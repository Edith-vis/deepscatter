6afb51d1f460d97b5f77cd2b6368f3f9075b67e1	algebraic certificates of (semi)definiteness for polynomials over fields containing the rationals	convex functions;two dimensional displays;symmetric matrices;matlab;complexity theory;geometry;computational modeling	Sum of squares (SOS) decompositions for positive semidefinite polynomials are usually computed numerically, using convex optimization solvers. The precision of the decompositions can be improved by increasing the number of digits used in the computations, but, when the number of variables is greater than the length (i.e., the minimum number of squares needed for the decomposition) of the polynomial, it is difficult to obtain an exact SOS decomposition with the existing methods. A new algorithm, which works well in “almost all” such cases, is proposed here. The results of randomly generated experiments are reported to compare the proposed algorithm with those based on convex optimization.

Monolithic solvers are often considered to be computationally expensive, and it is believed that their rewards are realized only in situations where segregated solvers have convergence problems due to the strong coupling. We give opposite empirical evidence by demonstrating that cost-effective monolithic solvers may be derived from using segregated solvers as preconditioners in the iterative solution of monolithic systems.

The properties of Legendre multiwavelets are first given and their operational matrices of integral are constructed. These wavelets are utilized to reduce the solution of the given integro-differential equation to the solution of a sparse linear system of algebraic equations. In order to save memory requirement and computational time, a threshold procedure is applied to obtain the solution to this system of algebraic equations. Through numerical examples, performance of the present method is investigated concerning the convergence and the sparseness of the resulted matrix equation.	algebraic equation;george sugihara;legendre transformation;linear system;numerical partial differential equations;reduction (complexity);sparse matrix	Mehrdad Lakestani;Behzad Nemati Saray;Mehdi Dehghan	2011	J.

A 1-Ω shunt of coaxial design has been developed as the time constant standard. A coaxial inductor with identical structure as the time constant standard has been developed. A four-terminal mutual inductor has also been built for the measurement of the inductance of the time constant standard. The method is based on the use of a binary inductive current divider to compare the inductor with the mutual inductor. The standard uncertainty of the inductance measurement of the time constant standard is within 28 pH at frequencies up to 200 kHz. The expanded uncertainty of the phase angle errors is from 0.4 μrad at 1 kHz to 80.0 μrad at 200 kHz at 1 A.	current divider;current source;traceability	Xianlin Pan;Jiangtao Zhang;Xuefeng Ma;Yang Gu;Wenfang Liu;Biao Wang;Zuliang Lu;Deshi Zhang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2012.2212595	equivalent series inductance;lcr meter;electronic engineering;electrical reactance;engineering;electrical engineering;kinetic inductance;control theory;inductor;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	69.73483117190732	51.28131692477529	5244
4862227b91568ee1ca33be4edab8ac24905312f5	desirably adjusting gain margin, phase margin, and corresponding crossover frequencies based on frequency data		This paper presents an analytical method to tune a fixed-structure fractional-order compensator for satisfying desired phase and gain margins with adjustable crossover frequencies. The proposed method is based on the measured frequency data of the plant. Since no analytical model for the plant is needed in the compensator tuning procedure, the resulted compensator does not depend on the order and complexity of the plant. Also, sufficient conditions for the existence of a compensator with no zero and pole in the right half-plane for satisfying the aforementioned objectives are analytically derived. Furthermore, different hardware-in-the-loop experimental results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed tuning method.	bode plot;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;phase margin;staggered tuning	Negin Sayyaf;Mohammad Saleh Tavazoei	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2681842	control engineering;computer science;phase margin;crossover;pole–zero plot;control theory;control system	Robotics	67.24655570536406	43.13656019850741	5301

Numerical results are obtained for acoustic or TE-polarized electromagnetic scattering from one-dimensional, “Pierson-Moskowitz” sea surfaces at low grazing angles. Comparison with exact integral equation results shows that the secondorder small slope approximation is extremely accurate and better than both the perturbation and Kirchhoff methods.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation;first-order predicate;kirchhoff's theorem;numerical analysis;paul moskowitz;perturbation theory;reflection coefficient;test engineer	Shira L.

f170d844e90ea1bc0623e5bfcf01f995eb70a3e6	encoding true-color images with a limited palette via soft vector clustering as an instance of dithering multidimensional signals	digital signal processing;soft data clustering	One of the classic problems of digital image processing is to encode true-color images for the optimal viewing on displays with a limited set of colors. A major manifestation of optimal viewing in this regard is to maximally remove parasitic artifacts in the degraded encoded images such as the contouring effect. Several robust attempts have been made to solve this problem over the past 50 years, and the first contribution of this paper is to introduce a simple – yet effective – novel solution that is based on soft vector clustering. The other contribution of this paper is to propose the application of the soft clustering methodology deployed in our color-encoding solution for the dithering of multidimensional signals. Dithering essentially adds controlled noise to the analog signal upon its digitization so that the resulting quantization noise is dispersed over a much wider band of the frequency domain and is therefore less perceptible in the digitized signal. This comes of course at the price of more overall quantization noise. Dithering is a vital operation that is performed via well-known simple schemes upon the analog-to-digital conversion of one-dimensional signals; however, the published literature is still missing a general neat scheme for the dithering of multidimensional signals that is able to handle arbitrary dimensionality, arbitrary number and distribution of quantization centroids, and with computable and controllable noise power. This gap is also filled by this paper. 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We show as well the global convergence of this method under weaker assumptions than those made in the literature. The optimization method is applied to the design of robust truss structures.

6b6e9c491c42ebeb0a113c04f29bd8751e3e3cac	finding poles and zeros in an analog circuit directly from its conductance matrix using eigenvalues		The article presents a state space approach to identify and extract poles and zeros in an RC circuit. The results obtained are shown to match with circuit simulation (WinSpice). A new procedure is also developed that allows construction of the state matrix A directly from the circuit inspections. This is proven to be a very efficient technique for identifying the state matrix A without going through a traditional nodal analysis. As shown, the matrix A is constructed by making specific measurements on the circuit itself, or by simulating solely the resistive circuit. Finally, a new method is presented, through which the zeros of a transfer function are first converted into poles and then the poles are extracted through the circuit eigenvalues. In addition, a new Modified Nodal Procedure (MNP) is presented in the Appendix that allows circuits with all types of independent and controlled sources. It shows how the presence of these sources are incorporated into the conductance matrix, providing a unified nodal (branch) solution to the circuit problem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

JEDEC qualification of cascode packages and the long term reliability of GaN power switches has been estimated for the first and shown to be greater than a million hours. Excellent switched/dynamic on-resistance up to 1000 V and breakdown voltage over 1500 V indicate the suitability of these devices for switching up to 480 V. Detailed data of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) test is shown. High temperature DC stress test and high voltage off-state stress tests also corroborate the high reliability of these devices. This suite of initial, JEDEC & accelerated stress tests show that GaN-on-silicon power switches are ready for many commercial and industrial applications, would significantly reduce switching losses and system size and will impact all areas of electricity conversion, ranging from tablet chargers to photovoltaic inverters and electric vehicles.	cmos;gate driver;inverter (logic gate);network switch;power electronics;p–n junction;robustness (computer science);solar inverter;stress testing (software);to-220;tablet computer;test data;uninterruptible power supply	Toshihide Kikkawa;Tsutomu Hosoda;Ken Shono;Kenji Imanishi;Yoshimori Asai;YiFeng Wu;Likun Shen;Kurt Smith;Dixie Dunn;Saurabh Chowdhury;Peter Smith;John Gritters;Lee McCarthy;Ronald Barr;Rakesh Lal;Umesh K.

We show one example of sampling functions to interpolate signals from nonuniform samples, inheriting the properties of the C-type Fluency sampling functions introduced by Toraichi et al. The proposed sampling function is locally supported and composed with piecewise polynomial functions of degree 2 as the C-type Fluency sampling function. In this paper, we extend the C-type Fluency sampling function and derive the nonuniform sampling function which has a favorable property such that it can interpolate flat signal from samples that are constant. By using this sampling function, we get smooth and small undulate signal from samples of arbitrary.	interpolation	Tomoyuki Takahashi;Kazuo Toraichi;Keisuke Kameyama;Koji Nakamura	2002		10.1007/3-540-36228-2_52	coherent sampling;sampling;smoothness;computer vision;mathematical optimization;nonuniform sampling;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;computer science;slice sampling;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Theory	55.92962025167047	16.41849063936032	5579

First, the ESD protection diodes with different dimensions were designed and fabricated to evaluate their ESD levels and parasitic effects in gigahertz frequency band. With the knowledge of the dependence of device dimensions on ESD robustness and the parasitic capacitance, whole-chip ESD protection scheme were designed for the general receiver and transmitter interface circuits. Besides, an ESD protection scheme is proposed to improve the ESD robustness under the positive-to-VSS (PS-mode) ESD test, which is the most critical ESD-test pin combination. With a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) between the I/O pad and VSS, the clamping voltage along the PS-mode ESD current path can be reduced, so the PS-mode ESD level can be improved. Besides, the parasitic P-well/N-well diode in the SCR can provide the NS-mode ESD current path.

Caused by many reasons such as the timing/current mismatch and the leakage current from the PFD/CP and loop filter (LF), the reference spur is hard to be predicted. Using the novel open-loop algorithm instead of the traditional close-loop method, the proposed method allows for the quick prediction of the spur level during the design of the PLL building blocks, i.e., before the end of full PLL. In this paper, the spur transfer function is derived, and the method is implemented in Verilog-A. The prediction results match well with the close-loop transistor-level simulation.	algorithm;phase frequency detector;phase-locked loop;simulation;spectral leakage;transfer function;transistor;verilog	Bo Wang;Jinhai Zhang;Edouard Ngoya	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on ASIC	10.1109/ASICON.2013.6811884	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	62.61447855952727	48.6630903182387	5593

It is known that these systems show a periodic behavior after an initial transient phase. Assessment of the length of this transient phase provides important information on complexity measures of such systems, and so is crucial in system design. We identify relevant parameters in a graph representation of these systems and propose a modular strategy to derive new upper bounds on the length of the transient phase. By that we are the first to give asymptotically tight and potentially subquadratic transience bounds. We use our bounds to derive new complexity results, in particular in distributed computing.	complex systems;distributed computing;graph (abstract data type);linear system;systems design	Bernadette Charron-Bost;Matthias Függer;Thomas Nowak	2017	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2016.11.003	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;distributed computing	Logic	70.70660365236797	8.62799764143745	5602

Among various driving techniques for AMOLED displays, the current-driving scheme deals well with the issues of spatial and temporal variation of the TFT as well as IR drops in the pixel circuits [1]. Several previous works have successfully demonstrated this [2–3]. Figure 17.9.1 shows a block diagram of an AMOLED display system adopting a current-driving scheme. The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) plays a key role in the column driver by reconstructing the analog signal for pixel-driving from digital data. Considering that the number of columns of pixels continues to increase, even in mobile-oriented displays, the chip area occupied by the DAC should be greatly reduced. Furthermore, as widescreen displays such as WXGA are coming into wider use, it is necessary for column drivers for these displays to have a narrow channel pitch.	amoled;active matrix;analog signal;column (database);device driver;diagram;digital data;digital-to-analog converter;graphics display resolution;mobile phone;oled;pixel;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;viewing angle	Hyunsik Kim;Jinyong Jeon;Sungwoo Lee;Junhyeok Yang;Seung-Tak Ryu;Gyu-Hyeong Cho	2011	2011 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference	10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746335	chip;electronic engineering;capacitor;computer hardware;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;feedback loop;linearity;time constant;silicon	EDA	53.78722120437219	48.748056923087475	5654

Most of the mathematicians who used this device referred to it as the principle of (this term is sometimes also used in the sense of an axiom of of a space, such as Dedekindu0027s Principle or Cantoru0027s Principle). We will use the term principle of continuity if the only process used is transition to a limit, and the term principle of continuity if, in addition to passage to a limit, real arguments are replaced with complex ones. In this paper we consider the appearance of the general principle of in the work of Kepler and its most general formulation in the work of Leibniz, the appearance of the analytic principle of in the work of Euler and its most extensive use in the geometric work of Carnot, Poncelet, and Lobachevskil, as well as the application of this principle in connection with the theory of Lie groups.

HOS estimates, on the other hand, have been criticized for high complexity and the need for long data in order to maintain small variance. Since rank reduction offers a general principle for reduction of estimator variance and complexity, we consider the problem of designing low-rank estimators for HOS. We propose three methods for choosing the transformation matrix that reduces the mean-square error (MSE) associated with the low-rank HOS estimates. We also demonstrate the advantages of using low-rank third-order moment estimates for blind system estimation. Results indicate that the full rank MSE corresponding to some data length  N  can be attained by a low-rank estimator corresponding to a length significantly smaller than  N .

12f5f7846e296af53a903f66d9d84700b13a5244	open-phase fault detection of a five-phase permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor based on symmetrical components theory		This paper presents a novel approach for open-phase fault detection of a five-phase permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMa-SynRM). Under faults, the five-phase PMa-SynRM is expected to run at fault-tolerant control (FTC) mode, otherwise it draws a large amount of current with a significant reduction in the reluctance torque. To successfully achieve FTC operation of five-phase PMa-SynRM, the accurate detection of a fault condition has to be preceded. With the best of these authors knowledge, the detection of faults has been limitedly studied for five-phase motors. The analysis of open-phase fault in five-phase machine involves complicated conditions including single-phase open fault, two-phase adjacent fault, and two-phase nonadjacent fault. To perform the timely fault-tolerant operation, those faults have to be accurately analyzed and detected. In this paper, a novel symmetrical components (SCs) analysis is utilized to extract the feature of those fault conditions. This analysis will provide the types of faults by logically analyzing the pattern of magnitude and phase angle changes of the fundamental signal in the SCs. The proposed method has been comprehensively analyzed through theoretical derivation, finite-element simulations, and experimental testing through a 5 hp PMa-SynRM controlled by TI-DSP F28335.	fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;simulation;software bug;two-phase locking	A.

In order to avoid the voltage collapse, load shedding schemes represent a suitable action to maintain the power system service quality and to control its vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a new approach of a load shedding strategy based on fuzzy controllers. This strategy was founded on the calculation of generated power sensitivity degree related to voltage level at different network buses. During the fault phase, fuzzy controller algorithms generate monitor vectors ensuring a pre-calculated load shedding ratio in the purpose to reestablish the power balance and avoid the appearance of the collapse phenomenon.	algorithm;fuzzy concept;load shedding	Kamel Jemai;Hafedh Trabelsi;Abdelaziz Ouederni	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-130864	fuzzy logic;synchronous motor;power-flow study;real-time computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory	EDA	63.98893086172058	33.92392144801414	5756

This method involves the determination of S-parameters from the poles of voltage-gain transfer function. It is found that the information on the frequency responses of input/output return loss, input/output impedance, and reverse isolation is all hidden in the poles or equivalently in the denominator of the voltage-gain transfer function of a circuit system. The method has been applied to three commonly used RF circuit configurations and one fabricated CMOS wide-band amplifier to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed theory.	amplifier;application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;characteristic impedance;denavit–hartenberg parameters;feedback;frequency response;input impedance;input/output;integrated circuit design;output impedance;radio frequency;radio-frequency engineering;return loss;transfer function	Shey-Shi Lu;Yo-Sheng Lin;Hung-Wei Chiu;Yu-Chang Chen;Chin-Chun Meng	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2004.840084	electronic engineering;closed-loop pole;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;transfer function	EDA	65.40962895489459	49.416491137653274	5894

Planar microstrip patch bridged on both sides with squared split ring resonator is used to measure strain. Measurement of stress of isotropic dielectric materials in their linear elastic region that are uses as PCB substrates is also done using the proposed method. The designed microwave probe works at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The feasibility of the use of time-domain reflectometry method to monitor strain in materials is presented here. The proposed sensor exhibits a sensitivity of about 333 ps for every 1% change in strain. Finite integration technique and real-time measurements have been done to corroborate the relation derived between the transmit time and the strain experienced by the material. The correlation between the simulated and measured strain is about 99.3%. The proposed sensor can be used for faster and accurate testing of PCB substrates without requiring complex calibrations.	computational electromagnetics;microstrip;microwave;printed circuit board;printing;ps (unix);real-time clock;simulation;time-domain reflectometry	Vimal Samsingh Ramalingam;Malathi Kanagasabai;Esther Florence Sundarsingh	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2716876	control theory;microstrip;condition monitoring;engineering;acoustics;calibration;linear elasticity;split-ring resonator;printed circuit board;reflectometry;microwave;electronic engineering	Robotics	70.84891135175725	49.85870901203856	6007

A switched-capacitor integrator is introduced in the one-cycle control to obtain positive integration with a single positive power supply, allowing a standard low-cost CMOS fabrication process. To improve the efficiency, a dynamic loss control technique is presented. HSPICE Simulations are performed with transistor models from TSMC 0.35μm N-well CMOS fabrication process. With a supply voltage of 3 V, a voltage ripple of less than 15 mV is measured. The maximum efficiency is 92% with a load power of 475 mW. The converter exhibits a tracking speed of 2 μs/V for both start-up and reference voltage transitions. The recovery time for a 20% load change is approximately 2.6ms. The overall design exhibits superior system robustness to battery perturbations, noise and process variations.	cmos;computer simulation;line regulation;load regulation;ripple effect;spice 2;semiconductor device fabrication;switched capacitor;switched-mode power supply;transistor model	Dongsheng Ma;Janet Roveda;Pablo Vazquas	2006	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1145/1165573.1165670	chip;robust control;control engineering;design;electronic engineering;switched capacitor;performance;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;switched-mode power supply;process variation;voltage regulation	EDA	61.62830527968457	46.70930137679218	6026

The communication network is determined by a general interaction rule based on the distance between agents. The goal of this paper is to determine practical conditions ensuring that the agents asymptotically agree on a common velocity, i.e., a flocking behavior is achieved. Unlike previous studies on the topic, our results simultaneously satisfy the three following features: 1) our conditions apply to a model, which does not require long distance communication; 2) they only depend on the initial positions and velocities of the agents; and 3) most importantly, our results allow for the disconnection of communication links which are not necessary for flocking. To circumvent the difficulty arising from the state dependent dynamics, a suitable bounding process is used. We apply our result to two cases, where communication takes place either within deterministic or stochastic distance radiuses. Our result is illustrated through simulations.	agent-based model;flocking (behavior);mobile agent;multi-agent system;simulation;telecommunications network;velocity (software development)	Samuel Martin;Antoine Girard;Arastoo Fazeli;Ali Jadbabaie	2014	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2014.2316994	control engineering;simulation;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;flocking;multi-agent system;control theory;distributed computing;network topology;telecommunications network	Robotics	63.914213355571746	5.865340649016109	6077

It is assumed that the noise can be modeled by an autoregression whose order has also to be estimated. A new criterion is proposed for estimating the number of cisoids and the autoregressive model order, as well as a new algorithm for estimating the cisoidal frequencies. In the derivation, a Bayesian methodology and subspace decomposition are employed. The proposed criterion significantly outperforms the popular MDL and AIC as applied in a paper by nagesha and Kay. In addition, an algorithm that reduces the computational complexity of the solution is developed. Computer simulations that demonstrate the performance of the criterion are included.	akaike information criterion;algorithm;autoregressive model;bayesian network;bayesian programming;colors of noise;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;mdl (programming language)	Chao-Ming Cho;Petar M.

First we consider the contact problem with Tresca friction. This leads to a constrained non-differentiable minimization problem where the solvability is in general problematic. But, by utilizing the Fenchel duality theory, the dual formulation in terms of contact stresses turns out to be a quadratic optimization problem with a smooth functional. The regularization of the dual problem motivated by the augmented Lagrangian is suitable for the application of the generalized Newton method. Applying the boundary integral equation method, the problem is reduced to the boundary curve. The corresponding boundary integral equations are approximated by using a Galerkin method with the help of B-splines on the boundary curve (BEM). This yields an algebraic system of linear equations with dense stiffness matrix but which is symmetric. The symmetry property of the stiffness matrix enables the application of efficient iterative solution strategies for the linear systems at each Newton step. Second, the methods are carried over to the Coulomb friction problem by means of a fixed point approach. In particular, the analysis of the algorithm is presented and some numerical examples, which show a remarkable efficiency and reliability of the semi-smooth Newton method, are given.	boundary element method;elasticity (data store);newton's method;semiconductor industry;symmetric multiprocessing	L.

Our filter structure combines a low-pass prefilter and an adaptive predictive filter, making it possible to extract the sinusoidal active current from the distorted waveform without harmful phase shift, even when the frequency and amplitude alter simultaneously. Although active filters are typically used to compensate for the supply harmonics, where the fundamental frequency remains almost constant, we will show that our filter structure can also be applied in applications where the frequency alters rapidly.	active filter;adaptive filter;low-pass filter;multistage amplifier;waveform	Sami Väliviita;Seppo J.

Some basic properties are formulated, and a RiemannHilbert problem for the multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type is given. We derive a Christoffel-Darboux formula for these polynomials using the solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. The main motivation for studying these polynomials comes from a model of nonintersecting one-dimensional Brownian motions with a given number of starting points and endpoints. The correlation kernel for the positions of the Brownian paths at any intermediate time coincides with the Christoffel-Darboux kernel for the multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type with respect to Gaussian weights.	brownian motion;kernel (operating system);polynomial	Evi Daems;Arno B.

e4bcd998240b12e1dd0fc05cc3059d5863ae22f3	a 0.5-v 12-bit sar adc using adaptive time-domain comparator with noise optimization		"""This paper presents a 0.5-V 12-bit low-voltage power-efficient successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using an adaptive time-domain (ATD) comparator with noise optimization. To be power efficient with different residual input levels (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\Delta V_{\mathrm {in}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) during conversion, the proposed ATD comparator automatically adjusts its input-referred noise performance rather than consuming the same power for each bit conversion. Considering the noise requirement of 12-bit resolution, the proposed ATD technique effectively reduces the comparator power consumption by 50% compared to the conventional approach. Moreover, a differential threshold window (DTW) technique is also developed to provide the optimized time-domain threshold for lowest figure-of-merit (FoM) performance with a self-adjusted (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$V_{\mathrm {ctrlp}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>–<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$V_{\mathrm {ctrln}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), depending on process–voltage–temperature (PVT) variation. The test chip occupies a core area of 0.109 mm<sup>2</sup> in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 90-nm CMOS technology. With a 0.5-V supply voltage, the prototype consumes 810 and 1425 nW at 100 and 250 kS/s, respectively. The achieved effective number of bits and signal-to-noise and distortion ratio with Nyquist-rate input are 10.71/10.3 bit and 66.3/63.8 dB, respectively. The resultant Walden FoM and Schreier FoM are 4.82/4.52 fJ/conversion step and 174.2/173.23 dB, respectively."""	12-bit;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;comparator;core (optical fiber);distortion;effective number of bits;mathematical optimization;nyquist rate;prototype;resultant;sinad;sinadr;schreier vector;semiconductor;successive approximation adc	Sung-En Hsieh;Chen-Che Kao;Chih-Cheng Hsieh	2018	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2018.2862880	12-bit;chip;comparator;electronic engineering;effective number of bits;computer science;distortion;successive approximation adc;time domain;topology;cmos	EDA	59.78809591866156	50.3165731489447	6189

Existing circuit implementations are typically restricted in input voltage or input angular range, limiting their usefulness in real-world applications. In this contribution we introduce resistive source degeneration and transconductance attenuation so that sine shaping circuits can accept an arbitrary input range and achieve high accuracy. We present detailed analysis including accuracy and efficiency of the circuits using approximation with the sum of multiple hyperbolic tangent like functions. We also describe a design methodology that satisfies specific requirements for a sine shaping circuit. The design was verified with two examples in simulation using a BSIM3.3 model and nearly perfect sine function circuit was demonstrated. The applicability of this circuit for a triangle-to-sine converter was also verified using Monte Carlo simulation. Compared to other sine waveform generators this circuit has an extended frequency range and requires the lowest power.	angularjs;approximation;frequency band;monte carlo method;noise shaping;requirement;simulation;waveform shaping	Tsung-Hsueh Lee;Pamela Abshire	2014	2014 IEEE 12th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2014.6934038	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	67.6847807036634	49.772007555968585	6207

Using the Pricepsilas theorem and its extension, and by introducing new special integral functions, related expectations can be evaluated so as to obtain decoupled difference equations describing the mean and mean square behaviors of these algorithms. The analytical results are in good agreement with computer simulation results.	algorithm;computer simulation;gaussian blur;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;mixture model;recurrence relation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Shing-Chow Chan;Yi Zhou	2008	APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4745996	computer simulation;adaptive filter;gaussian noise;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;recurrence relation;convergence;impulse noise;computer science;noise;machine learning;mathematics;least squares;differential equation;integral equation;artificial neural network;statistics;robustness	EDA	59.31530765153522	12.10838704777761	6224

We show that for any weak solution of the corresponding system satisfying the energy inequality, the rigid ball never touches the plane. This result is the extension of that obtained in [M.

In particular, we give a negative answer to this question for a large class of systems. More specifically, the question remains open only for a well specified class of systems. We also investigate systems of two equations over three unknowns for which we give necessary and sufficient conditions for admitting at most quasi-periodic solutions, i.e., solutions where the images of two unknowns are powers of a common word. In doing so, we also give a number of examples showing that these conditions represent a boundary point between systems admitting purely non-periodic solutions and those admitting at most quasi-periodic ones.

A characterization of the class of filters of full rank type that can be obtainedwith such procedure is given. In particular, we restrict our attention to a special construction based on the representation of SO(2d) in terms of the elements of its Lie algebra. Explicit expressions for the filters in the case d = 2 are given, as a result of a local analysis of the parameterization obtained from perturbing the Haar system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate a fast, accurate and low-complexity method for estimation of static gain and sample-time mismatches. The proposed technique uses a calibration signal generated on-chip through a sinusoidal oscillator inserted into a phase-locked loop (PLL), similarly as the sampling clock signal is usually generated in these high speed conversion systems. We synchronize these two PLLs to allow efficient frequency domain computations, without resorting to windowing, from which accurate estimations are feasible. We show that the accuracy of the method is not affected by nonidealities in the calibration signal as long as the calibration frequency is carefully selected.	analog-to-digital converter;arnold tongue;clock signal;computation;phase-locked loop;sampling (signal processing);ti-nspire series;total harmonic distortion	Edinei Santin;Luís Bica Oliveira;João Goes	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271991	control engineering;estimation;electronic engineering;calibration;phase-locked loop;computer science;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;accuracy and precision;oscillation;frequency domain;statistics	EDA	60.20772384689068	50.34329101883486	6273

This antenna is intended for operation at Ka-band and designed using multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The proposed design incorporates shorting vias around the slot as well as a dielectric grid on the top of the antenna in order to achieve improved performance at the higher scanning angles for both polarisations. The effectiveness of beam scanning of the proposed unit cell design, especially at higher scanning angle at 60°, is evaluated with incident waves at various angles in the periodical boundary. The simulation results have shown the proposed unit cell antenna has the capability of beam scanning with good performance up to 60° for both E-plane and H-plane at the designated operational band, indicating that a folded reflectarray with excellent beam scanning performance, designed on the basis of this novel unit cell antenna element, can be realized.	crystal structure;ka band;layer (electronics);polarization (waves);printed circuit board;printing;simulation;via (electronics)	Chong Zhang;Dawei Zhou;Steven Gao;Gao Wei;Jiadong Xu;Jianzhou Li	2012	2012 8th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2012.6292690	microstrip antenna;telecommunications;computer science;coupling;printed circuit board;slot antenna;dielectric	Arch	66.66782180376075	58.07653499372037	6330

Box-constrained problems therefore continue to attract research interest. We address box-constrained (strictly convex) problems by deriving two new quasi-Newton algorithms. Our algorithms are positioned between the projected-gradient [J. B. Rosen, J. SIAM, 8(1), 1960, pp. 181–217], and projected-Newton [D. P. Bertsekas, SIAM J. Cont. & Opt., 20(2), 1982, pp. 221–246] methods. We also prove their convergence under a simple Armijo step-size rule. We provide experimental results for two particular box-constrained problems: nonnegative least squares (NNLS), and nonnegative Kullback-Leibler (NNKL) minimization. For both NNLS and NNKL our algorithms perform competitively against well-established methods on medium-sized problems; for larger problems our approach frequently outperforms the competition.	algorithm;constrained optimization;convex function;convex optimization;gradient;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;newton;non-negative least squares;program optimization;quasi-newton method	Dongmin Kim;Suvrit Sra;Inderjit S.

6d5ccd1c5c99a8c603d753f71dcbdf3066c95c64	weak galerkin finite element methods for the simulation of single-phase flow in fractured porous media		This paper presents a numerical simulation of the flow in fractured porous media, which can be efficiently described by the reduced model consisting of the bulk problem in the porous matrix and the fracture problem in the fracture together with physically consistent coupling conditions. The reduced model is solved by using two types of weak Galerkin finite element methods (on simplex mesh and polygonal mesh, respectively) for the bulk problem coupled with the cell centered finite volume method for the fracture problem. We prove that the algebraic system arising in the discrete formulation is symmetric and positive-definite, which leads to the well-posedness of the discrete problem. Error estimates for the pressure in suitable norms are established. A series of numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method with respect to the shape of the grid and the permeability of the fractures.	finite element method;galerkin method;simulation	Gang Wang;Yinnian He;Jinjin Yang	2018	J.

The resulting closed system of ODEs (ordinary differential equations) represents an extension to a recently published method of moments which utilizes least-square approximations of factors of the PDE over orthogonal polynomial bases. An extensive numerical analysis has been carried out for proof-of-concept purposes. The proposed modeling scheme is generally of interest for control and optimization of processes with distributed parameters.	approximation algorithm;closed system;first-order reduction;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;open dynamics engine;polynomial	Naim Bajçinca;Steffen Hofmann;D.

The original problem is reduced to the mean-square filtering problem for incompletely measured bilinear time-delay system states over linear observations. The unknown parameters are considered standard Wiener processes and incorporated as additional states in the extended state vector. To deal with the new filtering problem, the paper designs the mean-square finite-dimensional filter for incompletely measured bilinear time-delay system states over linear observations. A closed system of the filtering equations is then derived for a bilinear time-delay state over linear observations. Finally, the paper solves the original joint estimation problem. The obtained solution is based on the designed mean-square filter for incompletely measured bilinear time-delay states over linear observations, taking into account that the filter for the extended state vector also serves as the identifier for the unknown parameters. In the example, performance of the designed state filter and parameter identifier is verified for a linear time-delay system with an unknown multiplicative parameter over linear observations.	estimation theory	Michael V.

The linear system is solved at each nonlinear iteration within every time-step using biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGstab) in combination with block-Jacobi (bjacobi) preconditioners, as it failed to solve the linear system because of dramatic changes in flow velocity and pressure early in the simulation. To overcome this problem, we used the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc), a numerical library that provides multiple types of linear solvers. PETSc has been incorporated into the ADH code. The ADH-PETSc interface helps to systematically investigate the best linear solver for an ADH simulation. We found that a variant, known as enhanced BiCGstab(l) in combination with the additive Schwarz method (ASM), made it possible to simulate the John Day lock filling system. The BiCGstab(l) solver improved the rate of convergence because of a more reliable update strategy for the residuals. In addition, the simulation was run with various numbers of processors. The result shows good scaling of solution time as the number of processors increases	krylov subspace;newton	Hung V. Nguyen;Jing-Ru C. Cheng;E. Allen Hammack;Robert S.

When a certain condition is satisfied in the ring filters, a frequency, where all the excited power is reflected, exists. That is the inherent-ring-resonance frequency and the effective loss tangent from its reflection coefficient may be obtained correctly. To verify the method, two ring filters have been fabricated in microstrip lines and the measured results show good agreement with the predicted ones.	resonance	Hee-Ran Ahn;Kwyro Lee	2004	IEICE Electronic Express		electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;optics	EDA	66.02332831897039	55.560592507239534	6492

287155d3e6b9a5d1dc89be8df8d15c42196591cf	an anti-islanding protection for inverters in distributed generation		This paper presents a new anti-islanding protection (AIP) scheme for inverters in integration of distributed generation (DG) sources into the grid. The main advantage of this proposed AIP scheme is that it can be embedded into the control of DG inverters without a need of additional part in the hardware of the inverter and any change in the controller. The AIP scheme does not rely on a communication network. It detects the islanding condition based on continuous monitoring of the active power, the reactive power, and the voltage magnitude mismatch, which is shown to be an alternative to the grid impedance measurement technique. The AIP scheme isolates the inverter from the grid after the grid experiences an islanding condition for all possible scenarios of islanding. A detailed modeling of its implementation in a DG inverter is presented and the performance of the AIP scheme is verified by simulations and experiments.

A new method for solving Telegrapher equation that characterizes the uniform transmission lines is presented. It not only gives the time domain solution of the line terminal voltage and current, but also their distributions within the lines. The method achieves its goal by treating the voltage and current distributions as distributed state variables and transforms the Telegrapher equation into an ordinary differential equation. This allows the coupled transmission lines to be treated as a single component that behaves like other lumped dynamic components, such as capacitors and inductors. Using Backward Differentiation Formulae for time discretization, the transmission line component is converted to its time domain companion model, from which its local truncation error for time step control can be derived. As the shapes of the voltage and current distributions get more complicated with time, they can be approximated by piecewise exponential functions with controllable accuracy. A segmentation algorithm is thus devised so that the line is dynamically bisected to guarantee that the total piecewise exponential approximation error is only a small fraction of the local truncation error. Using this approach, the user can see the line voltage and current at any point and time freely without explicitly segment the line before starting the simulation.	simulation;transmission line	Panuwat Dan-Klang;Ekachai Leelarasmee	2009	IEICE Transactions		mathematical optimization;interpolation;discretization;control theory;telegrapher's equations	Arch	69.85081102661825	43.98537876948929	6624

Comparisons are made between the efficacy of interpolation with the magnitude-Lorentzian function and other interpolation functions. Optimal interpolation functions are suggested for time signals of various degrees of damping. For undamped time signals, magnitude-Lorentzian interpolation is exact for non-zero-filled and once-zero-filled spectra.	interpolation	Kim H. Chow;Melvin B.

For various elliptic hemivariational inequalities arising in contact mechanics, we provide error estimates of their numerical solutions, which are of optimal order for the linear finite element method, under appropriate solution regularity assumptions. Numerical examples are reported on using linear elements to solve sample contact problems, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted linear convergence.	approximation;converge;error analysis (mathematics);finite element method;galerkin method;gibbs' inequality;leggett–garg inequality;linear inequality;numerical analysis;numerical method;rate of convergence;simulation;social inequality	Weimin Han;Mircea Sofonea;Mikaël Barboteu	2017	SIAM J.

The proposed current mirror uses MOS current dividers to sample the output current and a feedback action is used to force it to be equal to the input current; yielding very high impedance with a very large output voltage range. The proposed implementation yields an increase of the output impedance by a factor of about gmro compared with that of the super-Wilson current mirror, thus offering a potential solution to mitigate the effect of the low output impedance of ultra-deep submicron CMOS transistors used in sub 1-V current mirrors and current sources. A NMOS version of the proposed current mirror circuit was implemented using STMicroelectronics 1-V 90-nm CMOS process and simulated using Spectre to validate its performance. The output current is mirrored with a transfer error lower than 1% down to an output voltage as low as 80 mV for an input current of 5 muA, and 111 mV when the input current is increased to 50 muA.	analogue electronics;biasing;cmos;characteristic impedance;current source;high impedance;input/output;nmos logic;output impedance;performance;requirement;sampling (signal processing);simulation;transistor;very-large-scale integration;wilson current mirror	Louis-François Tanguay;Mohamad Sawan;Yvon Savaria	2008	APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746105	mesh analysis;electronic engineering;immune system;current mirror;logic gate;high impedance;analogue electronics;gain;engineering;electrical engineering;buffer amplifier;electrical impedance;control theory;low voltage;output impedance;voltage source;transistor;negative impedance converter	EDA	62.19562331481551	48.044484331236525	6783

The offset cancellation allows for fast open loop operation of the differential CSA. A fourfold reduction of the cell access time is achieved compared to the conventional scheme under similar cell current and bitline capacitance. Thanks to its automatic turn off nature, the proposed CSA incurs zero static power without an auxiliary turn off circuit. The reduction of the charge redistribution on the bitlines offers a low bitline dynamic power consumption as well. In this work, the proposed scheme is rigorously analyzed and compared to the conventional scheme. The analysis is verified using circuit level simulations and compared to the conventional scheme as a reference analytically and using simulations.	access time;cmos;current sense amplifier;interference (communication);simulation;static random-access memory	Mohammad Sharifkhani;E.

Typical solutions are highly oscillatory and have a discontinuous time-derivative, and hence solving this equation numerically is a challenging task. We present and analyze a tailor-made time integrator which attains the desired accuracy with a significantly larger step-size than traditional methods. The construction of this method is based on a favorable transformation to an equivalent problem and the explicit computation of certain integrals over highly oscillatory phases. The error analysis requires the thorough investigation of various cancellation effects which result in improved accuracy for special step-sizes.	nonlinear system;schrödinger	Tobias Jahnke;Marcel Mikl	2018	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-017-0926-2	split-step method;mathematical analysis;mathematical optimization;piecewise;nonlinear schrödinger equation;midpoint method;relation between schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics;nonlinear system;mathematics;theoretical and experimental justification for the schrödinger equation;schrödinger field	Robotics	86.69452275335884	8.579961648788034	6815

I N T R O D U C T I O N The interest in meshfree methods to solve PDEs has grown considerably in the past 15 years. The two principal reasons are: (1) mesh generation over twoand three-dimensional complicated domains may require weeks or months to produce a well-behaved mesh, and (2) the convergence rate of traditional methods are typically second order, requiring very fine discretization. The fine diseretization required may need more operations than meshfree methods, even though these traditional methods are compactly supported.

Various RBFs have been successfully applied in a differential quadrature setting to obtain very accurate and efficient solutions to PDEs of engineering interest [3,4].

The Exponential window is modified by adding third parameter ( ρ ), which improves the spectral characteristic of a window in terms of smaller ripple ratio, wider main lobe width with improved side lobe roll-off ratio. When it is exploited for designing multi-channel cosine modulated filter banks, the modified Exponential window gives better performance for higher band as compared to lower band. In addition to this, the modified Exponential window performs better performance at lower stopband attenuation. When compared with modified Cosh and Kaiser windows, the modified Exponential windows performs better in terms of amplitude distortion, aliasing distortion ( AD ) and computational time (CPU time) for the same design specifications. Several examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of this window in the field multirate systems designing.	filter bank;modulation	Anil Kumar;B. Kuldeep	2012	J.

In this paper a Walsh power spectrum is developed which is based on a system of complex Walsh functions and thus applies to auto and cross power spectra as well. It is shown that this Walsh power spectrum is related to the Fourier power spectrum by a linear transformation. This fact makes it possible to calculate Fourier power spectrum estimates from corresponding Walsh power spectrum estimates. An estimation algorithm for the Walsh power spectrum is given in the paper.	hadamard transform;spectral density;stationary process;stochastic process	Linus M. Blaesser	1986	IEEE Trans.

Specifically, we describe a nonlinear dynamical system based on FE capacitors coupled into a unidirectional ring circuit which, under the appropriate operating conditions, exhibits an oscillating regime of behavior in the response variable (the electric polarization). In this device, a weak target E-field induces a perturbation of the polarization of the FE material; in turn, the target signal can be detected and quantified via its effect on the coupled system response. Hence, the device entails the synergetic use of bistable FE materials, micromachining technologies that allow for addressing charge density amplification, and novel sensing strategies based on coupling nonlinear elemental cells. The “charge collector” strategy has been employed to detect the target field. An experimental characterization of the sensing device, including three cells (each cell corresponds to an FE capacitor) coupled in a ring configuration, is presented as a function of the charge collector configuration.	dynamical system;elemental;nonlinear system;polarization (waves);sensor;synergetics (fuller);transducer	Bruno Ando;Salvatore Baglio;Vincenzo Marletta;Adi R.

Existing signal models that incorporate correlations often require regularization of the covariance matrix, so that the covariance matrix can be inverted. The disadvantage of this approach is that matrix inversion is computational intensive and regularization decreases precision. We use Bienaymé's theorem to approximate the covariance matrix by a diagonal one, so that matrix inversion becomes trivial, even with non-uniform rather than only uniform sampling that was considered in earlier work. This approximation reduces the computational complexity of the estimator and estimation bound significantly. We numerically validate this approximation and compare our approach with the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for multivariate Gaussian distributions. Simulations with highly correlated signals show that our approach differs less than 0.1% from this MLE and CRLB when the observation time is large compared to the correlation time. Additionally, simulations show that in case of non-uniform sampling, we increase the performance in comparison to earlier work by an order of magnitude. We limit this study to correlated signals in the time domain, but the results are also applicable in the space domain.	approximation algorithm;automated theorem proving;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;matrix regularization;nonuniform sampling;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);singular value decomposition;stationary process;widescreen signaling	Bram Dil;Gustaf Hendeby;Fredrik Gustafsson;Bernhard J.

The mathematical theories of MUSIC are partially discovered, e.g., in the full-view problem, for an unknown target of dielectric contrast or a perfectly conducting crack with the Dirichlet boundary condition (Transverse Magnetic-TM polarization) and so on. Hence, we perform further research to analyze the MUSIC-type imaging functional and to certify some well-known but theoretically unexplained phenomena. For this purpose, we establish a relationship between the MUSIC imaging functional and an infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind. This relationship is based on the rigorous asymptotic expansion formula in the existence of a thin inhomogeneity with a smooth supporting curve. Various results of numerical simulation are presented in order to support the identified structure of MUSIC. Although a priori information of the target is needed, we suggest a least condition of range of incident and observation directions to apply MUSIC in the limited-view problem.

ca4a31576b56f94e1b8c1929a5146f1436f7a92f	using hankel structured low-rank approximation for sparse signal recovery		Structured low-rank approximation is used in model reduction, system identification, and signal processing to find low-complexity models from data. The rank constraint imposes the condition that the approximation has bounded complexity and the optimization criterion aims to find the best match between the data—a trajectory of the system—and the approximation. In some applications, however, the data is sub-sampled from a trajectory, which poses the problem of sparse approximation using the low-rank prior. This paper considers a modified Hankel structured low-rank approximation problem where the observed data is a linear transformation of a system’s trajectory with reduced dimension. We reformulate this problem as a Hankel structured low-rank approximation with missing data and propose a solution methods based on the variable projections principle. We compare the Hankel structured low-rank approximation approach with the classical sparsity inducing method of (ell _1)-norm regularization. The (ell _1)-norm regularization method is effective for sum-of-exponentials modeling with a large number of samples, however, it is not suitable for damped system identification.	low-rank approximation;sparse	Ivan Markovsky;Pier Luigi Dragotti	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93764-9_44	mathematical optimization;signal processing;missing data;bounded function;system identification;regularization (mathematics);linear map;sparse approximation;low-rank approximation;mathematics	ML	65.90167962030777	15.953630179858774	7046

The new method involves a fast evaluation scheme for the space domain Green's functions of the substrate by using perfectly matched layers to obtain closed-form expressions as a series of leaky and Berenger modes. Efficient summation of these series is performed by means of the Shanks transform. The modal series can be applied to calculate all field interactions analytically, except for the selfpatch and the nearest neighbor contributions. Examples show an important reduction in CPU time for the new perfectly matched layers approach, as compared to the classical evaluation of the continuous Sommerfeld integrals.	dispersive partial differential equation;microstrip	Hendrik Rogier;Daniel De Zutter	2003	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2003.819425	waveguide;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematical analysis;perfectly matched layer;computer science;microstrip;mathematics;computational electromagnetics;computational complexity theory;k-nearest neighbors algorithm	EDA	91.06532776390839	5.936814424995867	7118

We show that if the local spaces on the reference elements satisfy suitable conditions, and if the mappings used to define the mesh and global spaces satisfy simple regularity and compatibility conditions, the methods provide optimally convergent approximations for both unknowns as well as superconvergent approximations for the scalar variable. A crucial feature of the analysis of the methods is the use of two new spaces of traces and two associated, suitably defined projections thanks to which the error analysis then becomes almost identical to that obtained by the authors in [Math.

Downscaling of the feature size causes significant drop of the trigger current and holding voltage in the latch-up (LU) victims (standard-cell logic). It is accompanied by an increase of resistance in the wells and tap-connections. The increase of well resistance causes a drop in the efficiency of latch-up guard-rings around aggressors (diffusion at IO). Weak victims and inefficient guard-rings boost the latch-up hazard in FinFET, compared to a planar process. New strategies for latch-up safe design are described.	downscaling;latch device component;latch-up;low-power broadcasting;planar process;ring device;standard cell;water wells;voltage	Krzysztof Domanski	2018	2018 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)	10.1109/IRPS.2018.8353550	electronic engineering;thyristor;voltage;engineering;planar process	Arch	54.85322384911486	42.843309956799665	7193

Its sampling rate is then multiplied through pipelining. The first stage of the filter can operate in either a voltage-sampling or charge-sampling mode. It uses switches, capacitors and a simple gm-cell, rather than opamps, thus being compatible with digital nanoscale technology. In the voltage-sampling mode, the gm-cell is bypassed so the filter is fully passive. A 7th-order filter prototype operating at 800 MS/s sampling rate is implemented in TSMC 65 nm CMOS. Bandwidth of this filter is programmable between 400 kHz to 30 MHz with 100 dB maximum stop-band rejection. Its IIP3 is +21 dBm and the averaged spot noise is 4.57 nV/√Hz. It consumes 2 mW at 1.2 V and occupies 0.42 mm2.	cmos;charge sharing;dbm;decibel;experiment;extensibility;infinite impulse response;low-pass filter;moore's law;network switch;operational amplifier;pipeline (computing);prototype;rejection sampling;roland gs;sampling (signal processing);scalability;third-order intercept point;transfer function	Massoud Tohidian;Iman Madadi;Robert Bogdan Staszewski	2014	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2014.2359656	butterworth filter;adaptive filter;control engineering;all-pass filter;discrete time and continuous time;electronic engineering;switched capacitor;voltage-controlled filter;low-pass filter;anti-aliasing filter;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;constant k filter;band-stop filter;filter design;prototype filter;high-pass filter;cmos;infinite impulse response;active filter;m-derived filter	Visualization	61.43326630920137	51.21051680633037	7215

The resonators are tuned by switching the length of an integrated transmission line (ITL) instead of the conventional varactor tuning. It makes the compensation process for the finite gain bandwidth (GBW) of transconductances independent from the tuning process of the resonator. Additionally, the same resonator gain is achieved at different tuned frequencies. To reduce the effect of parasitics and digital control patterns, common mode signal switching (CMS) is employed. The simulations are performed for a 2.5GHz resonator using a 16-segmented switchable ITL with unit length of 430um. A frequency tuning range of 1.5GHz and a finite GBW compensating range up to half of the sampling rate 10GHz is achieved in a 0.25um BiCMOS SiGe technology.	bicmos;distortion;inferential theory of learning;interval temporal logic;motion compensation;sampling (signal processing);silicon-germanium;simulation;staggered tuning;transmission line;value-driven design	Ali Zahabi;Farabi Ibne Jamal;Joachim Becker;Muhammad Anis;Maurits Ortmanns	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271941	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electric power transmission	Embedded	62.14424305685641	51.15329009161696	7221

Two methods are considered: the window method and the frequency sampling method. The ideal kernel is first specified in the ambiguity domain. At each time-lag, an FIR filter approximating the desired response is designed using one of the above methods. The individual responses along the different lags are then assembled to construct a finite extent t-f kernel with desirable characteristics. Two different classes of kernels are therefore introduced. While the window based t-f kernels are simple, noniteratively generated, and can be used for all practical considerations, the frequency sampling class of kernels is computationally efficient and leads to recursive computations. Kernels from the two different classes are presented along with simulation examples which illustrate their performance.	algorithmic efficiency;ambiguity function;computation;filter design;finite impulse response;kernel (operating system);recursion (computer science);sampling (signal processing);simulation	Gopal T.

Numerical simulations of such flows using the standard direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are hindered by high statistical noise, which has motivated the development of several alternate Monte Carlo methods for low Mach number flows. Here, we present a frequency-domain low Mach number Monte Carlo method based on the Boltzmann-BGK equation, for the simulation of oscillatory gas flows. This circumvents the need for temporal simulations, as is currently required, and provides direct access to both amplitude and phase information using a pseudo-steady algorithm. The proposed method is validated for oscillatory Couette flow and the flow generated by an oscillating sphere. Good agreement is found with an existing time-domain method and accurate numerical solutions of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Analysis of these simulations using a rigorous statistical approach shows that the frequency-domain method provides a significant improvement in computational speed.	bhatnagar–gross–krook operator;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;simulation;the australian	Daniel R.

To improve size problems of a stirrer that is an official unit to generate a uniform field in the reverberation chamber, we suggest a diffuser of Quadratic Residue Sequence method. To validate the substitution of a diffuser for a stirrer, a diffuser is designed for 1-3GHz, and three types of equilateral triangular prism reverberation chambers are modeled. Afterwards, the field distributions in these three reverberation chambers are both simulated and tested. Using XFDTD 6. 2 of finite difference time domain method, field deviations of each structure are simulated and compared to each other. An evaluation of field uniformity is done by cumulative probability distribution which is specified in the IEC 61000-4-21. The result shows that the field uniformity in the chamber is within ±6dB tolerance and also within ±3dB standard deviation, which means a diffuser can satisfy the requirement of international standards.

In an effort to utilize these energies effectively through Power converter, a great deal of research is being carried out by different researchers / scientist and engineers at different places in the world to meet the increasing demand of load . The study presents methodology to integrate solar (PV) energy (which is freely available in every corner of the world) with grid source and supplement the existing grid power in rural houses during its cut off or restricted supply period. In order to get consistency in supply a DG is also added as a standby source in the proposed integration of network. The software using novel Direct PWM modulation strategy and its soft control features extend the flexibility to control converter (inverter) parameters like voltage, frequency, number of samples of PWM pulses constituting sine-wave without changing any hardware configuration in the circuit. The system simulation of PWM Pulse generation has been done on a XILINX based FPGA Spartan 3E board using VHDL code. The test on simulation of PWM generation program after synthesis and compilation were recorded and verified on a prototype sample.	compiler;discontinuous galerkin method;electric power conversion;field-programmable gate array;page view;power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;simulation;spartan;vhdl;waveform	S.

Equations are derived describing the output and the quantization noise of MSM for an arbitrary input signal, and the noise-shaping characteristic of MSM is investigated. The spectral characteristics of an m-stage sigma-delta modulator with both DC and sinusoidal inputs are developed. For both types of inputs the binary quantizer noise of the mth (m>or=3) quantizer, which appears at the output as an mth order difference, is asymptotically white, uniformly distributed, and uncorrelated with the input level. It is also found that for an m-stage sigma-delta quantizer with either an ideal low-pass filter or a sinc/sup m+1/ filter decoder, the average quantization noise of the system is inversely proportional to the (2m+1)th power of the oversampling ratio. This implies that the high-order systems are favourable in terms of the trade-off between the quantization noise and oversampling ratio. Simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis. >	delta modulation;delta-sigma modulation;multistage amplifier	Wu Chou;Ping Wah Wong;Robert M. Gray	1989	IEEE Trans.

An important aspect of such techniques is related to the identification of optimal methods for analyzing and modeling any skewed components. This paper presents a fast, finite-element-based method, able to accurately analyze the effects of skew on wound-field, salient-pole synchronous generators in a relatively shorter time than the more traditional methods. As a vessel for studying the proposed technique, a 400 kVA alternator is considered. Analytical and theoretical considerations on the benefits of skewing the stator in the generator under analysis are preliminary carried out. A finite-element model of the machine is built and the proposed method is then implemented to investigate the effects of the skewed stator. Comparisons against more traditional techniques are presented, with focus on the analysis of the voltage total harmonic distortion and the damper bars’ currents. Finally, experimental tests are performed at no-load and on-load operations for validation purposes, with excellent results being achieved.	total harmonic distortion	Stefano Nuzzo;Michael Galea;Christopher Gerada;Neil Brown	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2694378	total harmonic distortion;control engineering;alternator;control theory;torque;damper;engineering;skew;electromagnetics;electronic engineering;shock absorber;stator	EDA	68.69085336728936	38.28384455609152	7355

a97fac4dd7921aa6dd1135805aefd50b1b327473	a robust isfet array with in-pixel quantisation and automatic offset calibration		A pH-based microarray is presented using Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors (ISFETs) as chemical sensors for an ion imaging platform. The pH is quantised in time with a pixel architecture based on Active Pixel Sensors (APS), and decoded using a continuous time Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) decoder with a resolution which can be modulated through a multiplexer. The complete peripheral system sends the data obtained from the 8×8 array to a microcontroller through an SPI interface. A novel automatic ISFET calibration scheme provides feedback to compensate for trapped charge at device level, offering a trade-off between accuracy and speed of processing. The algorithm relies on a source voltage modulation, whereby the value for Vs in every pixel is identified and stored in an on-chip RAM. Intermediate calibrations may be run periodically for drift cancellation. The design is implemented in a 0.35 μm standard CMOS technology. The resolution of the PWM decoder is shown to lie between 9.55 ns and 29.1 ns. The system was simulated for various offset values, and shows a high resolution of 33 mpH. The initial calibration typically runs in 130 ms and the readout for the full array once calibrated is carried out in 832 μs, which offers a high time resolution for ion imaging.	active pixel sensor;algorithm;cmos;high-throughput computing;image resolution;loss of significance;microarray;microcontroller;multiplexer;parallel computing;peripheral;pulse-width modulation;quantization (physics);random-access memory;robustness (computer science);serial peripheral interface bus;throughput;transistor;white noise	Nicolas Moser;Tor Sverre Lande;Pantelis Georgiou	2016	2016 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)	10.1109/BioCAS.2016.7833722	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	55.295949493480016	49.94319394548775	7412

e3fef74926ffde0ca986ba0a9aaf3d57697d1199	an optimal scheme for numerical evaluation of eshelby tensors and its implementation in a matlab package for simulating the motion of viscous ellipsoids in slow flows	eshelby s theory;lebedev quadrature;numerical integration;inclusion problems	To address the multiscale deformation and fabric development in Earth's ductile lithosphere, micromechanics-based self-consistent homogenization is commonly used to obtain macroscale rheological properties from properties of constituent elements. The homogenization is heavily based on the solution of an Eshelby viscous inclusion in a linear viscous medium and the extension of the solution to nonlinear viscous materials. The homogenization requires repeated numerical evaluation of Eshelby tensors for constituent elements and becomes ever more computationally challenging as the elements are deformed to more elongate or flattened shapes. In this paper, we develop an optimal scheme for evaluating Eshelby tensors, using a combination of a product Gaussian quadrature and the Lebedev quadrature. We first establish, through numerical experiments, an empirical relationship between the inclusion shape and the computational time it takes to evaluate its Eshelby tensors. We then use the relationship to develop an optimal scheme for selecting the most efficient quadrature to obtain the Eshelby tensors. The optimal scheme is applicable to general homogenizations. In this paper, it is implemented in a MATLAB package for investigating the evolution of solitary rigid or deformable inclusions and the development of shape preferred orientations in multi-inclusion systems during deformation. The MATLAB package, upgrading an earlier effort written in MathCad, can be downloaded online.	matlab;numerical analysis;simulation	Mengmeng Qu;Dazhi Jiang;Lucy X.

This DLCT is based on the well-known CM-CC-CM decomposition, that is, implemented by two discrete chirp multiplications (CMs) and one discrete chirp convolution (CC). This decomposition doesn't use any scaling operation which will change the sampling period or cause the interpolation error. Compared with previous works, DLCT calculated by direct summation and DLCT based on center discrete dilated Hermite functions (CDDHFs), the proposed method implemented by FFTs has much lower computational complexity. The relation between the proposed DLCT and the continuous LCT is also derived to approximate the samples of the continuous LCT. Simulation results show that the proposed method somewhat outperforms the CDDHFs-based method in the approximation accuracy. Besides, the proposed method has approximate additivity property with error as small as the CDDHFs-based method. Most importantly, the proposed method has perfect reversibility, which doesn't hold in many existing DLCTs. With this property, it is unnecessary to develop the inverse DLCT additionally because it can be replaced by the forward DLCT.	approximation algorithm;chirp;computational complexity theory;convolution;fast fourier transform;hermite polynomials;image scaling;interpolation;linear canonical transformation;numerical analysis;oversampling;relevance;sampling (signal processing);simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Soo-Chang Pei;Shih-Gu Huang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2491891	overlap–add method;discrete hartley transform;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;convolution theorem;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;convolution;computational complexity theory;bluestein's fft algorithm;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;chirp;discrete frequency domain	EDA	56.4528989261131	20.71983594351618	7500

The method is based on a recently proposed procedure [9] for an efficient computation of spectral bounds using extended codelists. Both that approach and the one presented here substantially differ from established methods in that they deliberately do not use any interval matrices and thus result in a favorable numerical complexity of order O(n)N(φ), where N(φ) denotes the number of operations needed to evaluate φ at a point in its domain. We improve the method presented Mönnigmann (in [9]) by exploiting sparsity, which naturally arises in the underlying codelists. The new method provides bounds that are as good as or better than those from the most accurate existing method in about 82% of the test cases.	comment (computer programming);computation;convex function;hessian;interval arithmetic;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sparse matrix;test case;theory	Moritz Schulze Darup;Martin Mönnigmann	2016	SIAM J.

Nonlinear equations can be solved by classical Newton-Raphson algorithm. Path tracking is the iterative application of Newton-Raphson algorithm. The Homotopy iteration method based on the path tracking is appropriate for solving all polynomial equations. At every step of path tracking we get rid of the estimating tache, and the number of divisor part is less, so the calculation efficiency is higher than the common continuum method and the calculation complexity is also less than the common continuum method.	constraint satisfaction problem;iteration	Wenhui Li;Chunhong Cao;Wan Yi	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30497-5_70	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;nonlinear system;calculus;mathematics;newton's method	Robotics	80.93705868182258	18.069968345728793	7523

It also allows algorithms to be written without consideration of degenerate cases. CP replaces the input objects by a set of randomly perturbed (moved, scaled, stretched, etc.) objects and protects the evaluation of geometric predicates by guards. The execution is aborted if a guard indicates that the evaluation of a predicate with floating point arithmetic may return an incorrect result. If the execution is aborted, the algorithm is rerun on a new perturbation and maybe a higher precision of the floating point arithmetic. If the algorithm runs to completion, it returns the correct output for the perturbed input. The analysis of CP algorithms relates various parameters: the perturbation amount δ, the arithmetic precision L, the range of input values [−M, M ], and the number of input objects n. We present a general methodology for analyzing CP algorithms. It is powerful enough to analyze all geometric predicates that are formulated as signs of polynomials.	algorithm;polynomial;randomness;significant figures	Kurt Mehlhorn;Ralf Osbild;Michael Sagraloff	2011	Comput.

Similar behavior occurs inside of supersonic combustors (scramjets) under startup conditions, but it is challenging to study these conditions experimentally. In order to investigate this phenomenon further, a numerical approach is developed to simulate compressible multiphase flows under the effects of surface tension forces. The flow field is solved via the compressible multicomponent Euler equations (i.e., the five equation model) discretized with the finite volume method on a uniform Cartesian grid. The solver utilizes a total variation diminishing (TVD) third-order Runge-Kutta method for time-marching and second order TVD spatial reconstruction. Surface tension is incorporated using the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model. Fluxes are upwinded with a modified Harten-Lax-van Leer Contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver. An interface compression scheme is employed to counter numerical diffusion of the interface. The present work includes modifications to both the HLLC solver and the interface compression scheme to account for capillary force terms and the associated pressure jump across the gas-liquid interface. A simple method for numerically computing the interface curvature is developed and an acoustic scaling of the surface tension coefficient is proposed for the non-dimensionalization of the model. The model captures the surface tension induced pressure jump exactly if the exact curvature is known and is further verified with an oscillating elliptical droplet and Mach 1.47 and 3 shock-droplet interaction problems. The general characteristics of secondary atomization at a range of Weber numbers are also captured in a series of simulations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;cartesian closed category;coefficient;discretization;euler;experiment;finite volume method;image scaling;numerical analysis;numerical diffusion;regular grid;riemann solver;runge–kutta methods;simulation;total variation diminishing	Daniel P.

This filter makes use of the shift structure of the input data vector. Thus the computational cost of the classical RLS filter which is O(M) is reduced to O(M) for each iteration where M is the order of the filter. In order to ensure numerical stability in finite precision, we make use of array based methods for implementing FAM 2D-RLS. The adaptive filters illustrated in the standard literature consist of a weight vector and a scalar desired data. But in our scenario of OFDM channel estimation the weight is a matrix while the desired data is a vector. Hence the algorithm for matrix form of FAM-2D RLS and its steady state equations are derived. Numerical stability, steady state and convergence performance are verified using MATLAB simulations.	adaptive filter;algorithm;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;data point;fuzzy associative matrix;iteration;least mean squares filter;matlab;numerical stability;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;simulation;steady state	Arun Joy;Vijay Kumar Chakka	2013	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-012-9519-6	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;recursive least squares filter	Robotics	60.69542841230461	14.271244464393384	7635

The proposed controller gives a nearly constant switching frequency operation throughout different speeds in the linear modulation region. It achieves the elimination of 6n ±1, n = odd harmonics from the phase voltages and currents in the entire modulation range, with an increase in the linear modulation range. It also exhibits fast dynamic behavior under different transient conditions and has a simple controller implementation. Nearly constant switching frequency is obtained by matching the steady-state CESV boundaries of the proposed controller with that of a constant switching frequency SVPWM-based drive. In the proposed controller, the CESV reference boundaries are computed online, using the switching dwell time and voltage error vector of each applied vector. These quantities are calculated from estimated sampled reference phase voltages. Vector change is decided by projecting the actual current error along the computed hysteresis space vector boundary of the presently applied vector. The estimated reference phase voltages are found from the stator current error ripple and the parameters of the IM.	clock rate;hysteresis;inductive reasoning;modulation;power inverter;ripple effect;steady state	Najath Abdul Azeez;Anubrata Dey;Kevin Mathew;Jaison Mathew;K.

If no confusion appears, we call FDE for brevity. We firstly establish a new local existence theorem. Then, we derive the continuation theorems for the general FDE, which can be regarded as a generalization of the continuation theorems of the ordinary differential equation (ODE). Such continuation theorems for FDE which are first obtained are different from those for the classical ODE. With the help of continuation theorems derived in this paper, several global existence results for FDE are constructed. Some illustrative examples are also given to verify the theoretical results.	adobe framemaker;continuation;linear system;nonlinear system	Chunhai Kou;Hua-Cheng Zhou;Changpin Li	2012	I. J.

In its input stage, a common gate amplifier is used to achieve approximately \(50\,\Omega\) input resistance across the entire band, instead of using a common source stage. However, the current reused technique is used to save power consumption by using the same DC current path for both transistors in the designed circuit instead of utilizing two stage cascade configuration. The output matching is achieved by tuning the total parasitic capacitance with the inductor \(\hbox {L}_{d1}\) at the output node. In its inter stage, inter stage matching technique is used to make the flat gain response and to extend the bandwidth, simultaneously. From simulation results, the designed LNA shows an average power gain \(\hbox {S}_{21}\) of 15.8  dB with the gain variation of \(\pm 0.97 \hbox { dB}\), an input return loss \(\hbox {S}_{11}\) of −30 to −10 dB, a high reverse isolation \(\hbox {S}_{12}\) of −59 to −43 dB, output return loss \(\hbox {S}_{22}\) of −16 to −10 dB, and a small group-delay variation of \(\pm 34\) ps across the entire band. It also shows minimum achievable noise figure below 3.2 dB, and a power consumption of 4.57 mW from a supply voltage of 0.9 V. When a two tone test is performed at 8 GHz with 10 MHz spacing, the linearity of the designed LNA such as 1-dB compression point and third order input intercept point are −22.5 and −9 dBm, respectively.	low-noise amplifier;ultra-wideband;windows 3.1x	Sunil Pandey;Tushar Gawande;Pravin N.

Under the Linear Independence Constraint Qualification we characterize strong stability of C-stationary points (in the sense of Kojima) by means of first and second order information of the defining functions. It turns out that strong stability of C-stationary points allows a possible degeneracy of bi-active Lagrange multipliers. Some relations to other stationarity concepts (such as A-, M-, S- and B-stationarity) are shortly discussed.	stationary process	Hubertus Th. Jongen;Vladimir Shikhman;Sonja Steffensen	2012	Math.

These methods are tailored to the usage of low-rank tensor arithmetics and allow to solve huge scale optimization problems. In particular, we consider a semismooth Newton method for an optimal control problem with pointwise control constraints and an interior point algorithm for an obstacle problem, both with uncertainties in the coefficients.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;coefficient;computation;constrained optimization;curse of dimensionality;discretization;error detection and correction;interior point method;iteration;linear least squares (mathematics);linear system;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;newton;newton's method;newton–cotes formulas;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical method;obstacle problem;optimal control;optimization problem;social inequality;truncation;variational inequality;variational principle;velocity obstacle	Sebastian Garreis;Michael Ulbrich	2017	SIAM J.

The proposed data recovery system is well suited for tight tolerance channels and coding systems supporting standards that limit the maximum number of consecutive 0's and 1's in a data stream. The proposed system, which samples incoming data in the delay line on transitions of the data itself, has a reduced sensitivity to jitter on incoming data when compared to standard PLL-based data recovery systems. Further, the proposed technique actually recovers all data in the channel for a fixed interval prior to the first data transition. A system clock driven DLL is used to generate precise delays. This technique recovers the incoming data without recovering a clock signal. When used in a retransmitter, retimed data with a very low jitter that is essentially independent of the jitter on the incoming data stream is retransmitted.	data recovery;retransmission (data networks)	S.

We consider the problem of parameter optimization in biomolecular bistable circuits. We show that, under some assumptions often satisfied by bistable biological networks, it is possible to derive algebraic conditions on the parameters that determine when bistability occurs. These (global) algebraic conditions can be included as nonlinear constraints in a parameter optimization problem. We derive bistability conditions using Sturm's theorem for Gardner and Collins toggle switch. Then we optimize its nominal parameters to improve switching speed and robustness to a subset of uncertain parameters.	biological network;bistability;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;sturm's theorem;switch;synthetic intelligence	Vahid Mardanlou;Elisa Franco	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526721	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	ML	75.71701062490375	4.723558012902043	7995

Therefore, the Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) are often connected in parallel to realize high power converter. The switching frequency semiconductor devices, used in the high power VSCs, is also limited. Therefore, large filter components are often required in order to meet the stringent grid code requirements imposed by the utility. As a result, the size, weight and cost of the overall system increase. The use of interleaved carriers of the parallel connected VSCs, along with the high order line filter, is proposed to reduce the value of the filter components. The theoretical harmonic spectrum of the average pole voltage of two interleaved VSCs is derived and the reduction in the magnitude of some of the harmonic components due to the carrier interleaving is demonstrated. A shunt LC trap branch is used to sink the dominant harmonic frequency components. The design procedure of the line filter is illustrated and the filter performance is also verified by performing the simulation and the experimental study.

This structure employs a synchronized comparator to compare the feedback voltage (Vfb) and the desired reference voltage (Vref). A coarse loop is used to simplify the control logic circuit and increase the LDO response speed during the output dynamic transit. A fine loop is used to minimize the output ripple voltage of the LDO in the steady-state. A dynamic detection circuit using dual offset comparators is employed to detect the output voltage variation. To minimize the current consumption, the switching frequency is scaled to 1/32 of original frequency in steady-state. The circuit is implemented by purely digital standard cells.

8776410cc2799ffbe596f2b3a84b84068f544ad7	a generalized mathematical analysis for matrix converters		Although being well known for more than thirty years, matrix converters still appear to be a cluster of special cases - either from topology or modulation point of view - targeted to achieve one stage frequency conversion without energy storage elements. This paper investigates the very basic principles behind the matrix converters, and concludes that they should be seen as total power converters rather than just frequency converters. It shows that traditional matrix converter applications can be completely modeled by a couple of equations first presented in 2001 regarding space vector modulation [1], which are ultimately equivalent to any configuration/modulation scheme, and whose only constraint is the energy conservation law itself.

In particular a family of IIR prototype filters is a good candidate for DFT FB, where a tradeoff between frequency selectivity and numerical properties (as measured by the Weyl-Heisenberg frames theory) could be made. Some realizations exhibiting a simple and a massively parallel and modular processing structure making a VLSI implementation very suitable are shown. In addition, some multipliers in the filters (both the analysis and synthesis) could be made; powers or sum of powers of 2, in particular for feedback loops, resulting in a good sensitivity behavior. For these reasons as well as for the use of low order IIR filters (as compared with conventional FIR filters), the overall digital filter bank structure is efficient for high data rate applications.

7975f499649d071d6119b18d60159754fbd7ec6f	phase noise analysis of proposed pfd and cp switching circuit and its advantages over various pfd/cp switching circuits in phase-locked loops		Abstract This paper presents the design of a new phase frequency detector (PFD) and different type of charge pump (CP) circuits for phase-locked loops. A proposed phase frequency detector circuit can eliminate the effect of missing edge and phase ambiguity problems in many PFDs. A novel CP circuit with a special switching scheme has been incorporated to reduce the current mismatch error, charge injection error and clock feed through effect in many CP circuits using a new and unique clocking scheme of up delay (UPD) and down bar-delay (DNBD) signals in place of the conventional UPD and DNB clock pulses. Output noise, input referred phase noise, and phase noise performance (with 10 fF load capacitance) of the proposed PFD and true single phase clock (TSPC) PFD have been studied with different CP circuits. The effect of CP current mismatch and DC offset current at any of the current source or sink has been incorporated to check the effect on spur and phase noise performance of the ΔΣ fractional-N PLL frequency synthesizer. In addition, PFD and charge pump circuit phase noise estimation theory has been illustrated and it has been verified through the transistor level simulation. PLL locking response has been verified through the transistor level simulation in Cadence SpectreRF for the different CPs configuration with the proposed PFD and it shows that the proposed PFD and different CP circuits lock much faster than other works in literature. This condition also holds for the automatic frequency control unit along with the loop bandwidth calibration circuit and in special case of both loop bandwidth calibration and phase noise cancellation circuit. According to our knowledge this work shows a new state of the art performances for this proposed charge pump circuit and phase noise analysis of the charge pump circuit in presence of an error amplifier and many switching circuits.	in-phase and quadrature components;phase frequency detector;phase noise;phase-locked loop;switching circuit theory	Manas Kumar Hati;T.

We show that the results obtained applying Richardson and Pade-Richardson extrapolations to a set of finite difference eigenvalues corresponding to different grids allow us to obtain extremely precise values. When possible we have assessed the precision of our extrapolations comparing them with the highly precise results obtained using the method of particular solutions. Our empirical findings suggest an asymptotic nature of the FD series. In all the cases studied, we are able to report numerical results which are more precise than those available in the literature.	finite difference;richardson extrapolation;richardson number	Paolo Amore;John P.

Electric double layer capacitors, or simply supercapacitors, have extremely low internal resistance, and a battery-supercapacitor hybrid may mitigate the rate capacity effect for high pulsed discharging current. However, a hybrid architecture comprising a simple parallel connection does not perform well when the supercapacitor capacity is small, which is a typical situation because of the low energy density and high cost of supercapacitors. This paper presents a new battery-supercapacitor hybrid system that employs a constant-current charger. The constant-current charger isolates the battery from supercapacitor to improve the end-to-end efficiency for energy from the battery to the load while accounting for the rate capacity effect of Li-ion batteries and the conversion efficiencies of the converters.	battery charger;discharger;end-to-end principle;hybrid system;load profile;mobile computing;series and parallel circuits	Donghwa Shin;Younghyun Kim;Jaeam Seo;Naehyuck Chang;Yanzhi Wang;Massoud Pedram	2011	2011 Design, Automation & Test in Europe	10.1109/DATE.2011.5763295	control engineering;electronic engineering;service life;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;capacitance;supercapacitor;efficient energy use;energy conversion efficiency;energy storage;double layer;hybrid system	Arch	59.97064257634002	43.18194300962003	8349

Only a subset of the subsystems is given access to the desired trajectory information directly, and the subsystems are connected through an undirected and connected graph with a time-invariant topology. A distributed adaptive controller is deduced using the backstepping technique and a Nussbaum-type function to drive all the subsystems to track the desired trajectory asymptotically. Moreover, these controllers are distributed in the sense that the controller design for each subsystem only requires relative state information between itself and its neighbors. It is proven that the output tracking error converges to zero asymptotically and that all the closed-loop system signals are bounded. A simulation is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

The algorithm is inspired by the expectation-maximization algorithm, and it utilizes the IEEE standard 1057 for single-tone parameter estimation. In the derivation of the algorithm, it is assumed that the number of tones are known and that the frequencies are well separated. The algorithm is evaluated using noisy data consisting of multiple real-valued tones. The performance of the frequency estimator is studied and compared with the asymptotic Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). It is shown that the algorithm produces statistically efficient frequency estimates at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), that is the variance of the estimates reaches the CRB. Finally, it is illustrated that the algorithm can produce efficient estimates independent of the number of tones in the input signal.	estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio	Tomas Andersson;Peter Händel	2005	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2005.853682	econometrics;mathematical optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Visualization	55.03419598886944	11.739256260854788	8375

In particular, a differential CMOS photodetector associated with a differential capacitive transimpedance amplifier (DCTIA)-based sensing front-end is merged with an incremental 2nd order 1-bit CTSDM to achieve a large dynamic range, low hardware complexity, and high energy-efficiency. The proposed optoelectronic biosensor is implemented in a 0.18-ßm CMOS technology, consuming 8.23 μW from a 1.8-v supply voltage while achieving a peak SNDR of 62.5 dB, a dynamic range of 86 dB over a 50-Hz input bandwidth, a minimum detectable current of 90-/arms, and at a 25.6-KS/s sampling frequency.

Our prime interest is in the representation of nonstationary discrete-time signals in terms of wavelet packets, and we concentrate on their fast transform algorithms. Wavelet packet representations provide a local time-spectral description which reveals the nonstationary nature of a signal. They allow the speech signal to be accurately parameterised for such applications as speech and speaker recognition, where a front-end is responsible for the frame synchronized feature extraction. In this case the fast overlapped block transform algorithms represent an elegant and e cient solution to the implementation of wavelet packet transforms, since their FFT-like lattice block structure provides all possible multiresolution timespectral coe cients. The frame synchronization is also preserved in subbands which allows a new subband-based approach for speech recognition.	algorithm;fast fourier transform;feature extraction;network packet;signal processing;speaker recognition;speech processing;speech recognition;transform coding;wavelet packet decomposition	Andrzej Drygajlo	1996			wavelet;speech recognition;harmonic wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;computer science;theoretical computer science;pattern recognition;speech processing;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform;fast wavelet transform	Networks	57.16602893417341	18.168172562757846	8397

Wireless channels have been `fortunateu0027 to see new channels/standards being made available over the past decade to meet up to multi-Gb/s demands. One such medium is the wideband 60GHz channel. Wireless mediums, by definition however, are thwarted by multi-path reflection-based inter-symbol interference (ISI) -- a problem which becomes only worse at higher speeds. For decades, equalizers have been used efficiently to mitigate such interference. However, wireless equalizers in commercial CMOS products are typically implemented in DSP along multi-level modulation schemes like OFDM, which when scaled to Gb/s speeds dissipate substantial power. This is particularly detrimental for handheld/mobile devices with limited battery capacity.To ease the power bottleneck for equalization, this work instead proposes using mixed-signal techniques. As opposed to classic multi-level ADC/DSP design, such techniques are inspired by high-speed chip-to-chip wired communication that advocates the use of simple modulation schemes (such as QPSK) with few comparators. Since wireless channels suffer ISI with longer delay spreads than their wired counterparts, previously developed wireline equalizers cannot be directly ported. This work therefore enables energy-efficient equalizers to cancel extremely long ISI delay spreads. Our first prototype demonstrated a 40-coefficient complex (I/Q) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in 65nm CMOS to enable 10Gb/s rates over line-of-sight (LOS) 60GHz channels, while consuming only 14mW of power. The second prototype in 65nm low-power (LP) CMOS enables non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel equalization as well, by using a 32-coefficient receiver feedforward equalizer (FFE) and a longer 100-coefficient DFE, achieving 3.5-8Gb/s rates while consuming 20-67mW. While the equalizer prototypes in this dissertation have been targeted towards 60GHz channels, the techniques enable energy-efficient equalization for long ISI delay spreads for any high-speed wireless or wireline communication link.	coefficient	Chintan Thakkar	2012			electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	54.752503451647875	57.20834053165618	8411

Using specific Gaussian optics lens antennas and a thru, reflect, and line calibration, the setup provides the free-space four S-parameters over the W-band of planar dielectric slabs without time-domain gating. An efficient optimization procedure is implemented to extract complex permittivity from the four S-parameters of homogeneous dielectric materials. Nonhomogeneous materials can also be tested, and measurements are presented. Very good agreement is observed between simulated and measured four S-parameters of various dielectric plates.

The binary search algorithm is one of the basic idea behind how they obtain a binary code representing an analog input. In practice, the imperfectness of analog circuit elements sometimes results in decision errors and decreases the resolution of A/D conversion. Thus, making accurate decisions using imperfect elements is a big challenge. This paper surveys one solution known as non-binary SA with redundancy as well as related topics and its application to state-of-the-art SA ADCs.	analog-to-digital converter;analogue electronics;approximation;binary code;binary search algorithm;ieee xplore	Takao Waho	2014	2014 IEEE 44th International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic	10.1109/ISMVL.2014.21	electronic engineering;shaping;successive approximation adc;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;redundancy	Arch	57.47601473106366	48.9024677575922	8492

Rather than employing a conventional multiply-accumulate unit to compute the inner-product, an alternative method based on re-quantization of the input data stream using a sigma-delta modulator is presented. The re-quantization process preserves the dynamic range of the signal components contained in the bandwidth of the filter, while shifting the re-quantization noise to the spectral region to be rejected by the filter. The reduced bit length representation of the re-quantized input data samples removes the requirment for a full multiplier in the filter hardware. This makes the method very attractive for realization using FPGA technology. The filtering technique is described and implementation results using a Xilinx XC4010 FPGA are presented. A 200-tap filter implemented in a single FPGA achieves a computation rate of 415 MOPS and has a memory bandwidth of 1.66 Gbytes/s. An extension of the method using a quadrature re-quantizer and filter is also presented.	delta modulation;delta-sigma modulation;field-programmable gate array;finite impulse response	Chris Dick;Fred Harris	1996	VLSI Signal Processing	10.1007/BF00929620	computer vision;dynamic range;parallel computing;real-time computing;quantization;dot product;computer hardware;computer science;delta-sigma modulation;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;filter;filter design;active filter;memory bandwidth;half-band filter	EDA	59.75014219441822	19.60061014235565	8515

It has common features to each of two types of existing techniques: local high-order Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC) and Perfectly Matched Layers (PML). However, it is different from both and enjoys relative advantages with respect to both. The new method, called the Double Absorbing Boundary (DAB) method, is based on truncating the unbounded domain to produce a finite computational domain @W, and on applying a local high-order ABC on two parallel artificial boundaries, which are a small distance apart, and thus form a thin non-reflecting layer. Auxiliary variables are defined on the two boundaries and inside the layer bounded by them, and participate in the numerical scheme. The DAB method is first introduced in general terms, using the 2D scalar time-dependent wave equation as a model. Then it is applied to the 1D Klein-Gordon equation, using finite difference discretization in space and time, and to the 2D wave equation in a wave guide, using finite element discretization in space and dissipative time stepping. The computational aspects of the method are discussed, and numerical experiments demonstrate its performance.		Thomas Hagstrom;Dan Givoli;Daniel Rabinovich;Jacobo Bielak	2014	J. Comput.

Also the signal-to-noise ratio of biomedical signals is usually quite low. In addition, biomedical signals often interfere with each other. Therefore, the filters employed for eliminating noise and interference are significant in the medical practice. Digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filters have shorter filter length than the finite impulse response (FIR) filters with the same frequency characteristic. Therefore, in this work, an approach based on digital IIR filters are described for the elimination of noise on transcranial Doppler by using artificial bee colony (ABC) which is a popular swarm based optimization algorithm introduced recently. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is compared to particle swarm optimization algorithm.	artificial bee colony algorithm;decibel;filter design;infinite impulse response;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectrogram	Nurhan Karaboga;Fatma Latifoglu	2013	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2012.09.015	computer science;2d filters;mathematics;artificial bee colony algorithm;particle swarm optimization;infinite impulse response	Robotics	63.71121946419307	16.09642500996619	8623

The proposed technique reduces power consumption of flash A/D converters by 50 % reduction of the number of comparators. Because output signals of flash A/D converters are thermometer code, only a few comparators whose reference voltages are around the input signal are significant and the other comparators can be removed. A novel track and hold circuit (T/H circuit) which can exchange its two balanced output signals is introduced. Thanks to the T/H circuit, the required input range of the comparator is limited to half of that of conventional one. The proposed A/D converter using the proposed T/H circuit can realize the same accuracy with the conventional one. The proposed technique is applied to a 6-bit 528 Msamples/s A/D converter realization. Its power consumption is evaluated by HSPICE simulations. It is confirmed that the proposed technique can save 34% of power consumption compared with conventional one.	analog-to-digital converter;balanced audio;comparator;computer simulation;digital-to-analog converter;flash adc;low-power broadcasting;spice 2;unary coding	Takahide Sato;Shigetaka Takagi;Nobuo Fujii	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378533	resistor;chip;electronic engineering;voltage;parasitic capacitance;unary coding;computer hardware;engineering;electrical engineering;digital electronics;low-power electronics	EDA	58.944763321054495	50.57463107806253	8625

In this paper, we show that exponential stability of a polynomial vector field on a bounded set implies the existence of a Lyapunov function which is a sum of squares of polynomials. In particular, the main result states that if a system is exponentially stable on a bounded nonempty set, then there exists a sum of squares Lyapunov function which is exponentially decreasing on that bounded set. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the degree of this converse Lyapunov function as a function of the continuity and stability properties of the vector field. The proof is constructive and uses the Picard iteration. Our result implies that semidefinite programming can be used to answer the question of stability of a polynomial vector field with a bound on complexity.	fixed-point iteration;lyapunov fractal;musicbrainz picard;nonlinear system;polynomial;scott continuity;semidefinite programming;time complexity	Matthew M.

The formulation involves two analytically equivalent boundary integral equations established by applying the conjugation operator to the real and the imaginary parts of an analytical function. The conventional approach is to use only one and ignore the other equation. However, the discrete version of the operator using the boundary element method (BEM) leads to two non-equivalent sets of linear equations forming an over-determined system. The generalised conjugation operator is introduced so that both sets of equations can be utilised and their least-square solution determined without any additional computational cost, a strategy largely responsible for the stability and efficiency of the proposed method. Numerical tests on various samples including problems with cracked domains suggest global convergence, although this cannot be proved theoretically. The computational efficiency appears significantly higher than that reported earlier by other investigators.	algorithmic efficiency;boundary element method;computation;imaginary time;iterative method;linear equation;local convergence;numerical analysis;numerical method	Bao Cheng Li;Stavros Syngellakis	1998	Math.

We present here an efficient algorithm for this subproblem, which has been implemented in the AXIOM computer algebra system for equations of arbitrary order over arbitrary fields of characteristic O. This algorithm never needs to compute with the individual complex singularities of the equation, and algebraic numbers are added only when they appear in the potential solutions.

938c76b951b51a21b68ac0d1ce322e81e250b88b	distributed tracking of heterogeneous nonlinear fractional-order multi-agent systems with an unknown leader		By applying the fractional Lyapunov direct method, this paper investigates the distributed tracking problem of nonlinear fractional-order multi-agent systems subject to heterogeneous control gains and a time-varying leader whose input is unknown and bounded over a general directed graph. Due to the existence of heterogeneous control gains as well as a time-varying unknown leader in the nonlinear systems, the fractional-order dynamics of each agent is in essence heterogeneous. At first, a discontinuous distributed controller is constructed to guarantee that the distributed tracking control problem can be solved if some conditions are satisfied. Next, a continuous distributed controller is further proposed to eliminate the undesirable chattering phenomenon of the discontinuous controller, where the upper bound of the tracking error is uniformly bounded and can be made small enough by choosing the parameters appropriately. Finally, some simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the main results.	multi-agent system;nonlinear system	Ping Gong	2017	J.

The new scheme is based on two different finite element subspaces defined respectively on one coarse grid with grid size  H  and one fine grid with grid size  h  ≪  H . Nonlinearity is treated in the coarse grid subspace by solving the standard Galerkin equation, while in the fine grid subspace, only a linear equation has to be solved. Differing from the usual two-grid method, the splitting of the coarse grid subspace and its related fine grid incremental subspace is based on a new projection, in which sense the incremental subspace is closely identified with the tangent space of certain operator on each time step. With linear finite element discretization, the stability and error estimate results for such new scheme are derived. The results show that the difference between this new approximation and the fine grid standard Galerkin approximation in  H  1 ( Ω   ) norm is of the order               H    4  -    d    2            , where  d  = 1, 2, 3 is the space dimension.	approximation;finite element method;galerkin method	Yanren Hou;Kaitai Li	2006	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2005.07.046	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;gaussian grid;applied mathematics;nonlinear system;finite element method;calculus;mathematics;statistics;algebra	Robotics	87.36392652940792	12.819094493927667	8850

bf52ab450753db09632ee3311d6e2ebbd4386bbd	adjoint multivariable repetitive control algorithm for active control of vibration		In this paper a well-known adjoint SISO Repetitive Control algorithm is extended to the multivariable case and its convergence properties are analysed. The new adjoint algorithm is validated using a simulation of an experimental facility consisting of a passive Naval vibration isolation mount that is combined with six active control channels located in a Stewart platform style arrangement. The algorithm utilises a multivariable FIR system description that is derived from frequency response function measurements. The adjoint repetitive control algorithm is used to eliminate a harmonic disturbance where the first harmonic coincides with the fundamental mount resonance of the passive component. The simulation results show that the repetitive control algorithm ultimately achieves good vibration isolation but due to the wide spread of system eigenvalues at the harmonic frequency, convergence is slow.

An Arnoldi-based technique is used to create compact models from the system matrices generated by a piezoelectric finite-element solver. The proposed approach also preserves the passivity of the generated compact models. The modeling results of a Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer are presented. The transient and frequency responses of the devices can be accurately simulated by the compact models. Moreover, compared with the full-meshed simulations, the compact models give computational speed-ups of at least two orders of magnitude.	arnoldi iteration;finite element method;frequency response;model order reduction;piezoelectricity;simulation;solver;transformer	C.-C.

Our target touch screen detection method employs multiple continuous sine waves to achieve a high speed for large touch screens. While conventional auto-zeroing schemes cannot handle such continuous signals properly, the proposed scheme does not suffer from switching noise and provides effective offset cancellation for continuous signals. Experimental results show that the proposed technique improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 14 dB compared to a conventional offset cancellation scheme. For the realistic simulation results, we used Cadence SPECTRE with an accurate TSP model and noise source. We also applied an asymmetric device size (10% MOS size mismatch) to the OP Amp design in order to measure the effectiveness of offset cancellation. We implemented the proposed circuit as part of a touch screen controller system-on-chip by using a Magnachip/SK Hynix 0.18-μm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process.

Robustness of the hierarchical two-level splitting of the FE space of continuous piecewise bicubic functions is achieved via the application of the balanced semi-coarsening technique. Behavior of the corresponding CBS constant which qualifies the hierarchical two-level splittings of the FEM stiffness matrices is analyzed and new uniform estimates are given. On the basis of the latter and the theory of the Algebraic Multilevel Iteration (AMLI) methods an optimal order multilevel algorithm is constructed whose total computation cost is proportional to the size of the discrete problem with a proportionality constant independent of the anisotropy ratio.	bicubic interpolation;finite element method;preconditioner;semiconductor industry	Maria Lymbery	2013		10.1007/978-3-662-43880-0_72	elliptic boundary value problem;mathematical optimization;piecewise;mathematics;finite element method;matrix (mathematics);bicubic interpolation;proportionality (mathematics);preconditioner;stiffness matrix	EDA	88.89262490200055	14.095467269975353	9033

All these algorithms are based on fitting the autocorrelation function of the system output; differences among g,, them arise from the various possible formulations of the fitcriterion. Thus, the asymptotic statistical properties of the x,,,(O) estimate are analyzed in order to have a choice tool among Em the class of algorithms and to compare them with other J existing estimation methods. A further relevant subject is the U statement of a robust test to verify the correctness of the a.s. tentative model assumed for the sake of the estimation procedure. Then the above algorithm is applied to the Vf(x°) problem of estimating structural parameters (i.e. natural frequencies and damping factors) of the Italian and V,,f(xO, yO) Yugoslavian power systems by recording some main electrical quantities during the normal operation of the system. Capability of dealing with structural systems affected by an D(O °) unknown number of oscillatory modes and simplicity of use C(O) by non-statistical people are interesting features of the present approach, emphasized by the application.

adcd4cbe8e67275ee4fbea8fcffc463ee58abf1c	a new approach for compensating memory nonlinear analog-to-digital converters using look-up tables	harmonic distortion;analog digital conversion;estimation;table lookup;harmonic analysis	This paper presents a look-up table (LUT) based principle for linearizing analog-to-digital converters (ADC) that have a non-linear behavior with memory effects. The approach relies on the estimation of an integral non-linearity (INL) sequence for the in-phase and quadrature components of the ADC output distorted signal for calibrating the entries of a couple of LUTs. An algorithm for this principle is also proposed in this paper. The process is made of four operations: an Hilbert Transform based decomposition of the distorted signal into its in-phase and quadrature components; for each of both, a calibration of a LUT with an INL sequence estimated with a spectrum-based method published in the literature; the compensation of each component with the LUTs; and an Hilbert Transform based reconstruction of a linearized signal from the corrected components. This new method is validated on experimental data from the 12-bit ADC12D800RF converter running at 800 MHz and excited with a sinewave.	12-bit;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;distortion;hilbert transform;in-phase and quadrature components;integral nonlinearity;lookup table;nonlinear system	Bryce Minger;Guillaume Ferré;Dominique Dallet;Loic Fuche	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2016.7841190	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.49121256437935	48.505897575592456	9129

[SIAM J Optim 20(2):915–934, 2009] is studied. After a brief review, some weaknesses of the mentioned approach are pointed out. These weaknesses are due to a redundant assumption and the inability to generate the entire Pareto front. We present two improvements for the mentioned approach, firstly by eliminating the assumption of equality between the Pareto front and the weak Pareto front and secondly by presenting a new definition of the boundary of the Pareto front and establishing some theoretical results about it.	approximation algorithm;pareto efficiency	Kazhal Khaledian;Majid Soleimani-Damaneh	2015	Math.

Since these dynamical systems can become very large, the essential simulation before production may consume hours or days of computing time. Hence there is need for efficient approaches that limit the computing time while preserving the accuracy. In this paper it will be shown how specialized eigen value methods and model order reduction techniques can be used to perform fast and accurate simulations of large dynamical systems. Results will be illustrated by numerical experiments with realistic examples.	algorithm;computation;dynamical system;eigen (c++ library);experiment;ibm power systems;integrated circuit;model order reduction;numerical analysis;numerical method;real life;simulation;very-large-scale integration	Joost Rommes;Nelson Martins	2008	2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2008.29	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;electric power system	EDA	71.78761939741834	43.86427162509536	9140

The technique uses the specific intermodulation distortions (IMDs) at the output ports in the array. The detected IMD power level can be used to optimize the linearizer's characteristics. Because the design does not need as many power detectors and carrier cancel loops as it does amplifiers, we were able to successfully miniaturize the array-antenna system. This paper describes the principles, verified both experimentally and mathematically for a 4-port amplifier array.	amplifier	Takana Kaho;Yo Yamaguchi;Tadao Nakagawa;Katsuhiko Araki;Kiyomichi Araki	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e89-c.10.1448	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;control theory;antenna array;linearization;intermodulation	Visualization	66.71739179642375	53.75442479051232	9141

We confirm that the proposed method is 18 times faster than HSPICE and is 352 times faster than Berkeley SPICE when the full capacitance and inductance matrices are used. Moreover, when the sparse capacitance and inductance matrices are used, the proposed method is 69 times faster than HSPICE and is 1,349 times faster than Berkeley SPICE, though a small-scale problem is analyzed.	converge;finite-difference time-domain method;linear programming relaxation;relaxation (iterative method);spice 2;sparse matrix;transient state	Yuichi Tanji	2008	2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674801	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;control theory	Robotics	71.98719251676799	44.63914088136131	9159

The project targets a volume of less than 10 , mass of less than 50 grams, and power consumption of 50 mW on receive and 100 mW, 300 mW, or 3 W on transmit (for 10 mW, 100 mW, and 1 W output options). The transmitter design supports convolutionally coded binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), RC-BPSK, and quadrature phase-shift keying transmission from 1 to 256 kbps. Command/control instructions can be received at 2 or 8 kbps, with a sensitivity of better than 120 dBm. In addition to its low volume/mass/power features, temperature compensation to 100 C and radiation tolerance to 100 krad allow operation outside of thermally controlled, shielded enclosures, further reducing the mass and complexity of exploration vehicles. The design is described in a top-down format, beginning with system requirements and proceeding through digital modem algorithm development, discussion of the silicon-on-sapphire CMOS process used and elaboration of key blocks in the radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuit design. Techniques to address coupling between high-sensitivity RF and on-chip digital circuits are also presented, and test results are given for prototypes of all major functions. Although designed for the Martian environment, the transceiver is expected to be useful in other proximity links where a small low-power radio compatible with Prox-1 space-link protocols is desired.	algorithm;cmos;data rate units;dbm;digital electronics;disk enclosure;grams;in-phase and quadrature components;integrated circuit design;key (cryptography);low-power broadcasting;modem;modulation;planetary scanner;radio frequency;requirement;silicon on sapphire;system requirements;top-down and bottom-up design;transceiver;transmitter;ultra high frequency	William Kuhn;Norman E.

The biharmonic equation is split into a coupled system of harmonic problems. We first use the truncated Fourier series expansion to derive a set of coupled singular ODEs, then we solve those singular equations by second-order finite difference discretizations. Using a radial grid with shifting a half mesh away from the origin, we can handle the coordinate singularity easily without pole conditions. The Sherman– Morrison formula is then applied to solve the resultant linear system in a cost-efficient way. The computational complexity of the method consists of O(MN log2 N) arithmetic operations for M · N grid points. The numerical accuracy check and some applications to the incompressible Navier–Stokes flows inside a disk are conducted. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The paper presents a performance optimisation of the heap charge pump achieved by using a tapered architecture. The proposed optimisation allows improvements on the order of 30% in terms of maximum output voltage as compared to the conventional heap charge pump. A mathematical description of both the conventional and the proposed structure was developed.

Instead of relying on square lattices it is possible to use rectangular and orthorombic lattices as well. Schemes using rectangular lattices can be constructed in several ways. Here we construct a rectangular scheme, with the BGK collision operator, by introducing 2 additional discrete velocities into the standard D2Q9 stencil and show how the same procedure can be applied in three dimensions by extending the D3Q19 stencil. The weights and scaling factors for the new stencils are found as the solutions of the well-known Hermite quadrature problem, assuring isotropy of the lattice tensors up to rank four (Philippi et al., Phys. Rev. E 73(5):056702, 2006) This isotropy is a necessary and sufficient condition for assuring the same second order accuracy of lattice-Boltzmann equation with respect to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamic equations that is found with the standard D2Q9 and D3Q19 stencils. The numerical validation is done, in the two-dimensional case, by using the new rectangular scheme with D2R11 stencil for simulating the Taylor–Green vortex decay. The D3R23 stencil is numerically validated with three-dimensional simulations of cylindrical sound waves propagating from a point source.	bhatnagar–gross–krook operator;cubic function;gauss–hermite quadrature;image scaling;lattice boltzmann methods;linear programming relaxation;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical integration;simulation;software propagation;stencil buffer;taylor–green vortex;velocity (software development);whole earth 'lectronic link	Luiz Adolfo Hegele;Keijo Mattila;Paulo Cesar Philippi	2013	J.

While the Lagrangian dual is equivalent to the SDP relaxation (which has been known for quite a while, although the presented form, incorporating explicitly linear constraints, seems to be novel), we show that the Semi-Lagrangian dual is equivalent to a natural copositive relaxation (and this has apparently not been observed before). This way, we arrive at conic bounds tighter than the usual Lagrangian dual (and thus than the SDP) bounds. Any of the known tractable inner approximations of the copositive cone can be used for this tightening, but in particular, above mentioned characterization with explicit linear constraints is a natural, much cheaper, relaxation than the usual zero-order approximation by doubly nonnegative (DNN) matrices, and still improves upon the Lagrangian dual bounds. These approximations are based on LMIs on matrices of basically the original order plus additional linear constraints (in contrast to more familiar sum-of-squares or moment approximation hierarchies), and thus may have merits in particular for large instances where it is important to employ only a few inequality constraints (eg., n instead of n(n−1) 2 for the DNN relaxation). Further we specify sufficient conditions for tightness of the Semi-Lagrangian relaxation and show that copositivity of the slack matrix guarantees global optimality for KKT points of this problem, thus significantly improving upon a well-known second-order global optimality condition.	cobham's thesis;conic optimization;convex cone;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;order of approximation;original order;quadratic programming;semiconductor industry;slack variable;social inequality;while	Immanuel M.

The scheme consists of two adaptive filters operating sequentially. The first adaptive filter adapts using a partial Haar transform of the input and yields an estimate of the location of the peak of the sparse impulse response. The second adaptive filter is then centered about this estimate. Both filters are short in comparison to the delay uncertainty of the unknown channel. The principle advantage of this scheme is that two short adaptive filters can be used instead of one long adaptive filter, resulting in faster overall convergence and reduced computational complexity and storage. The scheme is analyzed in detail for a least mean squares (LMS) LMS-LMS type of structure, although it can be implemented using any combination of adaptive algorithms. Monte Carlo simulations are shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical model for the behavior of the peak estimating filter as well as for the mean square error (MSE) behavior of the second filter.	adaptive filter;algorithm;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;haar wavelet;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;monte carlo method;sparse matrix	Neil J.

We consider a tractable case in which both the coefficient matrix and its eigenvectors can be represented in the low-rank tensor train formats. We propose a subspace optimization method combined with some suitable truncation steps to the given low-rank Tensor Train formats. Its performance can be further improved if the alternating minimization method is used to refine the intermediate solutions locally. Preliminary numerical experiments show that our algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods on problems arising from the discretization of the stationary Schrödinger equation.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;cobham's thesis;coefficient;computation;discretization;eigenvalue algorithm;experiment;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;schrödinger;stationary process;truncation	Junyu Zhang;Zaiwen Wen;Yin Zhang	2017	J.

With this method, the solution of the heat equation is approximated by polynomials, the coefficients of which are computed from a block-tridiagonal linear system. Once the polynomials have been determined for a given time interval, the solution can be computed in parallel at any point of this interval. If the number of points where the solution is computed in the considered time interval is sufficient, it appears that the performances of the implicit collocation method on a parallel machine are better than those of finite difference methods. Numerical experiments on a SIMD architecture are reported.	collocation method;parallel algorithm	Fabienne Jézéquel	1996		10.1007/BFb0024690	crank–nicolson method;ftcs scheme;mathematical optimization;orthogonal collocation;parallel computing;alternating direction implicit method;first-order partial differential equation;computer science;finite difference method;collocation method;parabolic partial differential equation;heat equation;parallel algorithm;linear system;elliptic partial differential equation;differential equation;partial differential equation	EDA	86.90523563959444	19.562814747170535	9368

The filter should satisfy a specialized criterion formulated in terms of a so called lower stepped matrix A. To satisfy the special structure of the filter, we propose a new technique based on a block-partition of the lower stepped part of matrix A into lower triangular and rectangular blocks, Lij and Rij with i = 1, ..., l; j = 1, ..., si where l and si are given. We show that the original error minimization problem in terms of the matrix A is reduced to l individual error minimization problems in terms of blocks Lij and Rij.

It has two parts. Part one describes the algorithms used in FastImp, a program for accurate analysis of wide-band electromagnetic effects in very complicated geometries of conductors. The program is based on a recently developed surface integral formulation and a Pre-corrected FFT accelerated iterative method, but includes a new piecewise quadrature panel integration scheme, a new scaling and preconditioning technique as well as a generalized grid interpolation and projection strategy. Computational results are given on a variety of integrated circuit interconnect structures to demonstrate that FastImp is robust and can accurately analyze very complicated geometries of conductors. Part two describes an efficient Stochastic Integral Equation (SIE) Method for computing the mean value and variance of the capacitance of interconnects with random surface roughness in O Nlog2 N time. An ensemble average Green’s function is used to account for the surface roughness. A second-order correction scheme is used to improve the accuracy. A sparsification technique based on the Hierarchical Matrix method is proposed to significantly reduce the computational cost. The SIE method avoids the time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations and the discretization of rough surfaces. Numerical experiments show that the results of the new method agree very well with those of Monte Carlo simulations. Thesis Supervisor: Jacob K.

The use of Bregman functions whose zone is the convex set allows for the generation of a sequence contained in the interior, without taking explicitly into account the constraints which define the convex set. We establish full convergence to a solution with minimal conditions upon the monotone operatorF, weaker than strong monotonicity or Lipschitz continuity, for instance, and including cases where the solution needs not be unique. We apply our algorithm to several relevant classes of convex sets, including orthants, boxes, polyhedra and balls, for which Bregman functions are presented which give rise to explicit iteration formulae, up to the determination of two scalar stepsizes, which can be found through finite search procedures. © 1998 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

In this method, a non-uniform amplitude weighting strategy is used in order to demonstrate an offset fed for the reflector antenna. Steered beam is kept in shape in terms of half power beam width (HPBW) and relative side lobe level (RSLL). To do so, an analytical derivation of beam pattern is performed for the array-fed reflector antenna. Two standard non-uniform weighting techniques, Binomial and Dolf-Tschebyscheff, are employed for this reason. Finally, a multi-object optimization method is proposed to provide the best weighting. The computer simulations are performed for different multiobject optimization scenarios. The results reveal an improvement beam shape in terms of HPBW and RSLL traditional non-uniform weighing methods.	acoustic lobing;algorithm;chebyshev filter;computer simulation;inverted-f antenna;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;offset dish antenna;radiation pattern;reflector (antenna)	M.-M.

We consider here the choice of the free parameters in discrete (two-parameter) Kautz approximation. Using a key relationship between Kautz and Laguerre expansions we derive an upper bound for the quadratic truncation error. Minimization of this upper bound yields pertinent parameters, whose computation then requires reduced knowledge of the function to be modeled.

Moreover, the weak uniqueness is proved under weaker conditions on the noise coefficient. Furthermore, if the noise coefficient is $C^{1+\varepsilon}$ for some ${\varepsilon}>0$ and the drift is Holder continuous of order ${\alpha}{\in} (\frac{2}{3},1)$ in the first component and order ${\beta\in}(0,1) $ in the second, the solution forms a $C^1$-stochastic diffeormorphism flow. To prove these results, we present some new characterizations of Holder--Dini space by using the heat semigroup and slowly varying functions.	coefficient;dini derivative;drift plus penalty	Feng-Yu Wang;Xicheng Zhang	2016	SIAM J.

We prove that sequences generated by the proposed hybrid iterative method converge strongly to a common solution of these problems. Further, we discuss some applications of the main result. We also discuss a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability of the iterative method.

The location of global maximal solutions of f̃ on D is derived from the roughly generalized convexity of f̃ . The distance between global (or local) maximal solutions of f̃ on D and global (or local, respectively) maximal solutions of f on D is estimated.

The usual methods for accomplishing this reduction require rapid random access to the elements of A; otherwise, for large matrices the computer time required to search (say on magnetic tape) for these elements may be much longer than the time required for actual computation.

87e5f91bc66dc2e45f41b64a2a389a8ff9c3ed93	recommendations for standardization of voltage level in lvdc networks based on iec 60479-1 guidelines		In order to standardize the DC (direct current) voltage level in low voltage grids, a study is carried out considering the behavior of the human body against different DC voltage levels. The study is based on an analysis that determines if the amount of body current that flows under specific shock conditions is tolerable or not, keeping the current flow time in account. The body impedance is first calculated for two different DC voltage levels with different skin contact conditions. Possible current paths through the human body are subsequently considered to realize the best and worst-case scenario for human contact with live terminal. A relationship between touch voltage and source voltage is defined considering the grounding methods in DC systems. Using ventricular fibrillation curves, the maximum allowable body currents and the associated flow intervals for human bodies are analyzed for the selected voltage levels. The study makes a step further in addressing the feasibility and safety concerns for the standardization of DC voltage level for low voltage installations.	recommender system	Ali Virdag;Torsten Hager;Rik W.

The proposed architecture uses two capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC) arrays to generate two possible outputs while the comparator is in the regeneration process. Two comparators are assigned to each DAC to alternately switch between the compare phase and the reset phase. Such an approach allows the overlapping of the DAC settling, the comparator reset, and the comparator regeneration, which significantly improves the conversion speed. Furthermore, the random nature of the internal channel selection converts the mismatches between both channels into wideband noise, which improves the spurious-free dynamic range.	analog-to-digital converter;comparator;digital-to-analog converter;spurious-free dynamic range;successive approximation adc	Lin He;Jiaqi Yang;Duona Luo;Lele Jin;Shuangshuang Zhang;Fujiang Lin;Libin Yao;Xicheng Jiang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362722	diffusion mri;electronic engineering;shaping;integral nonlinearity;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;noise;operating system;asynchronous communication;control theory;processor register	EDA	57.32592266551905	52.18138075948327	9680

This paper proposes an algorithm with modified topology to reduce the large capacitance requirement. Modular units of equal low voltage cascaded H - Bridges are used to create redundancies which helps in avoiding large duration of charge or discharge of capacitor, causing voltage ripple. To utilize these created redundancies, proper selection of redundant states by considering capacitor voltage status and corresponding phase current at multiple instances within a sampling interval are made and capacitor voltages are balanced within required band with reduced value of capacitance. Results for the proposed drive scheme is included in this paper which validates the effectiveness of the algorithm.	algorithm;computers in human behavior;discharger;power inverter;power supply unit (computer);ripple effect;sampling (signal processing);voltage source	Mohammed Imthias;R KrishnaRaj;Apurv Kumar Yadav;K.

The problem is discretized by a symmetric weighted interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method with nonmatching simplicial elements and piecewise linear functions. The resulting discrete problem is solved by a two-level additive Schwarz method with a relatively coarse grid and with local solves restricted to subdomains which can be as small as single element. In this way the method has a potential for a very high level of fine grained parallelism. Condition number estimate depending on the relative sizes of the underlying grids is provided. The rate of convergence of the method is independent of the jumps of the coefficient if its variation is moderate inside coarse grid substructures or on local solvers' subdomain boundaries. Numerical experiments are reported which confirm theoretical results.	additive schwarz method;coarse space (numerical analysis);coefficient;condition number;convergence (action);diameter (qualifier value);discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;experiment;finite element method;high-level programming language;langrisser schwarz;linear function;parallel computing;piecewise linear continuation;preconditioner;rate of convergence;reflections of signals on conducting lines;utility functions on indivisible goods;decigram	Maksymilian Dryja;Piotr Krzyzanowski	2016		10.1007/s00211-015-0718-5	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discontinuous galerkin method;additive schwarz method;calculus;mathematics;schwarz alternating method	ML	90.26192910039586	16.52769034749315	9737

We introduce the notion of input-to-state discrepancy of each subsystem Ai in a larger nonlinear dynamical system A which bounds the distance between two (possibly diverging) trajectories of Ai in terms of their initial states and inputs. Using the IS discrepancy functions, we construct a low dimensional deterministic dynamical system M(δ). For any two trajectories of A starting δ distance apart, we show that one of them bloated by a factor determined by the trajectory of M contains the other. Further, by choosing appropriately small δ's the overapproximations computed by the above method can be made arbitrarily precise. Using the above results we develop a sound and relatively complete algorithm for bounded safety verification of nonlinear ODEs. Our preliminary experiments with a prototype implementation of the algorithm show that the approach can be effective for verification of nonlinear models.	algorithm;discrepancy function;divergence (computer science);dynamical system;experiment;nonlinear system;norm (social);prototype;simulation;software bloat	Zhenqi Huang;Sayan Mitra	2014		10.1145/2562059.2562126	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Logic	68.39166568149986	4.69413293930492	9768

The nonlocal term involved in the strong problem essentially increases its complexity and the necessary total computational work. The existence and uniqueness of the weak solution is established. The nonlinear weak formulation is reduced to the minimization of a nonlinear functional. Finite element discretizations by Lagrangian finite elements are applied to obtain an approximate minimization problem. A two-point step size gradient method with an original steplength is used for finding approximate solutions of the problem under consideration. No line search is necessary in the new approach. The present method is computer implemented and tested on different triangulations. The test examples indicate that the method slightly depends on the initial guesses. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An approach is described that provides a fast and memory efficient scheme for the solution of boundary value problems in complex geometries. The key aspects of the new scheme are an automatic coarse grid generation algorithm, an adaptive smoothing technique for adjusting residuals on different component grids, and the use of local smoothing near interpolation boundaries. Other important features include optimizations for Cartesian component grids, the use of over-relaxed Red-Black smoothers and the generation of coarse grid operators through Galerkin averaging. Numerical results in two and three dimensions show that very good multigrid convergence rates can be obtained for both Dirichlet and Neumann/mixed boundary conditions. A comparison to Krylov based solvers shows that the multigrid solver can be much faster and require significantly less memory.	algorithm;boundary case;cartesian closed category;galerkin method;glossary of sudoku;interpolation;iterative method;krylov subspace;mesh generation;multigrid method;smoothing;software bug;solver	William D.

Traditional photon counting information is available; moreover, digital words representing the amplitude of each event and suitable image elaboration methods significantly enhance the detector capabilities. The prototype detector is composed of a collimator and four imaging modules. Each module is composed of an 8 8 sensing array of 2 2mm silicon PIN photodiode pixels, coupled to a CsI(Tl) scintillator and custom readout electronics. The sensor is fixed to an Al2O3 printed circuit board. Eight readout mixed analog–digital integrated circuits, wire bonded to the sensor pixels, provide analog signal conditioning, A/D conversion, self-triggered acquisition and bidirectional serial data transfer. Digital signals are routed out so that each module can be attached to a main board with suitable control logic for overall detector management. PC-based supervision of the detector is accomplished through an USB 2.0 interconnection using an easy-to-use graphical user interface. The purpose of the prototype is to test the approach and the chosen architecture; all its elements have been designed in order to permit the construction of the final detector with a significantly larger sensing area. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ea8876b12f614367f1ad54ac81fcf10f97af42a4	distributed observers for state estimation in power grids		In this paper an estimation scheme for a power grid based on distributed observers is presented. Assuming that the only measurements available are the generator phase angles, our approach allows us to consider an observer for each bus of the power grid, exploiting on only knowledge of local information about the power system. In particular, we design a super-twisting-like sliding mode observer for each generator bus and a so-called “algebraic observer” for each load bus, based on a distributed iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme is able to deal with power grid changes that may involve the insertion of new generators or new power transmission lines affecting the grid topology. Numerical examples and simulations confirm the validity of our approach.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);interconnection;iterative method;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation;transmission line	Gianmario Rinaldi;Prathyush P.

These belong to the class of simple approximate solvers that use a set of propagating jump discontinuities, or waves, to approximate the true Riemann solution. Typically, a simple solver for a system of m conservation laws uses m such discontinuities. We present a four wave solver for use with the the shallow water equations—a system of two equations in one dimension. The solver is based on a decomposition of an augmented solution vector—the depth, momentum as well as momentum flux and bottom surface. By decomposing these four variables into four waves the solver is endowed with several desirable properties simultaneously. This solver is well-balanced: it maintains a large class of steady states by the use of a properly defined steady state wave—a stationary jump discontinuity in the Riemann solution that acts as a source term. The form of this wave is introduced and described in detail. The solver also maintains depth nonnegativity and extends naturally to Riemann problems with an initial dry state. These are important properties for applications with steady states and inundation, such as tsunami and flood modeling. Implementing the solver with LeVeque’s wave propagation algorithm [25] is also described. Several numerical simulations are shown, including a test problem for tsunami modeling.	approximation algorithm;bathymetry;discretization;norm (social);numerical analysis;philip l. roe;reflections of signals on conducting lines;riemann solver;roe solver;simulation;software propagation;stationary process;steady state;topography	David L.

A more immediate solution is to couple macro-scale reactor models to micro-scale models of individual bubbles and collections of a small number of bubbles. In this paper, a micro-scale modelling technique was presented and tested on the situation of a single rising bubble. The micro-scale model was based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) technique combined with a dynamic mesh adaptation based on wavelet analysis to ensure a sufficient resolution at the gas-liquid interfaces. The method was based on a multi-block parallel scheme with mesh adaptivity facilitated by wavelet analysis embedded into a commercial CFD package CFX. Examples of the performance of the scheme for a bubble rising problem are given.	algorithmic efficiency;bubble bobble;computation;dot-com bubble;embedded system;experiment;multiscale modeling;numerical analysis;reactor (software);requirement;simulation;wavelet	Tom Liu;Phil Schwarz	2005		10.1007/11428862_15	wavelet;mesh generation;bubble;systems modeling;volume of fluid method;computer science;model-based reasoning;calculus;mathematics;free surface;scale model;algorithm;multigrid method;fluid mechanics	EDA	93.86518205637637	9.71183403570923	9972

Several modifications of the proposed method were used for the numerical solution of a one-dimensional mathematical model (on the basis of the shallow water theory), which describes crash events produced by dam collapse.	mathematical model;numerical partial differential equations	F.

A solution method derived from a trust-region Gauss-Newton algorithm is analyzed for such applications, where, contrary to the standard algorithm, the least-squares subproblem solved at each iteration of the method is rewritten as a quadratic minimization subject to linear equality constraints. This allows the exploitation of duality properties of the associated linearized problems. This paper considers a recent conjugate-gradient-like method which performs the quadratic minimization in the dual space and produces, in exact arithmetic, the same iterates as those produced by a standard conjugate-gradients method in the primal space. This dual algorithm is computationally interesting whenever the dimension of the dual space is significantly smaller than that of the primal space, yielding gains in terms of both memory usage and computational cost. The relation between this dual space solver and PSAS (Physical-space Statistical Analysis System), another well-known dual space technique used in data assimilation problems, is explained. The use of an effective preconditioning technique is proposed and refined convergence bounds derived, which results in a practical solution method. Finally, stopping rules adequate for a trust-region solver are proposed in the dual space, providing iterates that are equivalent to those obtained with a Steihaug-Toint truncated conjugate-gradient method in the primal space.	algorithmic efficiency;conn;complex systems;conjugate gradient method;cubic function;data assimilation;duality (optimization);dynamical system;gauss–newton algorithm;iteration;linear equation;linear least squares (mathematics);manifold regularization;matrix regularization;newton;non-linear least squares;nonlinear system;norm (social);preconditioner;quadratic function;quadratic programming;rayleigh–ritz method;recurrence relation;rewrite (programming);sas;simulation;solver;truncation;trust region	Serge Gratton;Selime Gürol;Philippe L.

A decentralized state control rule, namely, a second-order protocol, is designed for each agent to track the leader. And it is proved that the proposed control scheme can effectively estimate the tracking error of each agent when the leader is active. Particularly, to ensure the tracking error can be estimated, the following two questions are solved: (1) How many agents are needed to connect to the leader? (2) How should these connections be distributed? Finally, a simple example is also given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theorems.	directed graph;flocking (behavior);multi-agent system;track and trace	Wanli Guo;Jinhu Lu;Shihua Chen;Xinghuo Yu	2011	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2011.09.020	control engineering;directed graph;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics	ML	64.12887356563954	5.500742646173813	10042

In this paper, we are concerned with the convergence analysis of this algorithm. More precisely, we provide a complete numerical analysis for semi-discrete (in space) and fully discrete approximations derived using finite elements in space and an implicit Euler method in time. The analysis is carried out for abstract Schrödinger and wave conservative systems with bounded observation (locally distributed).

ebb9cd31102c80d11813c30652a47cf07b3dd9b2	stability of traveling front solutions with algebraic spatial decay for some autocatalytic chemical reaction systems	47a55;35b35;35c07;stability;35k45;traveling waves;evans function;47a75;spectral analysis;algebraic spatial decay	This paper is concerned with the linear and nonlinear asymptotic stability of traveling front solutions with algebraic spatial decay for some autocatalytic chemical reaction systems, especially for the typical autocatalytic system with reaction rate uqvp when p > 1 and q ≥ 1. First, for the autocatalytic systems with equal diffusion rates and with more general initial values, the wave fronts with noncritical speeds are proved to be nonlinearly asymptotically stable in some special polynomially weighted spaces for the case where p > 1 and q = 1, and the waves fronts with noncritical speeds are proved to be linearly asymptotically stable for the case where p > 1 and q > 1. Second, by applying special transformations and appropriate matrix perturbation theories, we establish some abstract results on the existence and analyticity of the Evans function for the more general linear ODE systems with slow algebraic decaying coefficients. Third, by detailed spectral estimates and by applying our abstract results on the Evans function to the autocatalytic systems for the case where p > 1 and q ≥ 1 and when the two diffusion rates are close, we prove that the wave fronts with noncritical speeds are linearly exponentially stable in some exponentially weighted spaces. Finally, for the autocatalytic systems with p > 1 and q = 1 it can be shown that if the initial perturbation of the wave in Cunif(R) space is small in both the unweighted norm and the exponentially weighted norm, then the perturbation stays small in the unweighted norm and decays exponentially in the exponentially weighted norm; further, we can prove that if the initial perturbation is, in addition, small in the L1 norm, then the perturbation also stays small in the L1(R) norm and decays algebraically in the Cunif(R) norm.	coefficient;linear algebra;nonlinear system;t-norm;taxicab geometry;theory	Yi Li;Yaping Wu	2012	SIAM J.

This work is an application of this concept to design a 1 order 330 KHz cutoff frequency Lowpass filter operating at 10 MHz sampling frequency in 0.13μm technology and 1.2 V supply voltage. The Comparator Based Switched Capacitor (CBSC) filter is compared with conventional Two stage Miller compensated Operational amplifier based switched capacitor filter. It is shown that CBSC filter relaxes the constraints like speed ,linearity, gain, stability which would otherwise be hard to satisfy in scaled technologies in Opamp based circuits. The designed CBSC based lowpass filter provides significant power savings compared to traditional Opamp based switched capacitor filter.	comparator;current source;eniac;low-pass filter;negative feedback;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;output impedance;sampled data system;sampling (signal processing);steady state;switched capacitor;virtual ground	Manodipan Sahoo;Bharadwaj S.

X ? X in a complete metric space X satisfying iterated contraction-like condition: d ( G ( y ) , G ( x ) ) ? ? ( d ( y , x ) , d ( y , x 0 ) , d ( x , x 0 ) ) d ( y , x ) for all x ? D 0 with y = G ( x ) ? D 0 , where x 0 ? D 0 and ? ? ? ( J 3 ) . Here J 3 is a suitable set of ( R + ) 3 to be defined in Section 2. We study the region of accessibility of fixed points of G by the Picard iteration u n + 1 = G ( u n ) , where the starting point u 0 ? D 0 is not necessarily x 0 . Our convergence theory is applied to the Newton-like iterations in Banach spaces under the center Lipschitz condition ? F x ' - F x 0 ' ? ? ω ( ? x - x 0 ? ) for a given point x 0 ? D 0 . Our results extend and improve the previous ones in the sense of the center Lipschitz condition and the region of accessibility of solutions. We apply our results to solve the nonlinear Fredholm operator equations of second kind.	accessibility;newton	D. R. Sahu;Y. J. Cho;Ravi P. Agarwal;Ioannis K. Argyros	2015	J.

Although timing margining loop-back tests are cost effective, phase interpolator (PI) circuitry needs to be tested for test completeness. Our method provides an efficient linearity test capability for the PI circuitry. In the proposed scheme, a sliding window search algorithm is used to extract differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL), based on a jitter distribution obtained from undersampling. Various simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the method. They indicate that the proposed algorithm provides an accurate estimation of linearities of the PI. We also implemented our algorithm in a conventional low cost high volume manufacturing (HVM) tester platform to show feasibility and validity of the proposed technique.	12-bit;bit error rate;built-in test equipment;differential nonlinearity;electronic circuit;hardware-assisted virtualization;integral nonlinearity;loopback;noise reduction;nonlinear system;phase-locked loop;repeatability;robustness (computer science);search algorithm;serdes;simulation;undersampling;x.690	Ji Hwan Chun;Siew Mooi Lim;Shao Chee Ong;Jae Wook Lee;Jacob A.

This provides a mechanism for nonuniqueness of the thin-film equation with $m (2,4)$ since solutions with a persistent touch-down point also exist in this case. In order to prove the existence of the self-similar solutions, we need to study a four-dimensional continuous dynamical system.

Unlike the uniform sampling case, where the aliases are simply periodic replicas of the original spectrum, random sampling theory shows that the randomization of sampling intervals shapes the aliases into a noise floor in the sampled spectrum. New insights into both the Fourier random sampling problem and Compressive Sensing theory can be obtained using the theoretical framework of random sampling. This paper extends the theory of continuous time random sampling to deal with random discrete intervals generated from a clock. A key result is established to relate the discrete probability distribution of the sampling intervals to the power spectrum of the aliasing noise. Based on the proposed theory, a generic discrete random sampling hardware architecture is also proposed for sampling and reconstructing a class of spectrally sparse signals at an average rate significantly below the Nyquist rate of the signal.	aliasing;compressed sensing;monte carlo method;noise floor;nyquist rate;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;spectral density	Chenchi Luo;James H.

A quadrature representation with built-in phase shifters is proposed for such systems. Fundamental structural characterizations of linear quantum optical systems are derived in terms of the new quadrature representation. These results reveal considerable insights into the issue of the physical realizability of such quantum systems. The problem of coherent quantum linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) feedback control studied in H. I. Nurdin, M. R. James, and I. R. Petersen, Automatica, IFAC, 45 (2009), pp. 1837–1846; G. Zhang and M. R. James, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 56 (2011), pp. 1535–1550 is reinvestigated in depth. First, the optimization methods in these papers are extended to a multistep optimization algorithm which utilizes ideal squeezers. Second, a two-stage optimization approach is proposed on the basis of controller parametrization. Numerical studies show that closed-loop systems designed via the second approach may offer LQG control performance even better than that when the closed-loop systems are in the vacuum state. When ideal squeezers in a closed-loop system are replaced by (more realistic) degenerate parametric amplifiers, a sufficient condition is derived for the asymptotic stability of the resultant new closed-loop system; the issue of performance convergence is also discussed in the LQG control setting.	algorithm;amplifier;canonical account;coherent;direct coupling;fits;feedback;in-phase and quadrature components;interconnection;julius petersen;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimal design;parametric oscillator;quantum system;resultant;theory	Guofeng Zhang;H.

Various circuit schemes have been proposed to relax such constrains with noise canceling methods [1, 2] at the cost of significant extra power and chip area, and with FIR filtering techniques [3, 4] utilizing multiple charge pumps (CPs), PFDs and dividers. To reduce the ΔΣ quantization noise, fractional phase rotation [4] has been also a popular approach as an alternative to the dual modulus divider. However, high-resolution phase interpolators (PIs) suffer from nonlinearities due to random mismatches among phase steps and systematic imperfections in circuit operation when the interpolated vector approaches quadrant boundaries, and such nonlinearities eventually limit the amount of noise reduction in PI-based PLL. This work presents a 1GHz ΔΣ fractional-N PLL based on the noise filtering by FIR-embedded PI. The proposed PI scheme greatly improves phase linearity by a dual-referenced interpolation and realizes FIR filtering without using multiple CPs, PFDs, and dividers. The designed fractional-N PLL shows a comparable phase-noise performance to that of an integer-N PLL even with loop bandwidth of 0.1×fref.	embedded system;finite impulse response;frequency divider;image resolution;interpolation;modulus robot;noise reduction;phase noise;phase-locked loop;quantization (signal processing);voltage-controlled oscillator	Dong-Woo Jee;Yunjae Suh;Hong-June Park;Jae-Yoon Sim	2011	2011 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference	10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746234	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;finite impulse response;control theory;pll multibit	EDA	61.34303902556927	50.43603385958379	10411

In the new tuning system, SRI can instantly operate in one of the switching frequency harmonics, e.g., the first, third, or fifth harmonic. Moreover, the new system can utilize pulse density modulation (PDM), phase shift (PS), and power–frequency control methods for each harmonic. Simultaneous combination of PDM and PS control method is also proposed for smoother power regulation. In addition, this paper investigates performance of selected harmonic operation based on phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits. In comparison with the fundamental harmonic operation, PLL circuits suffer from stability problem for the other harmonic operations. The proposed method has been verified using laboratory prototypes with resonant frequencies of 20 up to 75 kHz and output power of about 200 W.	arnold tongue;clock rate;inverter (logic gate);phase-locked loop;pulse-density modulation;resonant inverter	Alireza Namadmalan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2638399	control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;resonance;engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;q factor;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	66.13371058642473	40.341782671423765	10437

Hence, no global minimizer exists. In this paper we introduce a new discretization scheme in scale and time shifts, such that the total uncertainty of a corresponding function system has the lowest possible value. We also describe a generalized uncertainty principle inspired by the familiar uncertainty principle in time-frequency analysis. As an example we apply this concept to wavelet analysis, leading to a new affine uncertainty principle. We also introduce waveforms minimizing this principle. Furthermore, we remark that the uncertainty measure associated with this new principle allows for decay estimates of the ambiguity function (reproducing kernel) associated with the wavelet transform.	ambiguity function;discretization;frequency analysis;time–frequency analysis;uncertainty principle;wavelet transform	Daniel Lantzberg;Florian Lieb;Hans-Georg Stark;Ron Levie;Nir A.

a640bd1b7ea4c0123ac0333d59bfab4c00cf2ff3	a novel hybrid zcs zvs current control method for micro-inverters		Boundary current mode (BCM) zero voltage switching method is proposed to help inverters have better performances with higher conversion efficiency. But the modulations increase MOSFETs conduction losses and inductor core losses due to its rapidly changed bandwidth. In this paper, a novel hybrid current modulation, which combines zero current switching (ZCS) and zero voltage switching(ZVS) is proposed to further improve the efficiency and narrow the switching frequency range of the inverters. Finally, a 400W full-bridge inverter and a digital current control platform is built to give experimental results. The experimental results verify that higher efficiency can be achieved using the proposed new modulation.	bcm theory;bandwidth (signal processing);clock rate;frequency band;inverter (logic gate);modulation;performance;power inverter;prototype;switched-mode power supply	Naijun Xu;Dehua Zhang	2018	2018 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433583	switching frequency;voltage;control theory;engineering;solar micro-inverter;energy conversion efficiency;modulation;inverter;bandwidth (signal processing);inductor	EDA	62.60515571592248	45.01709296292548	10532

We work in the setting of derivative-free optimization (DFO), assuming that the objective and constraint functions are available through a black-box that provides function values for lower-C2 representation of the functions. Our approach is based on a DFO adaptation of the -comirror algorithm [6]. Algorithmic convergence hinges on the ability to accurately approximate subgradients of lower-C2 functions, which we prove is possible through linear interpolation. We show that, if the sampling radii for linear interpolation are properly selected, then the new algorithm has the same convergence rate as the original gradient-based algorithm. This provides a novel global rate-of-convergence result for nonsmooth convex DFO with nonsmooth convex constraints. We conclude with numerical testing that demonstrates the practical feasibility of the algorithm and some directions for further research.	approximation algorithm;black box;constraint (mathematics);constraint algorithm;convex function;convex optimization;convex set;cutting-plane method;derivative-free optimization;gradient;linear interpolation;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);social inequality;subderivative	Heinz H.

5e5c0b3f256f646800c47c286bf862ce0f4390d5	toward parallel coarse grid correction for the parareal algorithm		In this paper, we present an idea toward parallel coarse grid correction (CGC) for the parareal algorithm. It is well known that such a CGC procedure is often the bottleneck of speedup of the parareal algorithm. For an ODE system with initial-value condition $u(0)=u_0$ the idea can be explained as follows. First, we apply the $mathcal{G}$-propagator to the same ODE system but with a special condition $u(0)=alpha u(T)$, where $alphainmathbb{R}$ is a crux parameter. Second, in each iteration of the parareal algorithm the CGC procedure will be carried out by the so-called diagonalization technique established recently. The parameter $alpha$ controls both the roundoff error arising from such a diagonalization technique and the convergence rate of the resulting parareal algorithm. We show that there exists some threshold $alpha^*$ such that the parareal algorithm with diagonalization-based CGC possesses the same convergence rate as that of the parareal algorithm with classical CGC if $|alpha|leq alph...	algorithm;parareal	Shu-Lin Wu	2018	SIAM J.

It is shown that the objective function can have a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative optimization techniques used in SLAM. When Frobenius norm is adopted for the error term of the orientation part of odometry, the SLAM problem has much better convergence properties, as compared with that using the angle difference as the error term. For one-step case, we have proved that there is one and only one minimum to the SLAM problem, and strong duality always holds. For two-step case, strong duality always holds except when three very special conditions hold simultaneously (which happens with probability zero), thus the global optimal solution to primal SLAM problem can be obtained by solving the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem in most cases. Further, for arbitrary m-step cases, we also show using examples that much better convergence results can be obtained. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the different convergence properties using two different objective functions.	simultaneous localization and mapping	Heng Wang;Shoudong Huang;Guang-Hong yang;Gamini Dissanayake	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.08.009	mathematical optimization;odometry;simultaneous localization and mapping;duality (optimization);matrix norm;mathematics;strong duality;lagrangian;convergence (routing)	Robotics	74.77323078734186	24.753938025136215	10578

The modified CRB proves useful when, in addition to the parameter to be estimated, the observed data also depend on other unwanted parameters. The relationship between the modified and true CRB is established and applications are discussed regarding the estimation of carrier-frequency offset, carrier phase, and timing epoch in linearly modulated signals. Modified CRBs for phase and timing estimation have been already discussed in previous works where it is shown that several practical carrier-phase and clock recovery circuits do attain such bounds. Frequency discrimination, instead, is not so wellrepresented in the literature and a significant contribution of this paper is the calculation of the modified CRB for frequency estimation. This bound is compared with the performance of some frequency detectors and it is concluded that further work is needed in search of more efficient frequency discrimination methods.	clock recovery;estimation theory;frequency offset;loose coupling;modulation;newton's method;sensor;spectral density estimation;synchronization (computer science)	Nunzio Aldo D'Andrea;Umberto Mengali;Ruggero Reggiannini	1994	IEEE Trans.

A cryogenic 7-mm coaxial noise source was developed for verifying the ATL method. The ENT is determined from the parameters evaluated by a radiometer and the available power ratio of the transmission line measured by a vector network analyzer. The calibrated ENT by this method was 139.8 K-143.6 K with an expanded uncertainty of 4.0 K-4.6 K (k = 2) in the frequency range of 8-12 GHz. We also performed a comparison of the ENT using two different methods: an ordinary radiometer measurement using two reference noise sources and a theoretical calculation method analyzing temperature and loss distribution along the transmission line. The experimental results show the validity of the ATL method for determining the ENT.	conductance (graph);effective input noise temperature;experiment;frequency band;human cognitive reliability correlation;johnson–nyquist noise;microwave;noise generator;oral history metadata synchronizer;packet analyzer;propagation constant;reference noise;transmission line measurement	Hitoshi Iida;Yozo Shimada;Koji Komiyama	2011	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2010.2091298	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;radiometer;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Visualization	69.43496887445444	51.50838587634525	10712

A multi-layer MIC technology is adopted to reduce the circuit size of the oscillator. The oscillator consists of Gunn diodes, slot line resonators and strip lines. By embedding Gunn diodes in the slot line resonators, a harmonic RF signal can be generated very easily. The strip lines are used for the power combining output circuit. The shape of slot line resonator is square in order to achieve the low phase noise and the suppression of undesired harmonics. The second harmonic oscillator is designed and fabricated in K band. The output power is +8.89dBm at the design frequency of 18.75GHz (2f0) with the phase noise of -116.2dBc/Hz at the offset frequency of 1MHz. Excellent suppression of the undesired fundamental frequency signal (f0) of -33dBc is achieved. Also, the circuit size is reduced by three-tenths relative to that of the previously proposed circuit.	diode	Kengo Kawasaki;Takayuki Tanaka;Masayoshi Aikawa	2010	IEICE Transactions		electronic engineering;telecommunications;vackář oscillator;engineering;electrical engineering;phase noise;injection locking;parametric oscillator;physics;gunn diode;quantum mechanics	Visualization	64.79913670745387	54.98891305010341	10737

Timing analyzers attempt to capture the effect of the interconnect on the delay with a simplified model, typically an RC tree. For mid-frequency MOS integrated circuits the RC tree methods can predict the delay to within 10 percent of a SPICE simulation and at faster than lOOOx the speed. With continual progress in integrated circuit processing, operating speeds and new technologies are emerging that may require more elaborate interconnect models. Digital bipolar and high-speed MOS integrated systems can require interconnect models which contain coupling capacitors and inductors. In addition, to enable timing verification at the printed circuit hoard level also requires general RLC interconnect models. Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) provides a generalized approach to linear RLC circuit response approximations. The RLC interconnect model may contain floating capacitors, grounded resistors, inductors, and even linear controlled sources. The transient portion of the response is approximated by matching the initial boundary conditions and the first 2q-1 moments of the exact response to a lower order q-pole model. For the case of an RC tree model a first-order AWE approximation reduces to the RC tree methods.	approximation algorithm;asymptote;digital electronics;first-order predicate;hoard;integrated circuit;printed circuit board;propagation delay;rlc circuit;spice;simulation;software propagation;static timing analysis;waveform	Lawrence T.

The first are described by specific figures of merit, mainly integral nonlinearity and differential nonlinearity; the second, in terms of standard amplifier performance (e.g., total harmonic distortion, and so on). Performance is assessed without considering prior separation of the two, resulting in misleading characterization. We address the cross influence of (i) and (ii), and propose a novel figure of merit for bandpass response that separately addresses nonlinear deviations and memory effects attending to DACs inner structure.

One of the usual hypotheses to get semi-global controllability, is to assume that f(x, v)v ≥ 0. In this case, a stabilisation term u = γ(x)vt makes any solution converging to zero. The semi-global controllability then follows from a theorem of local controllability and the time reversibility of the equation. In this paper, the nonlinearity f can be more general, so that the solutions of the damped equation may converge to another equilibrium than 0. To prove semi-global controllability, we study the controllability inside a compact attractor and show that it is possible to travel from one equilibrium point to another by using the heteroclinic orbits.	bellman equation;commutation theorem;converge;nonlinear system;semilinear response;steady state	Romain Joly;Camille Laurent	2014	SIAM J.

A short duration zero mean white Gaussian noise is injected into the system using an active loudspeaker and the GLD algorithm is employed to recursively estimate the secondary path. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that obtained by filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm based ANC system and Eriksson's method in terms of ensemble mean square error and convergence rate. The new scheme is shown to effectively model the secondary path even without prior knowledge of its order.	algorithm;coefficient;control system;least mean squares filter;levinson recursion;loudspeaker;mean squared error;nonlinear system;powered speakers;rate of convergence;transfer function	Shashank Tyagi;Vibhav Katre;Nithin V.

At every step the SMD algorithm shifts the dominant column or row of the polynomial matrix to the zero lag position and eliminates the resulting instantaneous correlation. A proof of convergence is provided, and it is demonstrated that SMD establishes diagonalization faster and with lower order operations than existing PEVD algorithms.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;array processing;computation;filter bank;gabor filter;iteration;iterative method;parity bit;polynomial matrix;service mapping description;simulation;sparse matrix;storage module device;transformation matrix;zero suppression	Soydan Redif;Stephan D.

In such a design problem, there are a large number of local minimums. The updating procedure of normal PSO tends to stagnate around such a local minimum and thus indicates a premature convergence property. Therefore, a new method for avoiding such a situation is proposed, in which the Gaussian function is added as a penalty to the evaluation function. Several design examples are shown to present the effectiveness of the proposed method.	cambridge structural database;coefficient;evaluation function;finite impulse response;maxima and minima;particle swarm optimization;premature convergence	Kazuki Saito;Kenji Suyama	2013	2013 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference	10.1109/APSIPA.2013.6694374	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;infinite impulse response	EDA	61.74163169338252	15.114550282840682	10902

We present a multi-stage centred scheme, of the kind proposed by Toro [Appl. Numer. Math. 56 (2006) 1464], for numerically resolving the simultaneous flow of two fluids through a transport pipeline. This model contains non-conservative terms in both the temporal and spatial derivatives, and an extension of the standard numerical framework for conservation laws is needed. In this paper, we rewrite the model in an equivalent mathematical form, eliminating the nonconservative time-derivatives. This allows us to use the framework described by Parés [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44 (2006) 300]. We develop FORCE and MUSTA-type schemes which are consistent with Parés’ formalism. Numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of stability of our proposed schemes. Comparisons with the Roe and Rusanov schemes indicate that convergence to near-identical solutions are obtained when the non-conservative terms are discretized with respect to the same evaluation of the path-dependent integrals. However, if the schemes are not mutually formally path-consistent in the sense of Parés, different converged solutions are obtained.	comstock–needham system;converge;discretization;experiment;formal system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;path dependence;philip l. roe;rewrite (programming);simulation;two-phase commit protocol	Svend Tollak Munkejord;Steinar Evje;Tore Flåtten	2009	SIAM J.

It has been found that such GFMs encounter many difficulties when applied to shock impedance matching (-like) problems due to the inability of accurately imposing interfacial conditions. By predicting the flow states for the real fluid nodes just next to the interface and the ghost fluid nodes using the Riemann problem solver, a more accurate interface boundary condition can be imposed and the said difficulties are mitigated to a large extent. This leads to the development of a proposed real-GFM in this work. A simple yet efficient extension of the present method to multidimensions is also introduced. In order to overcome issues associated with the severe bunching of level set contours due to the large flow velocity gradient, an extension (artificial) velocity field is constructed in the computation of the level set function. The present method is applied to various oneand two-dimensional problems involving strong shock-interface interaction and complex flow physics.	algorithm;computation;distortion;fltk;ghost;gradient;impedance matching;numerical analysis;riemann problem;simulation;solver;velocity (software development)	Chaochao Wang Wang;T.

From the analytical point of view, two main results are established; the stability of an anisotropic approximation of the velocity (using different spaces for horizontal and vertical velocities) with piecewise constant pressures, and the unstability of standard (isotropic) approximations which are stable for the Stokes problem, like the mini-element or the Taylor-Hood element.

Under these assumptions, we construct a common quadratic positive definite Lyapunov function for the switched system describing the evolution of the disagreement vector, thus showing that the agents always reach consensus. In addition, the proof leads to the explicit construction of a constant state-feedback matrix that allows the multi-agent system to achieve consensus.	consensus (computer science);lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;state space	Maria Elena Valcher;Irene Zorzan	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.07.011	mathematical optimization;positive-definite matrix;control theory;homogeneous;mathematics;quadratic equation;topology;multi-agent system;lyapunov function;matrix (mathematics);consensus;instant	AI	64.90369864861509	5.498132730787769	10968

The realized communication link includes the transmitting capsule antenna, the outside body receiving antenna and the model of the human body. The capsule antenna is designed for operating at the frequency band of 600 MHz with an impedance bandwidth of 10 MHz and omnidirectional radiation pattern. The quality of the communication link is improved by using directive antenna outside body inside matching layer for electromagnetic wave tuning to the body. The outside body antenna has circular polarization that guaranteeing the communication link for different orientations of the capsule inside intestine. It is shown that the path loss for the capsule in 60 mm from the abdomen surface varies between 37-47 dB in relation to the antenna orientation. This link can establish high data rate wireless communications for capsule endoscopy.	agile software development;antenna device component;bandwidth (signal processing);body dysmorphic disorders;capsule endoscopes;characteristic impedance;circular polarization;data rate units;directive (programming);electromagnetic radiation;endoscope device component;frequency band;impedance matching;matching;megahertz;quantitative impedance;radiation pattern;resonance;simulation;small intestinal wall tissue;transmitter;transmitter device component	Ali Khaleghi;Ilangko Balasingham	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319291	antenna feed;omnidirectional antenna;reflective array antenna;electronic engineering;collinear antenna array;monopole antenna;random wire antenna;periscope antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;engineering;reconfigurable antenna;directional antenna;conformal antenna;helical antenna;antenna;horn antenna;smart antenna;radiation pattern;coaxial antenna;optics;slot antenna;dipole antenna;biconical antenna	Mobile	67.63375753331695	59.242442877918684	10983

This paper proposes a method of shortening duration time of MS operation that occurs when two inputs of RSFF consisting of CMOS NAND gates are switched from logic 0 to 1 approximately at the same instant. The MS operation is detected and fed back to inputs so that it is forced to terminate. A configuration of RSFF that has feedback based on this idea is first presented, and then a principle of shortening MS operation duration time follows. Then, considering implementation of RSFF by n-well process, feedback connection and MOSFET parameters are optimized. Although hardware increases slightly by addition of feedback, the result shows the MS operation duration time increase rate against input phase difference (switching time difference of two inputs of RSFF), and the range of input phase difference for MS operation incidence are reduced by approximately 114 and 113, respectively, compared with conventional methods.	cmos;flops;feedback;flip-flop (electronics);incidence matrix;nand gate;propagation delay;software propagation;switching time;terminate (software)	Yoichiro Sato;Takuji Okamoto;Yuji Sugiyama;Masahiro Kawai;Toshifumi Kobayashi	1996	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/scj.4690271003	real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;conflict resolution;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Arch	63.209325555195434	44.56326954433624	11043

A comprehensive analysis to the proposed converter is presented. Compared to conventional three-phase cascaded H-bridge converters, in the proposed new multilevel converters, the switch voltage stress is reduced, and fewer switches and dc capacitors are required under the similar operating conditions. Based on the study to the operation principle of the new converter, the minimum average value and maximum harmonic components of the dc-link voltages of the three Vienna rectifier modules are analyzed. The power factor correction of the proposed converters is realized by employing traditional one-cycle control strategy, the zero sequence current is injected to the three inner currents for balancing three VIENNA dc-link voltages. Simulations are carried out, the results verified the availability of the new proposed multilevel converters and the validity of the corresponding control strategy applied.	analog-to-digital converter;anatomy, regional;arabic numeral 0;computer simulation;control theory;converter device component;entity name part qualifier - adopted;equilibrium;h bridge;network switch;power switch device component;rectifier device component;sandy bridge;switch device component;unbalanced circuit;vienna rectifier;voltage	Zou Jia;Wang Cong;Cheng Hong;Hou Linan	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216277	vienna rectifier;control theory;power factor;engineering;voltage;capacitor;symmetrical components;rectifier;harmonic	EDA	64.21871796557453	40.99200735114633	11052

The approach makes use of the adaptive finite difference method presented by Huang and Sloan [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 15 (1994), pp. 776–797]. This method is applied on a coarse grid to obtain a rough approximation of the solution and a suitable adapted mesh. The adaptive finite difference solution permits the construction of a smooth coordinate transformation that relates the computational space to the physical space. The map between the spaces is based on Chebyshev polynomial interpolation. Finally, the standard pseudospectral (PS) method is applied to the transformed differential problem to obtain highly accurate, nonoscillatory numerical solutions. Numerical results are presented for steady problems in one and two space dimensions.	adaptive filter;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;chebyshev polynomials;comment (computer programming);computation;discretization;equidistributed sequence;finite difference method;finite element method;gauss pseudospectral method;iterative method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;polynomial interpolation;spectral method	Lawrence S.

In particular, we study a special case where the diagonal elements are constants with magnitude 1. Conditions on the perturbation matrices are given under which the system is left and right almost diagonal. An application of this result in a discrete adiabatic oscillator equation is discussed. We also introduce a result for the case when the diagonal matrix is approaching the identity matrix I. An example is given to illustrate that the new result can be applied to some cases that do not satisfy the ''Growth Condition''.

The erratum is in the part where we describe how to generate a complete solution from two partial solutions. More precisely, if o1 = (o1,1, o1,2), o2 = (o2,1, o2,2) ∈ Ωe are two partial solutions, then the associated complete solution is (o1,1, o2,1, o1,2, o2,2) instead of (o1,1, o1,2, o2,1, o2,2) as it is said in the mentioned paper. Therefore, the Möbius transformation generated by o1, o2 is o1,1t + o2,1 o1,2t + o2,2 .	coefficient;computation;evolutionary algorithm;heuristic;parametrization (atmospheric modeling)	J.

c743a2f7fba2f5444f1419dffc4811ab2984eb74	compensation of pvt variations in tof imagers with in-pixel tdc	single photon avalanche diode spad;time of flight tof;articulo;in pixel time to digital converter tdc;time gating;pvt compensation	The design of a direct time-of-flight complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (dToF-CIS) based on a single-photon avalanche-diode (SPAD) array with an in-pixel time-to-digital converter (TDC) must contemplate system-level aspects that affect its overall performance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the impact of process parameters, voltage supply, and temperature (PVT) variations on the time bin of the TDC array. Moreover, the design and characterization of a global compensation loop is presented. It is based on a phase locked loop (PLL) that is integrated on-chip. The main building block of the PLL is a voltage-controlled ring-oscillator (VCRO) that is identical to the ones employed for the in-pixel TDCs. The reference voltage that drives the master VCRO is distributed to the voltage control inputs of the slave VCROs such that their multiphase outputs become invariant to PVT changes. These outputs act as time interpolators for the TDCs. Therefore the compensation scheme prevents the time bin of the TDCs from drifting over time due to the aforementioned factors. Moreover, the same scheme is used to program different time resolutions of the direct time-of-flight (ToF) imager aimed at 3D ranging or depth map imaging. Experimental results that validate the analysis are provided as well. The compensation loop proves to be remarkably effective. The spreading of the TDCs time bin is lowered from: (i) 20% down to 2.4% while the temperature ranges from 0 °C to 100 °C; (ii) 27% down to 0.27%, when the voltage supply changes within ±10% of the nominal value; (iii) 5.2 ps to 2 ps standard deviation over 30 sample chips, due to process parameters' variation.	active pixel sensor;avalanches;behavioral tic;bin;cmos;conflict (psychology);converter device component;depth map;diode device component;electroencephalography phase desynchronization;image sensor;intrinsic drive;ions;oscillator device component;phase-locked loop;photons;prolymphocytic leukemia;ring oscillator;semiconductor;simulation;standard deviation;time-to-digital converter;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;transcranial direct current stimulation;transcranial direct-current stimulation;voltage	Ion Vornicu;Ricardo Carmona-Galán;Ángel Rodríguez-Vázquez	2017		10.3390/s17051072	electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	58.669378858372795	48.01614642174682	11208

The second-order RF filter has only two stacked transistors, and its use, in combination with a subsequent harmonic rejection mixer, results in wideband interference rejection. The energy detector with programmable rectifiers provides dynamic-range (DR) scalability, enabling shared use for white-space/interference-level detection and automatic gain control. A prototype chip, fabricated using 90-nm CMOS technology, achieved over 42-dB harmonic rejection including 7th-order component without any external device, a 67-dB gain, a 5-8-dB noise figure, a -11-dBm in-band third-order intercept point, and a +38-dBm second-order intercept point while drawing only 25-37 mA from a 1.2-V power supply. Multi-resolution DR-scalable spectrum sensing with a 0.2-30-MHz detection bandwidth, -83-dBm minimum sensitivity, and a 29-48-dB DR was demonstrated.	automatic gain control;cmos;cognitive radio;dynamic range;electronic filter;interference (communication);noise figure;peripheral;power supply;prototype;radio frequency;rectifier;rejection sampling;scalability;semiconductor;third-order intercept point;transistor;visual intercept	Masaki Kitsunezuka;Hiroshi Kodama;Naoki Oshima;Kazuaki Kunihiro;Tadashi Maeda;Muneo Fukaishi	2012	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2012.2185531	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;cmos	Mobile	61.10908491491727	52.27809321482902	11268

They are particularly effective for solving a sequence of related problems, such as those arising in mixedinteger nonlinear programming and the optimization of functions subject to differential equation constraints. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the formulation of stabilized SQP methods, which are specifically designed to handle degenerate optimization problems. Existing stabilized SQP methods are essentially local, in the sense that both the formulation and analysis focus on the properties of the methods in a neighborhood of a solution. A new SQP method is proposed that has favorable global convergence properties yet, under suitable assumptions, is equivalent to a variant of the conventional stabilized SQP method in the neighborhood of a solution. The method combines a primal-dual generalized augmented Lagrangian function with a flexible line search to obtain a sequence of improving estimates of the solution. The method incorporates a convexification algorithm that allows the use of exact second-derivatives to define a convex quadratic programming (QP) subproblem without requiring that the Hessian of the Lagrangian be positive definite in the neighborhood of a solution. This gives the potential for fast convergence in the neighborhood of a solution. Additional benefits of the method are that each QP subproblem is regularized and the QP subproblem always has a known feasible point. Numerical experiments are presented for a subset of the problems from the CUTEr test collection.	approximation algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;cuter;computation;constrained optimization;convex hull;experiment;gradient;hessian;line search;local convergence;matlab;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;qp state machine frameworks;rate of convergence;refinement (computing);sequential quadratic programming;social inequality	Philip E.

To solve this problem numerically, it is usually necessary to approximate Ω by a (typically polygonal) new domain Ωh. The difference between the solutions of both infinite-dimensional control problems, one formulated in Ω and the second in Ωh, was studied in [E. Casas and J. Sokolowski, SIAM J. Control Optim., 48 (2010), pp. 3746–3780], where an error of order O(h) was proved. In [K. Deckelnick, A. Günther, and M. Hinze, SIAM J. Control Optim., 48 (2009), pp. 2798–2819], the numerical approximation of the problem defined in Ω was considered. The authors used a finite element method such that Ωh was the polygon formed by the union of all triangles of the mesh of parameter h. They proved an error of order O(h3/2) for the difference between continuous and discrete optimal controls. Here we show that the estimate obtained in [E. Casas and J. Sokolowski, SIAM J. Control Optim., 48 (2010), pp. 3746–3780] cannot be improved, which leads to the paradox that the numerical solution is a better approximation of the optimal control than the exact one obtained just by changing the domain from Ω to Ωh.

The aim of the present analysis is to implement a relatively recent computational method, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, for obtaining the solutions of integrodifferential algebraic systems of temporal two-point boundary value problems. Two extended inner product spaces W[0, 1] and H[0, 1] are constructed in which the boundary conditions of the systems are satisfied, while two smooth kernel functions R t (s) and r t (s) are used throughout the evolution of the algorithm in order to obtain the required grid points. An efficient construction is given to obtain the numerical solutions for the systems together with an existence proof of the exact solutions based upon the reproducing kernel theory. In this approach, computational results of some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the viability, simplicity, and applicability of the algorithm developed.	algebraic equation;algorithm;computation;discretization;hilbert space;linear algebra;numerical analysis	Omar Abu Arqub;Hasan Rashaideh	2017	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-017-2845-7	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;reproducing kernel hilbert space;mathematics	Robotics	83.07834128399226	15.680676680335878	11366

Furthermore, a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) based on a perturb-and-observe method is also realized to effectively draw power from PV arrays. Both the FLC and the MPPT are implemented on a single-chip microprocessor.

Acknowledgement Working and studying with brilliant people in the superb environment at UC Berkeley was one of the most fortunate and honorable opportunities in my whole life. Most of all my gratitude to my research advisor, Prof. Jan M. Rabaey is so sincere and deep that I can't even find proper words to express it. Without the dedication, insight, and tolerance he showed me during my stay, I could not have reached this point, much less conducted proper research. I also would like to convey my deepest thanks to Prof. Ali M. Ninejad for the discussion and his devotion to the field of research. It was also my honor to have Prof. Paul K. Wright as my qualification committee. The proposed triple-channel UWB-based cognitive radio exploits spectral crowding and coexistence of other wireless devices as the number of sensors and wearable computing devices increases in 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz ISM band to achieve energy efficient 1Gb/s short-range wireless communication. A dual-resolution analog wavelet-based spectrum performs bandwidth-and frequency-agile band pass filter (BPF) to detect narrowband and wideband interferers with low power consumption. A charge-pump-based triangular waveform generators and a source follower type low pass filter (LPF) generates basis function for the spectrum sensing with 132MHz sensing resolution. A Low power integer-N QPLL with reduced reference spur by digital calibration on mismatch of the charge pump current supports the tuning frequencies with a linear tuned wide range two stage ring-VCO and a low power programmable true-single-phase-clock (TSPC) divider. The proposed Triple-channel UWB-based cognitive radio was fabricated in 1V 65nm CMOS GP process. The test chip size is 2.3×2 mm 2 , and the active area is 2.1mm 2. The data rate by using triangular shaped BPSK data is 1Gb/s at 1m communication. The lowest FoM of the energy/bit is 61pJ/bit, and the highest FoM is 102pJ/bit. It achieves BER from 9.2×10-7 to 1.1×10-4 according to frequency allocation of the triple-channels. The triple-channel UWB-based cognitive radio can provide energy efficient high-data rate wireless communication even with …	acoustic lobing;aggregate data;agile software development;baseband;basis function;bit error rate;cmos;charge pump;clock rate;coexist (image);cognitive radio;crowding;current source;data rate units;digital data;electronic circuit;feedback;frequency allocation;frequency band;gigabyte;human body weight;interference (communication);keeper (password manager);lock (computer science);low-noise amplifier;low-pass filter;maxima and minima;mebibyte;mixed-signal integrated circuit;modulation;multi-channel memory architecture;noise shaping;performance per watt;power inverter;pulse shaping;randomized algorithm;ripple effect;routing;sfiaplus;search algorithm;sensor;spectral density;spectral leakage;super smash bros.;throughput;transceiver;transmitter;uc browser;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video;voltage-controlled oscillator;wavelet;wearable computer;x.690	Nam-Seog Kim	2014				Mobile	58.31176246750788	53.25804944055001	11394

When the underlying mapping is both a P0-function and a R0-function and its Hessian is Lipschitz continuous, we prove the global convergence of the new method. The new method also has global Q-linear and local Q-quadratical convergence rates under the same conditions.	complementarity (physics);complementarity theory;hessian;iteration;line search;linear system;local convergence;numerical continuation;quadratic equation;rate of convergence;smoothing;system of linear equations	Min Sun;Zhen-Jun Shi	2006	APJOR	10.1142/S0217595906000838	system of linear equations;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;interior point method;calculus;mathematics;mixed complementarity problem;lipschitz continuity;rate of convergence;complementarity theory;line search	ML	75.62799977340133	22.821596136691802	11397
4302d1daff46fdebdf14363a959a4d93c08ed86d	discontinuous galerkin method for a nonlocal hydrodynamic model of flocking dynamics		Abstract In this paper we devise an efficient and robust numerical method for a nonlocal nonlinear model of flocking dynamics. The governing equations are a hydrodynamic limit of the model of Cucker and Smale which consists of the compressible Euler equations with added nonlinear nonlocal interaction terms. The numerical scheme is based on the discontinuous Galerkin method. A semi-implicit scheme is used in the time discretization which requires only the solution of one linear system per time level while retaining the stability of an implicit scheme. A crucial point is the construction of a suitable linearization of the nonlocal terms which does not result in fill-in of the system matrices. Element-wise and inter-element artificial diffusion is added to the scheme along with a postprocessing procedure to deal with near-vacuum states that typically arise in the solution. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the scheme on numerical experiments in 1D and 2D.	aharonov–bohm effect;discontinuous galerkin method	Andrea Zivcáková;Václav Kucera	2018	J. Comput.

VOC is a recently proposed grid-forming inverter control strategy, which acts on faster time scales compared to droop control. In our study, we leverage a scalable VOC controller (that is by design agnostic of power levels) to test the system's small-signal stability at different inverter penetration levels. The impact of rotational inertia, reactive power support, and filter parameters on stability is then investigated. Results highlight possible issues that might arise in these mixed machine-inverter systems further motivating the need to develop next generation stabilizing grid-forming controllers.

Based on these conditions, a partial uniqueness condition is proposed which allows collinear loadings in only one mode. We prove that if there is uniqueness in one mode, then the initial CP model can be uniquely decomposed in a sum of lower-rank tensors for which identifiability can be independently assessed. This condition is simpler and easier to check than other similar conditions existing in the specialized literature. These theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.	numerical analysis;numerical method	Xijing Guo;Sebastian Miron;David Brie;Alwin Stegeman	2012	SIAM J.

A prototype system was constructed to verify the feasibility of the design for a number of moving loads (toy cars). Here, 40 A/phase is supplied at 38.4 kHz to a 13-m-long test track. Flat pickups are used on the underside of each vehicle to couple power from the track to the vehicle. Finite element modeling software was used to design the geometrical position of the track cables and to predict the power output. This design resulted in a considerably wider power delivery zone than possible using a single-phase track layout and has been experimentally verified. Mutual coupling effects between the various track phases require additional compensation to be added to ensure balanced three-phase currents.	experiment;finite element method;inductive reasoning;information processes and technology;power inverter;power supply;prototype;pulse-width modulation	Grant Covic;John T.

To enhance the working performance of the lithium-based power battery pack, a hybrid natural and forced active balancing control (HNFABC) strategy is proposed and adopted to the balancing circuit that is proposed in this work. These converters, which are advantageous in natural balancing and forced equalization, accelerate the balance speed of natural equilibrium in the final stage and protect the battery from being repeatedly charged and discharged. Simulation and experimental results show that HNFABC is not only simpler than other traditional balance control strategies but also faster in the equalization process. The idea of combining natural equilibrium and forced equilibrium can be inspired to be used in some related industries.		Yewen Wei;S. K. Dai;Jiayu Wang;Zhifei Shan;Jie Min	2018	J.

The transmitter works in the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) frequency band (401 - 406 MHz) and transmits the signal at a power of -20 dBm while achieves energy efficiency of 40pJ/b. The transmitter achieves this performance through a modified pulse position modulation called saturated analog signal (SAS) which has been tailored to reduce not only the peak and average power consumption but also helps reduces the number of elements required for signal generation and dispenses the need for a crystal which in turn minimizes the overall footprint of the transmitter. The transmitter can also dynamically trade off duty cycling and energy consumption with data rate and range requirements for better operability on a constantly changing environment due to the inherent flexibility of the modulation scheme.	analog signal;data rate units;dbm;duty cycle;frequency band;implants;medical devices;megahertz;modulation;neural prostheses;operability;prosthesis;requirement;sas;signal peptides;transmitter device component	Farhad Goodarzy;Efstratios Skafidas	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610233	transmitter;radio transmitter design;electronic engineering;neuroscience;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;transmitter power output;neurophysiology	Mobile	56.483487429106155	51.451856155277866	11569

The significance of such effects is explored for four different classes of algorithms: low-rank compression, quasi-Monte Carlo integration, sparse grids, and cubature. The exponentially pronounced computational consequences of the anisotropy of the hypercube are described, notably its mismatch with the isotropy of the set of multivariate polynomials of a fixed degree on which some cubature formulas are based, and it is observed that the tensor product Gauss quadrature rule in [−1, 1]d requires up to (π/2)d times fewer points if it is transformed to a nonpolynomial basis.	algorithm;approximation;computation;curse of dimensionality;gaussian quadrature;gauss–kronrod quadrature formula;monte carlo integration;monte carlo method;numerical integration;polynomial;quasi-monte carlo method;sparse grid;sparse matrix	Lloyd N.

Due to the unreliability of communication channels, a packet may be delayed even lost during the transmission. At each moment, the data processing center may receive one or multiple data packets or nothing at all. A novel model is developed to describe the possible multiple random transmission delays and data packet losses by employing a group of Bernoulli distributed random variables. It is transformed to ameasurementmodelwithmultiple randomdelayed states and noises. Based on themodel, an optimal linear filter in the linearminimumvariance sense is proposed by using the orthogonal projection approach which is a universal tool to find the optimal linear estimate. It does not have a steady-state performance since it depends on the values of random variables that depict the phenomena of delays and losses at each moment. So it needs to be computed online. To reduce the online computational cost, a suboptimal linear filter dependent on the probabilities of random variables is also proposed. However, it is worth noting that it is linearly optimal among all the linear filters dependent on the probabilities. It can be computed offline since it has the steady-state performance. A sufficient condition of existence for the steady-state performance is given. A simulation example shows the effectiveness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

On the practical side, we explore its application on coordinating a group of wind Double-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) with integrated storage. To begin with, we establish asymptotic stability of the consensus protocol by employing singular perturbation theory. Subsequently, we establish asymptotic stability of the protocol under communication delays using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Lastly, we use the proposed protocol to design a methodology that can be adopted by a fleet of state-of-the-art wind generators (WGs). The objective is that the WGs selforganize and control their storage devices such that WF total power output is tracking a reference while equal contribution from each storage device is attained i.e equal power output from each storage.

In each time step the particles are assigned into subsets based on the corresponding uncertainty estimates. The weights are then updated based on accumulated subset-inclusion and likelihood information using a discrete set of measurement likelihood functions. By controlling the aggressiveness of the weight computing, the method strives to achieve faster convergence without losing robustness to model errors. Two localization experiments are conducted to verify that the method has a clear advantage over particle filters with single likelihood function. In the first experiment we use synthetic Gaussian Process data. In the second experiment real indoor magnetic field data with very coarse interpolation and uncertainty approximation is used to verify the method's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. One of the main advantages of the proposed method is that despite its flexibility, it adds only little implementational or computational overhead to conventional particle filters.	academy;approximation;experiment;gaussian process;interpolation;monty newborn;niche blogging;overhead (computing);particle filter;simultaneous localization and mapping;synthetic data	Ilari Vallivaara;Anssi Kemppainen;Katja Poikselkä;Juha Röning	2013	2013 16th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)	10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766512	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	54.86757862028618	4.326545852709298	11647

The GMDFa algorithm allows a faster convergence rate and faster tracking of the variation in the echo path to be identified. In these applications the filter may have several thousand tap length at a sampling rate of 16 KHz. This fact leads to difficulties in real time implementation of the algorithm. This paper describes an optimized architecture of' a specific circuit which is designed to perform the computational intensive task of the GMDFa algorithm in real time. It can be carried out for long impulse responlse filters. 1Introductioin For some years, there has been considerable interest shown in improving high quality handfree telephone and acoustic conference applications. However, the acoustic coupling betwe:en the loudspeaker and the microphone of each terminal i,s a significant operating difficulty [ 1-31, A solution to this problem may be the application of the adaptive filtering method to an Acoustic Echo Canceller (AEC). The adaptive filter results in a FIR filter structure with an impulse response with variable coefficients. An algorithm computes the variation of the filter coefficients and minimizes the matching error energy (Figure 1). However, the adaptive filter length may be several thousand taps at a sampling rate of 16 KHz. This fact leads to difficulties in real-time implementation of the algorithm. 2The GMDF algorithm The NLMS algorithm has been used for many years thanks to its simplicity. However its convergence rate and tracking properties are not sufficient when the input signal is strongly correlated (speech signal), and its computational complexity is relatively high. These facts have led specialists to introduce other algorithms which are more efficient, but also more complex. From among these algorithms we have chosen to implement the GMDF algorithm. The GMDF (Generalized Multi-delay frequecydomain filtre:) algorithm takes its place among the frequency-domain block adaptive algorithms [41 11. A block formulation involving a filter with fixed coefficients during N samples ( N is the block size) allows various techniques (FFI', fast FIR) to be applied in the frequency domain for reducing the arithmetic complexity. In early versions, the size of the block was equal to the number of filter tap-weights. The associated processing delay, equal to the block size, appeared to be prohibitive in applications where long impulse responses have to be processed. One method for reducing the inpudoutput delay is to segment into small blocks the impulse response to be identified. This idea has given rise to several versions of the Multidelay FrequencyDomain Filtering (MDF) algorithms [ 121. The GMDFa algorithm [13-151 shares the same basis as most block frequency-domain procedures. The main difference lies in the introduction of a new parameter, a , which controls the amount of overlapping between the successive input and output blocks. This is achieved by using a specific extension of the block OLS (OverLap Save) technique, the WOLA blockconvolution method, presented in [ 1,2]. Obviously, the filter is adapted a times per block, a being the overlapping factor. This oversampling implies an arithmetic complexity incrementation, but allows a fast convergence rate and faster tracking of the variation of the echo path to be identified (Figure 2). input sppech signal error output signal Fig 2.a) LMS algorithm: L=512 Fig 2.b) GMDF algorithm: L412, K=2, a=4 L being the filter length, K tne block number (K=L/N). 3195 0-7803-2431 45/95 $4.00	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;block size (cryptography);coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;display resolution;echo (command);echo suppression and cancellation;finite impulse response;foreign function interface;input/output;least mean squares filter;loudspeaker;microphone;ordinary least squares;overlap–save method;oversampling;processing delay;rate of convergence;real-time clock;real-time computing;sampling (signal processing);strongly correlated material;very-large-scale integration;websphere optimized local adapters	Amer El Helwani;Patrice Le Scan	1995		10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479564	adaptive filter;computer vision;real-time computing;computer science;control theory;frequency domain	ML	60.43277990002752	18.184439356399224	11663
23071b499008cb3819e26b2bd2913f662e3b816e	equivalence between minimal time and minimal norm control problems for the heat equation		This paper presents the equivalence between minimal time and minimal norm control problems for internally controlled heat equations. The target is an arbitrarily fixed bounded, closed and convex set with a nonempty interior in the state space. This study differs from [G. Wang and E. Zuazua, \textit{On the equivalence of minimal time and minimal norm controls for internally controlled heat equations}, SIAM J. Control Optim., 50 (2012), pp. 2938-2958] where the target set is the origin in the state space. When the target set is the origin or a ball, centered at the origin, the minimal norm and the minimal time functions are continuous and strictly decreasing, and they are inverses of each other. However, when the target is located in other place of the state space, the minimal norm function may be no longer monotonous and the range of the minimal time function may not be connected. These cause the main difficulty in our study. We overcome this difficulty by borrowing some idea from the classical raising sun lemma (see, for instance, Lemma 3.5 and Figure 5 on Pages 121-122 in [E. M. Stein and R. Shakarchi, \textit{Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces}, Princeton University Press, 2005]).	turing completeness	Shulin Qin;Gengsheng Wang	2018	SIAM J.

Two-dimensional version of these equations is transformed to the form of one dynamic equation for the stream function. This equation contains arbitrary function which is determined by inflow conditions given on the boundary. To determine unique solution, velocity and vorticity (but not only velocity itself) must be given on the boundary. This unexpected circumstance may be interpreted in the sense that the fluid has more degrees of freedom than it was believed. Besides, the vorticity is a less observable quantity as compared with the velocity. It is shown that the Clebsch potentials are used essentially at the description of vortical flow.	boundary case;nonlinear system;observable variable;time-scale calculus;turbulence;velocity (software development);vortex	Yuri A.

The steps of this process include image acquisition, image processing (noise reduction, smoothing, and segmentation); setting up the numerical experiment (object size and resolution as well as the boundary conditions); and numerically solving the field equations. Finally, we need to interpret the solution thus obtained in terms of the desired macroscopic properties. For each of these DRP steps, there is more than one method and implementation. Our goal is to explore and record the variability of the computed effective properties as a function of using different tools and workflows. Such benchmarking is the topic of the two present companion papers. Here, in the first part, we introduce four 3D microstructures, a segmented Fontainebleau sandstone sample (porosity 0.147), a gray-scale Berea sample; a gray-scale Grosmont carbonate sample; and a numerically constructed pack of solid spheres (porosity 0.343). Segmentation of the gray-scale images by three independent teams reveals the uncertainty of this process: the segmented porosity range is between 0.184 and 0.209 for Berea and between 0.195 and 0.271 for the carbonate. The implications of the uncertainty associated with image segmentation are explored in a second paper.	benchmark (computing)	Heiko Andrä;Nicolas Combaret;Jack Dvorkin;Erik Glatt;Junehee Han;Matthias Kabel;Youngseuk Keehm;Fabian Krzikalla;Minhui Lee;Claudio Madonna;Mike Marsh;Tapan Mukerji;Erik H.

The present note extends the analysis of this behavior to cover double SIB points, for which two eigenvalues diverge. The key assumption supporting this phenomenon is that the Kronecker index jumps by two at the singularity. In this situation, double SIB points are shown to undergo generically a transition from a spiral to a saddle in the linearized problem, after restricting the analysis to the corresponding invariant subspace. Typical examples arise in the context of nonlinear RLC circuits. The setting for the study is that of semi-explicit DAEs in Hessenberg form with arbitrary index.	linear algebra	Ricardo Riaza	2003	IEEE Trans. Automat.

To this end, a lower iteration bound is derived such that for all parameters from a compact set a solution with a specified level of suboptimality will be obtained. For its practical importance, the derivation of the smallest lower iteration bound is considered. In order to determine it, we investigate both the computation of the worst case minimal Euclidean distance between an initial iterate and a Lagrange multiplier and the issue of finding the largest step size for the fast gradient method. In addition, we argue that optimal preconditioning of the dual problem cannot be proven to decrease the smallest lower iteration bound. The findings of this paper are of importance in embedded optimization, for instance, in model predictive control.	best, worst and average case;computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;duality (optimization);embedded system;euclidean distance;gradient method;iteration;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;preconditioner	Stefan Richter;Colin Neil Jones;Manfred Morari	2013	Math.

A general solution along these lines would be tremendously useful, although it does not appear to be feasible at present, except for rather low McMillan degrees. We demonstrate that it can be feasible for specific examples; in such cases global optima can be found reliably.

When one or more phases reach the voltage and/or current limits, the controller optimally reshapes the stator currents of the remaining phases for continuing accurate torque production. This allows the motor to operate above the rated speed and torque that would be achieved without current reshaping. In the event that an open-circuit or short-circuit of a winding occurs, the torque controller can also isolate the faulty phase in order to generate torque as requested given the voltage and current constraints of the healthy phases. Assuming the inductance of stator coils is negligible allows the description of the phase voltage and current limit requirements by a set of inequity constraints. It follows by the derivation of a closed-form solution for the optimal phase currents at given angular position, velocity, and desired torque-rendering the control algorithm suitable for real-time implementation. Experimental results illustrate the capability of the controller to achieve precise torque production during voltage/current saturation of the motor's drivers or a phase failure.	servo	Farhad Aghili	2013	IEEE Trans.

Both charging and discharging process have been considered. In particular, in the charging process, the droop coefficient is set to be proportional to SoCn, and in the discharging process, the droop coefficient is set to be inversely proportional to SoCn. Since the injected/output power is in inverse-proportion to the droop coefficient, with the proposed method, the energy storage unit (ESU) with higher SoC absorbs less power in the charging process and delivers more power in the discharging process. Meanwhile, the ESU with lower SoC absorbs more power in the charging process and delivers less power in the discharging process. Eventually, the SoC and injected/output power in each ESU are equalized. The exponent n for SoC is employed to regulate the balancing speed of the SoC and injected/output power. It is demonstrated that with higher exponent n, the balancing speed is higher. Simulation model comprised of three ESUs is implemented by using MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed method is verified by the simulation results.	autonomous robot;coefficient;matlab;microgrid;simulation;simulink;state of charge	Xiaonan Lu;Kai Sun;Josep M. Guerrero;Juan. C.

Unlike two-phase methods that combine a first-order active set identification step and a subspace phase consisting of a cycle of conjugate gradient iterations, the method presented here has the flexibility of computing one of three possible steps at each iteration: a relaxation step (that releases variables from the active set), a subspace minimization step based on the conjugate gradient iteration, and an active-set refinement step. The choice of step depends on the relative magnitudes of the components of the minimum norm subgradient. The paper establishes global rates of convergence, as well as work complexity estimates. Numerical results illustrating the behavior of the methods on four test sets are presented.	active set method;algorithm;conjugate gradient method;first-order predicate;iteration;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;numerical method;refinement (computing);subderivative;subgradient method;test set;two-phase locking	Stefan Solntsev;Jorge Nocedal;Richard H.

The Flux–Charge Analysis Method is based on Kirchhoff Flux and Charge Laws and constitutive relations of circuit elements in terms of incremental fluxes and incremental charges. The straightforward application of the method has previously provided a full portrait of the nonlinear dynamics and bifurcations of the simplest memristor circuit composed by a capacitor and a flux-controlled memristor. This paper aims to show that the method is effective to analyze nonlinear dynamics and bifurcations in memristor circuits with more complex dynamics including Hopf bifurcations (originating persistent oscillations) and period–doubling cascades (leading to chaotic behavior). One key feature of the method is that it makes clear how initial conditions give rise to bifurcations for an otherwise fixed set of circuit parameters. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, these represent the first results that relate such bifurcations, which are referred to in the paper as Bifurcations without Parameters, with physical circuit variables as the initial conditions of dynamic circuit elements.	bifurcation theory;chaos theory;complex dynamics;initial condition;kirchhoff's theorem;memristor;nonlinear system;period-doubling bifurcation	Fernando Corinto;Mauro Forti	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2016.2642112	equivalent circuit;control engineering;electronic engineering;memristor;capacitor;computer science;control theory;oscillation;inductor;quantum mechanics	EDA	67.76324119860948	45.17033537539585	12140

The method is based on the coupling of an effective Darcy equation on a macroscopic mesh, with unknown permeabilities recovered from micro finite element calculations for Stokes problems on sampling domains centered at quadrature points in each macro element. The numerical method accounts for non-periodic microscopic geometry that can be obtained from a smooth deformation of a reference pore sampling domain. The computational work is nevertheless independent of the smallness of the pore structure. A priori error estimates reveal that the overall accuracy of the numerical scheme is limited by the regularity of the solutions of the Stokes micro problems. This regularity is low for a typical situation of non-convex microscopic pore geometries. We therefore propose an adaptive scheme with micro-macro mesh refinement driven by residual-based indicators that quantify both the macro and micro errors. A posteriori error analysis is derived for the new method. Two and three dimensional numerical experiments confirm the robustness and the accuracy of the adaptive method.	adaptive mesh refinement;error analysis (mathematics);experiment;finite element method;navier–stokes equations;numerical method;refinement (computing);sampling (signal processing)	Assyr Abdulle;Ondrej Budác	2015	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/130950136	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;darcy–weisbach equation;extended finite element method;calculus;mathematics;mixed finite element method;stokes flow;physics	HPC	92.43497573536042	10.680309212578505	12149

The main advantage of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter is that it can provide a much better performance than the finite impulse response (FIR) filter having the same number of coefficients. However, they might have a multimodal error surface. Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is a new heuristic approach mainly having three advantages; finding the true global minimum of a multimodal search space regardless of the initial parameter values, fast convergence, and using a few control parameters. In this work, DE algorithm has been applied to the design of digital IIR filters and its performance has been compared to that of a genetic algorithm.	coefficient;computation;differential evolution;digital filter;digital signal processing;filter design;finite impulse response;genetic algorithm;heuristic;infinite impulse response;maxima and minima;multimodal interaction;simulation;software release life cycle;system identification;time complexity	Nurhan Karaboga	2005	EURASIP J.

The library allows compact and intuitive implementation of lengthy manipulation of Bernstein-form polynomials, which often arise in computer graphics and computer-aided design and manufacturing applications. A series of empirical tests indicates that the library functions are typically very accurate and reliable, even for polynomials of surprisingly high degree.	algorithm;bernstein polynomial;c++;computer graphics;computer-aided design;library (computing);numerical analysis;operator overloading;phil bernstein;subdivision surface	Yi-Feng Tsai;Rida T.

Analysis of results of numerical experiments demonstrates that besides clearly visible solitons, which interact with each other, there exist also solitons that either are visible only for a short time due to the fluctuation of the reference level or can be detected only by their influence on other solitons, i.e., by specific changes in the amplitude curves and in the soliton trajectories. Recently I. Christov demonstrated that for integrable PDEs, like the KdV equation, one can apply the periodic inverse scattering transform (PIST) and distinguish """"true"""" soliton modes and modes that fall """"in-between"""" solitons and radiation. However, in nonintegrable cases one cannot apply the PIST and therefore distinction between """"true"""" solitons and nonlinear waves that have solitonic behavior seems to be complicated or even impossible.

However, the growing requirements by grid codes may impose high stress and even give reliability problem to this converter topology. This paper investigates the loss and thermal performances of a 10 MW 3L-NPC wind power inverter undergoing Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) operation. A series of new space vector modulation methods are then proposed to relocate the thermal loading among the power switching devices. It is concluded that, with the proposed modulation methods, the thermal distribution in the 3L-NPC wind power inverter undergoing LVRT becomes more equal, and the junction temperature of the most stressed devices can be also relieved. Also the control ability of DC-bus neutral point potential, which is one of the crucial considerations for the 3L-NPC converter, is not compromised by the proposed modulation methods.

Battery voltage is measured when battery is discharged by a high discharge current, to estimate harvested solar energy. Operating frequency and supply voltage of digital circuits and bias currents of analog circuits are reconfigured dynamically, based on measured battery voltage to optimize power-performance of the microsystem.

We use classical frequency domain analysis techniques to characterize the harmonic content of FR signals and to analyze the impact of such harmonics on the response of dynamical systems. The analysis reveals that systems with slow dynamics, as those found in large industrial facilities, are suitable to provide FR capacity because they can naturally damp the dominant high-frequency harmonic content of FR signals. We also propose optimization formulations to quantify the maximum amount of FR capacity that can be provided by a system given its dynamic characteristics, its control architecture. A distillation case study demonstrates that significant economic potential exists for large industrial facilities.		Alexander W. Dowling;Victor M.

To this end, we describe the design of a circuit to efficiently harvest energy from the standard audio jack of a mobile phone to power mHealth peripherals, lowering cost, reducing size, and improving the practicality of portable medical devices. This design not only obviates the need to charge or change an extra battery but also is universally compatible with all phones. The audio output channels of several popular phones were characterized in order to determine the range of design parameters. Using these data, different power harvesting topologies are presented, simulated, and compared. A PCB implementation was used to measure and confirm the performance. Compared with prior art, which have achieved 21% and 47% efficiency, this design is able to achieve greater than 77% efficiency by using a tunable impedance matching network.	impedance matching;mhealth;mobile phone;peripheral;phone connector (audio);printed circuit board	Chengyang Yao;Alexander C.

a5b4ec0fda503273e9c3572b2677a45cf3d8b5e8	carrier based modulation technique for space vector pwm of dodecagonal voltage sv structures		Dodecagonal (12-sided polygon) voltage space vector structures have advantages like extension of linear modulation range, elimination of fifth and seventh harmonics in phase voltages and currents for the full modulation range including extreme 12-step operation, reduced device voltage ratings, lower switching frequency requirement — making it more suitable for high power drive applications. A simple carrier based modulation method is proposed to obtain space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) switching patterns for a dodecagonal voltage space vector (SV) structure using only sampled reference voltages in this paper. The algorithm outputs the sector information and the SVPWM compare values which can be set as the references for any PWM module to obtain SVPWM switching sequences. The proposed method eliminates the need for partitioning and recombination of the computed timing values, angle estimation and computation of modulation index which in common in conventional SVPWM modulation technique. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method.	bibliographic reference;clock rate;closed-loop transfer function;computation (action);data table;disease vectors;excretory function;flatulence;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;in-phase and quadrature components;intrinsic drive;inverter device component;iteration;iterative method;lookup table;normal range;pokeweed mitogens;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;sampling - surgical action;simulation;systemverilog;time complexity;variable-frequency drive;verification of theories;voltage reference;algorithm;sievert;width	R.

ebb5a52e7fa5b3904ea24b220c9f17d43a12fd3f	stepper motor spwm subdivision control circuit design based on fpga		The stepper motor is a kind of angle tracking component with its own inherent characteristics such as low cost, simple structure and the open loop system, so it is widely applied due to these advantages. However, the stepper motor also has many disadvantages. For example, the resolution is so low that oscillation occurs in the low frequency, while the loss of the step occurs in the high frequency, so its application is limited in some systems requiring high accuracy and stability. The study aims to introduce the design of the stepper motor subdivision controlling circuit based on a combination of field-programmable gate array (FPGA), electronics design automation (EDA), and hardware description language (HDL). The stepper motor subdivision circuit with reference to the sinusoidal wave is designed to realize a kind of sine pulse width modulation (SPWM) subdivision driving technology that can control the motor winding current waveform more effectively, and to realize the step angle uniform subdivision and improve the motor resolution. Designing and stimulating each functional module, and testing the system by using the developing board of FPGA, we make the subdivided stepper motor can work precisely and stably so as to achieve the expected design purpose. Because of using FPGA, this design is highly valuable in its application with its simple peripheral hardware circuit, the shortened design cycle, as well as no D/A converter which improves the anti-interference.	circuit design;field-programmable gate array;subdivision surface	Hong-Bin Wang;Zhe Zhang;Xuhui Chen;Yuan-bin Wang	2017		10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960118	field-programmable gate array;electronic engineering;switched reluctance motor;open-loop controller;electronic design automation;hardware description language;stepper;circuit design;computer science;pulse-width modulation	EDA	69.31238679441451	41.18403829904407	12348

The method is shown to be easy to implement in parallel and distributed computing environments. The advantages of parallel computations are significant even in computer systems with low numbers of processing units, making it computationally efficient in a variety of settings. The non-iterative method is feasible for any sparse spatial weights matrix since the computations involved impose modest memory requirements for storing intermediate results. The method has a linear computational complexity for datasets with a finite Hausdorff dimension. It is shown that most geo-spatial data satisfy this requirement. Asymptotic properties of the method are illustrated using simulated data, and the method is deployed for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates for the spatial autoregressive model using data for the US economy.	jacobian matrix and determinant	Oleg A.

The number and stability of these solutions can change via different bifurcations: saddle-node, Hopf and transverse instability bifurcations. Conditions for these bifurcations can be determined from the linearization of the reaction-diffusion system. If an eigenvalue (or a pair) of the linearized system has zero real part, then a bifurcation occurs. Discretizing the linear system we obtain a matrix eigenvalue problem. It is known that its eigenvalues tend to the eigenvalues of the original system as the discretization step size goes to zero. Thus to obtain bifurcation curves we have to study the spectra of large matrices. The general bifurcation conditions for the matrices will be derived. These results will be applied to a reaction-diffusion system describing flame propagation.		Peter L.

In this model, it is assumed that phytoplankton releases toxic chemical for self defense against their predators. The model system is studied analytically and the threshold values for the existence and stability of various steady states are worked out. It is observed that if the maximal zooplankton conversion rate crosses a certain critical value, the system enters into Hopf bifurcation. Finally it is observed that to control the planktonic bloom and to maintain stability around the coexistence equilibrium we have to control the nutrient input rate specially caused by artificial eutrophication. In case if it is not possible to control the nutrient input rate, one could use toxic phytoplankton to prevent the recurrence bloom.	top-down and bottom-up design	Anal Chatterjee;Samares Pal;Samrat Chatterjee	2011	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2011.08.082	top-down and bottom-up design;mathematics	Logic	78.04493304841947	5.477718264754394	12403

Like Kalman filters, the estimate of the PGF is a Gaussian distribution, but like particle filters, its measurement update works directly with the likelihood function in order to avoid the inherent linearization of the Kalman filters. However, compared to particle filters, the PGF allows for much faster state estimation and circumvents the severe problem of particle degeneracy by gradually transforming its prior Gaussian distribution into a posterior one. In this paper, we further enhance the estimation quality and runtime of the PGF by proposing a semi-analytic measurement update applicable to likelihood functions that only depend on a subspace of the system state. In fact, the proposed semi-analytic measurement update is not limited to the PGF and can be used by any nonlinear state estimator as long as its state estimate is Gaussian, e.g., the Gaussian particle filter.

f38ac9a227a05dfcb5a3d07c952974b87f8fe235	on a conjugate directions method for solving strictly convex qp problem		Problem of solving the strictly convex, quadratic programming problem is studied. The idea of conjugate directions is used. First we assume that we know the set of directions conjugate with respect to the hessian of the goal function. We apply n simultaneous directional minimizations along these conjugate directions starting from the same point followed by the addition of the directional corrections. Theorem justifying that the algorithm finds the global minimum of the quadratic goal function is proved. The way of effective construction of the required set of conjugate directions is presented. We start with a vector with zero value entries except the first one. At each step new vector conjugate to the previously generated is constructed whose number of nonzero entries is larger by one than in its predecessor. Conjugate directions obtained by means of the above construction procedure with appropriately selected parameters form an upper triangular matrix which in exact computations is the Cholesky factor of the inverse of the hessian matrix. Computational cost of calculating the inverse factorization is comparable with the cost of the Cholesky factorization of the original second derivative matrix. Calculation of those vectors involves exclusively matrix/vector multiplication and finding an inverse of a diagonal matrix. Some preliminary computational results on some test problems are reported. In the test problems all symmetric, positive definite matrices with dimensions from (14times 14) to (2000times 2000) from the repository of the Florida University were used as the hessians.	convex function;problem solving	Andrzej Stachurski	2017	Math.

Presently, an active area of research on SAT problem is to design efficient algorithms to find a solution for a satisfiable conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula. A new formulation, the universal SAT problem model, which transforms the SAT problem on Boolean space into an optimization problem on real space has been developed (J. Gu, 1988; 1992; 1994). Many optimization techniques, such as the steepest descent method, Newton's method, and the coordinate descent method, can be used to solve the universal SAT problem. We prove that when the initial solution is sufficiently close to the optimal solution, the steepest descent method has a linear convergence ratio /spl beta/<1, Newton's method has a convergence ratio of order two, and the convergence ratio of the steepest descent method is approximately (1-/spl beta//m) for the universal SAT problem with m variables. An algorithm based on the coordinate descent method for the universal SAT problem is also presented. Experimental results show that this algorithm is more efficient than some previous ones in finding a solution for certain classes of the satisfiable CNF formulas.	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem	Jun Gu;Qian-Ping Gu;Dingzhu Du	1996	IEEE Trans.

bc208a8edaa08c728f092e21cd6cdb478da655c4	hybrid newmark-conformal fdtd modeling of thin spoof plasmonic metamaterials		Abstract The aim of this paper is to present a new efficient and accurate semi-implicit finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for modeling thin plasmonic metamaterials supporting spoof surface plasmons. The presented method is formulated by combining Yu–Mittrau0027s conformal FDTD technique for dielectrics, the simplified conformal finite integration technique for perfectly electric conductors (PECs) and the Newmark-Beta method. The resultant scheme is magnetically implicit, has a more relaxed stability condition than that of Yeeu0027s FDTD scheme, and allows for accurate modeling of both PEC and dielectric curved surfaces. Energy conservation and stability of the presented scheme is theoretically proved with the energy inequality method. Its formulation can be generalized to a class of magnetically implicit FDTD schemes with weakly conditional and unconditional stability in a unified manner. The presented scheme is used to simulate thin structures supporting spoof surface plasmon polaritons and spoof localized surface plasmons, and also applied to recent plasmonic devices such as planar frequency splitter, ultrathin rainbow trapping device and compact planar metadisk with split-ring resonators. The accuracy and efficiency of the presented scheme are assessed in comparison with the conventional explicit and implicit FDTD methods, and their conformal variants.		Kazuhiro Fujita	2019	J. Comput.

Therefore, the authors introduce it to predict the variation trend of instantaneous phase and unwrap phases efficiently. Even though with that being the case, errors still exist in phase unwrapping process because of its ambiguous phase characteristic. Furthermore, a SVR-based frequency estimation algorithm is proposed and makes it immune to these error phases by means of setting the SVR's parameters properly. The results show that, compared with other phased-based algorithms, not only does the proposed one maintain a wide estimation range and quality capabilities at low frequencies, but also improves accuracy at high frequencies and decreases the impact with the initial phase. The proposed algorithm is fit for not only linear phase signal but also polynomial phase signal, under both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian condition.	algorithm;instantaneous phase;spectral density estimation;support vector machine	Xueqian Liu;Hongyi Yu	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.0589	instantaneous phase;linear phase;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	EDA	57.61478229563056	11.567023020270545	12701

It is shown that FBB boosts the output resistance of a transistor such that the intrinsic gain reduction due to low-supply voltages can be compensated. This technique is then used to implement a low-noise amplifier (LNA) tailored for ultra-low power (ULP) and ULV applications. The proposed LNA uses common-gate (CG) NMOS transistors as input devices in a complementary current-reuse structure. Low-power input matching is achieved by employing an active shunt-feedback architecture while the current of the feedback stage is also reused by the input transistor. Moreover, a separate FBB scheme is exploited to tune the feedback coefficient. An inductive   $g_m$  -boosting technique is used to increase the bandwidth of the LNA without additional power consumption. The proposed LNA is implemented in an IBM   $0.13\ \upmu \text{m}$   1P8M CMOS technology and occupies   $0.39\ \text{mm}^2$  . The measured LNA has a 14 dB gain, 4 dB minimum noise figure, IIP3 of   $-10\ \text{dBm}$  , and 0.6–4.2 GHz bandwidth, while consuming only   $500\ \upmu$  A from a 0.5 V supply. The LNA operates with supplies as low as 0.4 V while maintaining good performance.	biasing;cmos;conductance (graph);low-noise amplifier	Mahdi Parvizi;Karim Allidina;Mourad N. El-Gamal	2016	J.

The Orthonormal Kernel Kronecker Product Graph Matching (OKKPGM) algorithm is based on the recently introduced Kronecker Product Graph Matching (KPGM) formulation. However, unlike previous algorithms based on the KPGM formulation which avoided explicit compatibility calculations, the OKKPGM algorithm obtains an estimate to the Kronecker Match Matrix (KMM) using kernel function evaluations. A permutation sub-matrix (match matrix), is then inferred from the KMM using a summation procedure.	kernel (operating system);matching (graph theory)	Barend J. van Wyk;Michaël A. van Wyk	2003		10.1007/3-540-45028-9_10	kernel;matrix function;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;summation;graph product;permutation matrix;mathematics;kronecker product;compatibility;matching;algebra	ML	57.66345406959842	24.48776788800656	12793
729fa721db48e39c175c0a6850ba0f2fb69e7e3d	scalable spatial notch suppression in spatio-spectral-filtering mimo receiver arrays for digital beamforming	baseband;impedance;antenna arrays;array signal processing;receivers;radio frequency;mimo	Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output(MIMO) technology is drawing significant interest for the next-generation wireless networks. Traditional MIMO receiver architectures use multiple parallel receiver front ends with digitization at every element to support digital space-time array processing. The absence of analog/RF spatial interference mitigation in traditional digital MIMO receiver arrays results in a high dynamic-range requirement, and consequently, power-hungry analog and RF receiver front ends and analog-to-digital converters. This paper presents a scalable 65 nm CMOS 0.1-1.7 GHz spatio-spectral-filtering four-element MIMO receiver array with spatial notch suppression that protects the analog/RF circuits and analog-to-digital converters from spatial interference early in the signal chain. The combination of spatial and spectral filtering results in more than 19 dB rejection irrespective of the frequency at which the spatial blocker is located. The proposed spatial notch suppression technique improves the measured in-band OIP3 from -10 to +24 dBV, and the measured out-of-band IIP3 from +11 to +18 dBm. Furthermore, turning on the spatial notch suppression leads to minimal noise figure degradation. The proposed chip architecture is scalable on board without the need for RF interconnections. A wireless imaging demo shows two of the implemented integrated circuits tiled on board to form an eight-element MIMO receiver array that is able to detect a weak desired signal in the presence of an in-band 15 dB stronger spatial blocker.	analog-to-digital converter;array processing;beamforming;cmos;clock rate;elegant degradation;incidence matrix;integrated circuit;interference (communication);mimo;noise figure;out-of-band agreement;prototype;radio frequency;rejection sampling;scalability;signal chain;software deployment;third-order intercept point;zero suppression	Linxiao Zhang;Arun Natarajan;Harish Krishnaswamy	2016	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2016.2600579	electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;low if receiver;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;rf front end;electrical impedance;baseband;radio receiver design;radio frequency;spatial multiplexing;mimo	Arch	60.834734734074345	56.935347106858146	12804

The characteristics equation of the linearized system at the zero solution is a polynomial equation involving very high-order terms. We first derive some sufficient and necessary conditions ensuring that all the characteristic roots have modulus less than 1. Hence, the zero solution of the model is asymptotically stable. Then, we study the existence of three types of bifurcations, such as fold bifurcations, flip bifurcations, and Neimark–Sacker (NS) bifurcations. Based on the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem, we discuss their bifurcation directions and the stability of bifurcated solutions. In addition, several codimension two bifurcations can be met in the system when curves of codimension one bifurcations intersect or meet tangentially. We proceed through listing smooth normal forms for all the possible codimension 2 bifurcations. r 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper derives an iterative scheme to approximate the generalised inverse which can be expressed in the form of successive squaring of a composite matrix T. Given an m by n matrix A with m~n, we show that the generalised inverse of A can be computed in parallel time ranging from O(log n) to O(log^2n), similar to previous methods. The rank of matrix A is obtained along with the generalised inverse. The successive matrix squaring algorithm is generalised to higher-order schemes, where the composite matrix is repeatedly raised to an integer power l>2. This form of expression leads to a simplified notation compared with that of earlier methods, and helps to clarify the relationship between l, the order of the iterative scheme and K, the number of iterations. In particular, the accuracy achieved in approximating A^+ is a function only of the magnitude of l^K and does not depend on the particular values chosen for l and K; we argue that there is no obvious advantage in choosing l other than 2. Our derived error bound for the approximation to A^+ is tighter than that previously established. The same bound applies to the rank. Numerical experiments with different test matrices (square, rectangular, complex, singular, etc.) illustrate the method. They further demonstrate that our tighter error bound provides a useful guide to the number of iterations required. In the examples given, the specified accuracy was achieved after the calculated number of iterations, but no earlier. Implementation studies on a general-purpose parallel machine (CM-5) demonstrated a smaller than expected penalty for direct squaring of matrix T in comparison with multiplication of its component block matrices. For special-purpose VLSI architectures, the simple structure of the matrix squaring algorithm leads to a straightforward parallel implementation with low communication overheads.	computation	Lujuan Chen;E.

It is shown that the site is fully compliant with CISPR-16-1-5 (2003-11). The site's performance, according to this standard, is determined by the difference between the measured and theoretical calculated site attenuation (SA) values. The main contributions of this paper are the assessment of the validation process and the practical implications deduced from this assessment process. The assessment validation process was performed using the following: 1) three sets of calculated theoretical SA values; 2) two measurement systems used almost simultaneously to strengthen the validation (one is based on a network analyzer, and the other is based on a spectrum analyzer); and 3) two direct-connection configurations. The similarities among the four sets of obtained results allow the deduction of the following important practical implications: 1) Measurement methods and system are validated, and we have confidence on the results from both measurement systems. 2) The direct connection at baluns is used in practice, because its effects are better canceled experimentally rather than mathematically. 3) There is a need to construct the set of dipoles of the Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM) due to bad functioning of the commercial 700-MHz dipole.	experiment;natural deduction;packet analyzer;spectrum analyzer;system of measurement	Victoria Molina-López;Mariano Botello-Pérez;Israel García-Ruiz	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2008473	spectrum;balun;dipole;electronic engineering;calibration;telecommunications;antenna measurement;engineering;electrical engineering;antenna;system of measurement;dipole antenna;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	68.03955415098949	58.03662303727236	12903

To eliminate continuous interagent communication, state estimates of neighboring agents are designed for control feedback and are updated via communication to reset growing estimate errors. The communication times are based on an event-triggered approach and are adapted based on the trade-off between the control system performance and the desire to minimize the amount of communication. An important aspect of the developed event trigger strategy is that communication is not required to determine when a state update is needed. Since the control strategy produces switched dynamics, analysis is provided to show that Zeno behavior is avoided by developing a positive constant lower bound on the minimum inter-event interval. A Lyapunov-based convergence analysis is also provided to indicate bounded convergence of the developed control methodology.	agent-based model;consensus (computer science);control system;control theory;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;network topology;scheduling (computing);time-varying network	Teng-Hu Cheng;Zhen Kan;Justin R.

The sparse nature of AER packets (also called events) allows driver/receiver bias currents to be switched off to save power. The on/off times must be lower than the bit time to minimize the latency introduced by the switching mechanism. Using this technique, the link power consumption can be scaled down with the event rate without compromising the maximum system throughput. The proposed technique has been implemented on a typical push/pull low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) circuit, but it can easily be extended to other widely used current mode standards, such as current mode logic (CML) or low-voltage positive emitter-coupled logic (LVPECL). A proof of concept prototype has been fabricated in 0.35 μm CMOS incorporating the proposed driver/receiver pair along with a previously reported switchable serializer/deserializer scheme. At a 500 Mbps bit rate, the maximum event rate is 11 Mevent/s for 32-bit events. In this situation, current consumption is 7.5 mA and 9.6 mA for the driver and receiver, respectively, while differential voltage amplitude is ±300 mV. However, if event rate is lower than 20-30 Kevent/s, current consumption has a floor of 270 μA for the driver and 570 μA for the receiver. The measured ON/OFF switching times are in the order of 1 ns. The serial link could be operated at up to 710 Mbps bit rate, resulting in a maximum 32-bit event rate of 15 Mevent/s . This is the same peak event rate as that obtained with the same SerDes circuits and a non-switched driver/receiver pair.	32-bit;bipolar transistor biasing;cmos;current source;current-mode logic;data rate units;emitter device component;emitter-coupled logic;hl7 2.5 event type;input/output;lambert's cosine law;low-voltage differential signaling;mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;neuromorphic engineering;prototype;serdes;serial communication;sparse matrix;throughput;wake-on-lan;disease transmission;standards characteristics;voltage	Carlos Zamarreño-Ramos;Teresa Serrano-Gotarredona;Bernab&#x00E9; Linares-Barranco	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2012.2186136	embedded system;communications protocol;synchronization;transmitter;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;asynchronous communication;cmos;manchester code;low-power electronics	Mobile	57.79430576837008	52.76074485868637	12923

Thus, a microstrip, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) amplifier realizable as a Microwave Integrated Circuit (MIC) is designed as a worked example using Genetic Algorithm for the maximum gain along an available wideband, simultaneously ensuring the available minimum noise and the permitted small constant mismatching at each operation frequency. Finally, the resultant amplifier's performance is verified by both the microwave circuit and 3-D full-wave EM-simulators.	genetic algorithm;input/output;low-noise amplifier;microstrip;monolithic microwave integrated circuit;requirement;resultant;simulation;thickness (graph theory);transistor;ultra-wideband	Filiz Günes;Ahmet Kenan Keskin;Salih Demirel	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband	10.1109/ICUWB.2012.6340406	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;microstrip	EDA	66.48524003810321	56.913260341747204	12925
1b84979c6e083c93e9d6b4a9468da7b7679cd5c6	two frequency-bandwidths real-time sensitive inverter-current-feedback control for lcl-type dg systems connected to weak grid		For LCL-type distributed generation (DG) systems connected to weak grid, a novel two frequency-bandwidths real-time sensitive inverter-current-feedback (TFBRTS-ICF) control method is proposed to enhance the system reliability and robustness, which mainly includes the synchronous reference frame quasi-proportional-integral (SRFQPI) control, un-attenuated inverter-current-feedback active damping (UICFAD) control, and high-sensitivity real-time PWM algorithm. The SRFQPI control can compensate reactive power, and regulate the instantaneous current without steady-state error regardless of the fundamental frequency fluctuation. The UICFAD control can suppress the LCL-resonance peak well without requiring additional sensors. The proposed PWM algorithm can solve the robust problem of the UICFAD controller against grid-impedance variation through removing the computation delay. Meanwhile, the proposed PWM algorithm can achieve a full range of duty-ratio between 0∼1 and offer half of switching period for the inverter-current sampling and the duty-ratio calculating, which is easy to implement using a digital microcontroller. Experimental results confirm the theoretical expectations and the effectiveness of the proposed method.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;computation;consent forms;controllers;discontinuous galerkin method;duty cycle;external lateral ligament;feedback;inverter device component;microcontroller;pokeweed mitogens;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;quantitative impedance;quantum fluctuation;real-time clock;reference frame (video);resonance;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;steady state;windows firewall;decigram;negative regulation of phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain;sensor (device)	Leming Zhou;An Luo;Yandong Chen;Xiaoping Zhou;Ling Yang;Wenhua Wu;Zhixing He;Zhiwei Xie;Aoyang Liu	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217386	robustness (computer science);electric power system;control theory;distributed generation;control theory;engineering;ac power;inverter;automatic frequency control;pulse-width modulation	Robotics	66.54897822804085	40.49223730254812	12926

These are uniquely defined whether the signal is represented as a pair of real-valued signals or as one analytic and one anti-analytic signal. A nonstationary but oscillatory bivariate signal has a natural representation as an ellipse whose properties evolve in time, and this representation provides a simple geometric interpretation for the bivariate instantaneous moments. The bivariate bandwidth is shown to consist of three terms measuring the degree of instability of the time-varying ellipse: amplitude modulation with fixed eccentricity, eccentricity modulation, and orientation modulation or precession. An application to the analysis of data from a free-drifting oceanographic float is presented and discussed.	analytic signal;bivariate data;distance (graph theory);instability;instantaneous phase;single-sideband modulation	Jonathan M.

With increased demand for electrical energy in world industries, the population of energy conversion devices such as generators/motors has greatly increased. As emerging and not being a mature enough technology in the application of renewable energy conversion or electric-drive transportation, the protection and diagnosis of electric motors have been extensively studied for safety and reliability. Meanwhile, motor phase currents commonly involve random noise components generated by harsh energy system environments, low- and high-order harmonics interferences caused by power inverters and fast switching devices, and various other design imperfections. Therefore, it is quite challenging to model the overall noise content and eliminate the disturbance while detecting motor fault signatures. Due to the inherent random variation of motor noise statistics, the noise model and elimination strategy should also be adaptively updated according to instantaneous noise conditions through which detection can be done with predefined performance expectation. Several successful solutions in the literature have managed to perform a diagnosis under certain noise conditions; however, a detailed performance and adaptability analysis covering arbitrary noise variation has not been satisfactorily addressed. This paper mainly deals with performance oriented threshold design strategies for fault signature detection utilizing the noise statistics of the motor phase current signal. The proposed solution is generalized to cover arbitrary Gaussian noise variations and derive the optimal form of the threshold that satisfies user's prior detection quality expectations. The mathematical derivations are proved through statistical theory and the experimental verifications are performed by using a 3-hp motor setup.	antivirus software;energy systems language;experiment;inverter (logic gate);noise (electronics);operating point;sensor;signal processing;thyristor	Seungdeog Choi;Bilal Akin;Mina M.

The HMM-based algorithm finds the most likely state evolution, given a sequence of uncertain test outcomes over time. We also present a method to estimate online the HMM parameters, namely, the state transition probabilities, the instantaneous probabilities of test outcomes given the system state and the initial state distribution, that are fundamental to HMM-based adaptive fault diagnosis. The efficacy of parameter estimation method is demonstrated by comparing the diagnostic accuracies of an algorithm with complete knowledge of HMM parameters with those of an adaptive one. In addition, the advantages of using the HMM approach over a Hamming-distance based fault diagnosis technique are quantified. Tradeoffs in computational complexity versus performance of the diagnostic algorithm are also discussed.	computational complexity theory;estimation theory;hamming distance;hidden markov model;markov chain;medical algorithm;state transition table;window function	Jie Ying;Thia Kirubarajan;Krishna R.

The complete classifications of global stability of the model are established in terms of these numbers by using the persistence theory and Lyapunov methods.

With the help of these weight functions, that play an important role in the development of higher order convergent iterative techniques, we are able to construct three-point eight-order optimal multiple-root finders. Also, numerical experiments have been applied to a number of test equations for different special schemes from this family satisfying the conditions given in the convergence analysis. We have also compared the basins of attraction of some proposed and known methods in order to check the wideness of the sets of converging initial points for each problem.	iterative method;nonlinear system;root-finding algorithm;weight function	Fiza Zafar;Alicia Cordero;Shabnam Sultana;Juan R.

beff58c3e2d134af859ff2ac14e07715ad9866ab	a fully integrated fast-response ldo voltage regulator with adaptive transient current distribution		A fully integrated low-dropout (LDO) regulator with fast transient response is proposed in this paper. The capacitor-less LDO (CL-LDO) regulator incorporates both assisted pass-transistors and control circuit to realize adaptive transient current distribution during the load current transition, thereby enhancing the transient response and minimizing the output voltage's spike. In 65-nm CMOS process, the CL-LDO regulator occupies an active area of 0.0088 mm2. It supplies an output voltage of 1.2 V, while the input supply ranges from 1.5 V to 2.5 V. Subjected to a 100 µA ± 10 mA step change of load current with 1-µs rise time and fall time, the regulator can settle the output to a stable voltage within 1.1 µs and the output voltage's spike is reduced to less than ± 20 mV. The line regulation and load regulation of this regulator are 0.52 mV/V and 0.01 mV/mA, respectively.	cmos;dropout (neural networks);fall time;line regulation;load regulation;low-dropout regulator;mv-algebra;ripple effect;rise time;semiconductor device fabrication;settling time;transistor;voltage regulator	Xingyuan Tong;Kangkang Wei	2017	2017 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2017.93	voltage regulator;low-dropout regulator;dropout voltage;rise time;line regulation;load regulation;regulator;transient response;engineering;control theory;electronic engineering	Arch	61.76796940929637	46.97135022368723	13029
4909317c14d7098edb31c2e34c2a812a39a47105	convexification of learning from constraints		Regularized empirical risk minimization with constrained labels (in contrast to fixed labels) is a remarkably general abstraction of learning. For common los s and regularization functions, this optimization problem assumes the form of a mixed integer pro gram (MIP) whose objective function is non-convex. In this form, the problem is resistant to standard optimization techniques. We construct MIPs with the same solutions whose objective func tio s are convex. Specifically, we characterize the tightest convex extension of the objectiv function, given by the Legendre-Fenchel biconjugate. Computing values of this tightest convex exte nsion is NP-hard. However, by applying our characterization to every function in an additive decom p sition of the objective function, we obtain a class of looser convex extensions that can be computed efficiently. For some decompositions, common loss and regularization functions, we derive a close d form.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;convex conjugate;convex function;convex hull;empirical risk minimization;integer programming;linear programming;loose coupling;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;optimization problem;utility functions on indivisible goods	Iaroslav Shcherbatyi;Bjoern Andres	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45886-1_7	convex analysis;subderivative;support function;mathematical optimization;proximal gradient methods for learning;combinatorics;convex optimization;linear matrix inequality;machine learning;mathematics;logarithmically convex function;proper convex function	ML	69.99694034207504	23.079434062205255	13033

An efficient domain for quantization and coding of this linear predictor is the line spectral frequency representation, where the predictor is encoded into an ordered set of frequencies that correspond to the roots of the corresponding line spectral polynomials. While this representation is robust in terms of quantization, methods available for finding the line spectral frequencies are computationally complex. In this work, we present a method for finding these frequencies using the FFT, including methods for limiting numerical range in fixed-point implementations. Our experiments show that, in comparison to a zero-crossing search in the Chebyshev domain, the proposed method reduces complexity and improves robustness, while retaining accuracy.	codec;experiment;fast fourier transform;kerrison predictor;line spectral pairs;numerical analysis;polynomial;quantization (signal processing);speech coding;zero crossing	Tomas Bäckström;Christian Fischer Pedersen;Johannes Fischer;Grzegorz Pietrzyk	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178947	linear predictive coding;speech recognition;computer science;speech;theoretical computer science;speech coding;line spectral pairs;mathematics;accuracy and precision;predictive modelling;statistics;polynomial;approximation theory	Robotics	56.60693079381387	15.308311590059414	13143

The number of equations needed is reduced from eight in the unnormalized case to just five. The complexity of the equations increases but the procedure is justified because it seems to lead to a more convenient hardware realization. Moreover, this realization would be completely similar (for the backward and forward residuals lines) to the CORDIC processors implementation already proposed for the feedlorward ladder algorithms (FFLA). A possible disadvantage is that three of the variables used may have magnitudes greater than one. However the essential feature of the FBLA, that of being able to read out directly the estimated coefficients of the -monic-polynomial model is not modified.	algorithm;cordic;central processing unit;coefficient;monic polynomial;moving-average model	Carlos Horacio Muravchik;Martin Morf	1984	ICASSP '84.

This gap results in market inefficiencies introduced by corrections to the market solution to accommodate stability requirements. In this paper we present an optimal power flow formulation that aims to close this gap. First, we show that the pseudospectral abscissa can be used as a unifying stability measure to characterize both poorly damped oscillations and voltage stability margins. This leads to two novel optimization problems that can find operation points which minimize oscillations or maximize voltage stability margins, and make apparent the implicit tradeoff between these two stability requirements. Finally, we combine these optimization problems to generate a dynamics-aware optimal power flow formulation that provides voltage as well as small signal stability guarantees.	bibo stability;coupling (computer programming);dynamic dispatch;game controller;h2 database engine;mathematical optimization;operating point;requirement;robustness (computer science);small-signal model;test case	Enrique Mallada;Ao Tang	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760118	damping;control engineering;mathematical optimization;power-flow study;voltage regulator;engineering;control theory;voltage optimisation;voltage regulation	Embedded	64.55451322212116	35.44466323303893	13154

When modelling two-dimensional PhCs two generalised eigenvalue problems are formed, one for the transverse-electric (TE) mode and the other for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode. Conventionally, the Band Diagrams for twodimensional PhCs are calculated by either the plane wave expansion method (PWEM) or the finite element method (FEM). Here, the eigenvalue equations for the two-dimensional PhCs are solved using RBFs based meshless methods. For the TM mode a meshless local strong form method (RBF collocation) is used, while for the tricker TE mode a meshless local weak form method (RBF Galerkin) is used (so that the discontinuity of the dielectric function ðxÞ can naturally be modelled). The results obtained from the meshless methods are found to be in good agreement with the standard PWEM. Thus, the meshless methods are proved to be a promising scheme for predicting photonic band gaps. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Several methods including the D’Alembert solution, the diamond rule, the Laplace transform and the convolution integral, are employed in the Mathematica animation. All the analytical derivations were carried out by using the symbolic software. Several examples, including an infinite string with a spring, mass and damper as well as a semi-infinite string, two-media string, string and beam subject to support motions, were demonstrated to show the validity of the present formulation. Parameter study of impedance ratio and mass, spring, and dashpot was also examined to see the transmission and reflection coefficient. 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effects of shading can be mitigated via the use of bypass diodes across the shaded cells. The impact of using bypass diodes on the solar cell performance under shading has been studied at a module level using MATLAB. Algorithms have been designed to study the effects of non-overlapping bypass diode configuration in a randomly shaded solar module and results have been compared with modules devoid of bypass diodes. I-V and P-V curves have been plotted and maximum peak power is tracked for severe to intermediate levels of shading patterns.	algorithm;diode;matlab;randomness;shading;solar cell	Srinivasa Vemuru;Priyanka Singh;Mohammed Y.

In practice, the commonly used Smagorinsky model ($\tau=(c_s\delta)^2\|\nabla^s\bm{u}\|_F\,\nabla^s\bm{u}$) is overly dissipative and yields unphysical results. To date, several methods for “clipping” the Smagorinsky viscosity have proven useful in improving the physical characteristics of the simulated flow. However, such heuristic strategies strongly rely upon a priori knowledge of the flow regime. The bounded artificial viscosity model relies on a highly nonlinear, but monotone and smooth, semilinear elliptic form for the artificial viscosity. For this model, we have introduced a variational computational strategy, provided finite element error convergence estimates, and included several computational examples indicating its improvement on the overly diffusive Smagorinsky model.	large eddy simulation;numerical diffusion	Jeff Borggaard;Traian Iliescu;John Paul Roop	2008	SIAM J.

In contrast to classical stochastical approaches to handle these uncertainties, guaranteed approaches represent an emerging alternative. They allow on the one hand a direct application of the usually given error bounds of measurements and on the other hand a provision of guarantees regarding a model's output. One interesting application area of such methods are safety-critical systems such as electrical traction drives. In this paper, a new methodology to model a voltage source inverter considering unknown but bounded measurement uncertainties during the identification and the operation is presented. The provision of output intervals including the real output voltages is proven by simulations and experiments.	experiment;numerical linear algebra;power inverter;real-time clock;real-time computing;semiconductor;simulation;traction teampage;voltage source	Stefan Krebs;Lukas Kohrer;Sören Hohmann	2016	2016 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)	10.1109/ICCAIS.2016.7822445	control engineering;electronic engineering;semiconductor device modeling;network switch;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics;measurement uncertainty	EDA	67.19052704261212	34.84852155553671	13405

In DSP-FF, the signal and error cancellation circuits are implemented, partially, in the DSP regime. By doing so, the number of bulky radio frequency (RF) components is reduced and their functionality is replaced by more flexible DSP circuitry and also various implementation nonidealities can be efficiently controlled. A two-stage estimation approach stemming from least-squares model fitting is proposed to identify proper DSP-FF coefficients. This improves the linearization performance by decoupling the effects of estimation inaccuracies between the two DSP-FF circuits. Furthermore, a comprehensive performance analysis of DSP-FF is carried out, taking also the memory of the core power amplifier into account. In particular, a closed-form expression for the intermodulation distortion reduction is derived in terms of the errors in the circuit coefficients. Also the measurement noise effects and large sample properties of the estimators are analyzed. The outcomes of computer simulated experiments verify the analytical results which are presented in this paper. Moreover, laboratory measurement setup utilizing a highly nonlinear RF power amplifier and contemporary telecommunication waveform demonstrates the linearization capability of the DSP-FF in terms of improvement in the measured adjacent channel leakage ratio.	algorithm;audio power amplifier;behavioral modeling;coefficient;computer simulation;coupling (computer programming);curve fitting;digital signal processing;digital signal processor;distortion;electronic circuit;error floor;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;intermodulation;least squares;linearizer;nonlinear system;performance per watt;prototype;rf power amplifier;radio frequency;real-time transcription;sc (complexity);spectral leakage;stemming;usc interactive media & games division;waveform	Ali Shahed hagh ghadam;Sascha Burglechner;Ahmet Hasim Gokceoglu;Mikko Valkama;Andreas Springer	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163890	computer simulation;control engineering;linear amplifier;feedforward neural network;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;least squares;direct-coupled amplifier;rf power amplifier;intermodulation	EDA	59.29611915533073	58.628623482379595	13409

These applications are typically characterized by their strict requirement for coordination between the individual UUVs. The proposed method is based on the assumption that the shared mission objectives and the associate constraints can be stated in terms of a mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem and known by all UUVs. Thus on the outset, the method considered in this paper is similar to a centralized approach but solved in a decentralized manner: the problem is decomposed into smaller sub-problems and solved in a parallel using a distributed Nashbased game approach. Sufficient conditions for numerical convergence of the method together with performance results are also presented. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the main features of the proposed method.

This paper specializes the alternating step method to generalized network problems with positive semi-definite quadratic arc costs, and describes its implementation on a massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine CM-2. Extensive computational tests reveal that while the method is disappointingly slow for most problems with purely linear cost functions, it is competitive with dual relaxation methods on many problems having positive definite objectives. Furthermore, the algorithm continues to perform well even if a minority of arcs are given purely linear costs.

With the Chapman-Enskog expansion, the governing evolution equation is recovered correctly from the continuous Boltzmann equation. Some problems, which have exact solutions, are validated by the present model. From the simulations, we find that the numerical results agree well with the exact solutions or better than the numerical solutions reported in previous studies. The study indicates that the present method is very effective and accurate. The present model can be used to solve more other nonlinear wave problems.	lattice boltzmann methods;numerical method	Huilin Lai;Changfeng Ma	2012	J. Sci.

These levels may further be potentially unknown. Multiple level set functions are used when there are more than two such levels, and we extend the methods and theory of our previous works to handle such more complex situations. A rather efficient method is developed. Several inverse potential problems in two and three space variables are solved numerically, demonstrating the method’s capabilities for both known and unknown several level values.	numerical analysis;smoothed analysis;smoothing;well-posed problem	Kees van den Doel;Uri M.

f883da5b64d347cd27f74fd81e5b3eda9dfcb6c0	a 29.5 dbm class-e outphasing rf power amplifier with efficiency and output power enhancement circuits in 45nm cmos		A CMOS class-E outphasing RF power amplifier is presented with a new passive combining circuit that provides high efficiency and high output power. An efficiency enhancement circuit and a power enhancement circuit are proposed as part of the combiner that improve efficiency at power back-off and increase output power without violating reliability limits, respectively. The proposed power amplifier is designed in a 45nm CMOS technology. The power amplifier (PA) delivers 29.5 dBm peak output power at 2.4 GHz with 46.76% drain efficiency at peak output power, 32.96% drain efficiency at 3 dB power back-off, and 21.16% drain efficiency at 6 dB power back-off. The proposed power amplifier shows excellent linearity with digital pre-distortion. Better than −50 dBc adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is obtained with 64-QAM long-term evolution (LTE) signal with 10 MHz and 20 MHz bandwidth. For two-carrier 20 MHz LTE signal, −44 dBc ACPR is achieved. 21% average drain efficiency is obtained with LTE signal with a 6 dB peak-to-average power ratio. The PA is also tested with 802.11g WLAN signal and it satisfies the spectral mask requirement with high margin. 1.4% (−37.1 dB) error vector magnitude (EVM) is obtained with LTE signal (64-QAM) with a 10 MHz bandwidth.	adjacent channel power ratio;audio power amplifier;backoff;cmos;compaq lte;dbm;decibel;distortion;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;power architecture platform reference;power dividers and directional couplers;rf power amplifier;radio frequency;spectral mask	Aritra Banerjee;Rahmi Hezar;Lei Ding;Baher Haroun	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2017.2695243	electronic engineering;power-added efficiency;control theory;switched-mode power supply;power bandwidth;signal-to-crosstalk ratio;adjacent channel power ratio;linear amplifier;mathematics;amplifier;rf power amplifier	EDA	62.28250745241865	53.98113618324136	13520

The ML FIR filter has the deadbeat property and its form is universal for all known bias constrained FIR filters. By the identity weighting matrix, the ML FIR filter becomes the unbiased FIR filter, which ignores the noise statistics and the initial error statistics. Otherwise, the ML FIR filter is equivalent to the optimal FIR filter with embedded unbiasedness and to the minimum variance unbiased FIR filter. An example of a stochastic resonator demonstrates higher immunity of the ML FIR filter against errors in the imprecisely defined noise statistics than in the Kalman filter.	embedded system;finite impulse response;kalman filter;state space	Shunyi Zhao;Yuriy S.

The synchronized measurements are obtained in real time from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and compared with offline thresholds determined by decision trees (DTs) to diagnose the fault. The DTs have already been trained offline using detailed power system analysis for different fault cases. While the traditional methods for fault diagnosis use the status of protective relays (PRs) and circuit breakers (CBs) to infer the fault section in the power system, the proposed method uses the available signals following the fault and thus can be trusted even in case of protection system failure. Therefore, fault diagnosis can be achieved successfully especially in blackout situations, where many CBs and and/or PRs malfunction. Simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus test system show that the proposed method is highly accurate in wide area fault diagnosis in spite of incomplete system observability.	decision tree;fault tolerance;online and offline;phasor;relay;simulation;system analysis	Payam Zamani Dehkordi;Ahmad Salehi-Dobakhshari;Ali Mohammad Ranjbar	2012	2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465808	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;fault coverage;fault indicator;engineering	EDA	68.46707255221317	35.146189817591306	13601
94b0bdd7dc3a6c5d2a71bacd5cb62bfcdc90d88c	analyzing standardization needs for chil-based testing of power systems and components		Real-time simulation methods for investigations on electric networks and integration of grid connected generation units are increasingly in the focus of ongoing research areas. While laboratory testing methods are the predominant method for the verification of safety and quality related features of grid-connected generation units in the past, load flow modeling verification methods have been integrated in state-of-the-art standardization frameworks recently. The next step is comprised in real-time simulation methodologies applied for compliance testing of entire power electronic systems integrated in power distribution networks. The Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) approach is an appropriate methodology that combines numerical simulations with software modeling approaches and classical hardware testing in labs. Control boards represent the hardware device directly connected to the power electronic periphery, which is entirely simulated in a real-time simulation environment. Hereby, input signals from voltage and current measurements and output signals for power system control are exchanged in real-time. Thanks to this setup the testing of the true behavior of entire generation units within the electric network can be emulated precisely. With the application of CHIL a shorter time to market and a lower risk in the development phase can be achieved. However, an analysis from realized CHIL experiments shows the need for more harmonized procedures. This paper addresses this topic and provides an outlook about necessary future CHIL standardization needs.		Georg Lauss;Filip Prostl Andren;Fabian Leimgruber;Thomas I.

The feasible regions for linear program with an additional reverse convex constraint are generally non-convex and disconnected.

This occurs, for instance, when describing the topography of seafloor surfaces, mountain ranges, volcanoes, islands, or the shape of geological entities, as well as when dealing with reservoir characterization and modelling. In all these circumstances, due to the presence of large and rapid variations in the data, attempting a fitting using conventional approximation methods necessarily leads to instability phenomena or undesirable oscillations which can locally and even globally hinder the approximation. As will be shown in this paper, the right approach to get a good approximant consists, in effect, in applying first a segmentation process to precisely define the locations of large variations and faults, and exploiting then a discrete approximation technique. To perform the segmentation step, we propose a quasi-automatic algorithm that uses a level set method to obtain from the given (gridded or scattered) Lagrange data several patches delimited by large gradients (or faults). Then, with the knowledge of the location of the discontinuities of the surface, we generate a triangular mesh (which takes into account the identified set of discontinuities) on which a D m -spline approximant is constructed. To show the efficiency of this technique, we will present the results obtained by its application to synthetic datasets as well as real gridded datasets in Oceanography and Geosciences.	approximation algorithm;curve fitting;delimiter;domain decomposition methods;entity;finite element method;gradient;http 404;instability;numerical analysis;polygon mesh;preprocessor;spline (mathematics);synthetic intelligence;topography	Christian Gout;Carole Le Guyader;Lucia Romani;A.-G.

70d894f13f198332a2a12cb9f57994b92c6371aa	an analytical approach for obtaining the transient solution of the fractional-order buck converter in ccm		This paper proposes a transient modeling and analysis method for the fractional-order DC-DC converters in continuous conduction mode (CCM), in which a fractional-order Buck converter is taken as an example. By extending the usage of equivalent small parameter method (ESP), the converter is modeled by a general state vector differential equation. Then by adopting the principle of harmonic balance, fractional differential of state variables is converted into linear operations of exponential functions, and different harmonic are separated. Thus the main transient oscillation components of state variables can be obtained according to Grünwald-Letnikov's definition of fractional derivation, and the data are processed approximately by polynomial fitting of triangular functions. The results are introduced back to the model to obtain the values of the rest harmonic magnitudes. So the final solution of state variables is in the form of the summation of harmonic contents. To confirm the correctness of the results of the proposed method, waveforms of the analytical solution are put together with those from circuit simulation in PSIM. These results demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed method.	associative aphasia;buck converter;converter device component;correctness (computer science);electronic circuit simulation;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;harmonic balance;physical security information management;polynomial;population parameter;summation (document);contents - htmllinktype;exponential	Xiaoxiao Li;Yanfeng Chen;Xi Chen;Bo Zhang;Dong Yuan Qiu	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217199	control theory;harmonic balance;differential equation;engineering;transient (oscillation);harmonic analysis;state variable;buck converter;harmonic;state vector	EDA	69.8779972775463	44.418583045122716	13762

Considered as a second-order equation for the unknown parameter, the problem is of mixed type, i.e., changing between elliptic and hyperbolic. Numerical routines for directly solving this equation are not available. In this paper we both theoretically and numerically show that the inverse problem can instead be solved in a stable way by means of a (derivative free) iterative regularization method.

However, the problem remains challenging for higher-order systems due to the complexity of consensus analysis and data rate minimization. In this paper, the leaderless and leader-following quantized consensus for a special kind of high-order systems are considered. Each agent is assumed to be controllable and observable with single input and single output, and its system matrix admits $n$ identical eigenvalues of 1. The special case of $n$ - th order integrator multi-agent system with only the first state variable being measurable is first investigated, and it is shown that for a fixed undirected connected network, $n$ bits of information exchange between agents suffice to guarantee the leaderless and leader-following quantized consensus respectively with an exponential convergence rate by employing a suitable encoding-decoding scheme and perturbation analysis of matrices. The obtained results are then extended to the general case of multi-agent dynamics with $n$ identical eigenvalues of 1 by applying the same encoding-decoding scheme and control protocol to an observer system for each agent. The final consensus value and the application to formation control are also discussed.	multi-agent system;uncompressed video	Zhirong Qiu;Lihua Xie;Yiguang Hong	2016	IEEE Trans. Automat.

ce5daa6b245f5e6df40f9b18559de562c964aa4b	game theoretic transient control of parallel connected inverters in islanded microgrids		Transient improvements in parallel connected inverter systems have become a vital part in the modern microgrid control arena. Owing to the low generation inertia and the spinning reserve, parallel connected inverters in the microgrid environment are highly vulnerable to transient instabilities. Decentralized transient trajectory optimization methodology for a parallel connected inverter system in an islanded microgrid is introduced in this paper. Non-cooperative differential game theoretic approach is developed to dynamic path optimization of the parallel connected inverters which are treated as the dynamic source players in the system. Optimum control signal trajectory generation and the dynamic modeling of the system is done in the d-q rotating reference frame. Example simulations were carried out based on a simple test system to illustrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	game theory;inverter (logic gate);mathematical optimization;microgrid;power inverter;reference frame (video);simulation;trajectory optimization;turing test	Anushka M.

There are several interactive software packages for analysis of dynamical systems defined by ODEs. The most widely used are AUTO86/97[1], CONTENT[2] and XPPAUT.The Matlab software package MATCONT provides an interactive environment for the continuation and normal form analysis of dynamical systems. This analysis is complementary to the simulation of the systems which is also included in the package and can be used in their identification, control, and optimization. MATCONT is designed to exploit the power of Matlab. It is developed in parallel with the continuation toolbox CL_MATCONT, a package of Matlab routines that can be used from the command line.We consider the following model of an autonomous electronic circuit where <i>x, y</i> and <i>z</i> are state variables and β,γ,ν,<i>r</i>,<i>a</i><sub>3</sub>,<i>b</i><sub>3</sub> are parameters: [see pdf for formula]We compute a branch of equilibria with free parameter ν stating from the trivial solution <i>x</i> = 0.00125, <i>y</i> = -0.001, <i>z</i> = 0.00052502 at <i>β</i> = 0.5, γ = -0.6, <i>r</i> = -0.6, <i>a</i><sub>3</sub> = 0.32858, <i>b</i><sub>3</sub> = 0.93358, ν = -0.9, ε = 0.001. We start a curve of periodic orbits from a Hopf point on this curve choosing ν as the free parameter. We detect a torus bifurcation point at ν = -0.59575. We continue the torus bifurcation in two parameters ν, ε and find that it shrinks to a single point for decreasing values of ν (Figure 2).	autonomous robot;bifurcation theory;command-line interface;continuation;dynamical system;electronic circuit;hopf bifurcation;matlab;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;portable document format;simulation	Annick Dhooge;Willy Govaerts;Yuri A.

The physical model is based on a phase field approach, which consists of a coupled system of the Cahn–Hilliard and Navier–Stokes equations with the generalized Navier boundary condition  [1] ;  [2]  ;   [5] . To overcome the difficulties due to large density and viscosity ratio, the Navier–Stokes equations are solved by a splitting method based on a pressure Poisson equation   [11]  , while the Cahn–Hilliard equation is solved by a convex splitting method. We show that the method is stable under certain conditions. The linearized schemes are easy to implement and introduce only mild CFL time constraint. Numerical tests are carried out to verify the accuracy, stability and efficiency of the schemes. The method allows us to simulate the interface problems with extremely small interface thickness. Three dimensional simulations are included to validate the efficiency of the method.		Min Gao;Xiaoping Wang	2014	J. Comput.

680fad981371ad591814068388ad14a592caa079	optimization of chaotic micromixers using finite time lyapunov exponents		In microfluidics mixing of different fluids is a highly non-trivial task due to the absence of turbulence. The dominant process allowing mixing at low Reynolds number is therefore diffusion, thus rendering mixing in plain channels very inefficient. Recently, passive chaotic micromixers such as the staggered herringbone mixer were developed, allowing efficient mixing of fluids by repeated stretching and folding of the fluid interfaces. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of such mixer devices is often performed by time consuming and expensive trial and error experiments. We demonstrate that the application of the lattice Boltzmann method to fluid flow in highly complex mixer geometries together with standard techniques from statistical physics and dynamical systems theory can lead to a highly efficient way to optimize micromixer geometries. The strategy applies massively parallel fluid flow simulations inside a mixer, where massless and noninteracting tracer particles are introduced. By following their trajectories we can calculate finite time Lyapunov exponents in order to quantify the degree of chaotic advection inside the mixer. The current report provides a review of our results published in [1] together with additional details on the simulation methodology.

The problem can be formulated either in a bounded domain or in an unbounded domain. The active shielding is realized via the implementation of additional sources in such a way that the total contribution of all sources leads to the desirable effect. Mathematically the problem is reduced to seeking the source terms satisfying some a priori described requirements to the solution and belongs to the class of inverse source problems. From the application standpoint, this problem can be closely related to the active shielding of noise, active vibration control and active scattering. It is important to note that along with undesirable field (noise) to be shielded the presence of a desirable component is accepted in the analysis. The solution of the problem requires only the knowledge of the total field on the perimeter of the shielded domain. The examples of acoustic and Maxwell equations are considered. This is the first publication where the solution of the problem is proved in a quite general nonstationary formulation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;euler;maxwell (microarchitecture);perimeter;requirement	Sergei V.

The factorization helps us to uncouple partitioned subsystems for parallel processing of their solution. A crucial question for the validity of the partition method is the existence and stability of the whole solution across the partitioning blocks . We show that if the given system is nonsingular and diagonally dominant, then within each block the WZ factorization exists and is (numerically) strongly stable, and the solution across the partitioning blocks exists (does not terminate prematurely).	winzip	M.

The main advantages of these filter banks are that (a) they have low approximation errors even if a lower-order shifted Chebyshev polynomial approximation is used, (b) the upper bound of the error after the  $p$th order Chebyshev polynomial approximation can be calculated rigorously without complex calculations, and (c) their parameters can be efficiently obtained from any real-valued linear phase finite impulse response filter banks in regular signal processing. The proposed filter bank has the same filter characteristics as the corresponding classical filter bank in the frequency domain and inherits the original properties, such as tight frame and no DC leakage. Furthermore, their approximation orders can be determined from the desired approximation accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by comparing them with existing spectral graph wavelets and filter banks.	approximation error;chebyshev polynomials;emoticon;filter bank;finite impulse response;frame (linear algebra);linear phase;polynomial;signal processing;spectral leakage;wavelet	Akie Sakiyama;Kana Watanabe;Yuichi Tanaka	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks	10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2581303	butterworth filter;adaptive filter;all-pass filter;raised-cosine filter;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;discrete mathematics;digital filter;kernel adaptive filter;low-pass filter;chebyshev filter;quadrature mirror filter;root-raised-cosine filter;filter bank;mathematics;filter design;elliptic filter;m-derived filter	Robotics	57.40856430626003	18.767861890361303	14201

This translation is designed by using jointly two new isomorphisms between real vector spaces and enables us to straightforwardly apply the well established schemes in real domain to problems for the hypercomplex linear model. We also clarify useful algebraic properties of the proposed translation. As an example of many potential algorithms through the proposed algebraic translation, we present Am-adaptive projected subgradient method ( Am-APSM) for Am valued adaptive system identification, and show that many hypercomplex adaptive filtering algorithms can be viewed as special cases of this algorithm. Moreover, we also apply the Am-APSM to nonlinear adaptive filtering by using the kernel trick. Numerical examples show that the effectiveness of the Am-APSM in many Cayley-Dickson valued linear system identification and nonlinear channel equalization problems.	am broadcasting;adaptive filter;adaptive system;algorithm;graph isomorphism;kernel method;linear algebra;linear model;linear system;magma;nonlinear system;numerical method;subgradient method;system identification;whole earth 'lectronic link	Takehiko Mizoguchi;Isao Yamada	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2296881	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;linear system	ML	60.039859472948066	8.606453221788462	14259

New results in sampling theory are obtained along the following lines: recovery of the process x(t) from nonperiodic samples, or when any finite number of samples are deleted; conditions for obtaining x (t) when only the past is sampled; a criterion for restoring x(t) from a finite number of consecutive samples; and a minimum mean square error est imate of x(t) based on any (possibly nonperiodie) set of samples. In each case, the proofs apply not only to the recovery of x(t), but are extended to show that (almost) arbitrary linear operations on x (t) can be reproduced by linear combinations of the samples. Further generality is at tained by use of the spectral distr ibution function F(. ) of x(t), without assuming F( . ) absolutely continuous.	eisenstein's criterion;hilbert space;mean squared error;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);stochastic process	Frederick J.

The method is analogous to that of replacing the kernel of a Fredholm integral equation by a degenerate one. An approximate expression for the kernel (ζ - z ) −  1  2    has been suggested which allows the determination of current function values in the range ζ ϵ[0.00155, 30.] of the non-dimensional time parameter ζ. Depending on the number of integration steps, the algorithm can be faster by 1–3 orders of magnitude than the traditional Huber method. The memory requirements are also much lower. The method can be extended to other cyclic voltammetric integral equations involving (ζ -  z ) −  1  2    kernels. A similar approach can be used for an approximate semi-integration, enabling e.g. a fast global analysis of cyclic voltammograms.	numerical linear algebra;numerical method	Leslaw K.

a4fbf7377115ab0bf747ba5084c2f511a9d71618	smoothing and filling holes with dirichlet boundary conditions	conference paper	A commonly used method for the fitting of smooth functions to noisy data sets is the thin-plate spline method. Traditional  thin-plate splines use radial basis functions and consequently requires the solution of a dense linear system of equations  that grows with the number of data points. We present a method based instead on low order polynomial basis functions with  local support defined on finite element grids. An advantage of such an approach is that the resulting system of equations  is sparse and its size depends on the number of nodes in the finite element grid.    A potential problem with local basis functions is an inability to fill holes in the data set; by their nature local basis  functions are not defined on the whole domain like radial basis functions. Our particular formulation automatically fills  any holes in the data.        In this paper we present the discrete thin-plate spline method and explore how Dirichlet boundary conditions affect the way  holes are filled in the data set. Theory is developed for general d-dimensional data sets and model problems are presented in 2D and 3D.      	smoothing	Linda Stals;Stephen G.

Both transmitters and also the receiver are impaired by frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance with different parameters. It is shown how an I/Q parameter deviation in these chains deteriorates the achievable self-interference suppression level. Three different types of pre-equalization units, with variable complexity degree and different implementation approach, are then introduced and investigated. These units correct the I/Q imbalance and retain the self-interference level to its value as in a perfectly I/Q matched full-duplex transceiver. They can even be used to fully calibrate the I/Q imbalance. Simulative results show that self-interference suppression levels of more than 71 dB can be achieved.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);transceiver;transmitter;zero suppression	Ramez Askar;Nidal Zarifeh;Benjamin Schubert;Wilhelm Keusgen;Thomas Kaiser	2014	1st International Conference on 5G for Ubiquitous Connectivity		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	61.60089837442394	60.40854690964573	14316
8b031c85dd91b0be0ae96e30f1ab1297d2303d2f	adaptive mesh reconstruction for hyperbolic conservation laws with total variation bound		We consider 3-point numerical schemes, that resolve scalar conservation laws, that are oscillatory either to their dispersive or anti-diffusive nature. The spatial discretization is performed over non-uniform adaptively redefined meshes. We provide a model for studying the evolution of the extremes of the oscillations. We prove that proper mesh reconstruction is able to control the oscillations; we provide bounds for the Total Variation (TV) of the numerical solution. We, moreover, prove under more strict assumptions that the increase of the TV, due to the oscillatory behavior of the numerical schemes, decreases with time; hence proving that the overall scheme is TV Increase-Decreasing (TVI-D). We finally provide numerical evidence supporting the analytical results that exhibit the stabilization properties of the mesh adaptation technique. 1. Outline Mesh adaptation techniques have been employed by several authors in the past. It is worth noting the seminal works [DD87, For88, HH83, Luc85, Luc86, TT03], where several properties of mesh adaptation were studied. It was noticed in [AKM01, AMT04, AMS10, Sfa09] that proper use of non-uniform adaptively redefined meshes is capable of taming oscillations; hence improving the stability properties of the numerical schemes. To study the stabilization properties of mesh adaptation techniques we analyze the effect they have, on the oscillations that oscillatory/unstable numerical schemes produce. The setting is the one-dimensional scalar Riemann problem: ut+f(u)x = 0, x ∈ [a, b], with the flux function f being smooth and convex. For initial conditions we consider the single jump u0(x) = X[0,x0](x) with x, x0 ∈ (0, 1). We discretize spatially over a non-uniform adaptively redefined mesh. The mesh adaptation and the time evolution of the numerical solution are combined into the Main Adaptive Scheme: Definition 1.1 (Main Adaptive Scheme (MAS)). Given, at time step n, the mesh M x = {a = x1 < · · · < xN = b} and the approximations U = {u1 , . . . , uN}, the steps of the (MAS) are: 1. (Mesh Reconstruction). Construct new mesh: M x = {a = x 1 < · · · < x N = b}. 2. (Solution Update).

BER simulations advocate for a critical-tap cancellation scheme, which leads to the realization of an equalizer featuring a small number of taps. A two-step configurable architecture is suggested as the equalizer's feedback path, in order to mitigate the loss of robustness that is caused by the absence of the clock. Simulations reveal the system's channel-dependent power consumption character and a delay line power consumption reduction of 3 to 4 times, when compared with its clocked counterpart.	analog delay line;baseband;cmos;clock rate;clock signal;computer simulation;delay line memory;digital delay line;equalization (communications);full scale;information sciences institute;mixed-signal integrated circuit;mobile device;multipath propagation;software deployment;system deployment;the verge;x.690	Ilias Sourikopoulos;Antoine Frappe;Andreas Kaiser;Laurent Clavier	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865427	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	58.43061558085653	58.5740301877854	14438

Most dimmable LED drivers contain a series dimming switch with a LED string to implement a pulse-width modulation-dimming function. However, this setup causes the dimming switch to suffer from high voltage stress in the dimming interval. To reduce the voltage stress of a dimming switch, a low switch stress scheme is presented. The dimming circuit is parallel with the LED string. Using proper arrangement and design of the parameters, the dimming circuit changes the feedback status, which results in the output driving voltage varying between a constant current and a fixed voltage operation. These two operating conditions also make the LED string turn on/off alternately and consequently and perform the dimming function. The dimming switch acts by altering the feedback path instead of cutting off the main power flow; hence, it does not need a power level switch. Details of the operating principles and design considerations are discussed in this study. A prototype boost converter was developed to verify the feasibility of the proposed low dimming switch stress LED driver. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.

We present a significantly improved RBF-FD scheme and successfully apply it to two types of multidimensional partial differential equations in finance: a two-asset European call basket option under the Black–Scholes–Merton model, and a European call option under the Heston model. We also show that the performance of the improved method is equally high when it comes to pricing American options. By studying convergence, computational performance, and conditioning of the discrete systems, we show the superiority of the introduced approaches over previously used versions of the RBF-FD method in financial applications.	algorithm;approximation;black–scholes model;computation;experiment;finite difference;heston model;lina;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);polynomial;radial (radio);radial basis function kernel;radial basis function network;smoothing	Slobodan Milovanovic	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;computational mathematics;finite difference;polyharmonic spline;derivative (finance);radial basis function;mathematics	ML	85.9155700822295	16.672017702631873	14485
04d36e8437dc6a19ae0b4dc35d413c29fc8cecd6	location-dependent impacts of resource inertia on power system oscillations		Inertial responses are seen by the system as the injection or withdrawal of electrical energy, corresponding to a change of frequency. The inertia of a machine primarily contributes to the power system transient stability. Oscillations are always present in the bulk power system due to the electromechanical nature of the grid. Poorly damped oscillations may cause system instability. Thus, this paper aims to study inertia’s impacts on system primary frequency response, in particular on system oscillation modes. Both transient stability simulations and modal analysis are performed to provide insights into the extent to which inertia and its location influence the system oscillation behavior. Simulation results using both a small-scale test system and a large-scale synthetic network dynamic model are presented to verify the locational impacts of resource inertia.	causality;downtime;frequency response;instability;mathematical model;modal logic;neural oscillation;normal mode;numerical stability;simulation;synthetic intelligence;system dynamics;transmission line	Ti Xu;Wonhyeok Jang;Thomas J.

This proposed method overcomes both of these limitations of previous research.

It is shown that typical regenerative devices making use of linear-to-rotational elements can be modelled as a parallel arrangement of an inerter and a dissipative admittance. Taking account of typical adjustable parameters of the generator, it is shown, for a given suspension damping coefficient, that the power efficiency ratio scales with inertance. For a typical passenger vehicle, it is shown that there is a feasible compromise, namely that good efficiency is achievable with an inertance value that is not detrimental to vehicle performance.

The principle is illustrated using a sectored phased array antenna working on the 5.2 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. The antenna is a four-element dipole array, with two active and two parasitic elements. The array uses a reflective 2P4T switch to route the RF signals to consecutive elements of the array and four pin diode SPST switches for short or open circuiting the antenna elements. The performance of the proposed antenna system surpasses the performance of traditional two-port phased array systems and is comparable to that of four-element planar arrays. Simulated results of the antenna performance and beam-forming capabilities are presented.	electronic circuit;network switch;pin diode;phased array;radio frequency;sfiaplus	Antonis Kalis;Michael J.

Lower platform cost is enabled by integrating the headphone module on the same SoC as the baseband functions. Maintaining device reliability with direct battery hook-up and providing large output swing are major challenges for this work, and several techniques were employed to guarantee safe operation for all of the devices under various conditions. Area reduction techniques were utilized to reduce the die cost and achieve lower platform cost. The module supports direct battery hookup with a battery range from 3.1 to 4.5 V and achieves a minimum low frequency, i.e., 217 Hz, PSRR of 110 dB at the lowest battery voltage. Audio quality is preserved by achieving a dynamic range of 100 dB, THD+N of -84 dB at 10 mW output power, and 160 μV pop-and-click noise level during power-up and power-down. The module occupies an area of 0.675 mm 2 on the SoC.	baseband;cmos;decibel;die (integrated circuit);dynamic range;headphones;noise (electronics);out-of-band agreement;phone connector (audio);power supply rejection ratio;quantization (signal processing);system on a chip;total harmonic distortion;zero suppression	Khaled Abdelfattah;Sherif Galal;Iuri Mehr;Alex Jianzhong Chen;Chengyue Yu;Maurice Tjie;Ahmet Tekin;Xicheng Jiang;Todd Brooks	2014	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2014.2314449	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	61.65347069284318	52.61818495655599	14710

By means of this relationship, we then express the Mathieu series S(r) in terms of the Trigamma function @j^'(z) or (equivalently) the Hurwitz (or generalized) Zeta function @z(s,a). Accordingly, various interesting properties of S(r) can be obtained from those of @j^'(z) and @z(s,a).

We analyze an alternative form of phononic computing inspired by optical, rather than electronic, computing. Using the acoustic Faraday effect, we design a phonon gyrator and thereby a means of performing computation through the manipulation of polarization in transverse phonon currents. Moreover, we establish that our gyrators act as generalized transistors and can construct digital logic gates. Exploiting the wave nature of phonons and the similarity of our logic gates, we demonstrate parallel computation within a single circuit, an effect presently unique to phonons. Finally, a generic method of designing these parallel circuits is introduced and used to analyze the feasibility of magneto-acoustic materials in realizing these circuits.	acoustic cryptanalysis;boolean algebra;computation;faraday cage;faraday effect;gyrator;information processing;logic gate;parallel computing;phonon;polarization (waves);series and parallel circuits;transistor;transverse wave	Sophia Sklan;Jeffrey C.

An exact analytical resolution is obtained by using a vector comprising a voltage and a current. From a matrix calculation, the voltage and current can be written with solutions of the characteristic equation, power supply voltage, the switching ratio in the switching transistor circuit, and the number of switchings. Using the expression, the voltage and current in the stepwise adiabatic charging method can be derived clearly. As a result, it is clarified analytically that, in N-step charging, the current is reduced to 1/N so that the energy dissipation is reduced to 1/N. Next, the experimental switching transistor circuit with the controller is described, which is composed of discrete ICs. The experimental inductor current in the circuit is investigated. The measured current is reduced to 1/N in N-step charging, which is consistent with the simulated one from the theory. It is also confirmed experimentally from the average power supply current that power consumption is reduced to 1/N.	stepwise regression	Shunji Nakata;Hiroshi Makino;Ryota Honda;Masayuki Miyama;Yoshio Matsuda	2014	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S021812661450039X	mesh analysis;electronic engineering;current mirror;computer science;electrical engineering;machine learning;stepwise regression;constant current;control theory;volt-ampere	EDA	66.61850826483581	43.714889673763864	14756

A new criterion was introduced for the quality of estimate or filter. It is the level of damping random perturbations which is defined by the maximal value over all covariance matrices of the root-mean-square error normalized by the sum of variances of all random factors. The level of damping random perturbations was shown to be equal to the square of the spectral norm of the matrix relating the error of estimation and the random factors, and the optimal estimate minimizing this criterion was established. In the problem of filtration, it was shown how the filter parameters that are optimal in the level of damping random perturbations are expressed in terms of the linear matrix inequalities.		Mark M.

In such systems, vector-valued refinable functions act as the sinc function in the Shannon sampling theorem, and their corresponding matrix-valued masks possess a special structure. In particular, for the multiplicity r = 2, a biorthogonal multifilter bank can be reduced to two scalar-valued filters. Moreover, if the vector-valued scaling functions are interpolating, three different concepts: balancing order, approximation order and analysis-ready order, will be shown to be equivalent. Based on this result, we introduce the transferring armlet order for constructing biorthogonal balanced multiwaveletswith sampling property.Also, somebalanced biorthogonalmultiwaveletswill be obtained. Finally, application of biorthogonal interpolating multiwavelets in image compression is discussed. Experiments show that for the same length, the biorthogonal multifilter bank is superior to the orthogonal case. Moreover, certain biorthogonal interpolating multiwavelets are also better than the classical Daubechies wavelets.	daubechies wavelet;dirac delta function;image compression;image scaling;interpolation;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;order of approximation;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);sinc function;variable shadowing	Baobin Li;Lizhong Peng	2016	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-015-0095-4	mathematical analysis;biorthogonal system;calculus;mathematics;biorthogonal polynomial	ML	57.247274236575784	18.906073872210712	14804

Under appropriate conditions on the construction ofΛ, we show that it is asymptotically exact with respect to the energy norm of the error. The single layer equation and the hyper-singular equation are treated separately.

eee6e2f2e35d0f024d24c62a89b0c7ef0a52c08e	a meshless discrete collocation method for the numerical solution of singular-logarithmic boundary integral equations utilizing radial basis functions		The main intention of the current paper is to describe a scheme for the numerical solution of boundary integral equations of the second kind with logarithmic singular kernels. These types of integral equations result from boundary value problems of Laplace’s equations with linear Robin boundary conditions. The method approximates the solution using the radial basis function (RBF) expansion with polynomial precision in the discrete collocation method. The collocation method for solving logarithmic boundary integral equations encounters more difficulties for computing the singular integrals which cannot be approximated by the classical quadrature formulae. To overcome this problem, we utilize the non-uniform composite Gauss–Legendre integration rule and employ it to estimate the singular logarithm integrals appeared in the method. Since the scheme is based on the use of scattered points spread on the analyzed domain and does not need any domain elements, we can call it as the meshless discrete collocation method. The new algorithm is successful and easy to solve various types of boundary integral equations with singular kernels. We also provide the error estimate of the proposed method. The efficiency and accuracy of the new approach are illustrated by some numerical examples.	collocation method;meshfree methods;numerical partial differential equations;radial (radio);radial basis function	Pouria Assari;Mehdi Dehghan	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.07.073	singular boundary method;mathematical optimization;regularized meshless method;mathematical analysis;boundary knot method;boundary element method;orthogonal collocation;mathematics;nyström method;singular integral;collocation method	Robotics	84.6564438232359	15.066830972922846	14864

92cea192f9baade87041c47f9c6b414b26f9e993	alternating proximal gradient method for nonnegative matrix factorization		Nonnegative matrix factorization has been widely applied in face recognition, text mining, as well as spectral analysis. This paper proposes an alternating proximal gradient method for solving this problem. With a uniformly positive lower bound assumption on the iterates, any limit point can be proved to satisfy the first-order optimality conditions. A Nesterov-type extrapolation technique is then applied to accelerate the algorithm. Though this technique is at first used for convex program, it turns out to work very well for the non-convex nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the alternating proximal gradient method and the accleration technique. Especially for real data tests, the accelerated method reveals high superiority to state-of-the-art algorithms in speed with comparable solution qualities.	algorithm;convex optimization;experiment;extrapolation;facial recognition system;first-order reduction;non-negative matrix factorization;numerical analysis;proximal gradient method;proximal gradient methods for learning;spectral density estimation;text mining	Yangyang Xu	2011	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;nonnegative matrix;mathematics;proximal gradient methods	AI	75.32166388465346	25.875487323254305	14894
4b737c9714a592e92627835be3f5cefdc5bd1abc	accelerated admm based on accelerated douglas-rachford splitting		Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a form of augmented Lagrangian optimisation algorithm that found its place in many new applications in recent years. This paper explores a possibility for an upgrade of the ADMM by extrapolation-based acceleration, which has been successfully utilised for a long time in case of accelerated gradient method. The development uses a recently proposed accelerated Duglas-Rachford splitting by applying it on Fenchel dual problem, resulting in a method that replaces the classical proximal point convergence mechanism of ADMM with the accelerated gradient. The obtained method requires that the second function involved in the cost is strongly convex quadratic, as well as an upper bound on the penalty parameter. A heuristic modification of the derived method is described, and numerical experiments are performed by solving a randomly generated quadratic programming (QP) problem.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;duality (optimization);experiment;extrapolation;fast fourier transform;fenchel's duality theorem;gradient method;heuristic;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;procedural generation;quadratic programming;randomness	Ivan Pejcic;Colin Neil Jones	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810577	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	ML	75.89583614493816	24.74899715499279	14917

This appears in many signal processing problems and is instrumental in source separation. We propose a new Jacobi-like algorithm based both on a special parameterization of the diagonalizing matrix and on an adapted local criterion. The optimization scheme is based on an alternate estimation of the useful parameters. Numerical simulations illustrate the overall very good performances of the proposed algorithm in comparison to two other Jacobi-like algorithms and to a global algorithm existing in the literature.	algorithm;computational fluid dynamics;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;performance;signal processing;simulation;source separation	Victor Maurandi;Eric Moreau	2014	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2339891	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;orthogonal diagonalization;mathematics	Vision	64.91139579983245	19.58018456231776	14958
aba2ac7626499aba5c1f7e10a31e321f0ec01087	compensation of the dispersion of optical systems with crude a-priori knowledge of the input signal	a priori knowledge	All real optical systems are dispersive systems which can be seen from the fact that abrupt changes from white to black in gray level images are smoothed by the optical system so that the processed image shows unsharpness at its edges. In principle this disadvantage can be overcome by a more precise fabrication of the optical lens system. Since this involves a significant increase in manufacturing cost means of digital signal processing are looked for to compensate the dispersive effect of the optical system. The bandwidth of the input signal is normally unknown for the optical system. Thus the dispersion problem for optical systems has to be solved with low-level a-priori knowledge of the input signal.

11960ffa1aa5da7349acced8566f604e565fd5a6	response identification of distributed systems with noisy measurements at finite points	distributed system	A stochastic approximation algorithm is proposed for the on-line estimation of the parameters in an assumed approximate response of a class of distributed systems minimizing a mean-square error criterion. The systems considered are those that can be modeled mathematically by the general linear elliptic equation and are defined on a fixed and bounded domain .Q. More importantly, it is assumed that the model is completely orpartially unknown. Noisy measurements of the response are assumed available at a finite number of fixed points in .Q. The response is approximated by a finite set of preselected linearly independent bounded functions. A random optimization algorithm is also proposed to obtain the optimal location of the measurement points such that a known sensitivity criterion is maximized and, therefore, the search algorithm is accelerated. The minimum eigenvalue of a positive definite matrix obtained from the performance criterion in terms of the known approximating functions and the measurements points is defined as the sensitivity criterion.

In classical (real and complex) numerical analysis, however, one often prefers other algorithms, because they avoid derivatives or use fewer iterations. Our goal is to initiate the systematic study of these other algorithms in the p-adic context. We determine explicit convergence regions for the secant method and Halley's method. We also investigate the computational cost of refining a root to precision m, under the simplifying assumption that both p and the degree of f are large. We show that both of these methods can be implemented so that their cost matches that of Newton's method. Finally, we show that none of these three methods is optimal, by exhibiting two methods with lower asymptotic cost.	approximation;iterative method;numerical analysis	Eric Bach	2009	J.

As the examples show, the sparse structure of the mass and stiffness matrices is highly influenced by the edge numbering. Tetrahedral grid generators are mainly designed for nodal based finite elements so an edge numbering is required. Two different edge numbering schemes are tested with six different grid generators. Significant bandwidth reduction can be obtained by the proper combination of the edge numbering scheme with the grid generator method. Moreover, an ordering algorithm such as the Reverse Cuthill McKee can improve the bandwidth reduction which is necessary to reduce storage requirements.	computation;cuthill–mckee algorithm;finite element method;gödel numbering;pseudorandom number generator;requirement;sparse matrix	Gerardo Mario Ortigoza Capetillo	2010	Computación y Sistemas		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;geometry	HPC	91.63669225646177	18.33709573483211	15208

In this paper we present a high order scheme for determining unknown control parameter and unknown solution of parabolic inverse problem with both integral overspecialization and overspecialization at a point in the spatial domain. In these equations, we first approximate the spatial derivative with a fourth order compact scheme and reduce the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then we apply a fourth order boundary value method for the solution of resulting system of ODEs. So the proposed method has fourth order accuracy in both space and time components and is unconditionally stable due to the favorable stability property of boundary value methods. Several numerical examples and also some comparisons with other methods in the literature will be investigated to confirm the efficiency of the new procedure.

Finally some modifications of the sequences of the families are introduced, in such a way that the resulting operators reproduce linear functions and are comparable with the genuine sequences. 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.	linear function;phil bernstein	D.

4b2c4d96a4c1fc1aa3c8f765865e5749e8cba044	signal processing considerations in power management applications	signal processing;power management	Advances in integrated circuit technology have sparked the use of Application Specific Integrated Circuits ( ASIC ) in applications previously lacking such sophisticated technology. One such application is power management. Power management is the distribution, control, and monitoring of electric power in either a residential or an industrial setting. This article examines how signal processing is used in power management when an ASIC is used as the heart of a power management system. Most of the work in developing ASICs for power management is for industrial applications since the systems required are much more complex than for residential applications. The higher complexity and cost of these systems justify higher development costs. Also, in monitoring power for revenue metering purposes, the accuracy of the meter must be very high to assure that the large amount of energy consumed in a factory is metered properly and the customer is charged the proper amount. Small inaccuracies in industrial meters can generate large losses in revenue for a utility, or cause customers to be unjustly overcharged. For these reasons, this article will focus on industrial power distribution. The basic configuration of a three-phase, four-wire power management system is illustrated in Fig. 1. The power comes in on four buses: phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, and neutral. A set of potential transformers and current transformers is used to monitor the current and voltage on each phase for power consumption monitoring and circuit protection. The values of currents measured at IlM, 12M, and 13M are used to protect the entire power distribution system in case of a high current condition, via a mechanical circuit breaker. Downstream, three-phase loads may be connected in a hierarchical fashion, each having its own power consumption monitor and protection network. Although the mechanical connection of these monitor/protect networks may differ slightly, the signal processing requirements remain the same. Therefore, this application lends itself to an ASIC solution. An ASIC designed for such an application must perform several critical functions. It must be capable of measuring three-phase power and related quantities, measuring instantaneous current for protection, and calculating the energy dissipated in the load to assess heating effects in the distribution system.

7ccaac9fb9a0db7245702f3bf445be9cd5420dc1	retrofitting based power system stabilizer design of pv-integrated power systems		In this paper, we propose a novel type of Power System Stabilizer (PSS) for power systems with large-scale photovoltaic (PV) integration. The proposed PSS can mitigate adverse impacts of short-term operation stoppage of PV generators on the overall power system dynamics. The advantage of the proposed PSS over conventional PSSs is that the damping performance of the overall power system is shown to be improved theoretically while the proposed PSS can be considerably lower-dimensional than the entire power system. The efficiency of the proposed PSS is shown through a numerical example of a PV-integrated benchmark model representing the bulk power system in the eastern half of Japan.	benchmark (computing);cns disorder;crest syndrome;ibm power systems;nobuyuki otsu;numerical analysis;observable;page view;penicillin v;physical symbol system;polycythemia vera;rhodeus pseudosericeus;simulation;state space;system dynamics	Tomonori Sadamoto;Takayuki Ishizaki;Jun-ichi Imura;Takuro Kato	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2018.8511590		EDA	65.91937482382048	36.50025924677009	15271

Like finite volume method, a dual partition is introduced. Combining Simpson integral formula and parabolic interpolation, a family of fourth-order and sixth-order compact difference schemes are obtained based on three different types of dual partitions. Moreover, several new fourth-order compact schemes are gained and numerical experiments are shown two of them are much better than almost any other fourth-order schemes which have been presented in others’ work. The outline for the nonlinear Poisson equation is also given. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the feasibility of this new method and the high accuracy of these fourth-order and sixth-order compact difference schemes.

The need for such a technique often arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems, where inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are required. The technique is quite simple and produces strict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with <italic>R</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>), the prescribed auto-covariance function (acf), over an interval [- <italic>T</italic><subscrpt>0</subscrpt>, <italic>T</italic><subscrpt>0</subscrpt>]. The method consists of approximating the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines, and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and appropriate amplitudes. In order to simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the noise generated, the technique is first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis. In practice, discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third section is used.	mit engineering systems division;spectral density;stationary process	P. R. Peabody;David S. Adorno	1962	Commun.

The PA comprises a two-stage common-source (CS) cascaded input stage with wideband T-type input, inter-stage and output matching networks, followed by a two-way CS gain stage using Y-shaped power divider and combiner, and a four-way CS output stage using dual Y-shaped power divider and combiner. Instead of the traditional area-consumed power divider and combiner with all ports impedance matching to 50 fi, in this work, Y-shaped and dual Y-shaped power divider and combiner that constitute miniature low-loss transmission-line inductors are used for more flexible inter-stage impedance matching and easier bias design. The PA consumes 90 mW and achieves power gain (S21) of 16 dB, 21 dB and 10.4 dB, respectively, at 60 GHz, 77 GHz and 94 GHz. In addition, the PA achieves excellent saturated output power (PSAT) of 13.2 dBm, 12 dBm and 10.6 dBm, respectively, at 60 GHz, 77 GHz and 94 GHz. The corresponding maximal PAE is 19.5%, 16% and 8.9%, respectively, at 60 GHz, 77 GHz and 94 GHz. These results demonstrate the proposed PA architecture is promising for 60~94 GHz communication systems.	audio power amplifier;cmos;characteristic impedance;dbm;diplexer;impedance matching;mac os x 10.4 tiger;maximal set;physical address extension;power dividers and directional couplers;power gain;transceiver;transmission line	Yo-Sheng Lin;Van Kien Nguyen;Jia-Wei Gao;Chien-Chin Wang;Yun-Wen Lin;Chih-Chung Chen	2016	2016 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)	10.1109/RWS.2016.7444375	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering	Arch	61.59590748794781	53.83861613709831	15310

c73063b8c1e91ce8e380491a4729f1fec4f9ef54	a primary-sided clc compensated wireless power transfer system based on the class d amplifier		In order to reduce the complexity of the high-frequency AC power supply of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system in small and medium power applications, the class D amplifier is adopted in this paper. The class D amplifier, which has fewer components than traditional full-bridge and half-bridge inverter, simplifies the structure of the WPT system and can realize the zero-voltage turn-on of MOSFETs. Meantime, a primary-sided CLC compensation network is proposed to achieve load-independent constant voltage output of the WPT system. The analysis and design procedure for the WPT system are provided and a prototype is built. Simulation results validate the load-independent voltage output characteristic of the circuit topology. Experiment is executed at a transfer distance of 10cm and the results show that when the load resistor changes by 233 % from 15Ω to 50Ω, the output voltage only fluctuates by 2.6V from 33.2V to 35.8V. The fluctuation rate is only 7.8%, which indicates that the output voltage of the WPT system is robust to the load variation. With a load resistor of 25Ω, the experimental prototype reaches a dc-dc efficiency of 87.57% at 48.16-W output power.

A new numerical method for solving the generalized regularized long wave equation is devised and analyzed. By using a reproducing kernel function, the numerical solution at each discrete time step is obtained by an explicit integral expression even though the scheme is truly implicit, and, hence, the computation is fully parallel.

c64f55807d449caf6dc750b40a4e36ec4240bc48	exact temporal/spatial discretization of a parabolic partial-differential-equation		The temporal discretization technique known as the step-invariant technique is applied to spatial discretization so that exact discretization of a system governed by a parabolic partial-differential equation becomes possible. The equation is divided into a set of ordinary-differential-equations; one in time and the other in space, which are then discretized in each domain. Given the boundary and initial conditions, the set of discretized models gives values that are identical to those of the original partial-differential equation for any sampling-instants in time and any grid-points in space. This is in contrast to existing finite difference methods, where the number of grid-points has to be sufficiently large for accuracy given the initial condition and the time-increment has to be even smaller for numerical stability.	discretization;finite difference method;initial condition;numerical stability;parabolic antenna;sampling (signal processing)	Shin Kawai;Noriyuki Hori	2017		10.1145/3149827.3149844	initial value problem;mathematical analysis;finite difference method;partial differential equation;parabola;discretization;temporal discretization;numerical stability;parabolic partial differential equation;mathematics	Theory	87.17546608569012	11.914754316240463	15487

d389879a5c4f36827104d42207fefb255142ef01	an efficient and stable two-pixel scheme for 2d forward-and-backward diffusion		Image enhancement with forward-and-backward (FAB) diffusion is numerically very challenging due to its negative diffusivities. As a remedy, we first extend the explicit nonstandard scheme by Welk et al. (2009) from the 1D scenario to the practically relevant two-dimensional setting. We prove that under a fairly severe time step restriction, this 2D scheme preserves a maximum– minimum principle. Moreover, we find an interesting Lyapunov sequence which guarantees convergence to a flat steady state. Since a global application of the time step size restriction leads to very slow algorithms and is more restrictive than necessary for most pixels, we introduce a much more efficient scheme with locally adapted time step sizes. It applies diffusive two-pixel interactions in a randomised order and adapts the time step size to the specific pixel pair. These space-variant time steps are synchronised at sync times. Our experiments show that our novel two-pixel scheme allows to compute FAB diffusion with guaranteed L∞-stability at a speed that can be three orders of magnitude larger than its explicit counterpart with a global time step size.	algorithm;backward compatibility;care-of address;discretization;experiment;image analysis;image editing;interaction;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;pixel;pontryagin's maximum principle;programming paradigm;requirement;steady state;well-posed problem	Martin Welk;Joachim Weickert	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58771-4_8	steady state;pixel;sync;mathematical optimization;orders of magnitude (numbers);mathematics;lyapunov function;convergence (routing)	ML	93.83051491134937	14.896820062964569	15494

It is assumed that the cylinder is stretched in the axial direction with a linear velocity and the surface temperature of the cylinder is subjected to vary non-isothermally. Here the thermal conductivity is assumed to vary linearly with temperature. Using a similarity transformation, the governing system of partial differential equations is first transformed into coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients. The resulting intricate non-linear boundary value problem is solved numerically by a second order finite difference scheme for different values of the pertinent parameters for two cases: (i) the prescribed surface temperature (PST case) and (ii) the prescribed heat flux (PHF case). Numerical results are obtained for two different cases namely, zero and non-zero values of the curvature parameter to get the effects on the velocity and temperature fields. The combined effects of the curvature parameter and the thermal conductivity parameter are examined. The physical significances of the numerical results are presented for several limiting cases.	coefficient;cylinder-head-sector;finite difference method;giant magnetoresistance;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;perfect hash function;planar separator theorem;thickness (graph theory);transfer function;transverse wave;velocity (software development)	K.

While the peak drain efficiency is found to improve by about 10% when the amplifier is scaled down from a 65-nm standard CMOS to a 28-nm fully-depleted SOI CMOS process, the average efficiency instead slightly degrades. Moreover, it is theoretically demonstrated that the power density (peak-power over area-occupation) is a function of the supply voltage and the dielectric constant of the switched capacitor insulator, and it is about 13% higher in the 65-nm CMOS node.	amplifier;cmos;compaq lte;die shrink;image scaling;maximum power transfer theorem;numerical analysis;semiconductor chip protection act of 1984;silicon on insulator;switched capacitor;topological insulator	Bruna Corrêa Pahim;Carlo Samori;Andrea L.

As a broader class of problems we consider separable convex integer minimization under linear equality restrictions Ax = b with any totally unimodular coefficient matrix A. By the total unimodularity Fenchel duality applies, despite the integer restrictions of the variables. The biproportional algorithm of Balinski and Demange (Math Program 45:193–210, 1989) is generalized and derives from the dual optimization problem. Also, a primal augmentation algorithm is stated. Finally, for the smaller class of matrix apportionment problems we discuss the alternating scaling algorithm, which is a discrete variant of the well-known Iterative Proportional Fitting procedure.	algorithm;coefficient;curve fitting;fenchel's duality theorem;image scaling;iterative method;iterative proportional fitting;linear equation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;rounding;support vector machine;unimodular polynomial matrix;whole earth 'lectronic link	Norbert Gaffke;Friedrich Pukelsheim	2008	Math.

Then, we developed schemes that have those two properties above by combining a) a proposed pressure flux (having Machproportional dissipation within numerical shock), and b) a mass flux of an all-speed AUSM-family scheme (SLAU, AUSM-up or LDFSS2001). The new schemes, called “SLAU2,” “AUSM-up2,” and “LDFSS2001-2,” are applied to numerical tests, and their desired performances are demonstrated for a wide spectrum of Mach numbers, including hypersonic heating (for the latter two schemes), a low speed flow, and 3D aerodynamic applications.	ausm;cpu power dissipation;computation;emoticon;numerical analysis;performance	Keiichi Kitamura;Eiji Shima	2013	J.

The circuit consists of four main building blocks: squaring circuit, exponential function generator circuit, Gaussian function generator circuit and analog multiplier circuit. The proposed structure is fully programmable in terms of standard deviation and peak gain of the Gaussian function. Therefore Morlet wavelet can be programmed to define different scaling and shifting parameters. Simulation results of the circuits are obtained by HSPICE in 0.35μm standard CMOS process. Simulated results verify the feasibility of both the wavelet realization and proposed circuits.	analog multiplier;cmos;image scaling;morlet wavelet;numerical integration;spice 2;scalability;signal processing;simulation;time complexity	Ali Naderi Saatlo;Serdar Özoguz	2015	2015 38th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2015.7296375	embedded system;computer science;signal processing;mathematics	EDA	62.21128729602438	49.2127817146322	15591

The proposed SC-CP can automatically configure its own voltage conversion ratio by adaptive control circuitry for maintaining high efficiencies of the DC/DC regulator under coupling variations. An adaptive deadtime control is developed to improve the efficiency of the proposed SCCP by minimizing the shoot-through current. Implemented in a standard 0.35-μm n-well CMOS process, the proposed SC-CP achieves peak power efficiencies of 95% (2x) and 92% (3x). The efficiency of the DC/DC regulator with the proposed SC-CP is improved by ≫25%, compared to that using the conventional 3x SC-CP, when the input voltage varies from 1.6V to 2.4V.	cmos;charge pump;electronic circuit;reconfigurable computing;sparse conditional constant propagation;switched capacitor;transformer	Xiwen Zhang;Hoi Lee	2009	2009 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference	10.1109/CICC.2009.5280827	control engineering;electronic engineering;charge pump;switched capacitor;logic gate;adaptive control;power transmission;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;power semiconductor device	EDA	61.41667769717462	46.87141759704653	15601

Based on Lyapunov stability theory, adaptive control scheme is applied to achieve the projective lag synchronization model with identical, different nodes and even if the delay coupling have constant time delay or time-varying coupling delay. In addition, the model consists of disturbances and fully unknown parameters. Theses parameters are identified by adaptive control and update law. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the states of the dynamical network with non-delay and delay coupling can be asymptotically synchronized onto a desired scaling under the designed controller. Additionally, numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	broadcast delay;control theory;image scaling;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;simulation;synchronization model;time complexity	Ghada Al-mahbashi;Mohd Salmi Md Noorani;Sakhinah Abu Bakar;Shahed Vahedi	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.05.043	real-time computing;adaptive control;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.64252752244106	4.873853593469233	15606

7c27c27e459e61963b30d06b5db72f1c961054c2	an architecture for large-area sensor acquisition using frequency-hopping zno tft dcos		Hybrid systems combine large-area electronics (LAE) with silicon-CMOS ICs for sensing and computation, respectively. In such systems, interfacing a large number of distributed LAE sensors with the CMOS domain poses a key limitation. This paper presents an architecture that aims to greatly reduce both the number of physical connections and the time for accessing all of the sensors. Each sensor modulates the amplitude of a thin-film transistor (TFT) digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). All DCO outputs are combined, but each follows a unique frequency-hopping pattern (controlled by a code from CMOS), allowing recovery of the individual sensors. The architecture enables much greater scalability of sensors for a given number of connections than active-matrix and binary-addressing schemes. For demonstration, an 18-element large-area force-sensing system is demonstrated based on zinc-oxide (ZnO) TFT DCOs with a frequency-hopping rate of 4.2 kHz. Acquisition error  $\leq $  62 mVrms is achieved over 30 weight patterns.	active matrix;cmos;computation;device configuration overlay;digitally controlled oscillator;dynamic range;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hybrid system;least absolute deviations;modulation;roll-to-roll processing;scalability;sensor;signal processing;thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	Yasmin Afsar;Tiffany Moy;Nicholas Brady;Sigurd Wagner;James C.

An innovative practice relies on a monitoring system for PV applications that supports this didactic tool. The monitoring system manages to provide real data about the performance of the PV module such as irradiance, ambient temperature and the current, voltage and power of the PV module. Students can study and calculate the effect of irradiance and ambient temperatures on these variables. Afterwards, they use the simulation models provided to observe the PV module performance. Finally, both set of data (calculated and simulated) will be compared with the real data obtained from the monitoring of the PV module mentioned above. The tool here developed not only shows the effect of a given instantaneous solar irradiance and temperature upon photovoltaic cell and module performance but manages to show, through a friendly and didactic graphic interface, their performance throughout a determined interval of time (e.g. days), given real irradiance and ambient temperatures profiles obtained from the monitoring system. Moreover, this tool has a high potential as it can be added more functionalities as energy estimation and the effect of shadows on a PV generator.	graphical user interface;simulation;solar cell	J. D.

Due to the difficulties for the analytical solutions, a numerical technics so called “the method of integrating factor” is used and the evolution equation is solved under a given initial condition and the bottom topography. It is observed the parameters of bottom topography causes to the changes in wave amplitude, wave profile and the wave speed.	software propagation	Hilmi Demiray	2011	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2011.07.049	classical mechanics;dispersionless equation;closed-form expression;wave equation;mathematical analysis;wave packet;plane wave;soliton;wave shoaling;korteweg–de vries equation;wave propagation;wave;calculus;mathematics;stokes wave;cnoidal wave;initial value problem	Vision	89.55522670579177	5.580676630014159	15724

This paper proposes an improved predictive torque control (PTC) method with CMV reduction strategy which cost little and much smaller than traditional filter method. A simulation based on SIMULINK is analyzed which verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This paper discusses CMV in start mode, reversal mode and steady modes of motor. By analyzing CMV in different modes, we can find that which mode contributes more to the CMV and the specific CMV reduction effect in each modes, which can guide the operating process of the motor.	bearing device component;coefficient;common-mode interference;control theory;flatulence;insulation device component;interference (communication);inverter device component;phase inversion;power inverter;reduction strategy (lambda calculus);simulation;simulink;small;voltage	Xiliang Chen;Wenjie Chen;Zifeng Zhao;Liyu Dai;Rui Wang;Yang Yang	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217230	control engineering;common-mode interference;engineering;control theory;torque;voltage;induction motor;reduction strategy;bearing (mechanical)	Robotics	66.91824160123245	40.82444339721975	15727

A related, but simpler, first-order (or fluid) control problem is first formulated. For a class of performance measures that satisfy a certain continuity property, it is then shown that any sequence of policies whose performances approach the infimum in the fluid control problem is asymptotically optimal for the original network problem. Examples of performance measures with this property are described, and simulations implementing asymptotically optimal policies are presented. The use of directional derivatives of the reflection map for solving fluid control problems is also illustrated. This work serves to complement a large body of literature on asymptotically optimal controls for time-homogeneous networks.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;performance;perturbation theory;reflection mapping;scott continuity;simulation	Milica Cudina;Kavita Ramanan	2011	SIAM J.

Biologically important questions include: what network components are responsible for the various dynamical behaviors that arise? can the underlying dynamical behavior be essentially attributed to a small number of modules? In this paper, we demonstrate that inverse bifurcation analysis can be used to address such inverse problems.We show that sparsity-promoting regularization strategies, in combination with numerical bifurcation analysis, can be used to identify small sets of """"influential"""" submodules and parameters within a given network. In addition, hierarchical strategies can be used to generate parameter solutions of increasing cardinality of non-zero entries. We apply the proposed methods to analyze a model of the mammalian G1/S regulatory module."""	bifurcation theory	James Lu;Heinz W.

A new decentralized Volt/Var Optimization (VVO) scheme is proposed to facilitate Volt/Var control for such a case. The proposed method is based on the Dantzig-Wolf decomposition and the paper shows that this approach facilitates dividing the distribution system into subareas where a local controller can be assigned. The effectiveness of DW-based decentralized VVO scheme is tested using the IEEE 34 node test feeder with high penetration of DGs.	approximation algorithm;discontinuous galerkin method;dreamwidth;inverter (logic gate);iteration;mathematical optimization;power inverter;qr decomposition;real-time clock;requirement;vergence	Yue Shi;Zhan Shen;Mesut E.

In the literature, convergence of the proximal alternating direction method has been established under the assumption that the proximal regularization matrix is positive semi-definite. Recently, it was shown that the regularizing proximal term in the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers does not necessarily have to be positive semi-definite, without any additional assumptions. However, it remains unknown as to whether the indefinite setting is valid for the proximal version of the symmetric alternating direction method of multipliers. In this paper, we confirm that the symmetric alternating direction method of multipliers can also be regularized with an indefinite proximal term. We theoretically prove the global convergence of the indefinite method and establish its worst-case convergence rate in an ergodic sense. In addition, the generalized alternating direction method of multipliers proposed by Eckstein and Bertsekas is a special case in our discussion. Finally, we demonstrate the performance improvements achieved when using the indefinite proximal term through experimental results.	convex optimization;program optimization	Bin Gao;Feng Ma	2018	J.

93e9d9ac070a68f3b5e29f224a8402105c1b4eb8	recent advances in fluorescence lifetime analytical microsystems: contact optics and cmos time-resolved electronics	cmos;tcspc;contact sensing;fluorescence spectroscopy;lab-on-a-chip;microsystems;time-gated;time-resolved	Fluorescence spectroscopy has become a prominent research tool with wide applications in medical diagnostics and bio-imaging. However, the realization of combined high-performance, portable, and low-cost spectroscopic sensors still remains a challenge, which has limited the technique to the laboratories. A fluorescence lifetime measurement seeks to obtain the characteristic lifetime from the fluorescence decay profile. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and time-gated techniques are two key variations of time-resolved measurements. However, commercial time-resolved analysis systems typically contain complex optics and discrete electronic components, which lead to bulkiness and a high cost. These two limitations can be significantly mitigated using contact sensing and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) implementation. Contact sensing simplifies the optics, whereas CMOS technology enables on-chip, arrayed detection and signal processing, significantly reducing size and power consumption. This paper examines recent advances in contact sensing and CMOS time-resolved circuits for the realization of fully integrated fluorescence lifetime measurement microsystems. The high level of performance from recently reported prototypes suggests that the CMOS-based contact sensing microsystems are emerging as sound technologies for application-specific, low-cost, and portable time-resolved diagnostic devices.	british informatics olympiad;cmos;electronic component;fluorescence;high-level programming language;laboratory;optics;photons;reduced cost;semiconductor;signal processing;steady state;throughput;sensor (device)	Liping Wei;Wenrong Yan;Derek Ho	2017		10.3390/s17122800	electronics;photon counting;lab-on-a-chip;engineering;electronic engineering;signal processing;fluorescence spectroscopy;electronic component;electronic circuit;optics;cmos	EDA	54.654647190030246	47.34754267515559	16055

The leading term of each equation is multiplied by a small positive parameter, but these parameters may have different magnitudes. The solution of the system has boundary layers that overlap and interact. The structure of these layers is analyzed, and this leads to the construction of a piecewise-uniform mesh that is a variant of the usual Shishkin mesh. On this mesh a hybrid finite difference scheme is proved to be almost second-order accurate, uniformly in both small parameters. Numerical results supporting the theory are presented.	finite difference method	Zhongdi Cen;Aimin Xu;Anbo Le	2010	J.

In this approach, the adaptive wavelet collocation method (AWCM) is firstly, to the best of our knowledge, incorporated into the FD-LBM. According to the grid refinement criterion based on the wavelet amplitudes of density distribution functions, an adaptive sparse grid is generated by the omission and addition of collocation points. On the sparse grid, the finite differences are used to approximate the derivatives. To eliminate the special treatments in using the FD-based derivative approximation near boundaries, the immersed boundary method (IBM) is also introduced into FD-LBM. By using the adaptive technique, the adaptive code requires much less grid points as compared to the uniform-mesh code. As a consequence, the computational efficiency can be improved. To justify the proposed method, a series of test cases, including fixed boundary cases and moving boundary cases, are invested. A good agreement between the present results and the data in previous literatures is obtained, which demonstrates the accuracy and effectiveness of the present AWCM-IB-LBM.	finite difference;lattice boltzmann methods;wavelet	Xiongwei Cui;Xiongliang Yao;Zhikai Wang;Minghao Liu	2017	J.

While the use of dual stochastic gradient descent algorithms is widespread, they suffer from slow convergence rate. Application of second order methods, on the other hand, is impracticable because computation of dual Hessian inverses incurs excessive cost. The proposed method utilizes stochastic gradients in lieu of deterministic gradients for both, the determination of descent directions and the approximation of the dual function's curvature. Since stochastic gradients can be computed at manageable computational cost stochastic DFP is realizable and retains the convergence rate advantages of its deterministic counterparts. Convergence results show that lower and upper bounds on the instantaneous form of the dual Hessian are sufficient to guarantee convergence to a small neighborhood of optimality. Numerical experiments illustrate that for ill conditioned dual functions stochastic DFP outperforms stochastic gradient descent by an order of magnitude.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;davidon–fletcher–powell formula;duality (optimization);experiment;fletcher's checksum;hessian;newton;newton's method;numerical analysis;numerical method;powell's method;quasi-newton method;rate of convergence;stochastic gradient descent	Aryan Mokhtari;Alejandro R.

Mindlin plate theory is adopted to take the transverse shear effect into considerations. Both incremental theory and deformation theory are employed. Due to thematerial non-linearity, iteration processes are involved for obtaining solutions. Detailed methodology and procedures are derived. The elastoplastic buckling behavior of thick rectangular plateswith ten combinations of boundary conditions and under various loadings is studied. To verify the DQ solution procedures, DQ results are compared with existing analytical solutions for plates with two boundaries simply supported and the others simply supported, clamped, or free. Then the DQ method is used to obtain solutions of rectangular thick plates with other combinations of boundary conditions. Since no analytical solutions for such cases are available, the buckling loads obtained by the DQ method could serve as a reference. The phenomenon reported in the literature, namely, the deformation theory generally gives consistently lower buckling loads than the incremental theory and large discrepancy in predictions between the two theories exists with increasing of plate thickness. E/σ0, and c in the Ramberg–Osgood relations, is also observed for the cases studied herein. Apart from the phenomenon reported earlier by Durban that deformation theory predicted a progressively lower inplane shear modulus as the level of plasticity increased, thus predicted lower buckling loads, another reason is given herein to explain the large discrepancy in predictions for thicker plates with the deformation theory and incremental theory. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonautonomous circuits with as few as two physical components have been developed. However, the operation of such circuits has typically traded physical simplicity for analytic complexity, or vice versa. In this brief, we present two simple autonomous chaotic circuits using only op-amps and linear time-invariant passive components. Each circuit employs one op-amp as a comparator to provide signum nonlinearity. The chaotic behavior is robust, and the circuits offer simple analysis, while minimizing both physical and model component counts.	autonomous robot;chaos theory;comparator;electronic circuit;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;robustness (computer science);time complexity;time-invariant system	Jessica R.

Existing examples of CAES refer to underground storage at medium pressure level. But for widespread utilization, independent from the availability of underground storage volumes, artificial reservoirs would be required. This requires rather high air pressure within the storage, which in turn will demand a carefully optimized recovery of the thermal energy released in the compression phase. Starting from a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the relevant design parameters and their influence on the system efficiency, we propose a comprehensive set of criteria for the design of the system, with particular attention to heat transfer devices.	adiabatic quantum computation;coefficient;computer cooling;experiment;mathematical optimization;multistage amplifier;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);proceedings of the ieee;prototype;scientific literature;simulation	Giuseppe Grazzini;Adriano Milazzo	2012	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2011.2163049	renewable energy;engineering;efficient energy use;thermodynamics;waste management;physics;mechanical engineering	HPC	59.56470937045031	36.70205707590395	16282

We assume that the initial conditions are given by fuzzy numbers that satisfying a special type of relationship namely interactivity. In particular, we assume that the initial conditions are completely correlated fuzzy numbers. Based on this notion, we obtain solutions for linear fuzzy initial value problems by means of the extension principle. Finally, we show that endpoints of each α-level of the proposed solution can be determined by solving two associated classical initial value problems.	entropy maximization;fuzzy number;initial condition;interactivity;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Tyler Finocchio;Yan.

One main challenge to this is represented by electromagnetic torque transients caused by grid faults and disturbances, which will result in significant stresses and fatigue of the gearbox. Possibilities for limiting the torque transients in fixed-speed wind generators have not been previously reported. This paper presents a technique by which the transient torques during recovery after a grid fault can be smoothed in a wind farm with induction generators directly connected to the grid. A model-based control technique using the quasi-stationary equivalent circuit of the system is suggested for controlling the torque with a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). The basis of the approach consists of controlling the induction generator terminal voltage by the injection/absorption of reactive current using the STATCOM. By controlling the terminal voltage as a function of the generator speed during the recovery process, the electromagnetic torque of the generator is indirectly controlled, in order to reduce the drive train mechanical stresses caused by the characteristics of the induction machine when decelerating through the maximum torque region. The control concept is shown by time-domain simulations, where the smoothing effect of the proposed technique on a wind turbine is seen during the recovery after a three-phase-to-ground-fault condition. The influence of the shaft stiffness in a multimass drive train model is discussed, and the performance of the control concept in the case of parallel connection of several turbines is investigated to discuss the applicability in a wind farm.	control system;control theory;equivalent circuit;map (parallel pattern);series and parallel circuits;simulation;smoothing;stationary process;stiffness matrix;transient (computer programming)	Marta Molinas;Jon Are Suul;Tore Undeland	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2035464	wind power;control engineering;electronic engineering;torque sensor;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;physics;direct torque control	Robotics	68.78590584659061	37.92735531940072	16426

This antenna gives an impedance bandwidth of 44.0% with respect to resonant frequency 1.98GHz, which is eight times greater in comparision to conventional elliptical patch microstrip antenna (EPMA) along with axial ratio bandwidth of 5.5% with reverence to frequency 1.98GHz. The antenna is studied on a Flame Retardant (FR-4) substrate having substrate permittivity 4.4 and thickness 1.59mm. The CP behaviour is observed by truncating the conventional elliptical patch and inserting slots. A square slot is also etched in ground plane at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to horizontal axis. This antenna design having a dimension of ground plane $35.0\times 32.0\ \text{mm}^{2}$. To achieve the higher impedance bandwidth, the technique of multilayer stacked of patch is used. The over all height of antenna is 9.18mm.

Following a method proposed by Kirsch and Kress, we approximate the acoustic and elastodynamic wave by potentials over auxiliary surfaces, and we reformulate the inverse problem as an optimization problem. The objective function to be minimized is the sum of three terms. The first is the deviation of the approximate far field pattern from the measured one, the second is a regularization term, and the last a control term for the transmission condition. We prove that the optimization problem has a solution and that, for the regularization parameter tending to zero, the minimizers tend to a solution of the inverse problem.

Under this model, the price of the option can be obtained by solving a highly complex system of coupled two-dimensional parabolic partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). We prove existence of the solution to this system of PIDEs by the method of upper and lower solutions via constructing a monotonic sequence of approximating solutions whose limit is a strong solution of the PIDE system. We then propose several numerical schemes for solving the system of PIDEs. One of the proposed schemes is built upon the constructive proof, hence its results are provably convergent to the solution of the system of PIDEs. We illustrate the accuracy of the proposed methods by several numerical examples.	numerical method	Duy-Minh Dang;Duy Nguyen;Granville Sewell	2016	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2015.12.017	mathematical optimization;asian option;mathematics;mathematical economics	Theory	85.89920542912697	15.846039640475045	16502

The system is modelled in a fractional flow formulation which consists of a parabolic equation (the global pressure equation) coupled with a nonlinear degenerated diffusion-convection one (the saturation equation). A mixed finite element (MFE) method is used to discretize the pressure equation and is combined with a conservative finite volume (FV) method on unstructured grids for the saturation equation. It is shown that the FV scheme satisfies a discrete maximum principle. We derive L^~ and BV estimates under an appropriate CFL condition. Then we prove the convergence of the approximate solution to a weak solution of the coupled system. Numerical results for water-gas flow through engineered and geological barriers for a geological repository of radioactive waste are presented to illustrate the performance of the method in two space dimensions.	farmville	Mustapha El Ossmani	2011	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2010.12.007	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;radioactive waste;finite volume method;porous medium	Robotics	90.2571420903251	13.613351500979942	16507

We define the notion of stationary stability for the Moran process with mutation and generalizations, as well as a generalized notion of evolutionary stability that includes mutation called an incentive stable state (ISS) candidate. For sufficiently large populations, extrema of the stationary distribution are ISS candidates and we give a family of Lyapunov quantities that are locally minimized at the stationary extrema and at ISS candidates. In various examples, including for the Moran and Wright-Fisher processes, we show that the local maxima of the stationary distribution capture the traditionally-defined evolutionarily stable states. The classical stability theory of the replicator dynamic is recovered in the large population limit. Finally we include descriptions of possible extensions to populations of variable size and populations evolving on graphs. corresponding author, email: marc.harper@gmail.com AMS keywords: 91A22, 92D25, 37B25 1 ar X iv :1 31 1. 09 41 v2 [ m at h.

9f8a101162b14e47104ae31ec21bc939c14cfdd5	the basins of attraction of the global minimizers of the non-convex sparse spikes estimation problem		The sparse spike estimation problem consists in estimating a number of off-thegrid impulsive sources from under-determined linear measurements. Information theoretic results ensure that the minimization of a non-convex functional is able to recover the spikes for adequatly chosen measurements (deterministic or random). To solve this problem, methods inspired from the case of finite dimensional sparse estimation where a convex program is used have been proposed. Also greedy heuristics have shown nice practical results. However, little is known on the ideal non-convex minimization to perform. In this article, we study the shape of the global minimum of this non-convex functional: we give an explicit basin of attraction of the global minimum that shows that the non-convex problem becomes easier as the number of measurements grows. This has important consequences for methods involving descent algorithms (such as the greedy heuristic) and it gives insights for potential improvements of such descent methods.	convex function;convex optimization;estimation theory;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);maxima and minima;referring expression generation;sparse matrix	Yann Traonmilin;Jean-François Aujol	2018	CoRR			ML	74.0485147780047	25.439563716516943	16550

The proposed system consists of three phase step-down transformer, three phase thyristor converter used to feed load commutated inverter (LCI) of a synchronous motor (SM) drive and a capacitor at point of common coupling (PCC) for PFC used in the distribution system. The PFC capacitor with a small inductor is designed as a passive filter to mitigate the parallel resonance problem in the distribution system which shifts the parallel resonance frequency at other frequency than the harmonics of the three phase thyristor converter feeding an LCI-fed SM drive. The mitigation of the parallel resonance problem is demonstrated through simulated results in MATLAB with SPS toolboxes to validate the design.	characteristic impedance;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;liquid contact indicator;matlab;portable c compiler;power inverter;powerbuilder foundation classes;resonance;synchronous circuit;thyristor;transformer	Bhim Singh;Ikhlaq Hussain;Ambrish Chandra;Kamal Al-Haddad	2015	2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2015.7356945	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Arch	65.8149350786958	39.78037901843911	16566

Although those oscillations are physically meaningful, finite element approximations experience difficulty in their reconstruction. The relaxation of the nonconvex minimization problem by (semi) convexification leads to a macroscopic model for the effective energy. The resulting discrete macroscopic problem is degenerate in the sense that it is convex but not strictly convex. This paper studies a modified discretization by adding a stabilization term to the discrete energy. It will be proven that for a wide class of problems, this stabilization technique leads to strong H1 convergence of the macroscopic variables even on unstructured triangulations. In contrast to the work [C. Carstensen, P. Plecháĉ, S. Bartels, and A. Prohl, Interfaces Free Bound., 6 (2004), pp. 253–269] on quasi-uniform triangulations, this paper allows for general unstructured shape-regular triangulations and so enables the use of adaptive algorithms for the stabilized formulations.	algorithm;approximation;calculus of variations;convex function;convex hull;convex optimization;discretization;finite element method;gradient;linear programming relaxation;quasi-quotation;semiconductor industry;variational principle	Wolfgang Boiger;Carsten Carstensen	2010	SIAM J.

The capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system strongly depends on the correlation between the antennas. By placing two antennas in a fixed area, it is found that the envelope correlation could be halved simply by proper mutual orientation. The set-ups that maximise the distances between the open ends of the PIFAs yield the lowest mutual coupling as well as the lowest envelope correlations. It is found that the envelope correlation is 0.8 when the PIFAs are oriented in parallel. The envelope correlation can be decreased to 0.4 by rotating one of the PIFAs by 180 degrees.

The proposed approach effectively alleviates the strict stability constraint on the ESR of the output capacitor. Stability of a CMOS LDO with the conventional compensation requires the effective series resistance (ESR) of the output capacitor in a tunnel-like region. With the proposed design approach, an LDO can be stable using an output capacitor without ESR. A 2.5V/150mA LDO has been implemented using a 0.5-μm 1P2M CMOS process. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed LDO is stable with an output capacitor of 0.33μF and no ESR.	cmos;dropout (neural networks);low-dropout regulator	Hsuan-I Pan;Chern-Lin Chen	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e91-c.8.1356	voltage regulator;electronic engineering;capacitor;stability;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;equivalent series resistance;low-dropout regulator;statistics	DB	64.11726832562285	44.61148635305965	16673

Insecure operating conditions are likely to happen in power systems. Reducing the risk associated with this condition, adaptive countermeasures, and self-healing actions are made using the infrastructures of the smart grids. Real-time transient stability assessment is classified into these kinds of applications. Corrective control actions could be taken based on the postfault rotor angle deviations. In this paper, a novel real-time digital signal processing (DSP)-based load angle measurement instrument for synchronous generators is discussed. This real-time instrument is designed for high-precision online applications. In this approach, input signals contain the rotor's shaft position and zero crossing of generator terminal voltage is applied to a DSP board to achieve the online load angle. The proposed load angle measuring instrument is installed and used in many power plants in Iran. The experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and fast response of the proposed instrument.	digital signal processing;ibm power systems;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time clock;real-time transcription;zero crossing	Seyed Mehdi Hosseini;Rohollah Abdollahi;Mehdi Karrari	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2811394	voltage;zero crossing;control engineering;smart grid;permanent magnet synchronous generator;electric power system;rotor (electric);digital signal processing;measuring instrument;engineering	Embedded	67.89509105773732	35.58139587357489	16686

Error bounds are obtained in the W 1,∞ norm uniformly on bounded time intervals and, with an improved approximation order, in the parabolic energy norm. The proofs rely on discrete maximal parabolic regularity.

In fact, in some applications, we show that we cannot estimate the phase of the signal with this transform. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a new transform which allows us to estimate this phase in these particular situations.

In particular, a numerical procedure to design transient limiters with high current rating, low clamping voltage, and low degradation rate is presented and described in detail.

The computational implementation is based on the linear Edge Finite Element Method in 3D isotropic domains because it has the ability to eliminate spurious solutions and is claimed to yield accurate results. The framework structure is able to exploit the embarrassingly-parallel tasks and the advantages of the geometric flexibility as well as to work with three different orientations for the dipole, or excitation source, on unstructured tetrahedral meshes in order to represent complex geological bodies through a local refinement technique.

We study the convergence of classical Lanczos (i.e., without reorthogonalization) to the point where there is a cluster of Ritz values around each eigenvalue of the input matrix A. At that point, convergence to all the eigenvalues can be ascertained if A has no multiple eigenvalues. To eliminate multiple eigenvalues, we disperse them by adding to A a random matrix with a small norm; using high-precision arithmetic, we can perturb the eigenvalues and still produce accurate double-precision results. Our experiments indicate that the speed with which Ritz clusters form depends on the local density of eigenvalues and on the unit roundoff, which implies that we can accelerate convergence by using high-precision arithmetic in computations involving the Lanczos iterates.	computation;double-precision floating-point format;eigenvalue algorithm;experiment;lanczos resampling;perturbation theory;sparse matrix	Alexander Alperovich;Alex Druinsky;Sivan Toledo	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-55224-3_4	iterated function;random matrix;lanczos resampling;computer science;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;computation;matrix (mathematics);symmetric matrix;arithmetic;convergence (routing)	ML	82.49027360542158	23.72889423896825	16898

Kalman filtering has been an effective algorithm for tracking dynamic processes for over four decades. Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) involves design of the information processing algorithm of a network of estimator agents with a two-fold objective: 1) estimate the state of the target of interest and 2) reach a consensus with neighboring estimator agents on the state estimate. We refer to this DKF algorithm as Kalman-Consensus Filter (KCF). The main contributions of this paper are as follows: i) finding the optimal decentralized Kalman-Consensus filter and showing that its computational and communication costs are not scalable in n and ii) introducing a scalable suboptimal Kalman-Consensus Filter and providing a formal stability and performance analysis of this distributed and cooperative filtering algorithm. Kalman-Consensus Filtering algorithm is applicable to sensor networks with variable topology including mobile sensor networks and networks with packet-loss.	algorithm;approximation;computation;cooperative mimo;formal proof;information processing;kalman filter;lyapunov fractal;network packet;numerical stability;scalability;software propagation	Reza Olfati-Saber	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5399678	kalman filter;control engineering;wireless sensor network;information processing;computer science;control theory;distributed computing	Robotics	62.354486566890586	6.152366003673848	16904

Prompt detection of power switchu0027s failure and fault-tolerant operation of multilevel converters have extremely vital significance for high reliability electronic systems. The paper presents a new technique of detecting, identifying, and locating faults of switching devices in an N-Level Flying Capacitor Buck-Boost Converter (FCBBC). The characteristics of inductor current and flying capacitor voltage of FCBBC with different kinds of failure are analyzed. A new fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed to detect and identify the fault on basis of this information. Then the fault-tolerant operation method of the FCBBC is also discussed. The validity of the new control method is demonstrated in the control hardware by experiment result.	boost converter;charge pump;fault tolerance;switch	Sai Tang;Xin Yin;Daming Wang;Chao Zhang;Zhikang Shuai;Xin Yang;Z.

The new algorithms are based on the special linear group SL(n). In order to achieve our target, we first provide a representation theory for any matrix in SL(n), which only simply uses the product of multiple exponentials of traceless matrices. Based on the matrix representation theory, two novel ICA algorithms are developed along with simple analysis on their equilibrium points. Moreover, we apply our methods to the classical problem of signal separation. The experimental results indicate that the superior convergence of our proposed algorithms, which can be expected as two viable alternatives to the ICA algorithms available in publications.	algorithm;independent computing architecture	Hang Tan;Xianhe Huang;Ying Tang;Huachun Tan	2013	IJMSSC	10.1142/S1793962312500286	matrix analysis;independent component analysis;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;special linear group;computer science;mathematics;matrix exponential;matrix	ML	64.95192738515351	20.648196470399352	16994

We show how to control the dual norm of the residual augmented by a nonconformity evaluation term by fully computable estimators. We then decompose the estimators into the space, time, linearization, and algebraic error components. This allows to formulate criteria for stopping the iterative algebraic solver and the iterative linearization solver when the corresponding error components do not affect significantly the overall error. Moreover, the spatial and temporal error components can be balanced by time step and space mesh adaptation. Our analysis applies to a broad class of standard numerical methods, and is independent of the linearization and of the iterative algebraic solvers employed. We exemplify it for the two-point finite volume method with fully implicit Euler time stepping, the Newton linearization, and the GMRes algebraic solver. Numerical results on two real-life reservoir engineering examples confirm that significant computational gains can be achieved thanks to our adaptive stopping criteria, already on fixed meshes, without any noticeable loss of precision.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;computable function;computation;dual norm;euler;exemplification;finite volume method;iterative method;newton;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;real life;solver;stepping level	Daniele A.

It adopts the pre fitting verification algorithm (PREVA) to obtain the fast and accurate gain fitting and verification in two steps, coarse and fine gain fittings. The ear canal modeling filter circuit (EMC) which models the human external ear into the distributed LC filter enables the coarse gain fitting based on the shape of the external ear of the patient. The fine fitting verification is performed by the external inputs from the hearing loss test results. To reduce the power consumption of the human factored hearing aid chip design, the multi-threshold preamplifier, the adaptive fitting digital signal processor (DSP) with the filter reuse technique and the gated successive approximation ADC are designed and embedded to the digital hearing aid chip. The dynamic range of the multi-threshold preamplifier exists from 0.45 V to 0.8 V and dissipates 32 muW from a single 0.9 V supply. The fabricated digital hearing aid chip achieves the peak SNR of 81 dB in the overall system with 4.2 muV of input-referred noise voltage. The fabricated chip occupies the core area of 3.12times1.20 mm2 in a 0.18 mum standard CMOS technology and consumes only 107 muW from a single 0.9 V supply.	algorithm;cmos;core (optical fiber);digital signal processor;dynamic range;embedded system;human factors and ergonomics;lc circuit;low-power broadcasting;preamplifier;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;successive approximation adc	Sunyoung Kim;Seungjin Lee;Namjun Cho;Seong-Jun Song;Hoi-Jun Yoo	2007	2007 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In this paper, we provide neat bounds for the spectral norm and the nuclear norm of a tensor based on tensor partitions. The spectral norm (respectively, the nuclear norm) can be lower and upper bounded by manipulating the spectral norms (respectively, the nuclear norms) of its subtensors. The bounds are sharp in general. When a tensor is partitioned into its matrix slices, our inequalities provide polynomial-time worst-case approximation bounds for computing the spectral norm and the nuclear norm of the tensor.

The optimization procedure is done via a gradient method, while the computation of the eigenvalues themselves is done by means of an efficient meshless numerical method allowing for the computation of the eigenvalues for large numbers of domains within a reasonable time frame. The Dirichlet problem, previously studied by Oudet using a different numerical method, is also studied and we obtain similar (but improved) results for a larger number of eigenvalues. These results reveal an underlying structure to the optimizers regarding symmetry and connectedness, for instance, but also show that there are exceptions to these preventing general results from holding.

We analyzed the properties of the structure for both the TE and TM modes by 2-D FDTD (two-dimensional finite difference time domain) simulation. By optimizing the offset crossing structure, a transmission loss of 0.021dB, and crosstalk of -55.0dB was achieved with a crossing angle of 20 degrees for the TE mode. A transmission loss of 0.070dB, and crosstalk of -48.6dB was also achieved with the same crossing angle for the TM mode. The low losses achieved with a small crossing angle makes this structure very useful for highly integrated optical matrix switches, etc.	crosstalk;integrated circuit;lightwave 3d	Daiki Tanaka;Yuichiro Ikuma;Hiroyuki Tsuda	2009	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.6.407	crossing;electronic engineering;telecommunications;optics;physics;quantum mechanics	HCI	65.67028924202148	55.26376140139453	17103

Two-dimensional IIR adaptive filters can be used in a variety of image and video processing applications. Of primary concern with IIR adaptive filters, whether 1D or 2D, is the possible existence of multiple stationary points on the mean-squared error surface. Gradient based adaptive algorithms can get stuck at suboptimal local minima, rendering themselves less effective. Results show that the 2D IIR mean-squared-error performance surface characteristics are similar to those of the 1D IIR adaptive filter with respect to unimodality of the error surface. The authors explore the mathematical characteristics of the 2D IIR MSE minimization problem. Some simple special cases are examined, and experimental evidence is discussed. >	infinite impulse response;mean squared error	Jeffrey C. Strait;W.

In this context, the stepsize restriction to obtain numerical monotonicity is normally computed using the optimal representation. In this paper we extend the Shu–Osher representations for any Runge–Kutta method giving sufficient conditions for monotonicity. We show how optimal Shu–Osher representations can be constructed from the Butcher tableau of a Runge–Kutta method. The optimum stepsize restriction for monotonicity is given by the radius of absolute monotonicity of the Runge–Kutta method [L. Ferracina and M. N. Spijker, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 42 (2004), pp. 1073–1093], and hence if this radius is zero, the method is not monotone. In the Shu–Osher representation, methods with zero radius require negative coefficients, and to deal with them, an extra associate problem is considered. In this paper we interpret these schemes as representations of perturbed Runge–Kutta methods. We extend the concept of radius of absolute monotonicity and give sufficient conditions for monotonicity. Optimal representations can be constructed from the Butcher tableau of a perturbed Runge–Kutta method.	coefficient;comstock–needham system;linux/rk;long division;method of analytic tableaux;numerical analysis;numerical integration;runge–kutta methods;monotone	Inmaculada Higueras	2005	SIAM J.

The reciprocal vector of the periodicity matrix of tiling is chosen as the unit step of the 1-D sampling. However, in general, reciprocal vectors cannot always be the unit vectors of 1-D samplings for 2-D discrete frequency distributions. The condition for a reciprocal vector to be a unit step of 1-D sampling for 2-D discrete frequency distributions with tiling capability is examined in this brief. The results show that the condition is that two things are satisfied simultaneously for the periodicity matrix of tiling, [M]. When [M] is expressed as [M]=[A][D][B] in the Smith normal form, [A] and [B] are unimodular matrices, and [D] is an integer-valued diagonal matrix. One is that d1 of [D] is 1. The other is that ([A]-1)2,1 and d2 of [D] are congruent. When the condition is satisfied, the reciprocal vector T1 made from [M]-1 can be a unit step of 1-D sampling, where 1-D discrete Fourier transform can be used in the calculation, and the number of sampling points is equal to that of NZ frequency components.	discrete fourier transform;discrete frequency domain;harmonic balance;quasiperiodicity;sampling (signal processing);tiling window manager;unimodular polynomial matrix	Toshihiro Hori	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2015.2469074	sampling;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;time–frequency analysis;harmonic analysis;lattice;mathematical model;mathematics;statistics	Visualization	55.886600090274506	19.238007972509582	17253

By introducing a novel concept of the derivative system for a given bilinear system, it is shown that the Fisher information matrix for a data set generated by a bilinear system with additive Gaussian measurement noise can be expressed explicitly in terms of the outputs of its derivative system which is also bilinear. A connection between the identifiability of the unknown parameters and the output reachability of the derivative system is established. For a bilinear system with a piecewise constant input and uniformly sampled output data, a trackable condition is derived for local identifiability.	bilinear filtering;experiment;fisher information;formation matrix;plasmon;reachability;resonance;utility functions on indivisible goods	Raimund J.

The constrained problem is to minimize a smooth function subject to some quadratic constraints and nonnegative constraints. A good property of the constrained problem is that at any feasible point, the set of all feasible directions coincides with the set of all linearized feasible directions. Consequently, the KKT point always exists. Moreover, we will show that the KKT points are the same as the stationary points of the L1/2 regularization problem. Based on the constrained optimization reformulation, we propose a feasible descent direction method called feasible steepest descent method for solving the unconstrained L1/2 regularization problem. It is an extension of the steepest descent method for solving smooth unconstrained optimization problem. The feasible steepest descent direction has an explicit expression and the method is easy to implement. Under very mild conditions, we show that the proposed method is globally convergent. We apply the proposed method to solve some practical problems arising from compressed sensing.

84f23bf9cb0c5a57929a2ae23887641574ca8637	coefficients of prolongations for symmetries of odes	infinitesimal generator;differential equation	Sophus Lie developed a systematic way to solve ODEs. He found that transformations which form a continuous group and leave a differential equation invariant can be used to simplify the equation. Lie’s method uses the infinitesimal generator of these point transformations. These are symmetries of the equation mapping solutions into solutions. Lie’s methods did not find widespread use in part because the calculations for the infinitesimals were quite lengthy, needing to calculate the prolongations of the infinitesimal generator. Nowadays, prolongations are obtained using Maple or Mathematica, and Lie’s theory has come back to the attention of researchers. In general, the computation of the coefficients of the (n)prolongation is done using recursion formulas. Others have given methods that do not require recursion but use Fréchet derivatives. In this paper, we present a combinatorial approach to explicitly write the coefficients of the prolongations. Besides being novel, this approach was found to be useful by the authors for didactical and combinatorial purposes, as we show in the examples.	coefficient;computation;fréchet derivative;maple;recursion;wolfram mathematica	Ricardo Alfaro;Jim Schaeferle	2004	Int.

It is known that, without volume correction, the method is first order convergent, provided there is a nondegenerate diffusion term. We consider the advective part of the system and give some properties of the weak solution. With these properties we prove that the volume corrected method, with no diffusion term, gives a lower order L1-convergence rate of O(h/√Δt + h + (Δt)r), where r is related to the accuracy of the characteristic tracing. This result compares favorably to Godunov’s method, but avoids the CFL constraint, so large time steps can be taken in practice. In fact, Godunov’s method converges at O(h1/2), which is our result for Δt = Ch, where now C is not limited. However, the optimal choice, Δt = Ch2/(2r+1), gives a better rate, O(h2r/(2r+1)), than Godunov’s method, e.g., O(h2/3) if r = 1. With a nondegenerate diffusion term, we obtain an L2-error estimate for the problem. We also prove the existence of, and give an error estimate for, a perturbed velocity field for which the volume is locally conserved. Finally, some convergence tests are given to verify the optimal convergence rate for r = 1.	courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;godunov's scheme;rate of convergence;velocity (software development)	Todd Arbogast;Wen-Hao Wang	2010	SIAM J.

The Burger’s equation models efficiently certain problems of a fluid flow nature, in which either shocks or viscous dissipation is a significant factor. It can be used as a model for any nonlinear wave propagation problem subject to dissipation [1]. The first steadystate solutions of Burger equation were given by Young et al. [2] However, the equation gets its name from the extensive research of Burger’s [3]. The generalized Burger’s-Huxley introduced by Satsuma shows a prototype model for describing the communication among reaction mechanisms, convection effects, and diffusion transports [4]. Burger-Fisher equation has significant applications in various fields of applied mathematics and has physical applications such as gas dynamic, traffic flow, convection effect, and diffusion transport [5–12]. Marinca and Herişanu et al. introduced a new semianalytic method OHAM for approximate solution of nonlinear problems of thin filmflow of a fourth-grade fluid down a vertical cylinder. In progression of papers Marinca and Herişanu et al. have applied this method for the solution of nonlinear equations arising in the steady state flow of a fourth-grade fluid past a porous plate and for the solution of nonlinear equations arising in heat transfer [13–15]. The method has been applied by a number of researchers for solution of ordinary and partial differential equations [16– 21]. The motivation of this paper is to show the effectiveness of OHAM for the solution of Burger’s-Huxley and Burger’sFisher equations.

The triple-tail cell principle is exploited to obtain a circuit topology suitable to low-voltage high-speed applications, with a very simple structure and thus limited jitter generation. A model is proposed to understand circuit behavior and optimize its design. The PD has been used in a clock-and-data recovery circuit for 10-Gb/s optical communications, and measurements in agreement with SONET specifications are reported.	bicmos;biasing;circuit topology;clock recovery;data recovery;markov chain;online and offline;phase detector;quantum fluctuation;sampling (signal processing);silicon-germanium	Francesco Centurelli;Massimo Pozzoni;Giuseppe Scotti;Alessandro Trifiletti	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The proposed method requires only two capacitors placed between the midpoint and one end of each inverter leg. An original control solution of the inverter ensures the power ripple transfer toward the two decoupling capacitors without affecting the inverter output voltage. The simple design makes the proposed solution easy to adapt for single-phase inverters in H-bridge configuration. This paper focuses on the autonomous operation mode of the inverter, detailing its operating principle and the control analysis.

Previous algorithms for this problem have either required the computation of a matrix nullspace, requiring O(N) computations, or have been iterative in nature; for the latter, the irregularity of the frequency samples precludes use of the fast Fourier transform. Our rst algorithm requires only O(N) computations (O(N logN ) asymptotically). In the special case of equally-spaced frequency samples, it is related to a previous algorithm. The second algorithm is recursive{at each recursion a meaningful magnitude retrieval problem is solved. This is useful for updating a solution; it also allows checking of the result at each recursion, avoiding any errors due to computational roundo error and ill-conditioning of the problem.	algorithm;computation;condition number;discrete-time fourier transform;fast fourier transform;iterative method;kernel (linear algebra)	Andrew E.

The core of this framework is the concept of robust algorithms. Such kind of algorithms have the convenient property that an arbitrary set of degenerate cases can be ignored without loss of generality during proofs of many important properties, e.g., runtime, space requirements, feasibility, competitive and approximation ratios. Here degeneracy is defined as a set of problem instances satisfying a certain property, and this property is independent from both the algorithm under consideration and the specific combinatorial problem structure. It turns out that robustness is related to the tie breaking policy of algorithms in two different ways. On the one hand, the set of inputs where a tie actually occurs is typically (but not always) a degenerate case. On the other hand,we show that for any algorithm there is a way to break ties such that it becomes robust. In particular, robustness is guaranteed by any tie breaking strategy that can be interpreted as symbolic perturbation. For many typical algorithms the implicit usage of symbolic perturbation can be easily verified and so the consideration of degenerate cases can be avoided during their analysis. The concept of robustness also gives a theoretical explanation of why tie breaking does often notmatter at all. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The objective here is to combine the advantages of an adoptive mesh structure with the advantages of kinetic mesh maintenance, and demonstrate their value for dynamic simulation. Despite the theoretical advantages of the Free-Lagrange method, its use has been handicapped with the reconstruction of topology after each time step that considerably reduces the efficiency of the method. In addition, the use of fixed time steps causes problems such as overshoots and undetected collisions. In order to demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to solve these problems, the method is applied to a dam-breaking problem and global tides. With the results obtained from these numerical experiments, the validity of the global kinetic data structure is approved. In particular, the method is found to be more efficient than existing methods. In addition, qualitative comparison of physical results with analytical solutions demonstrates the similarity of the results and confirms the physical validity of the proposed method. Further investigations with real-world data and the complete equation of motion are suggested to compare it with other numerical methods.	experiment;fluid animation;global optimization;kinetic data structure;numerical method;simulation;voronoi diagram	Mir Abolfazl Mostafavi;Christopher M.

7837c2c128a1a82e7b0cb88ef68414408cce4357	dynamic stability enhancement of interconnected multi-source power systems using hierarchical anfis controller-tcsc based on multi-objective pso	hierarchical adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system controller hanfisc thyristor controlled series compensator tcsc automatic generation control agc multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso power system dynamic stability interconnected multi source power systems	Suppression of the dynamic oscillations of tie-line power exchanges and frequency in the affected interconnected power systems due to loading-condition changes has been assigned as a prominent duty of automatic generation control (AGC). To alleviate the system oscillation resulting from such load changes, implementation of flexible AC transmission systems (FACTSs) can be considered as one of the practical and effective solutions. In this paper, a thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC), which is one series type of the FACTS family, is used to augment the overall dynamic performance of a multi-area multi-source interconnected power system. To this end, we have used a hierarchical adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system controller-TCSC (HANFISC-TCSC) to abate the two important issues in multi-area interconnected power systems, i.e., low-frequency oscillations and tie-line power exchange deviations. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization technique is inevitable. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) has been chosen for this optimization problem, owing to its high performance in untangling non-linear objectives. The efficiency of the suggested HANFISC-TCSC has been precisely evaluated and compared with that of the conventional MOPSO-TCSC in two different multi-area interconnected power systems, i.e., two-area hydro-thermal-diesel and three-area hydro-thermal power systems. The simulation results obtained from both power systems have transparently certified the high performance of HANFISC-TCSC compared to the conventional MOPSO-TCSC.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;automatic gain control;computer simulation;diesel;ibm power systems;incidence matrix;inference engine;mathematical optimization;microwave;multi-objective optimization;multi-source;neural oscillation;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;superword level parallelism;thyristor;tie line;zero suppression	Ali Darvish Falehi;Ali Mosallanejad	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1500317	power-flow study;computer science;control theory	HPC	65.14986482568253	36.6641398656117	17708

Because of their small numerical viscosity even when very small time steps are enforced, they look very suitable for acoustic simulations of silencers in internal combustion engines. In this work, a high resolution central scheme has been used with ad-hoc developed boundary conditions for the generation of different acoustic perturbations (white noise, sweep, impulse) in the OpenFOAMR © technology. The temporal solution, carried out by a fourth order explicit integration of the conservation laws by the Runge-Kutta method, has been first transferred into the frequency domain using FFT and then it has processed to evaluate the transmission loss (by the two-microphone technique) and the transfer function of different geometries of silencers for internal combustion engines. The results obtained from the simulations have been compared with experimental data. Corresponding author: Tel. (+39) 02 2399 8620, Fax (+39) 02 2399 3863, e-mail: federico.piscaglia@polimi.it Tel.

This method employs a body-fitted unstructured mesh where the interfaces between liquids are lines of the mesh system, and the triple junction points (if exist) are mesh nodes. To enhance the accuracy and the efficiency of the method, the mesh is constantly adapted to the evolution of the interfaces by refining and coarsening the mesh locally; dynamic boundary conditions on interfaces, in particular the triple points, are therefore incorporated naturally and accurately in a finite-element formulation. In order to allow pressure discontinuity across interfaces, double-values of pressure are necessary for interface nodes and triple-values of pressure on triple junction points. The resulting non-linear system of mass and momentum conservation is then solved by an Uzawa method, with the zero resultant condition on triple points reinforced at each time step. The method is used to investigate the rising of a liquid drop with an attached bubble in a lighter liquid.	euler method;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field	Jie Li	2013	J. Comput.

9ef26ecbadc060dc63a4ee02d2caa7386e3e2d09	a splitting preconditioner for toeplitz-like linear systems arising from fractional diffusion equations		In this paper, we study Toeplitz-like linear systems arising from time-dependent onedimensional and two-dimensional Riesz space-fractional diffusion equations with variable diffusion coefficients. The coefficient matrix is a sum of a scalar identity matrix and a diagonal-times-Toeplitz matrix which allows fast matrix-vector multiplication in iterative solvers. We propose and develop a splitting preconditioner for this kind of matrix and analyze the spectra of the preconditioned matrix. Under mild conditions on variable diffusion coefficients, we show that the singular values of the preconditioned matrix are bounded above and below by positive constants which are independent of temporal and spatial discretization step-sizes. When the preconditioned conjugate gradient squared method is employed to solve such preconditioned linear systems, the method converges linearly within an iteration number independent of the discretization step-sizes. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate that the performance of the proposed preconditioner is better than other tested solvers.	coefficient;conjugate gradient method;discretization;iteration;linear system;matrix multiplication;numerical method;preconditioner;rate of convergence;toeplitz hash algorithm	Xue-lei Lin;Michael K.

The ADDLL uses a novel complementary delay line with lattice-type delay elements. The complementary line can effectively reduce at most 50% active delay elements than a single line. Less active delay elements make better suppression of supply-induced jitter. The lattice-type delay element is beneficial to high frequency applications because of its small intrinsic delay. The ADDLL employs a 9-bit configurable SAR controller to achieve fast lock. Moreover, it can work in a wide-range application (200MHz ∼ 2GHz) without the harmonic-lock problem of conventional SAR controllers. Under a 1.1V power supply, the ADDLL has a delay resolution of 8 ps and the lock time is 36 cycles at 200 MHz and 24 cycles at 2GHz.	analog delay line;cmos;delay line memory;delay-locked loop;digital delay line;dynamic-link library;power supply;zero suppression	Shuai Chen;Hao Li;Kai Jia;Yue Wang;Xiaobing Shi;Feng Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271616	electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;delay calculation;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;group delay and phase delay;harmonic analysis;lattice;control theory;mathematics;delay line oscillator	Arch	60.33888125017332	51.034849421434856	17891

So, there are now many sparse recovery algorithms (and program codes) available. However, most of these algorithms have been developed for real-valued systems. This paper discusses an approach for using available real-valued algorithms (or program codes) to solve complex-valued problems, too. The basic idea is to convert the complex-valued problem to an equivalent real-valued problem and solve this new real-valued problem using any real-valued sparse recovery algorithm. Theoretical guarantees for the success of this approach will be discussed, too. On the other hand, a widely used sparse recovery idea is finding the minimum ℓ1 norm solution. For real-valued systems, this idea requires to solve a linear programming (LP) problem, but for complex-valued systems it needs to solve a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which demands more computational load. However, based on the approach of this paper, the complex case can also be solved by linear programming, although the theoretical guarantee for finding the sparse solution is more limited.	algorithm;code;compressed sensing;computation;linear equation;linear programming;second-order cone programming;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;taxicab geometry	Arsalan Sharif-Nassab;Milad Kharratzadeh;Massoud Babaie-Zadeh;Christian Jutten	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		mathematical optimization;basic solution;theoretical computer science;machine learning;sparse approximation;mathematics;compressed sensing	Theory	75.65507606652025	26.79540992211392	17962

We introduce an optimized parallelization scheme that reduces communication overhead between computational nodes. We demonstrate that the compute time, t, scales inversely with the number of computational nodes as t ∝ (Nnodes). This makes it possible to solve the 3d Schrödinger equation on extremely large spatial lattices using a small computing cluster. In addition, we present a new method for precisely determining the energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions of quantum states based on a symmetry constraint on the FDTD initial condition. Finally, we discuss the usage of multi-resolution techniques in order to speed up convergence on extremely large lattices.	blocking (computing);booting;boundary case;computation;computer cluster;finite difference;finite-difference time-domain method;ground state;initial condition;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;non-blocking algorithm;open-source software;overhead (computing);parallel algorithm;parallel computing;quantum state;schrödinger;stationary state	Michael Strickland;David Yager-Elorriaga	2010	J.

The crack model used promotes discontinuities in both transversal displacements and rotation due to bending. To solve the buckling problem, the perturbationmethod is used, considering that the solutions for both the cracked and the uncracked columns are slightly different. This procedure leads to firstorder closed-form expressions for the buckling loads of the Timoshenko cracked column, which were compared with those found by directly solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem, establishing validity limits for these solutions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The third algorithm adaptively estimates local Lipschitz constants during the search. All the methods either find the minimal root or determine the global minimizers (in the case when the equation under consideration has no roots).

Using a contraction approach, we derive a connection between a system's intra-dynamics and its neighboring systems. We then show that the design of regulatory controllers is equivalent to a linear feasibility problem on the order of the number of systems. We illustrate our main result using a disturbance mitigation problem, where the goal is to design controllers at a subset of nodes to drive the global nodal values to a particular value in the presence of destabilizing forces. We note that our main result is especially applicable to networks that exhibit interconnection variability and intermittent subsystem faults, like energy grids.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;graphical user interface;interconnection;overhead (computing);spatial variability;spectral method	Jordan J.

c2010b1bbdbfca71155348250f8367e3fe582eb6	computational efficiency and accuracy of sequential nonlinear cyclic analysis of carbon nanotube nanocomposites		Abstract The accuracy and efficiency of a numerical strategy for sequential nonlinear cyclic analyses of carbon nanotube nanocomposites are investigated. The computational approach resorts to a nonlinear 3D finite element implementation that seeks to solve the cyclic hysteretic response of the nanocomposite. A variant of the Newton-Raphson method within a time integration scheme is proposed whereby the elastic tangent matrix is chosen as iteration matrix without paying the price of its iterative update. This is especially rewarding in the context of the employed mechanical model which exhibits hysteresis manifested through a discontinuous change in the stiffness at the reversal points where the loading direction is reversed. Key implementation aspects – such as the integration of the nonlinear 3D equations of motion, the numerical accuracy/efficiency as a function of the time step or the mesh size – are discussed. In particular, efficiency is regarded as performing fast computations especially when the number of cyclic analyses becomes large.

In addition to the linear constraints present in the CNLMS algorithm, the L1-WCNLMS and the L1-CNLMS algorithms take into account an L1-norm penalty on the filter coefficients, which results in sparse solutions producing thinned arrays. The effectiveness of both algorithms is demonstrated via computer simulations. When employing these algorithms to antenna array problems, the resulting effect due to the L1-norm constraint is perceived as a large aperture array with few active elements. Although this work focuses the algorithm on antenna array synthesis, its application is not limited to them, i.e., the L1-CNLMS is suitable to solve other problems like sparse system identification and signal reconstruction, where the weighted version, the L1-WCNLMS algorithm, presents superior performance compared to the L1-CNLMS algorithm.	adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;coefficient;computer simulation;least mean squares filter;signal reconstruction;sparse matrix;system identification;taxicab geometry	Jose Francisco de Andrade;Marcello Luiz Rodrigues de Campos;José Antonio Apolinário	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2474302	mathematical optimization;convergence;computer science;machine learning;mathematics	Visualization	62.406353774670734	13.068346908655482	18157

In the present model, the graph describing the communication topology among the followers is assumed to be fixed and directed, but does not need to meet any connectivity condition. Furthermore, it is assumed that output information of the leader is only available to a small fraction of the followers. To achieve containment, a kind of distributed controllers based only on the local state information is exploited. Under the assumptions that the dynamics of the leaders are detectable and that each follower can directly or indirectly receive information from at least one leader, some sufficient conditions for achieving containment are provided and analyzed.	academy;local variable;multi-agent system;norm (social);path (graph theory);systems science	Guanghui Wen;Zhisheng Duan;Wenwu Yu;Guanrong Chen	2013		10.3182/20130902-3-CN-3020.00191	control theory;distributed computing	AI	64.2336636659881	5.154893818001935	18207

Whether a particular player is leader or follower depends on the instrument variable s/he is controlling, and it is possible for a player to be both leader and follower, depending on the control variable. The paper studies two-player open-loop differential games in this framework, and obtains a complete set of equations (differential and algebraic) which yield the controls in the mixed-leadership Stackelberg solution. The underlying differential equations are coupled and have mixed-boundary conditions. The paper also discusses the special case of linear-quadratic differential games, in which case solutions to the coupled differential equations can be expressed in terms of solutions to coupled Riccati differential equations which are independent of the state trajectory. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

d32ef00823b5bd31c2c6ad7e28908f55a7e7c4dd	investigation on low voltage operation of electrovibration display	perceived intensity electrovibration low voltage operation lateral vibration;force friction frequency modulation vibrations electrostatics low voltage dynamics	This paper presents three methods of input voltage signals that allow low voltage operation of an electrovibration display while preserving the perceptual feel and strength of electrovibration stimuli. The first method uses the amplitude modulation of a high-frequency carrier-signal. The second method uses a dc-offset, and the third method uses a combination of the two methods. The performance of the three methods was evaluated by a physical experiment that measured and analyzed static (dc-component) and dynamic (vibratory component) friction forces and two subsequent psychophysical studies. The physical experiment showed that only the dc -offset method enabled a statistically significant increase in the static friction force between the fingertip and the surface of the electrovibration display. The static friction increase was closely related to the root mean square of input voltage level. In contrast, all of the three methods increased the dynamic friction force significantly, which was deemed to be related to the high frequency effect validated in the previous literature. The first psychophysical study showed that the three proposed methods can significantly reduce the peak-to-peak (p-p) amplitude of an input voltage signal while generating perceptually equally strong electrovibrations to that produced by the conventional method. Using lower p-p voltage has the merits of a simpler electrical circuit and less electromagnetic noise, saving the overall system cost. Further, the perceived intensity of electrovibration was more correlated to the dynamic friction force than the static friction force. The second psychophysical study was a discrimination experiment, and it demonstrated that all the three proposed methods and the conventional method can provide perceptually similar stimuli despite their different signal forms and voltage amplitudes. Our experimental investigation allowed us to conclude that the dc-offset method is the best way to lower the driving voltage of an electrovibration display while providing perceptually equivalent electrovibrations.	experiment;fingertip dosing unit;friction;mean squared error;modulation;voltage	Jeonggoo Kang;Heewon Kim;Seungmoon Choi;Ki-Duk Kim;Jeha Ryu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2016.2635145	electrovibration;voltage;control engineering;electrical network;amplitude;frequency modulation;computer science;low voltage;vibration;electronic engineering;root mean square	HCI	71.3562266526386	40.63999707023532	18247

Specifically, we focus on the implementation of a conjugate gradient algorithm for a transputer-based machine. After discussing communication, harnesses, we present strategies for decomposing the algorithm on a transputer array, and report the results of measurements of speed-ups for some practical reservoir problems. We then address the problemsof preconditioning by first implementing distributed forms of three standard iterative algorithms, namely Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over-relaxation, and determining their convergence and speed-up properties. On the basis of these measurements, we suggest that a Jacobi preconditioned conjugate gradient (JPCG) algorithm appears likely to be the most cost-effective for the class of problems under considerations. Finally we implement the JPCG algorithm and present measurements in support of our claim.		M. A. Baker;K. C. Bowler;R. D.

The strategy is motivated by the observation that the preconditioned minimal residual method with the inverse of the absolute value of the coefficient matrix as a preconditioner converges to the exact solution of the system in at most two steps. Neither the exact absolute value of the coefficient matrix, nor its exact inverse are computationally feasible to construct in general. However, as the proof of concept, we provide two practical examples of SPD preconditioners, which are based on the suggested approach, called absolute value preconditioning. The first example is for strictly (block) diagonally dominant coefficient matrices, where we propose using the inverse to the absolute value of the (block) diagonal as the preconditioner. Our second example is less intuitive. We consider a model problem with a shifted discrete negative Laplacian, and suggest a geometric multigrid preconditioner, where the inverse to the absolute value of the coefficient matrix appears only on the coarse grid, while operations on finer grids are based on the Laplacian. Our numerical tests demonstrate practical effectiveness of the new multigrid preconditioner for moderately small shifts.	coefficient;diagonally dominant matrix;generalized minimal residual method;linear system;multigrid method;numerical analysis;preconditioner	Eugene Vecharynski;Andrew V.

The integration of dynamic data can be expressed as an inverse problem: the purpose is to identify a set of porosity/permeability values which allows for reproducing the available data. This issue motivated the development of geostatistical-based parameterization techniques, which make it possible to vary the spatial distribution of porosity/permeability values within the geological model from a reduced number of parameters while preserving their spatial variabilities. This paper introduces first an algorithm for performing cosimulation, then a new method for continuously modifying realizations representing porosity or permeability fields. This one consists of simulating cross-correlated Gaussian random functions with identical means and covariances. The realizations resulting from the cosimulation process depend on the linear correlation coefficients between the random functions considered. Variations in these correlation coefficients induce variations in the realizations. Then, the proposed cosimulation perturbation method is incorporated into a history-matching process to calibrate porosity and permeability fields to dynamic data. The parameters to be adjusted are the various correlation coefficients. Last, an example is shown to stress the potential of the method.	dynamic data;perturbation theory	Mickaële Le Ravalec;Sébastien Da Veiga	2011	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2010.10.013	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;inverse problem;calculus;mathematics;statistics	SE	96.33019784280775	8.304846440189063	18294
287db8b5b3cf73c58564d6cdb2313e0e856bcb76	maximally concentrated sequences in both time and linear canonical transform domains		In signal analysis based on linear canonical transform (LCT), researchers often seek signal designs that have the greatest concentrations simultaneously in both time and LCT domains. This paper investigates the extent to which a sequence and its LCT can be simultaneously concentrated in their respective domains. Firstly, the most concentration of indexlimited sequences in LCT domain is derived. Then, the most concentration of (a, b, c, d)-bandlimited sequences in time domain is given. It is shown that the discrete generalized prolate spheroidal sequences (DGPSSs), which generalize the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences proposed by Slepian for Fourier transform to LCT, do the best job of simultaneous concentrations in both time and LCT domains. Associated with DGPSSs are certain related functions of frequency in LCT domain, called discrete generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions (DGPSWFs). Some interesting properties of DGPSWFs as well as two relationships between DGPSSs and DGPSWFs are also presented.	linear canonical transformation;prolate spheroidal wave function;signal processing	Hui Zhao;Ruyan Wang;Daiping Song;Dapeng Wu	2014	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-012-0309-1	telecommunications;calculus;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	55.461564390521815	17.684703401331564	18305

144322206f4c9fcab2e70a293ca87a35c9187248	a simpler approach to low-rank tensor canonical polyadic decomposition		In this paper we present a simple and efficient method to compute the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of generic low-rank tensors using elementary linear algebra. The key insight is that all the columns in a low-rank tensor lie in a low-dimensional subspace, and that the coefficients of the columns in each slice with respect to the right basis are scaled copies of one an other. The basis, together with the coefficients of a few carefully selected columns determine the CPD. The computational complexity of our method scales linearly in the order and the rank of the tensor, and at most quadratically in its largest dimension. Furthermore, our approach can be easily adapted to noisy settings. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments that support our findings.	coefficient;collaborative product development;column (database);computational complexity theory;experiment;linear algebra	Daniel L.

The idea of the SR28FFT algorithm is from the modified split radix FFT (MSRFFT) algorithm, and its purpose is to furnish other algorithms with high efficiency but without shortcomings of the MSRFFT algorithm. A novel radix-2/4 FFT (NR24FFT) algorithm and a novel radix-2/8 FFT (NR28FFT) algorithm are proposed. These two algorithms use SR28FFT to calculate their sub-DFTs of odd-indexed terms. Several aspects of the two algorithms such as computational complexity, computation accuracy, and coefficient evaluations or accesses to the lookup table all are improved. The bit-reverse method can be used for their order permutation and no extra memory is required to store their extra coefficients by the two novel algorithms, which contribute significantly to the performance of the FFT algorithms. The SR28FFT algorithm can also be applied to other algorithms whose decomposition contains sub-DFTs of powers-of-two. The Appendix presents an algorithm named SR28FFT-2 for further reducing the number of arithmetic operations, and NR24FFT and NR28FFT algorithms based on SR28FFT-2 requires fewer real operations than that required by the MSRFFT algorithm.	coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;cooley–tukey fft algorithm;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;lookup table;split-radix fft algorithm	Weihua Zheng;Keqin Li;Keqin Li	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2310434	arithmetic;fast fourier transform;twiddle factor;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;ramer–douglas–peucker algorithm;lookup table;cooley–tukey fft algorithm;split-radix fft algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;bruun's fft algorithm;mathematics;accuracy and precision;rader's fft algorithm;computational complexity theory;prime-factor fft algorithm;algorithm;cornacchia's algorithm;memory management	Visualization	57.583221670294556	21.576460641720832	18350

Olsson, G. Kreiss, A conservative level set method for two phase flow, J. Comput. Phys. 210 (2005) 225–246] with a ghost fluid approach. By employing a hyperbolic tangent level set function that is transported and re-initialized using fully conservative numerical schemes, mass conservation issues that are known to affect level set methods are greatly reduced. In order to improve the accuracy of the conservative level set method, high order numerical schemes are used. The overall robustness of the numerical approach is increased by computing the interface normals from a signed distance function reconstructed from the hyperbolic tangent level set by a fast marching method. The convergence of the curvature calculation is ensured by using a least squares reconstruction. The ghost fluid technique provides a way of handling the interfacial forces and large density jumps associated with two-phase flows with good accuracy, while avoiding artificial spreading of the interface. Since the proposed approach relies on partial differential equations, its implementation is straightforward in all coordinate systems, and it benefits from high parallel efficiency. The robustness and efficiency of the approach is further improved by using implicit schemes for the interface transport and re-initialization equations, as well as for the momentum solver. The performance of the method is assessed through both classical level set transport tests and simple two-phase flow examples including topology changes. It is then applied to simulate turbulent atomization of a liquid Diesel jet at Re 1⁄4 3000. The conservation errors associated with the accurate conservative level set technique are shown to remain small even for this complex case. 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1. Motivation and objectives In most propulsion devices, the fuel is introduced in liquid form in a combustion chamber, where it undergoes atomization, evaporation, mixing with air, and chemical reactions in the combustion process. Since the atomization process governs the liquid droplet diameter distribution, it strongly affects both the subsequent evaporation and combustion. Consequently, full predictive capabilities for numerical tools will only be achieved once the atomization is accurately modeled. However, no satisfying models exist to this date, mostly because of the high complexity of the physics involved. Surface instabilities, ligament formation, ligament stretching and fragmentation, and droplet coalescence, all interact with turbulence to transform large scale coherent liquid structures into small scale droplets. Such a problem has scarcely been studied numerically, because it poses several great challenges. . All rights reserved. dins). 8396 O. Desjardins et al. / Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 8395–8416 The first challenge lies in the fact that the material properties, such as density and viscosity, are different in the two phases. Hence, a flow solver needs to be capable of handling large density ratios, of the order of 40 for Diesel engines, up to several hundreds for aircraft engines. Second, one of the characteristics of liquid–gas flows is the presence of a surface tension force, which exists only at the interface between the liquid and the gas. The singular nature of this force leads to a difficult discretization. High robustness is therefore required from the flow solver. A third challenge lies in the interface localization and transport. While many approaches have been developed, they all suffer from various limitations, so that no clear gold standard exists today. Prerequisites for such methods include high accuracy, robustness, and the capability of accurately extracting the interface normals and curvature. Moreover, in the case of incompressible flows, the interface transport and localization should ensure that the volume of each phase is exactly conserved. Another challenge comes from the small scales that the atomization process produces. The formation of always smaller liquid structures leads to a multiscale problem that requires high resolution to tackle, and that will generally generate liquid structures at the limit of numerical resolution. Among the available strategies to numerically transport an interface, the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method [1] is one of the most popular. Because it relies on a liquid volume fraction scalar to represent the interface, this method ensures discrete mass conservation. However, since the VOF scalar is discontinuous across the interface, a specific geometric advection scheme is required, which puts constraints on both the accuracy of the method and the time step size. Additionally, accessing quantities such as the interface normals or curvature can prove challenging. The front-tracking approach was introduced by Unverdi and Tryggvason [2]. It consists of discretizing the interface using an unstructured moving mesh that is transported in a Lagrangian fashion. While enjoying the benefit of a purely Lagrangian transport, this method requires frequent mesh rearrangements that affect the conservation of the liquid volume. Moreover, the parallelization of such a method is very challenging. The main limitation of this approach is the lack of automatic topology modification. Any interface merging or break-up events have to be handled manually, which can be a complex procedure, especially for three-dimensional simulations. Since topology changes are extremely frequent in primary atomization, front-tracking methods seem unadapted. The level set method [3,4] aims at representing the interface implicitly by an iso-level of a smooth function. This smooth function is preserved with a re-initialization process. Simple Eulerian scalar transport schemes can be used to transport this function, and therefore highly accurate methods are available. Moreover, parallelization is straightforward and highly efficient, and the smoothness of the level set function makes the interface normals and curvature readily available. However, level set methods are typically plagued by mass conservation issues, for no inherent conservation property of the level set function exists. This represents a severe drawback to level set methods, considering that inaccuracies in the liquid mass of fuel in a reactive simulation could lead to large errors in quantities such as temperature, or pollutant mass fractions. In order to improve the mass conservation property of the level set method, several hybrid approaches have been proposed. Enright et al. [5] proposed a particle level set method (PLS), where Lagrangian markers are employed to correct the front location predicted by Eulerian transport. Sussman et al. [6] proposed to couple a level set method with the VOF technique (CLSVOF), hence benefiting from both the good mass conservation property of the VOF approach and the smooth interface description of the level set method. While both these methods have been quite successful, they suffer from additional problems. Their cost is typically much greater than the cost of a simple level set method, because many particles per cell are required for an accurate solution for the PLS approach, and because of the time step size restrictions for the geometric transport of the VOF scalar for the CLSVOF method. Moreover, the complexity of these techniques is significantly greater than that of a classical level set method. Another attempt to alleviate the mass conservation issue of level set methods has been to refine the mesh locally in order to decrease the numerical errors associated with level set transport and re-initialization. This refinement can be used for the level set equation only, such as in the case of the refined level set grid (RLSG) method of Herrmann [7], or it can be a standard arbitrary mesh refinement (AMR) approach, where the Navier–Stokes equations are also solved on the refined mesh [8]. While this approach ensures a good resolution of all structures, it remains both challenging to implement on parallel systems and significantly more expensive than classical methods. Moreover, the time step size in the case of strong local refinement is likely to be extremely restrictive. Recently, Olsson and Kreiss [9] and Olsson et al. [10] proposed a simple modification to the level set method in order to reduce mass conservation errors while retaining the simplicity of the original method. By replacing the usual signed distance function of the classical level set approach by a hyperbolic tangent profile that is transported and re-initialized using conservative equations, they showed in Olsson and Kreiss [9] that the mass conservation errors could be reduced by an order of magnitude in comparison with the results obtained with a signed distance function. In Olsson et al. [10], they improved their re-initialization equation, and further studied their approach in the context of finite elements. The work presented here is based on the conservative level set method with the improved re-initialization equation from Olsson et al. [10]. However, the choice was made to remain in the context of finite difference methods. Starting from the observation that the conservative level set approach is difficult to use in the context of complex turbulent flows, several key modifications to this approach are introduced, resulting in both improved accuracy and robustness. Different strategies have been developed to handle the large density ratio and the surface tension force in a flow solver. The continuum surface force approach (CSF) [11] spreads out both the density jump and the surface tension force over a few cells surrounding the interface in order to facilitate the numerical discretization. Consequently, this approach tends to misrepresent the smallest front structures.

This technique has been widely used in military applications, for its recognized anti-jamming performance, and in some wireless standards such as GSM and Bluetooth, for its interference resistance. Modern FH systems employ partial digital technology and their performance depends on the hopping bandwidth. The wider is the hopping bandwidth the greater is the performance. The width of the hopping bandwidth is one of the factors that limits the usage of fully digital technology for FH systems. In [7] we proposed a fully digital FH architecture based on polyphase channelizers. In this paper, we extend the proposed transmitting architecture to a multi-carrier frequency hopping (MCFH) system. The proposed structure is composed of a cascade of two polyphase up converter channelizers. The first one performs the M-FSK (or BFSK) modulation while the second one accomplishes the task of hopping the modulated spectra independently over L subcarriers under the control of pseudorandom sequence generators. In this paper, both theoretical aspects and simulation results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed fully digital structure, are provided.	bluetooth;carrier frequency;digital electronics;electronic counter-countermeasure;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);modulation;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;pseudorandom number generator;pseudorandomness;radio jamming;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter	Fred Harris;Elettra Venosa;Xiaofei Chen	2015	MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357548	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	59.29912082709724	57.52682089287648	18363

The novel TIWLS estimator exploits the weighted least squares (WLS) technique to reuse the discarded information of the previous harmonic Aboutanios and Mulgrew (HAM) algorithm. Consequently, the TIWLS method can reduce the main estimation error in HAM estimator caused by the maximum bin search. The entire two-step estimation scheme has the same order complexity as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which is computationally efficient. Simulation results are presented to test the TIWLS algorithm, demonstrating that the new TIWLS estimator always outperforms HAM method with less oscillation.		Jiadong Sun;Elias Aboutanios;David B.

This method obtains system state estimate and covariances using the principle of robust estimation. Subsequently, the importance density is obtained by adjusting the state estimate and covariances through the equivalent weight function and adaptive factor constructed from predicted residuals to control the contributions to the new state estimation from measurement and kinematic model. The proposed method can not only minimize the variance of the importance density distribution to resist the disturbances of systematic noises, but it also fully takes advantage of present measurement information to avoid particle degeneration.

Magnetically labeled biosensors are proposed as a promising candidate to potentially eliminate or augment the optical instruments used by conventional fluorescence-based sensors. However, magnetic biosensors developed thus far require externally generated magnetic biasing fields [1–4] and/or exotic post-fabrication processes [1,2]. This limits the ultimate form-factor of the system, total power consumption, and cost. To address these impediments, we present a low-power scalable frequency-shift magnetic particle biosensor array in bulk CMOS, which provides single-bead detection sensitivity without any (electrical or permanent) external magnets.	biasing;cmos;form factor (design);low-power broadcasting;scalability;sensor;software portability	Hua Wang;Arjang Hassibi;Axel Scherer;Ali Hajimiri	2009	2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977496	magnetic nanoparticles;electronic engineering;point of care;form factor;computer science;sensor;electrical engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;oscillation;cmos;sensor array;physics;quantum mechanics;magnetic particle inspection;biosensor	EDA	54.643857020718414	47.14567580674064	18507

In order to improve these problems, this paper has proposed a new system design with an ARM microprocessor as the control core. The dimming data transmission follows the DMX512 protocol, so a digital PWM controller was used to generate duty-cycle adjustable PWM signal. The drive circuit controlled the IGBT device to turn-on and turn-off. Therefore, the brightness of lamp is adjustable through the dimming system. The experimental results have shown the perfect performance of simple operation and stable dimming effect of our system, which can satisfied the demand of stage dimming for modern performing places.	arm architecture;dmx512;duty cycle;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;lighting control system;microcomputer;microprocessor;pulse-width modulation;scalability;systems design	Hui Ren;Zhang Liu;Shuwei Li	2017	2017 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960077	data transmission;scalability;control theory;embedded system;stage lighting;dmx512;digital control;computer science;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;pulse-width modulation	Robotics	61.198366893930555	44.01984054838725	18530

This is because the reduced representation of the state vector appears as an argument to the nonlinear function, whose evaluation remains as costly as for the full model. Masked projection approaches, such as the missing point estimation and the (discrete) empirical interpolation method, alleviate this effect by evaluating only a small subset of the components of a given nonlinear term; however, the selection of the evaluated components is a combinatorial problem and is computationally intractable even for systems of small size. This has been addressed through greedy point selection algorithms, which minimize an error indicator by sequentially looping over all components. While doable, this is suboptimal and still costly. This paper introduces an approach to accelerate and improve the greedy search. The method is based on the observation that the greedy algorithm requires solving a sequence of symmetric rank-one modifications to an eigenvalue problem. For doing so, we develop fast approximations that sort the set of candidate vectors that induce the rank-one modifications, without requiring solution of the modified eigenvalue problem. Based on theoretical insights into symmetric rank-one eigenvalue modifications, we derive a variation of the greedy method that is faster than the standard approach and yields better results for the cases studied. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments, where we observe a speed-up by two orders of magnitude when compared to the standard greedy method while arriving at a better quality reduced model.	approximation;approximation algorithm;basis (linear algebra);column (database);computation;computational complexity theory;discretization;experiment;galerkin method;greedy algorithm;interpolation;iteration;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;symmetric rank-one	Ralf Zimmermann;Karen Willcox	2016	SIAM J.

b5744464d7e4e26486c4c54ab9af7929c0d69bb3	a computationally-efficient, semi-implicit, iterative method for the time-integration of reacting flows with stiff chemistry	iterative method;stiff chemistry;numerical integration;semi implicit preconditioning	A semi-implicit preconditioned iterative method is proposed for the time-integration of the stiff chemistry in simulations of unsteady reacting flows, such as turbulent flames, using detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. Emphasis is placed on the simultaneous treatment of convection, diffusion, and chemistry, without using operator splitting techniques. The preconditioner corresponds to an approximation of the diagonal of the chemical Jacobian. Upon convergence of the sub-iterations, the fully-implicit, second-order time-accurate, Crank-Nicolson formulation is recovered. Performance of the proposed method is tested theoretically and numerically on one-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional high Karlovitz turbulent premixed n-heptane/air flames. The species lifetimes contained in the diagonal preconditioner are found to capture all critical small chemical timescales, such that the largest stable time step size for the simulation of the turbulent flame with the proposed method is limited by the convective CFL, rather than chemistry. The theoretical and numerical stability limits are in good agreement and are independent of the number of sub-iterations. The results indicate that the overall procedure is secondorder accurate in time, free of lagging errors, and the cost per iteration is similar to that of an explicit time integration. The theoretical analysis is extended to a wide range of flames (premixed and non-premixed), unburnt conditions, fuels, and chemical mechanisms. In all cases, the proposed method is found (theoretically) to be stable and to provide good convergence rate for the sub-iterations up to a time step size larger than 1 μs. This makes the proposed method ideal for the simulation of turbulent flames.	approximation;approximation algorithm;computer simulation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;crank (person);crank–nicolson method;flame (malware);hoare logic;iteration;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;laminar-turbulent transition;list of operator splitting topics;next-generation access;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;numerical stability;order of accuracy;preconditioner;rate of convergence;semiconductor industry;simulation;surround sound;test case;turbulence;xfig	B.

78f4bc3b09f7a59d24d8b680675b159fe89aaae7	behavioral modeling of a sensor interface circuit including various non-idealities		In modern CMOS processes, several non-ideal influences affect the functionality of integrated circuits. In order to analyze and reduce these influences, time intensive circuit simulations are performed at transistor level. Although numerous non-idealities are considered in such simulations, they cannot be analyzed separately since they are inherent parts of the transistor models and cannot be faded out. In this work, a solution to this problem is presented: the use of Verilog-A/MS behavioral models in combination with Response Surface Modeling. Since error sources can easily be switched on and off in these models, their influence on circuit parameters can be examined individually. Moreover, the required simulation time is drastically reduced by using these models. A 65nm CMOS sensor interface is selected to demonstrate the advantages of the introduced approach. The interface is transferred from transistor to behavioral level before both circuit representations are compared in various simulations.	behavioral modeling;cmos;integrated circuit;response surface methodology;simulation;transistor model;verilog;verilog-a	Sascha Heinssen;Maike Taddiken;Theodor Hillebrand;Steffen Paul;Dagmar Peters-Drolshagen	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design (SMACD)	10.1109/SMACD.2017.7981576	capacitor;transistor model;cmos sensor;behavioral modeling;semiconductor device modeling;transistor;integrated circuit;cmos;electronic engineering;computer science	EDA	60.55166260297729	44.60345715489988	18884

These systems often arise from discretizing partial differential equations over unstructured meshes, and the particular parameters or geometry of the physical problem being discretized may be unavailable to the solver. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) and multilevel domain decomposition methods of algebraic type have been of particular interest in this context because of their promises of optimal performance without the need for explicit knowledge of the problem geometry. These methods construct a hierarchy of coarse problems based on the linear system itself and on certain assumptions about the smooth components of the error. For smoothed aggregation (SA) methods applied to discretizations of elliptic problems, these assumptions typically consist of knowledge of the near-nullspace of the weak form. This paper introduces an extension of the SA method in which good convergence properties are achieved in situations where explicit knowledge of the near-nullspace components is unavailable. This extension is accomplished by using the method itself to determine near-nullspace components and adjusting the coarsening processes accordingly.	aggregate data;algebraic data type;automatic parallelization;black box;cpu cache;discretization;domain decomposition methods;gauss–seidel method;heuristic (computer science);image scaling;iteration;iterative method;kernel (linear algebra);linear programming relaxation;linear system;matrix multiplication;multigrid method;parallel computing;polynomial;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;smoothed analysis;smoothing;solver;sparse matrix;speedup	Marian Brezina;Robert D.

867e9014f883698ae6c3cc7bf161a0b1b0689caa	improvement of efficiency of multi-parallel dynamic wireless power transfer system with lcc topology		Wireless power transfer (WPT) for moving electric vehicles has been widely studied. LCC topology was proposed as a novel compensation circuit for dynamic WPT (DWPT) because inverter current is suppressed automatically according to the decrease in coupling coefficient. In addition, its characteristic enables a DWPT system to connect multiple transmitter coils to a single inverter. This paper proposed an optimal load condition under a multi-parallel operation considering waiting loss. Moreover, two types of LCC topologies are approximated into a Series-Series compensation topology, and the effective range of that approximation is derived. Calculation results revealed the effective range of the approximation. The proposed method improved transmission efficiency by up to 7% in the experiment.

A four terminal 1.2 GW dc transmission grid is used as a test system. The study compares four semiconductor-based devices for dc fault isolation: series hybrid dc breaker, half bridge and full bridge dc chopper, and LCL thyristor converter. The study considers performance of devices, costs and losses, and also application with larger dc grids. A hybrid dc CB has lowest losses, but the component sizing crucially depends on the speed of fault detection. It is demonstrated that fast communication between various devices in the dc grid is mandatory but might be very challenging. On the other hand, dc choppers and LCL converter component sizing is not dependent on the speed of protection, and there is no need for communication across dc grids. Additionally, they offer the capability of voltage stepping and dc cable power regulation. The LCL converter provides inherent fault current interruption and needs no overrating for dc faults. It also gives better efficiency compared to dc choppers. The performance of these dc breakers is demonstrated using detailed transient PSCAD simulation for dc faults.	chopper (electronics);fault detection and isolation;gw-basic;interrupt;lazarus component library;semiconductor;simulation;stepping level;thyristor	Masood Hajian;Dragan Jovcic;Bin Wu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2013.2238260	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;charge pump;flyback converter;braking chopper;engineering;electrical engineering;circuit breaker	EDA	63.19657726614344	39.049858311464696	18989

The parallel reduction of the dimension in CMOS technology, and hence higher levels of integration enables the combined integration of bandpass or baseband analog-to-digital converter along with the traditional front-end receiver building blocks. While this trend of technological achievements advances the digital technology, one of the key analog limitations of state-of-theart submicron CMOS technologies remains the restricted powersupply voltage, limited by the low-junction breakdown voltage of high density CMOS process and by the thin gate oxide, prone to voltage stress. There exist many resonator circuits to implement SC bandpass AX modulators and filters for high-frequency communication applications such as the “lossless-discrete integrator” (LDI) and “forward-Euler” (FE) types [l], two-delay loop (TDL) [2], [ 5 ] . low-pass filter [3], high-pass filter based [4] and pseudo-two-path (P2P) type [6] . The most recent ones use P2P and TDL techniques, with double sampling to increase the sampling frequency. In these previous implementations, the minimum available power supply voltage was 3 V. In our previous work, we have shown the LV implementations of SC ADCs and low-pass filters [7] based on the uiiiry-gaii~-reser (UGR) technique. Compared to the switched-opamp technique [8], this technique is suitable for operating at higher speeds, by keeping the opamp in its active operating region at all times. In this paper, we present a novel LV resonator circuit, which is functional down to I V. This resonator will be used as the main block of the LV SC bandpass AC modulator. Our aim is not only to design LV circuit but also to reduce the effects of analog circuit imperfections.

Secondly, the optimal bandwidth of INS-assisted Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is proposed to remove the period-amplitude outcome caused by Schuler frequency, and thus to ensure the absolutely satisfactory tracking capability. By theoretical simulation, the INS-assisted tracking ability superior to the receiver without aiding is quantized according to different grades of INS, and the optimal bandwidth is evaluated. The results verify the availability.	inertial navigation system;mathematical model;phase-locked loop;satellite navigation;signal processing;simulation;track and trace	Ping Ye;Xingqun Zhan;Chunming Fan	2011	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.8.650	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;computer science;engineering;control theory;gnss applications;tracking;physics	EDA	68.77430239932151	40.10425054424183	19032

A straightforward linear algebraic model for the orbits of Earth and Venus—essentially using one parameter, namely, the relative angular velocity σ of Venus—is powerful enough to generate respectable transit year predictions. We generalize, allowing σ to vary; uncover an algebraic analog for predicting transits; and show that time cycles for transits are what they are because each σ is sufficiently close to a suitably simple rational number, which for Venus is 13 8 , and which in turn induces a modulo 8 shuffling of successive transit years by a factor of 3.	angularjs;linear algebra;modulo operation;quasiperiodicity;velocity (software development)	Andrew J.

9dcce4cc41e88fb1f2ac28c1720299adb11c2fa4	constraint interface preconditioning for the incompressible stokes equations		We introduce a novel substructuring approach for solving the incompressible Stokes equations for the case of enclosed flows. We employ a simple distribution of the global pressure constraint to subdomains which allows for a natural decomposition into Stokes subdomain problems with Dirichlet data which are well-posed and inf-sup stable. This approach yields a saddle-point problem on the interface $Gamma$ involving an operator which is continuous and coercive on $H^{1/2}(Gamma)$ and which is restricted to the interface trace space of functions satisfying the incompressibility constraint. We derive the form of the constraints explicitly, both for the continuous and for the discrete case. This allows us to design directly a class of interface preconditioners of constraint type, thus avoiding the need to formulate a coarse level problem. Our analysis indicates that the resulting solution method has performance independent of the mesh-size, while numerical results point to a mild dependence on the number of s...	navier–stokes equations;preconditioner	Daniel Loghin	2017	SIAM J.

A method of fast detection of a frequency band affected by the high-frequency content and time of its occurrence is described. It is based on the auxiliary waveform distortion band factors (DBFs) calculated on the basis of wavelet coefficients. The merits of the presented method, as well as its limitations, are described on the basis of real voltages registered in ships' electrical power systems. This method is a part of the method based on the complementary application of Fourier and wavelet transforms, which was described in the previous papers of the author. However, this paper describes new research results and an expanded analysis exclusively focused on the aforementioned DBFs.	coefficient;distortion;frequency band;ibm power systems;waveform;wavelet transform	Tomasz Tarasiuk	2008	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2007.913606	fourier transform;electronic engineering;dbfs;telecommunications;electrical engineering;mathematics;wavelet transform	Visualization	70.91604707333869	38.04669999512872	19125

This system of equations is considered an appropriate model for the motion of a water solution of polymers. As expected, the difficulties of this problem arise from the transport equation. As one of our aims is to derive unconditional a priori estimates from the discrete analogue of the transport equation, we stabilize our scheme by adding a consistent stabilizing term. We use the IP2 − IP1 Taylor-Hood finite-element scheme for the velocity v and the pressure p, and the discontinuous IP1 finite element for an auxiliary variable z. The error is of the order of h + k, considering that the discretization of the transport equation loses inevitably a factor h.	discretization;finite element method;hood method;numerical analysis;velocity (software development)	Hyam Abboud;Toni Sayah	2009	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2009.01.035	system of linear equations;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;pressure-correction method;convection–diffusion equation;finite element method;calculus;mathematics;incompressible flow;algebra	ML	88.38286749149931	8.793178270336876	19126

In this paper, a scheduled perturbation technique is proposed to reduce the stability impact of K. In the proposed technique, chopping fraction (cf) is used to compensate for reduction in the value of K, where higher cf values are used to achieve zero nondetection zone (NDZ) under low gain SFS. It is shown by analysis that theoretical reduction of NDZ can be always achieved for a nonzero value of cf. Simulations for singleand multi-DGs systems are performed to verify the analytical analysis. It is shown that an appropriate design of scheduled signal duty cycle (d) is of critical importance to realize the proposed reduction in NDZ. While close synchronization of perturbation signals for multi-DG system is required, a delay of 0.33 s is shown to be tolerated for a two-DG system. Synchronization can be achieved either through locally synchronized timers or by limited communication among DGs. The proposed technique provides an attractive option for systems with high DG penetration by reducing the negative impact of K on stability.	cloud fraction;clustered file system;computer simulation;constant current;discontinuous galerkin method;duty cycle;electric power quality;hardiness zone;optic axis of a crystal;timer;total harmonic distortion;xfig	Mohamed Al Hosani;Zhihua Qu;Hatem H.

A dual, 3 V, 32 MS/s A/D converter was fabricated in a standard digital 5 V, 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS process. Fully differential first-generation switched-current circuits with common-mode feedforward are used to implement a 1.5-b/stage pipelined ADC core. Eight time-interleaved ADC cores operating at 4 MS/s are used to achieve a high sample rate. With channel compensation, the measured SFDR is more than 50 dB at 32 MS/s with f/sub in/=1.13 MHz. The ADC-core was measured to have 60.3 dB peak SFDR, 46.5 dB peak SNDR, and approximately 20 MHz input bandwidth. The resolution of the parallel ADC was limited by additional noise and the useful bandwidth was lowered by a fixed-pattern timing error that could not be removed by channel calibration.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos	B.

The directed and switching communication topologies are considered. The control protocols for the first-order/second-order system dynamics are designed with bounded control gains. The Rotate&Run scheme  is proposed to update the vehicles’ states: 1) the vehicle calculates its goal orientation and the input of each wheel at the sampling time instants by using the states of itself and the neighbors; 2) the vehicle rotates in place until it aims at the calculated direction; and 3) the vehicle moves forward/backward with the calculated wheel velocities until the next sampling time instant. It is shown that consensus in a group of 2WMRs can be achieved when the switching directed graphs satisfy certain conditions. The convergence analysis of consensus is conducted based on the algebraic graph theory and stochastic matrix analysis. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	algebraic graph theory;consensus (computer science);consensus dynamics;directed graph;experiment;first-order predicate;linear algebra;matrix analysis;mobile robot;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);stochastic matrix;system dynamics	Bingxian Mu;Jicheng Chen;Yang Shi;Yufang Chang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2638398	control engineering;mobile robot;communications protocol;simulation;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory;system dynamics	Robotics	63.35630978677439	5.228148689046521	19186

The COM has a number of powerful theoretical properties which enable it to provide very compact models for a wide range of deterministic signals. Several of these properties are studied here. The theoretical COM is shown to model and synthesize exactly all types of stationary signals, irrespective of the dimension of the system that generated it, using only one model parameter. The exact representation property independent of data dimension extends to certain amplitude-variable signals as well. The COM also reconstructs with high fidelity a number of other classes of nonstationary signals for which the exact representation cannot be guaranteed. One such class encompasses frequency-modulated signals presented here. The theoretical results obtained under idealized conditions are related to practical discrete implementations, where the COM is shown to be robust to deviations from the ideal conditions. In non-ideal conditions, increasing the order of the COM to two terms, four parameters total, delivers near exact models in many cases. The compact representation property of the COM is illustrated on several canonical waveforms, which provide representative examples for each class of signal studied here.	modulation;stationary process	Irina Gorodnitsky;Anton Y.

2c3ea2ed5845797db7d010a90d5e87ea3ebc0445	passivity-based thermohygrometric control in buildings		This paper presents a modeling and control method for the thermohygrometric condition (temperature and humidity) in a multizone building. The interconnection between the zones is captured through an undirected graph. Employing an electrical circuit analogy, rooms represent capacitances, and walls and doors/windows are resistances. This model characterizes both mass and heat transfer between the zones and their coupling within each zone, extending the temperature-only resistance–capacitance models commonly used in the building control literature. By using physics-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, we verify that this lumped-parameter model is a reasonable approximation of the physical system. The control objective is to drive the temperature and humidity of each zone into the comfort region in the psychrometric chart, using the mass-flow rate of the supplied air into the zone as the control input. In contrast to thermal-only building control, the challenge of this problem is to use a single control variable, mass-flow rate, to regulate both temperature and humidity. Our approach is to first design a feedforward control based on the desired steady-state condition within the comfort zone. We then draw on our previous work on passivity-based building temperature control to show that the thermohygrometric model around the steady state is strictly passive, from the mass-flow rate to a synthetic output combining temperature and humidity. This allows the use of any passive feedback controller combined with the feedforward to achieve robust stabilization about the desired operating point. The feedforward may be further adaptively updated, resulting in an integral-control term in the controller. Finally, to reduce the energy usage, we only apply the controller outside of the comfort zone and turn OFF the controller within the comfort zone. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, simulation results using both the lumped and CFD models are presented for an existing physical six-room testbed.	approximation;computational fluid dynamics;control theory;dvd region code;energy minimization;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;image scaling;interconnection;lumped element model;microsoft windows;operating point;scalability;simulation;steady state;synthetic intelligence;testbed	Charles Chukwunyem Okaeme;Sandipan Mishra;John T.

We show how to design a decentralized control for maximizing band occupancy and fairness. If the network is fully connected, the problem admits a simple solution. Difficulties arise in the case of partially connected networks, and in the presence of time-varying network topologies and delays. General conditions are given which, by properly tuning control parameters, ensure stability. These conditions are conservative and affect system performance. However, we show that in the case of symmetric connections, stability can be studied based on the system eigenvalues even in the presence of topology switchings. Less conservative bounds can be inferred by exploiting known properties of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a graph. We finally consider the multichannel case, in which nodes may jump among channels: the previous scheme can be extended to this case and asymptotically ensures uniform channel exploitation. 11Some of the presented results have been previously published in a preliminary form in [1].	adjacency matrix;aggregate data;distributed algorithm;distributed control system;fairness measure;network topology;telecommunications network;time-varying network	Franco Blanchini;Daniele Casagrande;Giulia Giordano;Pier Luca Montessoro	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2015.2502025	control engineering;mathematical optimization;network switch;computer science;control theory;mathematics;network topology;robustness;computer network	Embedded	65.53422789481888	4.613838574330099	19244

It is shown that the first term of the series expansion of the frequency of oscillation coincides with that determined from a first-order harmonic balance procedure, whereas the two-term approximation to the frequency of oscillation is shown to be more accurate than that of a parameter perturbation procedure for the second equation considered in this paper. For the third equation, it is shown that the two-term approximation presented in this paper is more accurate than the corresponding one for one of the parameter perturbation methods, and for initial velocities less than one, for the other parameter perturbation approach.	autonomous robot;nonlinear system	Juan I.

Among the set of solutions only one particular solution is smooth and all others are singular at the origin. The numerical solutions of this class of equations have been a difficult topic to analyze and have received much previous investigation. The aim of this paper is to present a numerical technique for giving the approximate solution to the only smooth solution based on reproducing kernel theory. Applying weighted integral, we provide a new definition for reproducing kernel space and obtain reproducing kernel function. Using the good properties of reproducing kernel function, the only smooth solution is exactly expressed in the form of series. The n-term approximate solution is obtained by truncating the series. Meanwhile, we prove that the derivative of approximation converges to the derivative of exact solution uniformly. The final numerical examples compared with other methods show that the method is efficient. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This estimation is made via the use of a Minimum Variance Unbiased Observer (as in Kalman Filtering). After recalling some useful results, the observer equations for state and unknown input estimation are established, and then an example is given in order to illustrate the talk.	kalman filter	Luc Meyer;Dalil Ichalal;Vincent Vigneron;Claire Vasiljevic	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2017.8123017	control theory;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;kalman filter;white noise;noise measurement;computer science;observer (quantum physics);gaussian	Robotics	58.732518276827875	4.520376535695561	19363

In a color television receiver the analog-to-digital converter is a parallel analog-to-digital converter with p=2r-1 differential amplifiers as comparators, where r is the number of binary digits of the output signal of the analog-to-digital converter minus one. The composite color signal is then applied as the input signal to the noninverting (or inverting) inputs of all p differential amplifiers and the inverting (noninverting) inputs of the differential amplifiers being connected successively to the taps of a resistive voltage divider which contains equal-value resistors and is fed with a reference voltage (Ur). For the duration of every second line, either the reference voltage or the input signal is shifted by DELTA U=0.5 Ur/2r.

A monopole is first designed with tri-band characteristic; three resonating frequencies are generated by three separate resonators. Then, two tri-band monopoles are employed to develop a MIMO antenna system. The resonators of low band can reduce the mutual coupling for two higher bands by suppressing surface wave propagation. Finally, coupling reduction at low band is achieved by a Ω-shaped metal line to neutralize original coupling. The proposed MIMO antenna covers the 2.4/5.8GHz WLAN and 3.5GHz WiMAX bands, with the measured mutual coupling lower than −18 dB.	coupling (computer programming);duality (optimization);ecc memory;emoticon;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;mimo;software propagation;surface wave;triangular function;xfig	Chao-Ming Luo;Jing-Song Hong;Muhammad Amin	2017	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.14.20170354	3g mimo;electronic engineering	Networks	64.25602457207214	58.253340752189054	19455

This approach relaxes significantly the noise specifications of the channel, but requires the programmability of the most important parameters of the circuit (gain, shaping time, threshold, polarity, pole-zero cancellation) to allow the same analog channel to be connected to many types of detectorICSA pairs. The channel includes also a 10 bit AID converter and hence provides digital output. The programming of the parameters is performed digitally.

The proposed IC is comprised of a bipolar biphasic neural stimulator using a transistor-stacked current-mirror driver to achieve good current matching performance in stimulation mode and low-voltage capacitive feedback neural amplifiers for recording mode. In order to save die area, high-voltage isolation switches are embedded within the stimulator core to protect the low-voltage recording circuits from damage. Despite using a low-voltage process, the stimulator is able to deliver up to 1 mA current through 10 kΩ load using 12.8 V supply voltage and the recording amplifier uses 0.8 V supply voltage while consuming 1 μA of current. The complete IC occupies 0.29 mm of die area and can be applied for various multi electrode array interface bidirectional neural SoCs in medical implant devices.	amplifier;analog front-end;brain–computer interface;cmos;characteristic impedance;current mirror;embedded system;high impedance;low-power broadcasting;macintosh programmer's workshop;mirror driver;network switch;transistor	Alfian Abdi;Hyouk-Kyu Cha	2016	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2016.10.013	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;high voltage;electrical engineering;physics	EDA	57.035614533193446	49.24472011946241	19476

At every iteration, an approximation to each mapping generates a halfspace containing its set of fixed points. The next iterate is found by projecting the current iterate on a surrogate halfspace formed by taking a convex combination of the halfspace inequalities. This acceleration technique extends one for convex feasibility problems (CFPs), since projection operators onto closed convex sets are firmly nonexpansive. The resulting methods are block iterative and, hence, lend themselves to parallel implementation. We extend to accelerated methods some recent results of Bauschke and Borwein [SIAM Rev., 38 (1996), pp. 367--426] on the convergence of projection methods.	minimal mappings	Krzysztof C.

9208d2a15e5c40435e5b8e8967347fc3e2eeb83c	equivalent modeling and simulation for pv system on dynamic clustering equivalent strategy		As the large-scale integration of photovoltaic (PV) power station, a higher requirement is put forward by power grid analysis on the accuracy of PV station model. For the model of photovoltaic system is complex, and it requires solving large-scale model equation, which is not conductive for simulation and big data analysis when a large-scale PV power station connected to grid. This paper focuses on the same type of photovoltaic power generation, assuming that the photovoltaic power plant is composed of multiple photovoltaic power generation units connected by the collector line, the photovoltaic power plant can be modeled to consider the operation of similar power generation unit grouped together, so that reduce the simulation scale. This paper points out that the dynamic clustering equivalence strategy can be classified into two cases. During the fault and fault-over, the transient condition is required to be grouped when the active power ramp recovery control module is operating, and the another single-unit equivalent model can be performed when the module is ignoring or not running into a non-fault condition, which is the second condition. Simulation results show that the proposed method has good adaptability for irradiance disturbance, different fault time.	big data;classification;cluster analysis;control unit;integrated circuit;page view;penicillin v;power plants;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;row hammer;sleep disturbances;turing completeness;statistical cluster	Hang Meng;Xiaohui Ye;Mingyu Yang;Xinli Song;Zhida Su;Wenzhuo Liu;Lingtong Luo;Huiying Zhao	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217002	grid;adaptability;control engineering;control theory;electricity generation;cluster analysis;engineering;modeling and simulation;ac power;power station;photovoltaic system	EDA	63.38664996000306	38.40700501571571	19544

The proposed analytic method guarantees consistency of the resulting approximations related to the sophisticated initial infinite-dimensional optimization problem and can provide a fundament for some concrete implementable algorithms.	algorithm;approximation;cobham's thesis;control system;infinite-dimensional optimization;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;optimization problem	Vadim Azhmyakov;Michael V.

In the proposed collocation approach, the double and triple shifted Jacobi polynomials are used as base functions for approximate solutions of the one- and two-dimensional cases. The space and time fractional derivatives given in the underline problems are expressed by means of Jacobi operational matrices. This investigates spectral collocation schemes for both temporal and spatial discretizations. Thereby, the expansion coefficients are then determined by reducing the FSDEs, with their initial and boundary conditions, into systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which are far easier to be solved. Furthermore, the error of the approximate solution is estimated theoretically along with graphical analysis to confirm the exponential convergence rate of the proposed method in both spatial and temporal discretizations. In order to show the high accuracy of our algorithms, we report the numerical results of some numerical examples and compare our numerical results with those reported in the literature.	algebraic equation;approximation algorithm;coefficient;collocation method;dirichlet kernel;jacobi eigenvalue algorithm;jacobi method;laguerre polynomials;matrix mechanics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;polynomial;rate of convergence;semiconductor industry;sid meier's alpha centauri;spectral method;time complexity	A.

For example, RL algorithms have been applied to walking robots to examine the connection between robot motion and the brain, which is known as embodied cognition. In this paper, RL algorithms are analysed using an exemplar test problem. A closed form solution for the value function is calculated and this is represented in terms of a set of basis functions and parameters, which is used to investigate parameter convergence. The value function expression is shown to have a polynomial form where the polynomial terms depend on the plant's parameters and the value function's discount factor.

It is shown that the parallel-resonant transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) topology is advantageous for high efficiency even with lossy but compact components. In addition, the output voltage of the topology is insensitive to coupling and/or loading variations if the operating frequency is automatically adjusted according to coupling variations. A parallel-resonant class-D oscillator TX is developed to track the optimum operating frequency for the constant output voltage. The operating distance for the constant output voltage is also extended using a novel resonator structure, which contains two resonating coils. These proposed schemes allow a compact, efficient, and robust wireless power system. Maximum power of 174 mW can be transmitted with 63% overall efficiency.	cmos;clock rate;lossy compression;maximum power transfer theorem;network switch;printed circuit board;printing;transmitter	Dukju Ahn;Songcheol Hong	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2273472	control engineering;electronic engineering;resonant inductive coupling;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;printed circuit board;oscillation;cmos;quantum mechanics	Arch	60.722859160355306	44.78598597499662	19636

In this work special design is done for a tapered transmission line used for matching an arbitrary real load to a 50Ω line. The problem at hand is to match this arbitray load to 50 Ω line using three section tapered transmission line with impedances in decreasing order from the load. So the problem becomes optimizing an equation with three unknowns with various conditions. The optimized values are obtained using Particle Swarm Optimization. It can easily be shown that PSO is very strong in solving this kind of multiobjective optimization problems.	algorithm;electrical engineering;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;microstrip;microwave;multi-objective optimization;particle swarm optimization;transmission line	Ezgi Deniz Ulker;Sadik Ulker	2014	CoRR	10.5121/cseij.2014.4106	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization	Theory	69.83342180946056	55.55075675366097	19666

In the present paper, a weaker admissibility condition is described which leads to a coarser partitioning of the hierarchical -matrix format. A coarser format yields smaller constants in the work and storage estimates and thus leads to a lower complexity of the -matrix arithmetic. On the other hand, it preserves the approximation power which is known in the case of the standard admissibility criterion. Furthermore, the new weak -matrix format allows to analyse the accuracy of the -matrix inversion and multiplication.		Wolfgang Hackbusch;Boris N.

cd5e3128b0c69d68dcc724ae49f0e3cbbef096c0	optimization of class-d amplifier output stage for piezoelectric actuator control		Design of a high power piezoelectric actuator driver in a small form factor such as Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (MicroTCA) introduces a number of challenges due to its size and power limitations. Because of relatively small dimensions and a maximum dissipated heat of only 30 W for the Micro Rear Transmission Module $\pmb{(\mu \mathrm{RTM})}$, low efficiency of a linear amplifier becomes a major drawback. Switching Class-D amplifiers provide exceptional efficiency compared to non-switching solutions, which allows for higher output power without additional heat dissipation. The efficiency, however, comes at a price of high frequency harmonics introducing high Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Driving a capacitive load, such as a piezoelectric actuator, at a high voltage and frequency with a LC Low Pass Filter (LPF) output stage is susceptible to signal distortions caused by the resonant frequency of the filter or the parasitic inductance of the cabling connecting the load to the driver. The inductance of the connection together with the capacitance of the load creates a resonant circuit, which must be designed as an integral part of the driver module. This article presents the effects of the connection inductance on the LC LPF output stage and the influence of the parameters of the filter on the signal. The measurements were performed on a custom made driver module for piezoelectric stack actuators with 180 V peak-to-peak voltage, 600 kHz switching frequency and a range of capacitive load from $\pmb{2.2 \ \mu\mathrm{F}}$ to $\pmb{40\ \mu \mathrm{F}}$.	advanced mezzanine card;class-d amplifier;clock rate;emi;floor and ceiling functions;interference (communication);lc circuit;linear amplifier;low-pass filter;parasitic element (electrical networks);piezoelectricity;resonance;small form factor;thermal management (electronics);total harmonic distortion	Aleksander Szubert;Dariusz Makowski;Grzegorz Jablonski;Andrzej Napieralski	2018	"""2018 25th International Conference """"Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and System"""" (MIXDES)"""	10.23919/MIXDES.2018.8444558	rlc circuit;total harmonic distortion;electronic engineering;computer science;power factor;linear amplifier;amplifier;inductance;class-d amplifier;low-pass filter;electrical engineering	EDA	62.43986714268513	45.070852135794	19680
e988c95a5740b2bd9e3d0c59c3bdcf2d30118385	an introduction to adjoints and output error estimation in computational fluid dynamics		"""In recent years, the use of adjoint vectors in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has seen a dramatic rise. Their utility in numerous applications, including design optimization, data assimilation, and mesh adaptation has sparked the interest of both researchers and practitioners alike. In many of these fields, the concept of an adjoint is explained differently, with various notations and motivations employed. Further complicating matters is the existence of two seemingly different types of adjoints --""""continuous""""and""""discrete""""-- as well as the more formal definition of adjoint operators employed in linear algebra and functional analysis. These issues can make the fundamental concept of an adjoint difficult to pin down. In these notes, we hope to clarify some of the ideas surrounding adjoint vectors and to provide a useful reference for both continuous and discrete adjoints alike. In particular, we focus on the use of adjoints within the context of output-based mesh adaptation, where the goal is to achieve accuracy in a particular quantity (or""""output"""") of interest by performing targeted adaptation of the computational mesh. While this is our application of interest, the ideas discussed here apply directly to design optimization, data assimilation, and many other fields where adjoints are employed."""	computation;computational fluid dynamics;data assimilation;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization	Steven M.

0c32a18ca004bf8029ca03b9465891989da9c4b0	local discontinuous galerkin methods for the khokhlov-zabolotskaya-kuznetzov equation		Khokhlov–Zabolotskaya–Kuznetzov (KZK) equation is a model that describes the propagation of the ultrasound beams in the thermoviscous fluid. It contains a nonlocal diffraction term, an absorption term and a nonlinear term. Accurate numerical methods to simulate the KZK equation are important to its broad applications in medical ultrasound simulations. In this paper, we propose a local discontinuous Galerkin method to solve the KZK equation. We prove the L2 stability of our scheme and conduct a series of numerical experiments including the focused circular short tone burst excitation and the propagation of unfocused sound beams, which show that our scheme leads to accurate solutions and performs better than the benchmark solutions in the literature.	benchmark (computing);discontinuous galerkin method;experiment;nonlinear system;nonlocal lagrangian;numerical method;selective calling;simulation;software propagation	Ching-Shan Chou;Weizhou Sun;Yulong Xing;He Yang	2017	J.

Small geometrical details impose a fine mesh and a reduced time step, significantly increasing computational cost. Model order reduction has been proposed as a systematic way to generate compact models for complex objects, by which one can then instantiate into a main FDTD mesh. However, the stability of FDTD with embedded reduced models remains an open problem. We propose a systematic method to generate reduced models for FDTD domains, and embed them into a main FDTD mesh with guaranteed stability up to the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) limit of the fine mesh. With a simple perturbation technique, the CFL of the whole scheme can be further extended beyond the fine grid’s CFL limit. Reduced models can be created for arbitrary domains containing inhomogeneous and lossy materials. Numerical tests confirm the stability of the proposed method and its potential to accelerate multiscale FDTD simulations.	algorithmic efficiency;bremermann's limit;coefficient;computation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;embedded system;finite-difference time-domain method;lossy compression;mathematical model;model order reduction;numerical method;simulation	Xinyue Zhang;Fadime Bekmambetova;Piero Triverio	2018	IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation		mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Vision	95.10944463232066	10.302601368955134	19714

The backstepping algorithm is employed to preserve a good control performance and to avoid different uncertainties in order to have good signals acquisition for the diagnosis process. The used technique for the fault detection is the discrete wavelet transforms which applied to analyze the stator phase current and the output signal of the speed regulator. Furthermore, the calculation of the energy stored in each decomposition can evaluate the effect of the fault. The controls of the induction motor and their diagnosis have been investigated experimentally using Matlab/Simulink environment with Real-Time interface based on the dSpace 1104.	algorithm;discrete wavelet transform;experiment;fault detection and isolation;interface device component;matlab;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time transcription;simulink	Tarek Ameid;Arezki Menacer;Rapha&#x00EB;l Romary;Remus Pusca;Hicham Talhaoui	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217414	wavelet transform;backstepping;control engineering;engineering;fault detection and isolation;rotor (electric);control theory;stator;regulator;induction motor;dspace	Robotics	68.2821086056391	38.982070414067195	19771

This includes excellent isolation from the decohering influence of the environment, and the existence of well developed techniques for atom trapping and coherent manipulation. We present a review of our work to implement quantum control and measurement for ultra-cold atoms in far-off-resonance optical lattice traps. In recent experiments we have demonstrated coherent behavior of mesoscopic atomic spinor wavepackets in optical double-well potentials, and carried out quantum state tomography to reconstruct the full density matrix for the atomic spin degrees of freedom. This model system shares a number of important features with proposals to implement quantum logic and quantum computing in optical lattices. We present a theoretical analysis of a protocol for universal quantum logic via single qubit operations and an entangling gate based on electric dipole-dipole interactions. Detailed calculations including the full atomic hyperfine structure suggests that high-fidelity quantum gates are possible under realistic experimental conditions.	coherent control;information processing	John E.

Based on the recently proposed direct-form II transposed structure in /spl rho/-operator (/spl rho/DFIIt) (G. Li and Z.X. Zhao, IEEE Trans. Circuits Sys. I, vol. 51, pp. 769-778, 2004), an alternative structure is obtained, with replacing the 1st-order /spl rho/-operators in /spl rho/DFIIt with a set of 2nd-order polynomial operators, and hence denoted as /spl rho/IDFIIt. Expressions for evaluating the roundoff noise gain are derived for this new structure and its equivalent state-space realization. It is shown that for a given filter, the state-space realization always yields a smaller roundoff noise gain than the /spl rho/IDFIIt. The optimization problem is focused on how to choose the 2nd-order operators to minimize roundoff noise gain. A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to efficiently solve this problem. A design example is given to illustrate the advantage of the proposed structures and confirm the theoretical analysis.	digital filter;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;polynomial;state space	Zixue Zhao;Gang Li;Jiong Zhou	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465155	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;genetic algorithm;digital filter;computer science;control theory;mathematics	EDA	61.136616166099856	17.142823167533543	19930

One important generalization of the unit circle is the unit hypersphere. In this paper, we propose a recursive Bayesian estimator for the unit sphere S2 based on spherical harmonics for arbitrary likelihood functions and rotationally symmetric system noises.

Four logic controlled outputs provide the best voltage for various applications to accommodate low power design requirements. A low current low dropout regulator (LDO) is utilized to provide a regulated 2.2V output for powering low power processors or other low power integrated circuit (ICs). Reserve energy on the storage capacitor CSTORE provides power when the input voltage source is unavailable, thus prolongs the life of the system and expands the application range. Extremely low quiescent current (6 A) and high e±ciency design (64%@300 A load current) ensure the fastest possible charge times of the output reservoir capacitor.

To solve the linear least squares problem in a distributed way, we consider a multi-agent system where each agent has a difference approximation of a gradient of concentration as its state. In large-scale sensor networks, communication time-delays cannot be ignored due to large transfer distances under limited link capacity. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time consensus dynamics with communication time-delays which are common for all agents. We show that the multi-agent system can estimate the initial distribution of 1-D diffusion phenomena by the proposed consensus dynamics.	approximation;consensus (computer science);consensus dynamics;gradient;linear least squares (mathematics);multi-agent system;time series	Naoki Hayashi;Shigemasa Takai	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6858735	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.64469102372561	5.730300721282416	20102

The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which describes magnetization dynamics, is linearized around a stable equilibrium configuration and the stability of micromagnetic equilibria is discussed. Special attention is paid to take into account the property of conservation of magnetization magnitude in the continuum as well as discrete model. The linear equation is recast in the frequency domain as a generalized eigenvalue problem for suitable self-adjoint operators connected to the micromagnetic effective field. This allows one to determine the normal oscillation modes and natural frequencies circumventing the difficulties arising in time-domain analysis. The generalized eigenvalue problem may be conveniently discretized by finite difference or finite element methods depending on the geometry of the magnetic system. The spectral properties of the eigenvalue problem are derived in the lossless limit. Perturbation analysis is developed in order to compute the changes in the natural frequencies and oscillation modes arising from the dissipative effects. It is shown that the discrete approximation of the eigenvalue problem obtained either by finite difference or finite element methods has a structure which preserves relevant properties of the continuum formulation. Finally, the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved for a rectangular magnetic thin-film by using the finite differences and for a linear chain of magnetic nanospheres by using the finite elements. The natural frequencies and the spatial distribution of the natural modes are numerically computed.	computation;numerical analysis	Massimiliano d'Aquino;Claudio Serpico;Giovanni Miano;Carlo Forestiere	2009	J.

8bc4f421a6920811b630b3b8259a384cd9c643d2	a random sampling method for a family of temple-class systems of conservation laws		The Aw–Rascle–Zhang traffic model, a model of sedimentation, and other applications lead to nonlinear (2 times 2) systems of conservation laws that are governed by a single scalar system velocity. Such systems are of the Temple class since rarefaction wave curves and Hugoniot curves coincide. Moreover, one characteristic field is genuinely nonlinear almost everywhere, and the other is linearly degenerate. Two well-known problems associated with these systems are handled via a random sampling approach. Firstly, Godunov’s and related methods produce spurious oscillations near contact discontinuities since the numerical solution invariably leaves the invariant region of the exact solution. It is shown that alternating between averaging (Av) and remap steps similar to the approach by Chalons and Goatin (Commun Math Sci 5:533–551, 2007) generates numerical solutions that do satisfy an invariant region property. If the remap step is made by random sampling (RS), then combined techniques due to Glimm (Commun Pure Appl Math 18:697–715, 1965), LeVeque and Temple (Trans Am Math Soc 288:115–123, 1985) prove that the resulting Av–RS scheme converges to a weak solution. Numerical examples illustrate that the new scheme is superior to Godunov’s method in accuracy and resolution. Secondly, the vacuum state, which may form even from positive initial data, causes potential problems of non-uniqueness and instability. This is resolved by introducing an alternative Riemann solution concept.	monte carlo method;sampling (signal processing)	Fernando Betancourt;Raimund Bürger;Christophe Chalons;Stefan Diehl;Sebastian Farås	2018	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-017-0900-z	weak solution;scalar (physics);mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;exact solutions in general relativity;nonlinear system;mathematics;conservation law;classification of discontinuities;invariant (mathematics);instability	EDA	84.27801472871214	5.02322635823447	20167

In this work, we will give a unified methodology to derive dispersion reduction FD schemes for the one dimensional wave equation, and this new method can reduce dispersion error uniformly for all wavenumbers up to the Nyquist.

A mesh is found as the solution of an optimization problem that automatically includes the boundary conditions and is solved using a multi-grid approach. The governing equations are discretized in space by linear finite elements and a split time-level scheme is used to numerically integrate in time. One novel aspect of the method is the choice of a regularized monitor function. The moving grid method enables us to obtain accurate numerical solutions with much less degree of freedoms. It is demonstrated numerically that the tip velocity obtained by our method is in good agreement with the previously published results. 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our approach is based on minimizing the worst-case difference between the MSE in the presence of uncertainties, and the MSE of the Wiener filter that knows the correct power spectra. The resulting filter, referred to as the minimax regret filter, takes the entire uncertainty interval into account, as well as the frequency response of the filter h[n]. We demonstrate through an example that the minimax regret filter can often lead to improved performance over traditional minimax MSE approaches for this problem.	best, worst and average case;convolution;deconvolution;frequency response;linear time-invariant theory;minimax;regret (decision theory);stationary process;stochastic process;time complexity;time-invariant system;utility functions on indivisible goods;wiener filter	Yonina C.

It is shown that under a least absolute error criterion, these problems can be transformed into appropriate finite problems, which can then be efficiently solved via dynamic programming techniques. Although the result does not carry over to least squares regression, hybrid programming algorithms can be developed to solve least squares counterparts of certain problems in the class.	algorithm;approximation error;dynamic programming;least squares;mathematical optimization;non-monotonic logic;nonlinear system	Nikos D.

The (indefinite) augmented system form of this linear system has a number of advantages, notably a higher degree of sparsity than the (positive definite) normal equations form. Therefore we use the conjugate gradients method to solve the augmented system and look for a suitable preconditioner. An explicit null space representation of linear constraints is constructed by using a nonsingular basis matrix identified from an estimate of the optimal partition in the linear program. This is achieved by means of recently developed efficient basis matrix factorisation techniques which exploit hyper-sparsity and are used in implementations of the revised simplex method. The approach has been implemented within the HOPDM interior point solver and applied to medium and large-scale problems from public domain test collections. Computational experience is encouraging.

The performance of this synchronization technique is related to the quality of the consumed or delivered electric power. The synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) has been widely used due to its ease of operation and robust behavior. However, the estimated phase can have a considerable amount of unwanted ripple if the grid voltage disturbances are not properly rejected. The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptive SRF-PLL which strongly rejects these disturbances even if the fundamental frequency of the grid voltage varies. This is accomplished by using several adaptive infinite-impulse-response notch filters, implemented by means of an inherently stable Schur-lattice structure. This structure is perfectly suited to be programmed in fixed-point DSPs (i.e., it has high mapping precision, low roundoff accumulation, and suppression of quantization limit cycle oscillations). The proposed adaptive SRF-PLL has been tested by means of the TI TMS320F2812 DSP. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed synchronization method highly rejects the undesired harmonics even if the fundamental harmonic frequency of a highly polluted grid voltage abruptly varies.	adaptive filter;arnold tongue;crystal structure;digital signal processor;electric power quality;fixed-point arithmetic;infinite impulse response;limit cycle;phase-locked loop;power electronics;ripple effect;tree accumulation;zero suppression	Francisco José González-Espín;Emilio Figueres;Gabriel Garcerá	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2166236	adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;harmonic analysis;control theory	HPC	64.6440024473363	49.87099019024543	20404

Under exposure to 1 sun, both can be charged in less than 4 hours.	charge pump;clock signal;dc-to-dc converter;indium gallium zinc oxide;organic solar cell;rechargeable battery;rollable display;simulation;thickness (graph theory);thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;voltage converter	Tilo Meister;Koichi Ishida;Reza Shabanpour;Bahman Kheradmand Boroujeni;Corrado Carta;Frank Ellinger;Niko Münzenrieder;Luisa Petti;Giovanni Antonio Salvatore;Gerhard Tröster;Michael Wagner;Pol Ghesquière;Stefan Kiefl;Martin Krebs	2015	2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300095	embedded system;electronic engineering;charge pump;systems modeling;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	60.004907085353636	43.90819697494088	20415
0f217a083f15ff5cff2284605ad160df431db6bc	efficient solution of two-sided nonlinear space-fractional diffusion equations using fast poisson preconditioners	010302 numerical solution of differential and integral equations;nonlinear;jacobian free newton krylov;fast poisson preconditioner;method of lines;two sided fractional diffusion	We develop a fast Poisson preconditioner for the efficient numerical solution of a class of two-sided nonlinear space-fractional diffusion equations in one and two dimensions using the method of lines. Using the shifted Grunwald finite difference formulas to approximate the two-sided (i.e. the left and right Riemann–Liouville) fractional derivatives, the resulting semi-discrete nonlinear systems have dense Jacobian matrices owing to the non-local property of fractional derivatives. We employ a modern initial value problem solver utilising backward differentiation formulas and Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov methods to solve these systems. For efficient performance of the Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov method it is essential to apply an effective preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of the linear iterative solver. The key contribution of our work is to generalise the fast Poisson preconditioner, widely used for integer-order diffusion equations, so that it applies to the two-sided space-fractional diffusion equation. A number of numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner and the overall solution strategy.	fractional poisson process;nonlinear system;preconditioner	Timothy J.

255ea17f99a88295d073cd54464b6f3e92fcdaa4	a connectivity preserving rendezvous for unicycle agents with heterogenous input disturbances		Abstract This paper studies the rendezvous strategy for a group of unicycle systems with connectivity preservation and collision avoidance. Based on the method of potential functions, a novel distributed control algorithm is proposed for all unicycles. By tuning the design parameters, the unicycles finally aggregate so that the average of the distances is bounded by a pre-specified positive number. It is proved that the connectivity of a minimum spanning tree in the initial topology is guaranteed. The result is then extended to multiple unicycles with heterogenous input disturbances. Potential function is further modified to handle the disturbances. Illustrative example is presented to show the improvements and effectiveness of the proposed controller.

In the former case the solution follows immediately from the determination of the Lie point symmetries of the governing 1 + 1 evolution partial differential equation. This is not the situation in the latter case, but we are able to infer the essential structure of the required nonlocal symmetry from that of the autonomous problem and hence can present the solution to the nonautonomous problem. As in the case of the standard Black-Scholes problem the presence of time-dependent parameters is not a hindrance to the demonstration of a solution.	autonomous robot;black–scholes model;heston model;quantum nonlocality;volatility	Christodoulos Sophocleous;J.

First, we introduce a specific parameterization of LTI systems that distinguishes dynamic and structural parameters. Next, we apply the Model Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM) [1] to particular parameters to achieve different approximations. This unified view of these popular model reduction techniques, which themselves can result in quite different approximations, illustrates that each approximation corresponds to a particular boundary element on a manifold, the “model manifold,” which is associated with the specific choice of model parameterization and is embedded in a sample space of measured outputs.	approximation;boundary element method;dataspaces;embedded system;interpolation;linear time-invariant theory;truncation	Philip E.

However, it has much larger complexity than its purely analog counterparts. This combination of performance and complexity is achieved through the use of a mixed-signal architecture consisting of a programmable analog core of reduced complexity, and a strategy, and the associated mixed-signal circuitry, to cover the whole input space through the dynamic programming of this core. Since errors and delays are proportional to the reduced number of fuzzy rules included in the analog core, they are much smaller than in the case where the whole rule set is implemented by analog circuitry. Also, the area and the power consumption of the new architecture are smaller than those of its purely analog counterparts simply because most rules are implemented through programming. The paper presents a set of building blocks associated to this architecture, and gives results for an exemplary prototype. This prototype, called multiplexing fuzzy controller (MFCON), has been realized in a CMOS 0.7 /spl mu/m standard technology. It has two inputs, implements 64 rules, and features 500 ns of input to output delay with 16-mW of power consumption.

1b6c689d856e5c9bece10b3f4f34d6ed6f4002b3	study of transient voltage stability with transient stability probing method in hunan power grid		The transient voltage stability issue is a well known problem in Hunan power grid, which the simulation shows the three-phase fault occurred at 500kV transmission line in eastern Hunan will cause the voltage collapse hundreds of kilometers away in southern Hunan. With the newly constructed Ultra High Voltage DC (UHV-DC) line in operation at 2017, located at eastern Hunan, the simulation reveals that the voltage issue is getting worse. This paper proposes a Transient Voltage Stability Probing Method and studies the transient voltage stability issue of Hunan power grid with UHV-DC in 2017. This study identifies the transient voltage stability weakness in Hunan power grid and helps to optimize the location of dynamic reactive power compensator installation.

The Fourier transform technique is used to reduce the elastostatic problem to a set of integral equations which have been solved by using the finite Hilbert transform and Cooke's results. Analytical expressions for the stress intensity factors at the tips of cracks are obtained for large values of h. Numerical results concerning the interaction effects are presented with physical significance. It is shown that interaction effects are either shielding or amplification depending on the location of cracks, spacing of crack-tips, and the thickness of the layer. The stress magnification factors at the crack-tips are also calculated.		S. Das;Lokenath Debnath	2003	Appl. Math.

In practice, the body force fields are most conveniently chosen to be the pressure gradient of the corresponding Navier-Stokes (N-S) flow. In the first of three examples, the driving-force required to yield a stagnation-point flow is derived from the pressure field of the potential flow for a lattice of counter-rotating line vortices. Such a lattice contains periodic squares bounded by streamlines with four vortices within them. Hence, the DPD simulation can be performed with periodic boundary conditions to demonstrate the value of a non-uniform driving-force without the need to model real boundaries. The second example is an irregular geometry consisting of a 2D rectangular cavity on one side of an otherwise uniform channel. The Navier-Stokes pressure field for the same geometry is obtained numerically, and its interpolated gradient is then employed as the driving-force for the DPD simulation. Finally, we present a third example, where the proposed method is applied to a complex 3D geometry of an asymmetric constriction. It is shown that in each case the DPD simulations closely reproduce the Navier-Stokes solutions. Convergence rates are found to be much superior to alternative methods; in addition, the range of convergence with respect to Reynolds number and Mach number is greatly extended.	dissipative particle dynamics	Alireza Yazdani;Mingge Deng;Bruce Caswell;George Em Karniadakis	2016	J.

Because most of the existing SPH fluid control methods employ the strategy of control force to control fluid particles, the artificial viscosity introduced by control force would lead to the loss of fine-scale details. Although the introduction of the low-pass filter can add details, it may easily destroy the target shape. To remedy the previous problems, we sample the control particles with curvature information to represent the shape complexity. Because of the shape's complexity, we suppress the generation of turbulence in the high-curvature areas and promote turbulence in the low-curvature regions. Our self-adaptive way to randomly generate turbulence can effectively prevent the lack of fluid dynamics caused by the artificial viscosity. Our new method can improve the visual quality of the fluid animation, and the shape control result is consistent to the target shape.

f1923a793d9227b7de1f6a91ed923499ccca9fe3	pfc interleaved buck-boost converter for telecom power application		At present, the field of power factor corrected (PFC) rectifiers are very much matured. Typically a single phase PFC converter requires measurements from three independent sensors i.e. input voltage, input current and output voltage. By considering a need of farther compact and more flexible in terms of input to output voltage gain, a new UPF rectifier with two buck-boost converter operating in interleaved condition with use of only one output voltage sensor is presented. The proposed control technique uses only integrator to compensate the error between measured voltage and reference voltage and it is very simple to implement. The proposed Buck-boost converter operates in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) to achieve UPF at AC input. The required buck-boost inductance in DCM operation is quite small. In contrast to this, the current ripple of buck-boost inductor is quite high. Interleaving is the viable option to reduce the inductor current ripple, component stress, input filter size and enhances the power density. To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the proposed converter is repeatedly simulated in PSIM and in real time platform OP4510. A scaled down lab prototype is built and experimental results are presented to verify the suitability of the proposed converter for the practical application.	associative aphasia;boost converter;cfp gene;cfp wt allele;controllers;converter device component;dicom;duty cycle;electric capacitance;forward error correction;inductor device component;physical security information management;powerbuilder foundation classes;prototype;pulse-width modulation;rectifier device component;ripple effect;simulation;sensor (device);voltage	G.

The velocity components are obtained by solving theNavier–Stokes equations using HOCS in spherical geometry. The convection terms in the momentum and energy equations are handled in an effective manner so as to get fourth order accurate solutions. The higher order compact scheme is made efficient by combining with the coarse grid correction based multigrid method. In the absence of an exact solution, the order of accuracy of the results is illustrated. The results are compared with first order accurate upwind scheme, second order accurate defect correction technique(DC) and other recent numerical results of the literature. It is found that HOCS captures heat transfer solutions accurately when compared to other conventional schemes at higher values of Re and Pr . The angular variation of thermal boundary layer thickness is also presented. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The main idea is to compose a given iterative method of order pwith a modification of the Newton method that introduces just one evaluation of the function, obtaining a new method of order p + 2. By applying this procedure to known methods of order three and four, we obtain new methods of order five and six, respectively. The efficiency index and the computational effort of the new methods are checked. We also performdifferent numerical tests that confirm the theoretical results and allow us to compare these methods with the ones from which have been derived and with the classical Newton method. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

601d06d4865eb60cf3d58502c5161a979c9346d7	direct inversion of the three-dimensional pseudo-polar fourier transform	radon transform;polar fourier transform;unequally spaced fft;3d pseudo polar fourier transform;65t50;92c55;44a12;toeplitz matrices	The pseudo-polar Fourier transform is a specialized nonequally spaced Fourier transform, which evaluates the Fourier transform on a near-polar grid known as the pseudo-polar grid. The advantage of the pseudo-polar grid over other nonuniform sampling geometries is that the transformation, which samples the Fourier transform on the pseudo-polar grid, can be inverted using a fast and stable algorithm. For other sampling geometries, even if the nonequally spaced Fourier transform can be inverted, the only known algorithms are iterative. The convergence speed of these algorithms and their accuracy are difficult to control, as they depend both on the sampling geometry and on the unknown reconstructed object. In this paper, a direct inversion algorithm for the three-dimensional pseudo-polar Fourier transform is presented. The algorithm is based only on one-dimensional resampling operations and is shown to be significantly faster than existing iterative inversion algorithms.	algorithm;iteration;iterative method;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing)	Amir Averbuch;Gil Shabat;Yoel Shkolnisky	2016	SIAM J.

This makes low-jitter phase-locked loops (PLLs) with jitter on the order of few picoseconds desirable. Unfortunately, due to stringent limit on die area, sometimes a PLL with a ring oscillator is the only choice. To get better phase noise, a wider loop bandwidth is needed to suppress the noise of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). However, due to the discrete-time nature of the operations, the loop bandwidth is limited to one-tenth of the crystal oscillator (XTAL) frequency. One way to solve this problem is to use the injection-locking technique. This method exploits the clean reference clock but has several production problems. One is the frequency offset between injection signal and VCO, and this can be solved by using the injection-locked PLL architecture [1, 2]. However, in [1, 2] extra loops are still needed to adjust the injection window due to on-chip variations. In this work, an injection-locked ring PLL (ILRPLL) architecture is proposed to solve this problem. Using the concept of sub-sampling PLLs [3], the injection window is aligned automatically without feedback adjustment. A 432MHz ILRPLL is realized in ATV/DTV system to justify this technique.	analog-to-digital converter;archaeopteryx;crystal oscillator;frequency offset;injection locking;lock (computer science);phase noise;phase-locked loop;ring oscillator;sampling (signal processing);voltage-controlled oscillator	Che-Fu Liang;Keng-Jan Hsiao	2011	2011 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference	10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746232	control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;pll multibit	EDA	60.205652002307396	49.978251519541594	20804

In this chip, concepts of system-on-chip (SOC) design and effective system integration technique are well-combined together to realize a highly miniaturized real-time EEG processing system.. The core area and total power consumption of the chip are respectively 1246*1246μm2 and 25.03mW. The chip operations were validated by ADVANTEST V93000 PS1600 and the results obtained match with the software simulation. The average correlation coefficient between original source signals and extracted ORICA signals reaches 0.9572. Eye blink artifact, and facial muscle artifact will be removed automatically. Producing a pure EEG signal is beneficial for real-time data analysis; therefore, this chip design can enhance the reliability and feasibility of EEG-related applications, such as BCI, medical diagnosis and depth of anesthesia detection.

It is a challenging task to obtain coherent sampling for accurate spectral testing. Windowing techniques are widely used to perform spectral testing when the sampling is slightly noncoherent. This paper proposes a new Fundamental Identification and Replacement (FIR) method. The proposed method can estimate the spectral characteristics accurately without requiring coherent sampling. The method is robust to any level of non-coherency, which makes on-chip spectral testing possible. The new method is computationally efficient and is applicable for high resolution spectral testing. Furthermore, the proposed method can perform both single tone signal test and multiple tone signal test accurately. The method gives accurate results even in situations when the windowing techniques cannot give correct results. Simulation results show the robustness and the computational efficiency of the proposed method. The method is also validated with the experimental data.	algorithmic efficiency;coherence (physics);coherent sampling;computation;distortion;fast fourier transform;finite impulse response;image resolution;mixed-signal integrated circuit;sampling (signal processing);selective calling;signal processing;simulation	Siva Sudani;Minshun Wu;Degang Chen	2011	2011 IEEE International Test Conference	10.1109/TEST.2011.6139176	chip;system on a chip;estimation;electronic engineering;image resolution;computer science;discrete fourier transform;signal processing;harmonic analysis;software testing;test method;statistics	Robotics	61.87573051120528	23.815632827668345	20849

We assume that each agent has limited information about the problem data and communicates with other agents at discrete times of its choice. Our main contribution is the development of a distributed continuous-time dynamics and a set of state-based rules, termed triggers, that an individual agent can use to determine when to broadcast its state to neighboring agents to ensure convergence. Our technical approach to the algorithm design and analysis overcomes a number of challenges, including establishing convergence in the absence of a common smooth Lyapunov function, ensuring that the triggers are detectable by agents using only local information, and accounting for the asynchronism in the state broadcasts of the agents.

The proposed method has the same functional capabilities as the level set method for shape optimization. The first advantage of the method is the simplicity of computation, since extra operations such as re-initialization of functions are not required. The second is compatibility with the topology optimization method due to the similar domain representation and the sensitivity analysis. Structural shapes are represented by the phase field function defined in the design domain, and this function is optimized by solving a time-dependent reaction diffusion equation. The artificial double-well potential function used in the equation is derived from sensitivity analysis. We study four types of 2D or 2.5D (axisymmetric) optimization problems. Two are the classical problems of photonic crystal design based on the Bloch theory and photonic crystal wave guide design, and two are the recent topics of designing dielectric left-handed ∗Corresponding author.

Although the emphasis of the paper is on the inverse problem, we adapt a computationally more efficient approach to study the solution of the direct problem in the context of the scattering model. Specifically, the direct model problem is equivalently formulated into a two-point spatially stochastic boundary value problem, for which the existence and uniqueness of the pathwise solution is proved. In particular, an explicit formula is deduced for the solution from an integral representation by solving the two-point boundary value problem. Based on this formula, a novel and efficient strategy, which is entirely done by using the fast Fourier transform, is proposed to reconstruct the mean and the variance of the random source function from measurements at one boundary point, where the measurements are assumed to be available for many realizations of the source term. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.	fast fourier transform	Gang Bao;Shui-Nee Chow;Peijun Li;Hao-Min Zhou	2014	Math.

Our proposed design is built using thyristor-based sensors, time difference amplifier (TDA), time difference comparator, voting mechanism, and diffusion algorithm circuit. Multiple identical thyristor-based sensors are fabricated on the same chip. Due to the manufacturing process variations, each sensor produces two slightly different delay values that can be compared in order to create a digital identification for the chip. Diffusion algorithm circuit further ensures that the proposed PUF is able to effectively identify a population of integrated circuits. We also improve the stability of PUF design with respect to temporary environmental variations, such as temperature and supply voltage with the introduction of TDA and voting mechanism. The thyristor-based PUF is fabricated in a 0.18-$\mu \text{m}$ CMOS technology. Experimental results show that the PUF has a good output statistical characteristic of a uniform distribution and a high stability of 96.8% with respect to temperature variation from -40 °C to 100 °C, and supply voltage variation from 1.7 to 1.9 V.	algorithm;cmos;comparator;differential amplifier;integrated circuit;physical unclonable function;sensor;thyristor;time value of money;topological data analysis	Chuang Bai;Xuecheng Zou;Kui Dai	2016	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2398454	thyristor;control engineering;electronic engineering;sensitivity;engineering;electrical engineering;integrated gate-commutated thyristor;reliability	EDA	59.706754082078184	47.32154221598293	20929

The implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains in efficiency. The tight coupling of CAD and analysis within IGA requires knowledge from both fields and it is one of the goals of the present paper to outline much of the commonly used notation. In this manuscript, through a clear and simple Matlab R © implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to the Finite Element (FE) method and related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. The open source Matlab R © code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The Bézier extraction concept that allows FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated.

The generalized Newtonian fluids contain Newtonian fluids, shear thickening and shear thinning non-Newtonian fluids. The mathematical model is the generalized system of Navier–Stokes equations. The finite volume method combined with an artificial compressibility method is used for spatial discretization. For time discretization the explicit multistage Runge–Kutta numerical scheme is considered. Steady state solution is achieved for t ?1 using steady boundary conditions and followed by steady residual behavior. For unsteady solution a dual-time stepping method is considered.

fbf86ef458b73fb88a1ada72c6bd85258d3b3b08	a low-voltage high-swing colpitts vco with inherent tapped capacitors based dynamic body bias technique		A low-voltage high-swing voltage-biased Colpitts voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is proposed for wireless applications. A small capacitive voltage divide factor is chosen to enhance the output swing and improve the phase noise performance. To further enhance the negative resistance, and thus decrease the start-up time, the bulk terminals of the gm-boosting transistors are dynamic-biased by the low-swing nodes provided by the inherent tapped capacitors in Colpitts VCOs. Due to the switching operation mode of the gm-boosting transistors and the absence of common-mode nodes for the switching transistors, the flicker noises up-conversion is largely suppressed. Designed in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the postlayout simulation results show that it provides a phase noise of −127.66 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset centered at 3.76 GHz and a figure-of-merit (FoM) of 192.4 dBc/Hz while dissipating 4.71 mW from a 0.6 V supply. The tuning range is 17% (from 3.28 GHz to 3.89 GHz) and the 1/f 3 phase noise corner is only 60 kHz.	cmos;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;colpitts oscillator;diode;emitter-coupled logic;flicker (screen);phase noise;pink noise;simulation;transistor;uptime;voltage-controlled oscillator	Jun Chen;Benqing Guo;Fading Zhao;Yao Wang;Guangjun Wen	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050374	phase noise;control theory;dbc;electronic engineering;capacitive sensing;colpitts oscillator;computer science;capacitor;voltage-controlled oscillator;negative resistance;cmos	Arch	62.11320678169191	47.590986805820485	21041
937a4d8a233361a80f2e1663f14cf93e11051299	new products		PXI Modules Support WLAN and WiMax RFIC Testing Aeroflex has released two new PXI modules to address the need for high-speed testing of RFICs and other devices designed for wireless local area network (WLAN) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMax) applications. The two new modules are the Aeroflex PXI 3025 6 GHz digital signal generator and the Aeroflex 3035 6 GHz wideband RF digitizer. The 3025 digital RF signal generator follows the recent introduction of the 3020A digital RF signal generator, which introduced new features for Aeroflex’s PXI RF signal generators that improve range, speed, accuracy, and flexibility for RF manufacturing and design verification. The 3010 RF synthesizer and the 3025 form a compact 3U-high precision digital RF signal generator complete with integrated dualchannel arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) that occupies just three PXI slots. The frequency range of the 3025 has been extended to 6 GHz to cover WLAN and WiMax frequencies. Modulation modes are extended to include internal AM/FM and external IQ vector modulation. List Mode and AWG file sequencing modes enable the user to set frequency, level, and AWG waveforms much faster and with greater flexibility. AWG sequencing enables long files to be generated, and a new option that offers analog IQ inputs and outputs allows the Aeroflex 3025 to be used for baseband stimulus generation as well as modulated RF generation. The 3035 RF digitizer is complementary to the 3025; it provides wideband high dynamic range A/D conversion of RF input signals up to 6 GHz. Together with the 3010 RF digitizer and measurement application software, the system provides vector signal analysis of RF signals.

In some practical applications, the measurements are usually acquired through low-resolution analog-to-digital converters because of the limitations in hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, we present the first hardware architectural design for an optimal signal recovery from coarsely quantized measurements, in which the sensing matrix is a partial discrete Fourier transform matrix. The optimal signal recovery can be achieved using a novel turbo-type algorithm. We develop a variety of approximations at the algorithm level and employ pipelining and folding techniques, which enable high-efficiency and low-complexity implementation.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;application-specific integrated circuit;approximation;compressed sensing;computer simulation;dft matrix;detection theory;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;ibm notes;nonlinear system;pipeline (computing);quantization (signal processing);single event upset;sparse matrix;transformation matrix	Junmei Yang;Chuan Zhang;Shi Jin;Chao-Kai Wen;Xiaohu You	2016	2016 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2016.44	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;compressed sensing	Robotics	59.87817781171295	25.097141630291567	21068

The pseudospectral abscissa is the largest real part of such an eigenvalue, and the pseudospectral radius is the largest absolute value of such an eigenvalue. We find conditions for the pseudospectrum to be Lipschitz continuous in the setvalued sense and hence find conditions for the pseudospectral abscissa and the pseudospectral radius to be Lipschitz continuous in the single-valued sense. Our approach illustrates diverse techniques of variational analysis. The points at which the pseudospectrum is not Lipschitz (or more properly, does not have the Aubin property) are exactly the critical points of the resolvent norm, which in turn are related to the coalescence points of pseudospectral components.	coalescing (computer science);pseudospectrum;resolution (logic);variational analysis	Adrian S.

The state equations describe an interface problem and the ultimate goal of our research is to determine the interface between two materials with different physical properties. The interface is identified by the minimization of the shape (or the cost) functional representing the misfit between the data and the simulations. For shape sensitivity of the shape functional we elaborate the material and the shape derivative method. In this concept a vector field is introduced that deforms the unknown shape toward the optimum. We characterize the elliptic interface problems whose solutions give the material and the shape derivatives. In particular, we show the existence of weak as well as strong material derivatives. Further, we employ the adjoint variable method to obtain an explicit expression for the gradient of the shape functional. This gradient is then used for the actual implementation of the minimization algorithm. In simulations we use the level set method for the representation of the interface. We present the simulation results showing the reconstructed voids in the nonlinear ferromagnetic material from the near-boundary measurements of magnetic induction.	algorithm;gradient;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;shape optimization;simulation	Ivan Cimrák	2012	SIAM J.

f5e323510402d09bc552fec5bb8f551a8624cb98	sensitivity and 3 db bandwidth in single and series-connected tunneling magnetoresistive sensors	magnetoresistive sensors;current sensors;high speed electronics;sensitivity bandwidth product;tunneling magnetoresistance	As single tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) sensor performance in modern high-speed applications is limited by breakdown voltage and saturation of the sensitivity, for higher voltage applications (i.e., compatible to 1.8 V, 3.3 V or 5 V standards) practically only a series connection can be applied. Thus, in this study we focused on sensitivity, 3 dB bandwidth and sensitivity-bandwidth product (SBP) dependence on the DC bias voltage in single and series-connected TMR sensors. We show that, below breakdown voltage, the strong bias influence on sensitivity and the 3 dB frequency of a single sensor results in higher SBP than in a series connection. However, the sensitivity saturation limits the single sensor SBP which, under 1 V, reaches the same level of 2000 MHz∙V/T as in a series connection. Above the single sensor breakdown voltage, linear sensitivity dependence on the bias and the constant 3 dB bandwidth of the series connection enable increasing its SBP up to nearly 10,000 MHz∙V/T under 5 V. Thus, although by tuning bias voltage it is possible to control the sensitivity-bandwidth product, the choice between the single TMR sensor and the series connection is crucial for the optimal performance in the high frequency range.	biasing;catabolism;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);frequency band;microscopy, scanning tunneling;sbp;sensitivity and specificity;series and parallel circuits;triple modular redundancy;tunneling protocol;sensor (device);standards characteristics;voltage	Michal Dabek;Piotr Wisniowski;Tomasz Stobiecki;Jerzy Wrona;Susana Cardoso;Paulo P.

The operators of the radiation hydrodynamics are splitted as such that the hydrodynamics equations are solved explicitly making use of the capability of well-understood explicit schemes. On the other hand, the radiation diffusion part is solved implicitly. The idea of the self-consistent IMEX method is to hybridize the implicit and explicit time discretizations in a nonlinearly consistent way to achieve second order time convergent calculations. In our self-consistent IMEX method, we solve the hydrodynamics equations inside the implicit block as part of the nonlinear function evaluation making use of the Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method [5,20,17]. This is done to avoid order reductions in time convergence due to the operator splitting. We present results from several test calculations in order to validate the numerical order of our scheme. For each test, we have established second order time convergence. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

These schemes are presented by 9-point stencils. We prove the V-cycle convergence adopting the theory developed for finite element methods to these schemes. To be more precise, we show that the energy norm of the prolongation operator is less than one and hence obtain the conclusion using the approximation and regularity property as in (2). In the numerical experiment section, we report contraction numbers, eigenvalues and condition numbers of the multigrid algorithm. The numerical test shows that for higher order schemes the multigrid algorithm converges much faster than for low order schemes. We also test the case of a nonuniform grid with a line smoother which also shows good convergence behavior.	finite difference method;multigrid method	Do-Young Kwak;J. S. Lee	2004	J. Num.

The second eliminates the need for a common-mode output reference voltage by deriving the common-mode output from a switched average of the power supplies. In the latter, nearly a full-scale input range is achieved while preserving the low-power low offset characteristics of earlier CTAs. Voltage comparator devices were constructed in 0.6-/spl mu/m double-poly, triple-metal CMOS to test the prototype CTA architectures. Input common-mode range and offset performance consistent with simulation data is demonstrated with a 10X reduction in input capacitance. Measured dynamic power dissipation on the order of 3-6 /spl mu/W/MSPS is observed.

Controlar o efeito de poluicao e especialmente dificil quando sao utilizadas malhas nao uniformes. Para malhas uniformes com elementos quadrados sao conhecidos metodos (p. e. o QSFEM, proposto por Babuska et al) que minimizam a poluicao. Neste trabalho apresentamos inicialmente dois metodos de elementos finitos de Petrov-Galerkin com formulacao relativamente simples, o RPPG e o QSPG, ambos com razoavel robustez para certos tipos de distorcoes dos elementos. O QSPG apresenta ainda poluicao minima para elementos quadrados. Em seguida e formulado o QOFD, um metodo de diferencas finitas aplicavel a malhas nao estruturadas. O QOFD apresenta grande robustez em relacao a distorcoes, mas requer trabalho extra para tratar problemas nao homogeneos ou condicoes de contorno nao essenciais. Finalmente e apresentado um novo metodo de elementos finitos de Petrov-Galerkin, o QOPG, que e formulado aplicando a mesma tecnica usada para obter a estabilizacao do QOFD, obtendo assim a mesma robustez em relacao a distorcoes da malha, com a vantagem de ser um metodo variacionalmente consistente. Resultados numericos sao apresentados ilustrando o comportamento de todos os metodos desenvolvidos em comparacao com os metodos de Galerkin, GLS e QSFEM.%%%%It is well known that classical finite elements or finite difference methods for Helmholtz problem present pollution effects that can severely deteriorate the quality of the approximate solution. To control pollution effects is especially difficult on non uniform meshes. For uniform meshes of square elements pollution effects can be minimized with the Quasi Stabilized Finite Element Method (QSFEM) proposed by Babusv ska el al, for example. In the present work we initially present two relatively simple Petrov-Galerkin finite element methods, referred here as RPPG (Reduced Pollution Petrov-Galerkin) and QSPG (Quasi Stabilized Petrov-Galerkin), with reasonable robustness to some type of mesh distortion. The QSPG also shows minimal pollution, identical to QSFEM, for uniform meshes with square elements. Next we formulate the QOFD (Quasi Stabilized Finite Difference) method, a finite difference method for unstructured meshes. The QOFD shows great robustness relative to element distortion, but requires extra work to consider non-essential boundary conditions and source terms. Finally we present a Quasi Optimal Petrov-Galerkin (QOPG) finite element method. To formulate the QOPG we use the same approach introduced for the QOFD, leading to the same accuracy and robustness on distorted meshes, but constructed based on consistent variational formulation. Numerical results are presented illustrating the behavior of all methods developed compared to Galerkin, GLS and QSFEM.

337ebf7225ddbc43db18a34c367f2e81ececd26e	low-complexity first-order constraint linearization methods for efficient nonlinear mpc		In this paper, we analyze first-order methods to find a KKT point of the nonlinear optimization problems arising in Model Predictive Control (MPC). The methods are based on a projected gradient and constraint linearization approach, that is, every iteration is a gradient step, projected onto a linearization of the constraints around the current iterate. We introduce an approach that uses a simple ℓp merit function, which has the computational advantage of not requiring any estimate of the dual variables and keeping the penalty parameter bounded. We then prove global convergence of the proposed method to a KKT point of the nonlinear problem. The first-order methods can be readily implemented in practice via the novel tool FalcOpt. The performance is then illustrated on numerical examples and compared with conventional methods.	algorithm;critical point (network science);duality (optimization);first-order predicate;first-order reduction;gradient;interior point method;iteration;local convergence;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method	Giampaolo Torrisi;Sergio Grammatico;Damian Frick;Tommaso Robbiani;Roy S.

We extend the idea of ergodic partition and propose a concept called coherent ergodic partition for visualizing ergodic components in a continuous flow. Numerically, we first apply the level set method [33] and extend the backward phase flow method [25] to determine the long time flow map. To compute all required long time averages of observables along particle trajectories, we propose an Eulerian approach by simply incorporating flow maps to iteratively interpolate those short time averages. Numerical experiments will demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. As an application of the method, we apply the approach to the field of geometrical optics for high frequency wave propagation and propose to use the result from the coherent ergodic partition as a criteria for adaptivity in typical Lagrangian ray tracing methods.	coherence (physics);dynamical system;ergodic theory;ergodicity;euler method;experiment;flow map;interpolation;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical method;observable;ray tracing (graphics);software propagation	Guoqiao You;Shingyu Leung	2014	J.

6ba65d94043c047d98420174d81542c6bebf8a2a	nonisolated high step-down converter with zvs and low current ripples		In this paper, a nonisolated high step-down converter is proposed. Energy transfer capacitor and built-in transformer are employed to achieve a very high step-down conversion ratio. Due to the interleaved technique, small values of output inductance can be used, leading to a fast transient response. Furthermore, the use of a coupled inductor reduces inductor current ripples, which implies lower losses. Two main switches and two synchronous rectifiers are used in the converter and all can achieve zero-voltage-switching. As no floating switches are employed, grounded gate drivers and boost strap drivers can be used, avoiding the use of complex isolated gate drivers. In addition, if the switches are shorted, the high input voltage does not appear at the output; thus, the load is protected. A 48 V/1 V 30 A prototype was built, and experimental results are provided to verify the performance of the converter.	active rectification;boost;built-in self-test;emitter-coupled logic;gate driver;network switch;prototype;rectifier;switched-mode power supply;transformer	Yifei Zheng;Shouxiang Li;Keyue Ma Smedley	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2833047	control theory;capacitor;engineering;digital down converter;transformer;voltage;inductance;inductor;transient response;magnetic flux	Arch	62.959122239494626	43.213162665274666	21392
0e731e7fc4142523d2957f42e18adfa7bee047b7	frequency-based load control in power systems	frequency response;supply and demand;time frequency analysis;frequency control	Maintaining demand-supply balance and regulating frequency are key issues in power system control. Conventional approaches focus on adjusting the generation so that it follows the load. However, relying on solely regulating generation is inefficient, especially for power systems where contingencies like a sudden loss in generation or a sudden change in load frequently occur. We present a frequency-based load control scheme for demand-supply balancing and frequency regulation. We formulate a load control optimization problem which aims to balance the change in load with the change in supply while minimizing the overall end-use disutility. By studying the power system model that characterizes the frequency response to real power imbalance between demand and supply, we design decentralized synchronous and asynchronous algorithms which take advantage of local frequency measurements to solve the load control problem. Case studies show that the proposed load control scheme is capable of relatively quickly balancing the power and restoring the frequency under generation-loss like contingencies, even when users only have the knowledge of a simplified system model instead of an accurate one.	algorithm;experiment;frequency response;generation loss;ibm power systems;load management;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;utility	Changhong Zhao;Ufuk Topcu;Steven H.

b1b3a81e26702b87543e1152393b63933f99c1ce	robust stability analysis of dc microgrids with constant power loads		This paper studies stability analysis of DC microgrids with uncertain constant power loads (CPLs). It is well known that CPLs have negative impedance effects, which may cause instability in a DC microgrid. Existing works often study the stability around a given equilibrium based on some nominal values of CPLs. However, in real applications, the equilibrium of a DC microgrid depends on the loading condition that often changes over time. Different from many previous results, this paper develops a framework that can analyze the DC microgrid stability for a given range of CPLs. The problem is formulated as a robust stability problem of a polytopic uncertain linear system. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we derive a set of sufficient conditions that can guarantee robust stability. The conditions can be efficiently checked by solving a convex optimization problem in polynomial time. The effectiveness and non-conservativeness of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a simulation example.	characteristic impedance;control theory;convex optimization;instability;linear system;mathematical optimization;microgrid;numerical stability;optimization problem;polynomial;simulation;time complexity	Jianzhe Liu;Wei Zhang;Giorgio Rizzoni	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963042	control engineering;capacitor;engineering;control theory;convex optimization;electrical impedance;instability;linear system;microgrid;real versus nominal value	ML	68.01176351948521	4.4523517408533975	21589
0ab108d69ec7573358157627a3ab0437324778ed	a new smoothed aggregation multigrid method for anisotropic problems	multigrid method;anisotropy;smoothed aggregation;multigrid;algebraic multigrid;amg	A new prolongator is proposed for smoothed aggregation (SA) multigrid. The proposed prolongator addresses a limitation of standard SA when it is applied to anisotropic problems. For anisotropic problems, it is fairly standard to generate small aggregates (used to mimic semi-coarsening) in order to coarsen only in directions of strong coupling. Although beneficial to convergence, this can lead to a prohibitively large number of non-zeros in the standard SA prolongator and the corresponding coarse discretization operator. To avoid this, the new prolongator modifies the standard prolongator by shifting support (non-zeros within a prolongator column) from one aggregate to another to satisfy a specified non-zero pattern. This leads to a sparser operator that can be used effectively within a multigrid V-cycle. The key to this algorithm is that it preserves certain null space interpolation properties that are central to SA for both scalar and systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). We present two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical experiments to demonstrate that the new method is competitive with standard SA for scalar problems, and significantly better for problems arising from PDE systems.

5b6c3f2a6364a12dfd0820133940253e8bcb1781	matrix-free iterative solution strategies for large dense linear systems		A purely algebraic approach to solving very large general unstructured dense linear systems, in particular, those that arise in 3D boundary integral applications is suggested. We call this technique the matrix-free approach because it allows one to avoid the necessity of storing the whole coefficient matrix in any form, which provides significant memory and arithmetic savings. We propose to approximate a non-singular coefficient matrix A by a block low-rank matrix̃A and to use the latter when performing matrix–vector multiplications in iterative solution algorithms. Such approximations are shown to be easily computable, and a reliable a posteriori accuracy estimate of ||A − Ã||2 is derived. We prove that block low-rank approximations are sufficiently accurate for some model cases. However, even in the absence of rigorous proof of the existence of accurate approximations, one can apply the algorithm proposed to compute a block low-rank approximation and then make a decision on its practical suitability. We present numerical examples for the 3D CEM and CFD integral applications, which show that, at least for some industrial applications, the matrix-free approach is robust and cost-effective. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	approximation algorithm;auxiliary memory;bidiagonalization;coefficient;computable function;computational electromagnetics;computational fluid dynamics;computer data storage;iterative method;john d. wiley;lanczos resampling;linear algebra;linear system;low-rank approximation;numerical analysis;reduction strategy (lambda calculus);robustness (computer science);the matrix	S.

QLMOR employs two novel ideas: 1) we show that nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and more generally differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with many commonly encountered nonlinear kernels can be rewritten equivalently in a special representation, quadratic-linear differential algebraic equations (QLDAEs), and 2) we perform a Volterra analysis to derive the Volterra kernels, and we adapt the moment-matching reduction technique of nonlinear model order reduction method (NORM) [1] to reduce these QLDAEs into QLDAEs of much smaller size. Because of the generality of the QLDAE representation, QLMOR has significantly broader applicability than Taylor-expansion-based methods [1]-[3] since there is no approximation involved in the transformation from original DAEs to QLDAEs. Because the reduced model has only quadratic nonlinearities, its computational complexity is less than that of similar prior methods. In addition, QLMOR, unlike NORM, totally avoids explicit moment calculations, hence it has improved numerical stability properties as well. We compare QLMOR against prior methods [1]-[3] on a circuit and a biochemical reaction-like system, and demonstrate that QLMOR-reduced models retain accuracy over a significantly wider range of excitation than Taylor-expansion-based methods [1]-[3]. QLMOR, therefore, demonstrates that Volterra-kernel based nonlinear MOR techniques can in fact have far broader applicability than previously suspected, possibly being competitive with trajectory-based methods (e.g., trajectory piece-wise linear reduced order modeling [4]) and nonlinear-projection based methods (e.g., maniMOR [5]).	algebraic equation;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;linear algebra;linear system;model order reduction;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical stability;polynomial expansion;rewriting;volterra's function	Chenjie Gu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2011.2142184	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;nonlinear system;mathematics;differential equation;statistics	EDA	88.42491581349051	21.037523093711716	21769

On the basis of a factorization of solutions as a product of a certain edge-singular weight $\omega$ times a """"regular"""" unknown, a characterization of the regularity of solutions is obtained in terms of the smoothness of the corresponding right-hand sides. In particular, for right-hand sides which are analytic in a Bernstein Ellipse, analyticity in the same Bernstein Ellipse is obtained for the """"regular"""" unknown. Moreover, a sharp Sobolev regularity result is presented which completely characterizes the co-domain of the Fractional-Laplacian operator in terms of certain weighted Sobolev spaces introduced in (Babu\v{s}ka and Guo, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2002). The present theoretical treatment relies on a full eigendecomposition for a certain weighted integral operator in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomial basis. The proposed Gegenbauer-based Nystr\""""om numerical method for the Fractional-Laplacian Dirichlet problem, further, is significantly more accurate and efficient than other algorithms considered previously. The sharp error estimates presented in this paper indicate that the proposed algorithm is spectrally accurate, with convergence rates that only depend on the smoothness of the right-hand side. In particular, convergence is exponentially fast (resp. faster than any power of the mesh-size) for analytic (resp. in nitely smooth) right-hand sides.

Area and power savings are obtained through both current reuse and oscillator tank sharing between the I and Q paths. Since this choice can cause I and Q amplitude/phase mismatches, the conversion gain is analyzed and a technique to minimize these errors is implemented. Moreover, since using a single tank makes quadrature generation at the local oscillator level costly and power-hungry, two alternative quadrature generation techniques in the RF path are proposed, together with the corresponding input matching strategies.	local oscillator;low-power broadcasting;radio frequency	Marika Tedeschi;Antonio Liscidini;Rinaldo Castello	2010	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2010.2053861	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;low-noise amplifier;oscillation;inductor	Visualization	62.20821664061031	51.893319594588675	21805

The mantle is the outer, solid 3,000-km-thick shell that overlies Earth’s fluid outer core. An enormous amount of geological and geophysical data has gone into determining the motion of the plates,1 and within the last few years direct GPS measurements have corroborated the geological constraints on the motions of plates. A fundamental question in geology has been, what drives the plates? This question has largely been solved—the plates are part of a system of large-scale thermal convection—and geodynamicists have moved on to more difficult questions, such as what are the details of the coupling between surface motions and deeper mantle flow? and why do we have plate tectonics as opposed to some other mode of tectonics or thermal convection? Answering these more subtle questions is complicated by the fact that the primary effect of plate motion is to consume the old ocean floor and recycle it into the mantle. The primary evidence of plate history is therefore limited to the past 100 to 200 million years or so (less than 10% of the overall history of plate tectonics). We therefore rely heavily on evidence drawn from theoretical and computational models and from the continents that are not consumed wholesale by plate motions. Ideally these two sources of evidence go hand in hand to reinforce each other.	computation;computational model;computer simulation;global positioning system;mantle	Louis Moresi;Michael Gurnis;Shijie Zhong	2000	Computing in Science and Engineering	10.1109/5992.841793	computer simulation;complex dynamics;computational fluid dynamics;numerical analysis;mantle convection;convection;tectonics	AI	96.95028128544746	6.438789731721363	21831

93443298ce3acf2fe62a020f6c4e1704e73530e9	frequency adaptive pre filtering stage for differentiation based control of shunt active filter under polluted grid conditions		A differentiation based control method for a shunt active power filter is used in this paper for functioning in the presence of grid voltage distortion and imbalance. To enable the fast and accurate estimation of the variables in the presence of unbalancing or distortion in the grid voltages, a pre-filtering scheme is considered based on the dual second order generalized integrator (DSOGI) approach. The signal recomposition performed by the pre-filter isolates the harmonics from the voltage and current waveforms, and the differentiation FLL (dFLL) is able to estimate the frequency of the waveforms which is used as a feedback for the pre-filter, thus making the system frequency adaptive. The control algorithm is validated with both simulation studies and a hardware prototype of a active power filter carrying out current compensation robustly, demonstrating the speed and accuracy of the system under grid voltage distortions and maintaining less than 5% supply current total harmonic distortion THD as dictated by IEEE Std. 519-2014.	active filter;algorithm;automatic differentiation;prototype;simulation;total harmonic distortion	Sanchit Mishra;Ikhlaq Hussain;Bhim Singh;Ambrish Chandra;Kamal Al-Haddad	2017	2017 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2017.8101796	total harmonic distortion;integrator;harmonics;frequency-locked loop;filter (signal processing);active filter;distortion;shunt (electrical);electronic engineering;control theory;engineering	Visualization	66.98195123867913	40.88345319431291	21865

These solutions frequently appear when an iterative algorithm is used to solve a vector optimization problem. We consider a concept of approximate efficiency introduced by Kutateladze and widely used in the literature to study this kind of solutions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Kutateladze’s approximate solutions are given through scalarization, in such a way that these points are approximate solutions for a scalar optimization problem. Necessary conditions are obtained by using gauge functionals while monotone functionals are considered to attain sufficient conditions. Two properties are then introduced to describe the idea of parametric representation of the approximate efficient set. Finally, through scalarization, characterizations and parametric representations for the set of approximate solutions in convex and nonconvex vector optimization problems are proved and the obtained results are applied to Pareto problems.	approximation algorithm;iterative method;mathematical optimization;monotone polygon;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;vector optimization	César Gutiérrez;Bienvenido Jiménez;Vicente Novo	2006	Comp.

A finite element method using piecewise quadratic splines that are globally C 1 is introduced; its novelty lies in the norm associated with the method, which is stronger than the usual energy norm and is “balanced”, i.e., each term in the norm is O(1) when the norm is applied to the true solution of the system. On a standard Shishkin mesh with N subintervals, it is shown that the method is O ( N − 1 ln N ) $O(N^{-1}\ln N)$ accurate in the balanced norm. Numerical results to illustrate this result are presented.	coefficient;finite element method;numerical method;spline (mathematics)	Runchang Lin;Martin Stynes	2015	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-015-9969-6	singular perturbation;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;matrix norm;mathematics;reaction–diffusion system	Theory	87.48522581820538	12.672627010534768	21925

By relying on a family of random systems itself, we first set up the abstract result when it is convergent, uniformly absorbing and uniformly random when asymptotically null in the phase space. Then we apply the results to the second-order lattice dynamical system driven by multiplicative white noise. It is indicated that the criterion depending on the dynamical system itself seems more applicable than the existing ones to lattice differential models.	coupled map lattice;dynamical system;scott continuity;semi-continuity;semiconductor industry;white noise	Anhui Gu;Yangrong Li	2017	I.

It is shown that the method is also stable in case of systems with  negative definite matrices and sometimes may be also successful if the matrix is neither positive nor negative definite. The  algorithm handles systems with complex symmetric (not Hermitian) matrices, too. This fact has deep physical sense and engineering  applications since systems with negative definite matrices are common in tasks of dynamics and post buckling analysis in civil  and mechanical engineering. Possibility of utilization of Choleski-Banachiewicz algorithm to such problems can be very practical.

1cdffce74779ae144c16fa75366417bae296ccf9	active thermal loading control of the modular multilevel converter by a multi-objective optimization method		The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become the most attractive converter topology for medium/high-power applications. However, uneven power loss distribution and thermal loading among the semiconductor devices of each submodule (SM) compromise the reliability and lifetime of the converter. In this paper, an active thermal loading control method for the MMC is proposed to simultaneously (i) minimize the total semiconductor power loss and (ii) balance the thermal loading of the semiconductor devices within each submodule. In the proposed method, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved to establish a trade-off between the total power loss and the power loss of the semiconductor devices with the highest thermal loading. Subsequently, the Pareto optimal solutions for circulating currents, output common-mode voltage, and capacitor voltages are explored. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by simulation and experimental studies.	anatomy, regional;capacitor device component;converter device component;mathematical optimization;memory management controller;mitomycin;multi-objective optimization;multilevel analysis;numerous;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;semiconductor device;simulation;solutions	Qichen Yang;Maryam Saeedifard	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216772	capacitor;control engineering;engineering;multi-objective optimization;semiconductor device;voltage;modular design;integrated circuit;optimization problem;compromise	EDA	61.989917845188806	39.226133301659374	21948

This package employs high-order adaptive methods in time and space within a method-of-lines approach and provides tolerance control of the spatial and temporal errors. The DAEs resulting from the spatial discretization (based on B-spline collocation) are handled by a substantially modified version of the Runge-Kutta solver, RADAU5. For each time step, the RADAU5 code computes an estimate of the temporal error and requires it to satisfy the user tolerance. After each time step BACOLR then computes a high-order estimate of the spatial error and requires this error estimate to satisfy the user tolerance. BACOLR was developed through a substantial modification of the adaptive method-of-lines package, BACOL. In this article we introduce the BACOLR package and present numerical results to show that the performance of BACOLR is comparable to and in some cases significantly superior to that of BACOL, which was shown in previous work to be more efficient, reliable and robust than other existing codes, especially for problems with solutions exhibiting narrow spikes or boundary layers.	algorithm;b-spline;code;collocation;discretization;error detection and correction;method of lines;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;runge–kutta methods;solver	Runqiu Wang;Patrick Keast;Paul H.

The ability to conduct high current at high temperatures through the 1D structure is making the CNT interconnect technology an attractive one. Single wall and multi wall CNT interconnects have received greater interest initially when the mixed CNT bundles (MCBs) did not get much attention as VLSI interconnects. But, it was only in 2007 when the conductance study of mixed CNT bundles was done and since then many works have been reported. At this stage, it is essential to review the reports of MCB based interconnect technology. We present in this paper, the first review on MCB VLSI interconnects.	electrical connection;very-large-scale integration	P. Uma Sathyakam;Partha Sharathi Mallick	2012	Nano Comm.

Given a univariate function whose domain consists of n distinct values, it begins by employing a base-2 expansion to express the function in terms of the ceiling of log2n binary and n continuous variables, using linear restrictions to equate the functional values with the possible binary realizations. The representation of the product of such a function with a nonnegative variable is handled via an appropriate scaling of the linear restrictions. Products of m functions are treated in an inductive manner from i = 2 to m, where each step i uses such a scaling to express the product of function i and a nonnegative variable denoting a translated version of the product of functions 1 through i-1 as a newly defined variable. The resulting representations, both in terms of one function and many, are important for reformulating general discrete variables as binary, and also for linearizing mixed-integer generalized geometric and discrete nonlinear programs, where it is desired to economize on the number of binary variables. The approach provides insight into, improves upon, and subsumes related linearization methods for products of functions of discrete variables.	binary number	Warren P. Adams;Stephen M.

In this context, consensus-based methods have been advocated because of their simplicity, fault tolerance and versatility. This paper presents a new consensus-based decentralized algorithm for a class of non-convex optimization problems that arises often in inference and learning problems, including `sparse dictionary learning' as a special case. For the proposed algorithm, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence to a stationary point. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and provide evidence that validates our convergence claim.	algorithm;big data;convex optimization;fault tolerance;machine learning;mathematical optimization;numerical method;signal processing;sparse dictionary learning;sparse matrix;stationary process	Hoi-To Wai;Tsung-Hui Chang;Anna Scaglione	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178631	convex function;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;convergence;k-svd;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;signal processing;population-based incremental learning	Robotics	62.72178174916644	9.705342403962659	22017
cf9d17f40d21e6e7791f0f3c874788baa77533a2	a smart transformer-rectifier unit for the more electric aircraft		In the framework of the More Electric Aircraft (MEA), an efficient and flexible power distribution system is of paramount importance. Considering the presence of both AC and DC loads at multiple voltage levels, the distribution system of the most modern aircrafts is intrinsically hybrid. In this scenario, the different buses are connected by AC/DC converters. The simplest approach is to use a Transformer-Rectifier Unit (TRU) based on a low-frequency transformer followed by passive rectifiers to perform the AC/DC conversion. This solution, however, is intrinsically uni-directional, introduces current harmonics in the AC side and can have a considerable size. This paper proposes the use of a Smart-TRU, based on a Cascaded H-Bridge topology and a multi-port DC/DC converter, to solve the issues of the traditional TRU, increasing the controllability of the system. Experiments show how the proposed STRU is resilient to faults in the AC side.	bridge circuit;fault tolerance;h bridge;rectifier;smart tv;transformer;virtual circuit	Giampaolo Buticchi;Christopher Gerada;Youngjong Ko;Marco Liserre	2018	2018 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433784	controllability;voltage;harmonics;control engineering;transformer;engineering;rectifier	Arch	63.12307030408132	39.19613683251517	22040

Design in small-scale technologies can reduce the power and area of digital processing. However, due to the accompanied reduced supply voltage (VDD), the analog front-end (AFE) faces significant challenges in maintaining a large dynamic range in a power- and area-efficient manner [1-3]. A large dynamic range is important to handle the large signals expected during motion [1]. In this paper, we demonstrate a 0.6V ECG readout in 40nm technology for ambulatory applications. It can handle up to 40mVpp AC-signal and up to 300mV DC-electrode offset while consuming 3.3μW power and 0.015mm2 area. These results are achieved by implementing a time-domain-based readout architecture that focuses on scalable design techniques and especially avoids high-gain opamps and large passives. The AFE achieves more than 5× increase in AC dynamic range compared with previous work with similar silicon area and similar VDD [2], without compromising on the power consumption (see Fig. 28.5.6).	analog front-end;cmos;digital data;front and back ends;high dynamic range;operational amplifier;scalability;system on a chip;value-driven design	Rachit Mohan;Samira Zaliasl;Georges G.

In this study, we designed and fabricated an RSFQ microwave chopper, which turns on and off an externally applied microwave to control qubit states with the time resolution of sub-nanosecond. The chopper is implemented in a microwave module and mounted in a dilution refrigerator. We tested the microwave chopper at 4.2 K. The amplitude of the output microwave was approximately 100 μV which is much larger than that of previously designed chopper. We also confirmed that the irradiation time can be controlled by RSFQ control circuits.	microwave;rapid single flux quantum;superconducting quantum computing	Naoki Takeuchi;Yuki Yamanashi;Nobuyuki Yoshikawa	2010	IEICE Transactions		control engineering;electronic engineering;quantum information;rapid single flux quantum;engineering;electrical engineering;quantum computer;physics;quantum mechanics	OS	70.53378377758152	50.12654115963304	22105
735828eb9f476834cc9ecf63a0fb96218930e295	the q -gradient vector for unconstrained continuous optimization problems		In the beginning of nineteenth century, Frank Hilton Jackson generalized the concepts of derivative in the q -calculus context and created the q -derivative, widely known as Jackson’s derivative. In the q -derivative, the independent variable is multiplied by a parameter q and in the limit, q → 1 , the q -derivative is reduced to the classical derivative. In this work we make use of the first-order partial q -derivatives of a function of n variables to define here the q -gradient vector and take the negative direction as a new search direction for optimization methods. Therefore, we present a q -version of the classical steepest descent method called the q -steepest descent method, that is reduced to the classical version whenever the parameter q is equal to 1 . We applied the classical steepest descent method and the q -steepest descent method to an unimodal and a multimodal test function. The results show the great performance of the q -steepest descent method, and for the multimodal function it was able to escape from many local minima and reach the global minimum.	continuous optimization;distribution (mathematics);first-order predicate;frank rosenblatt;gradient descent;jackson;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multimodal interaction;shadow volume	Aline Cristina Soterroni;Roberto Luiz Galski;Fernando Manuel Ramos	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-20009-0_58	optimization problem;quadratic unconstrained binary optimization;continuous optimization;vector optimization	ML	75.68394257737313	23.512337024354867	22143

Then a new solution algorithm is proposed according to the theoretical analysis. And some numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

7616b3685532fe61f8b2df4c1062deeb7b4af6ab	quantum hamiltonian identifiability via a similarity transformation approach and beyond		The identifiability of a system is concerned with whether the unknown parameters in the system can be uniquely determined with all the possible data generated by a certain experimental setting. A test of quantum Hamiltonian identifiability is an important tool to save time and cost when exploring the identification capability of quantum probes and experimentally implementing quantum identification schemes. In this paper, we generalize the identifiability test based on the Similarity Transformation Approach (STA) in classical control theory and extend it to the domain of quantum Hamiltonian identification. We employ STA to prove the identifiability of spin-1/2 chain systems with arbitrary dimension assisted by single-qubit probes. We further extend the traditional STA method by proposing a Structure Preserving Transformation (SPT) method for non-minimal systems. We use the SPT method to introduce an indicator for the existence of economic quantum Hamiltonian identification algorithms, whose computational complexity directly depends on the number of unknown parameters (which could be much smaller than the system dimension). Finally, we give an example of such an economic Hamiltonian identification algorithm and perform simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;control theory;experiment;hall-effect thruster;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);quantum;qubit;simulation;spin-½	Yuanlong Wang;Daoyi Dong;Akira Sone;Ian R.

The method gives reliable results in the form of analytical approximation. Thus, the method is seen to be a very reliable alternative tool for finding analytical solutions of more complex equations. Use of small parameter or linearisation is not needed in the present approach as opposed to numerical methods. The aim of this work is to derive approximations to the solution of the diffusion equations. The method and its ability are illustrated in solving seven examples. The obtained solutions converge to the analytical solutions and are in very good agreement with the literature. The proposed method is realised to be more cost-effective in terms of computation. The DGJ method is seen to be a very good alternative to existing iterative techniques.	nonlinear system	Murat Sari;Abdurrahim Gunay;Gürhan Gürarslan	2011	IJMNO	10.1504/IJMMNO.2011.043086	local convergence;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;iterative method;ode	Vision	83.39808026403	17.075603573593572	22206

Then there exist algorithms that decid e onstructively if the coefficients of their power series representations can be given within the c lass of nested sums over hypergeometric products. In this article we will work out the calculatio n steps that solve this problem. First, we will present a successful tactic that has been applied rec ently to challenging problems coming from massive 3-loop Feynman integrals. Here our main tool is to solve scalar linear recurrences within the class of nested sums over hypergeometric product s. Second, we will present a new variation of this tactic which relies on more involved summa tion technologies but succeeds in reducing the problem to solve scalar recurrences with lower recurrence orders. The article will work out the different challenges of this new tactic and demo nstrates how they can be treated efficiently with our existing summation technologies.	algorithm;coefficient;demo effect;enea ose;existential quantification;expect;matthews correlation coefficient;path integral formulation;preprocessor;recurrence relation	Jakob Ablinger;Arnd Behring;Johannes Blümlein;Abilio De Freitas;Carsten Schneider	2016	CoRR		combinatorics;mathematical analysis;boundary value problem;mathematics;field theory;differential equation;algebra	Theory	79.42578931991308	13.531441110606975	22229

Our approach is based on the multilevel interface solver applied to the Schur complement reduction onto the nested refined interface associated with a nonmatching decomposition of a polygon by rectangular substructures. This paper extends methods from Khoromskij and Prossdorf (1995), where the finite element approximations of interior problems on quasi‐uniform grids have been considered. For both interior and exterior problems, the matrix–vector multiplication with the compressed Schur complement matrix on the interface is shown to have a complexity of the order O(Nr log3Nu), where Nr = O((1 + pr) Nu) is the number of degrees of freedom on the polygonal boundary under consideration, Nu is the boundary dimension of a finest quasi‐uniform level and pr ⩾ 0 defines the refinement depth. The corresponding memory needs are estimated by O(Nr logqNu), where q = 2 or q = 3 in the case of interior and exterior problems, respectively.	computation	Boris N.

First, several important properties of 2-D recursive DAFs with NSHP support regions for filter coefficients are investigated. The stability of the 2-D recursive NSHP DAFs is guaranteed by using a spectral factorization-based algorithm. Then, the important characteristics regarding the proposed novel structure are discussed. The design problem of 2-D recursive digital filters using the novel structure is considered. We formulate the problem by forming an objective function consisting of the weighted sum of magnitude, group delay, and stability-related errors. A design technique using a trust-region Newton-conjugate gradient method in conjunction with the analytic derivatives of the objective function is presented to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem. The novelty of the presented 2-D structure is that it possesses the advantage of better performance in designing a variety of 2-D recursive digital filters over existing 2-D filter structures.

Numerical and symbolic methods are available to determine their expressions. In this paper the problems associated with the numerical determination of the base inertial parameters expressions in the context of low mobility mechanisms are analyzed and discussed through and example. To circumvent these problems two alternatives are proposed: a variable precision arithmetic implementation of the customary numerical algorithm and the application of a general symbolic method. Finally, the advantages of both approaches compared to the numerical one are discussed in the context of the proposed low mobility example.	algorithm;estimation theory;numerical analysis;symbolic-numeric computation	Xabier Iriarte;Javier Ros;Aitor Plaza;Jokin Aginaga;Vicente Mata	2017	CoRR		inertial frame of reference;expression (mathematics);mathematical optimization;mathematics	SE	84.3455423150263	16.777351902211464	22308

Prior to the decoder, such systems typically consist of a matched filter followed by a sampler that is controlled by a timing recovery algorithm to obtain soft channel outputs. This approach, however, performs poorly in the presence of impulsive noise. To overcome this problem, an impulse mitigation strategy derived from the myriad filtering framework is used to produce reliable symbol waveforms over a wide range of noise environments. This method proves to be fruitful in that all subsequent signal processing operations including symbol synchronization and iterative decoding are safe to process the symbol samples obtained hereafter, thereby retaining all their optimality and advantages	algorithm;baseband;carrier recovery;digital rights management;embedded system;interference (communication);iteration;matched filter;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;waveform;zero suppression	Teong Chee Chuah	2006	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2006.1706470	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory;matched filter	Visualization	59.37861441679177	15.106388330228391	22315

The vesicle evolution dynamics is governed by hydrodynamic and elastic forces. The elastic forces are due to local inextensibility of the vesicle membrane and resistance to bending. Numerically resolving vesicle flows poses several challenges. For example, we need to resolve moving interfaces, address stiffness due to bending, enforce the inextensibility constraint, and efficiently compute the (non-negligible) long-range hydrodynamic interactions. Our method is based on the work of Rahimian et al. (2010) [33]. It is a boundary integral formulation of the Stokes equations coupled to the interface mass continuity and force balance. We extend the algorithms presented in that paper to increase the robustness of the method and enable simulations with concentrated suspensions. In particular, we propose a scheme in which both intra-vesicle and inter-vesicle interactions are treated semi-implicitly. In addition we use special integration for near-singular integrals and we introduce a spectrally accurate collision detection scheme. We test the proposed methodologies on both unconfined and confined flows for vesicles whose internal fluid may have a viscosity contrast with the bulk medium. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of treating both intra-vesicle and inter-vesicle interactions accurately.	simulation	Bryan D. Quaife;George Biros	2014	J. Comput.

Firstly, the integrands are assumed to have the Puiseux expansions at the endpoints with arbitrary algebraic and logarithmic singularities. Secondly, the Euler-Maclaurin expansion of a general composite quadrature rule is obtained directly by using the asymptotic expansions of the partial sums of the Hurwitz zeta function and the generalized Stieltjes constant, which shows that the standard numerical integration formula is not convergent for computing the Hadamard finite-part integrals. Thirdly, the standard quadrature formula is recast in two steps. In step one, the singular part of the integrand is integrated analytically and in step two, the regular integral of the remaining part is evaluated using the standard composite quadrature rule. In this stage, a threshold is introduced such that the function evaluations in the vicinity of the singularity are intentionally excluded, where the threshold is determined by analyzing the roundoff errors caused by the singular nature of the integrand. Fourthly, two practical algorithms are designed for evaluating the Hadamard finite-part integrals by applying the Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Kronrod rules to the proposed framework. Practical error indicator and implementation involved in the Gauss-Legendre rule are addressed. Finally, some typical examples are provided to show that the algorithms can be used to effectively evaluate the Hadamard finite-part integrals over finite or infinite intervals.	type rule	Tongke Wang;Zhiyue Zhang;Zhifang Liu	2017	Adv.

920c1fae6b20b4b7818e244df523dceb44e20732	computing geometric lorenz attractors with arbitrary precision		The Lorenz attractor was introduced in 1963 by E. N. Lorenz as one of the first examples of strange attractors. However Lorenz’ research was mainly based on (non-rigourous) numerical simulations and, until recently, the proof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor remained elusive. To address that problem some authors introduced geometric Lorenz models and proved that geometric Lorenz models have a strange attractor. In 2002 it was shown that the original Lorenz model behaves like a geometric Lorenz model and thus has a strange attractor. In this paper we show that geometric Lorenz attractors are computable, as well as their physical measures.	arbitrary-precision arithmetic;computable function;lorenz cipher;lorenz system;numerical analysis;simulation	Daniel Graca;Cristobal Rojas;Ning Zhong	2017	CoRR		mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;lorenz system;mathematics;chaos theory	Theory	76.74933937383868	10.779812263652934	22466
b9cb9a061b6ffe854c4c2e06c888176edfb0c7b7	on the resilience of conjugate gradient and multigrid methods to node failures		In this paper, we examine the inherent resilience of multigrid (MG) and conjugate gradient (CG) methods in the search for algorithm-based approaches to deal with node failures in large parallel HPC systems. In previous work, silent data corruption has been modeled as the perturbation of values in the work arrays of a MG solver. It was concluded that MG recovers fast from errors of this type. We explore how fast MG and CG methods recover from the loss of a contiguous section of their working memory, modeling a node failure. Since MG and CG methods differ in their convergence rates, we propose a methodology to compare their resilience: Time is represented as a fraction of the iterations required to reach a certain target precision, and failures are introduced when the residual norm reaches a certain threshold. We use the two solvers on a linear system that represents a model elliptic partial differential equation, and we experimentally evaluate the overhead caused by the introduced faults. Additionally, we observe the behavior of the conjugate gradient solver under node failures for additional test problems. Approximating the lost values of the solution using interpolation reduces the overhead for MG, but the effect on the CG solver is minimal. We conclude that the methods also have the inherent ability to recover from node failures. However, we illustrate that the relative overhead caused by node failures is significant.	conjugate gradient method;multigrid method	Carlos Pachajoa;Wilfried N.

E-mail address: mau@dcci.unipi.it (M. Persico). Many approximate methods of quantum chemistry yield potential energy surfaces with discontinuities. While clearly unphysical, such features often fall within the typical error bounds of the method, and cannot be easily eliminated. The integration of nuclear trajectories when the potential energy is locally discontinuous is obviously problematic. We propose a method to smooth out the discontinuities that are detected along a trajectory, based on the definition of a continuous function that fits locally the computed potential, and is used to integrate the trajectory across the discontinuity. With this correction, the energy conservation error can be reduced by about one order of magnitude, and a considerable improvement is obtained in the energy distribution among the internal coordinates. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Knowing when a solution is unique has the obvious advantage of removing the need for searching for better solutions, but it can also provide useful insight into the algorithms themselves. We point out that for any convex optimization problem, if the objective function can be written as the sum of a function which is strictly convex in some subset S of the variables, and a second, convex function, then the solution is unique in the S variables. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the solutions of the SVM and ν-SVM classification and regression problems to be unique. We show how the analysis can be extended to a large class of kernel methods with a convex objective function and linear constraints. For SVMs, we show that if the solution is not unique, all support vectors are necessarily at bound, and the margin width is fixed for the set of solutions. The case of ν-SVMs is different, in that the margin width and offset can both change within a set of non-unique solutions, and that in the case of ν-SVM classifiers, the solution can be unstable with respect to small changes in ν; we show that this kind of instability, and the occurrence of non-unique solutions, are closely linked. We give simple examples illustrating these findings. Finally, the reasoning also leads to a simple method for computing the offset for an SVM classifier or regression model when the usual method for determining the offset does not apply.	algorithm;control theory;convex function;convex optimization;instability;kernel method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;support vector machine	Christopher J.

3390fa1119084ad557aba54ae213d383dcc9e9f3	preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions based on artificial compressibility method for solution of incompressible flows	artificial compressibility method;high order compact finite difference method;preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions;incompressible flows	The preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions based on the artificial compressibility (AC) method are implemented at artificial boundaries for the solution of two- and three-dimensional incompressible viscous flows in the generalized curvilinear coordinates. The compatibility equations and the corresponding characteristic variables (or the Riemann invariants) are mathematically derived and then applied as suitable boundary conditions in a high-order accurate incompressible flow solver. The spatial discretization of the resulting system of equations is carried out by the fourth-order compact finite-difference (FD) scheme. In the preconditioning applied here, the value of AC parameter in the flow field and also at the far-field boundary is automatically calculated based on the local flow conditions to enhance the robustness and performance of the solution algorithm. The code is fully parallelized using the Concurrency Runtime standard and Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) and its performance on a multi-core CPU is analyzed. The incompressible viscous flows around a 2-D circular cylinder, a 2-D NACA0012 airfoil and also a 3-D wavy cylinder are simulated and the accuracy and performance of the preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions applied at the far-field boundaries are evaluated in comparison to the simplified boundary conditions and the non-preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions. It is indicated that the preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions considerably improve the convergence rate of the solution of incompressible flows compared to the other boundary conditions and the computational costs are significantly decreased.	preconditioner	Kazem Hejranfar;Kaveh Parseh	2017	J.

The proposed parallel coupled line band-pass filters are composed of the parallel coupled lines and open stubs. The equivalent circuit of the proposed parallel coupled line band-pass filter is proposed and analyzed. By using odd–even mode analytical method, the design equations are derived. The relation between the center resonant frequency of the proposed band-pass filters and the electrical length is analyzed. The relation between the fractional bandwidth and the impedances is discussed. Two proposed parallel coupled line band-pass filters are designed, fabricated and measured based on the calculated results. The spurious frequencies of the proposed filters are suppressed and the transmission zeros improve the filters’ selectivity. The measured results and the simulated results show good agreement with each other, which verifies the design theory.

Predictive control calculates the future values of the variables to be controlled in order to choose the switching state that produces the minimum error between the variables and their references. Both methods have been tested and compared in simulation, obtaining sinusoidal output voltage and achieving unitary input displacement factor, with a THD of less than 2% for both the input currents and the output voltages.	ac/ac converter;algorithm;control theory;current source;displacement mapping;phase-locked loop;simulation;total harmonic distortion	Marco Rivera;José R.

We quantify the rate requirements and obtain optimal signaling, coding and control schemes for decentralized stabilizability in such multicontroller systems. We show that in the absence of a centralized decoder at the plant, there is in general a rate loss in decentralized systems as compared to a centralized system. This result is in contrast with the absence of rate loss in the stabilization of multisensor systems. Furthermore, there is rate loss even if explicit channels are available between the stations. We obtain the minimum data rates needed in terms of the open-loop system matrix and the connectivity graph of the decentralized system, and obtain the optimal signaling policies. We also present constructions leading to stability. In addition, we show that if there are dedicated channels connecting the controllers, rate requirements become more lenient, and as a result strong connectivity is not required for decentralized stabilizability. We determine the minimum number of such external channels leading to a stable system, in case strong connectivity is absent.	centralized computing;codec;decentralised system;distributed control system;linear system;requirement	Serdar Yüksel;Tamer Basar	2007	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2007.904279	control engineering;open-loop controller;adaptive control;information theory;decentralised system;control system;connectivity;graph theory;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;linear system	Theory	66.00395065959799	6.7702479129380775	22646

General evolution equations for the reconstruction of unknown obstacles are derived in terms of the underlying level set parameters. We show that using the appropriate form of parameterizing the level set function results a significantly lower dimensional problem, which bypasses many difficulties with traditional level set methods, such as regularization, re-initialization and use of signed distance function. Moreover, we show that from a computational point of view, low order representation of the problem paves the path for easier use of Newton and quasi-Newton methods. Specifically for the purposes of this paper, we parameterize the level set function in terms of adaptive compactly supported radial basis functions, which used in the proposed manner provides flexibility in presenting a larger class of shapes with fewer terms. Also they provide a “narrow-banding” advantage which can further reduce the number of active unknowns at each step of the evolution. The performance of the proposed approach is examined in three examples of inverse problems, i.e., electrical resistance tomography, X-ray computed tomography and diffuse optical tomography.	ct scan;colour banding;computation;diffuse optical imaging;newton;quasi-newton method;radial (radio);radial basis function;tomography	Alireza Aghasi;Misha Elena Kilmer;Eric L.

This design is achieved by cutting multi shapes in square pattern combined with crown & sierpinski fractal shapes and placing a single coaxial feed. The Sierpinski pre-fractal can be defined by an iterated function system (IFS). As a consequence, the geometry has a multilevel structure with many equal sub domains. It is experimentally found that the resonant frequency of the patch can be greatly lowered, and the higher the iteration order of the fractal shapes, the lower the resonant frequency becomes. And this property can be utilized to reduce the size of the microstrip patch antennas. It is also found that, the radiation patterns of the proposed fractal-shaped antennas maintained because of the self-similarity and Centro- symmetry of the fractal shapes. Crown & sierpinski fractal shapes patch antenna is designed on a FR4 substrate of thickness 1.524 mm and relative permittivity of 4.4 and mounted above the ground plane at a height of 6 mm. Bandwidth as high as 31.14% are achieved with stable pattern characteristics, such as gain and cross polarization, within its bandwidth. Impedance bandwidth, antenna gain and return loss are observed for the proposed antenna. Details of the measured and simulated results are presented and discussed.	crown group;experiment;fractal;iterated function system;iteration;microstrip;nominal impedance;polarization (waves);resonance;return loss;self-similarity;thickness (graph theory)	Yogesh Bhomia;Ashvini Chaturvedi;Yogesh Kumar Sharma	2012		10.1145/2345396.2345590	electronic engineering;cross-polarized wave generation;resonance;microstrip antenna;engineering;patch antenna;mathematics;geometry;radiation pattern;optics;fractal antenna;iterated function system;sierpinski triangle	HCI	66.53424893834	57.84382574974711	22724

The operation of the FPIM with distributed winding requires the elimination of third-harmonic voltage, which, if not taken care of, would generate distorted stator current. For this, the concept of virtual vectors (VVs) is utilized. Before selecting the VVs for the DTC operation, a theoretical analysis is carried out to find the effects of these VVs on the torque and flux response of the FPIM under different speed and loading conditions. It is found that the rotor speed plays a crucial role in the selection of VVs. A particular VV has different effects on the torque change as speed varies. This analysis helps in the selection of VVs, hysteresis torque bandwidth, flux bandwidth, and efficient formation of sectors. Furthermore, in this paper, the performance of the FPIM during low-speed operation is improved by avoiding the demagnetization of the stator flux. To achieve this, a new modified lookup table is proposed. Superiority of the proposed method over the reported approaches is illustrated by experimental results.	care-of address;hysteresis;lookup table;power inverter;r.o.t.o.r.;verification and validation	Saifullah Payami;Ranjan Kumar Behera	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2652397	control engineering;electronic engineering;torque sensor;hysteresis;network switch;stall torque;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor;torque;vector control;physics;torque motor;direct torque control	Robotics	65.98479958389913	40.496599505511966	22785

[6]. These models are based on the evolution of the electric potential in conducting media. The main feature lies in the transmission of the voltage potential which is proportional to the electric flux (the normal derivative of the potential). An adapted scheme is necessary to accurately simulate the voltage potential in the whole cell, notably at the membrane separating the cell from the outer medium. Our finite difference scheme is inspired by the method of Cisternino and Weynans [3] for elliptic problems with immersed interfaces. This is a Cartesian grid method based on the accurate discretization of the fluxes at the interface, through the use of additional interface unknowns. The aim of the paper is to present the method and to study its stability and convergence properties. We prove the first-order convergence of the method for the dynamic non-linear model in one dimension, and the second order convergence in the stationary linear one-dimensional case. This results are corroborated by numerical experiments in two dimensions.

Résumé : Dans cet article nous présentons une nouvelle méthode de différences finies pour la simulation de modèles d’électroperméabilisation, comme le modèle de Neu et Krassowska [10] ou le récent modèle de Kavian et al. [6]. Ces modèles sont obtenus via une description du potentiel électrique dans une cellule, et plus particulièrement de la transmission du potentiel de voltage, qui est proportionnelle au flux électrique (la dérivée normale du potentiel). Un schéma adapté est nécessaire pour simuler avec précision le potentiel électrique dans la cellule entière, et notamment sur la membrane séparant la cellule du milieu extérieur. Notre schéma aux différences finies est inspiré de la méthode développée par Cisternino et Weynans [3] pour des problèmes elliptiques avec des interfaces immergées. Il s’agit d’une méthode sur grille cartésienne basée sur une discrétisation précise des flux sur l’interface, grâce à l’utilisation de variables supplémentaires situées sur l’interface. Le but de cet article est de présenter la méthode et d’étudier sa stabilité et ses propriétés de convergence. Nous montrons que la méthode converge à l’ordre un dans le cas du modèle non-linéaire dynamique en dimension un, et à l’ordre deux dans le cas linéaire stationnaire en dimension un. Ces résultats sont corroborés par des expériences numériques en dimension deux.

1afe3520fbca629ad13e1f8d50a9cdd0f84378ca	integration of ripple correlation mppt technique with one-cycle-controlled transformerless inverter for single-phase single-stage photovoltaic systems		With the advent of distributed generation, single-phase rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) generators of small rating, feeding power to the utility grid has become popular. Cost and performance of the inverters used to integrate such systems to the grid depends upon the topology of the inverter used, modulation scheme employed, and the efficiency of auxiliary functions like maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The appropriate modulation scheme is generally decided by looking at the topology of inverter. For example, a transformerless H-bridge inverter is generally switched using bipolar modulation in order to avoid large leakage currents. However, selecting the appropriate technique for auxiliary functions like MPPT, is done independently and is generally not integrated with the control scheme. A large number of MPPT techniques were proposed in the literature, and choosing an appropriate technique suitable for the chosen inverter topology and the modulation scheme might be advantageous. This paper proposes the integration of one cycle control (OCC) modulation scheme for single-phase single-stage transformerless PV inverter with ripple correlation control (RCC) MPPT technique. Detailed numerical simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed integrated method. Real-time simulation studies are also carried out using the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to verify the efficacy of the system further.	anatomy, regional;choose (action);computational complexity theory;dna integration;extravasation;h bridge;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;maximum power transfer theorem;modulation;numerical weather prediction;optimistic concurrency control;penicillin v;phase-locked loop;power inverter;prolymphocytic leukemia;real-time clock;ripple effect;simulation;solar inverter;spectral leakage;steady state;sensor (device);voltage	Venkata R.

The existence of Hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium is obtained. Through analyzing the distribution of the eigenvalues we find that the unstable equilibrium state without dispersion may become stable with dispersion under certain conditions. Our results show that Crank-Nicolson and the backward Euler difference schemes are superior to the forward Euler difference scheme under the means of describing approximately the dynamics of the original system.

This paper introduces a fully integrated multi-channel impedance extraction circuit that can both generate AC stimulus signals over a broad frequency range and also measure and digitize the real and imaginary components of the impedance response. The circuit was fabricated in 0.5μm CMOS and consumes 355μW at 3.3V. Tailored for protein and lipid bilayer characterization, the signal generator produces sinusoidal waves from 1Hz to 10kHz. To suit a variety of applications, the impedance extraction circuit provides a programmable current measurement range from~100pA to 100nA with a measured resolution of ~100fA. Occupying only 0.045mm2 per measurement channel, the circuit is compact enough to include nearly 100 channels and the signal generator on 3 × 3mm die.	8-bit;analog-to-digital converter;best, worst and average case;cmos;characteristic impedance;frequency band;imaginary time;nominal impedance;output impedance;sensor;spurious-free dynamic range	Xiaowen Liu;Daniel Rairigh;Andrew J.

However, while moving over road-embedded pads during a regular driving and charging routines, the vehicle energy storage system is exposed to short-duration, high- energy bursts delivered from the road-embedded equipment. To manage energy storage and distribution inside a vehicle, a hybrid energy storage system is proposed, consisting of a battery and supercapacitor modules actively connected to an internal DC bus while supplying the inverter-motor drivetrain. Considering the specificity of the wireless charging system as a power delivery infrastructure, as well as the operational constrains of supercapacitor and battery storage units, we formulated the requirements and proposed a new energy management system (EMS). The proposed EMS strategy was verified for selected battery and supercapacitor modules through simulations over the downscaled standardized ECE-15 Urban Drive Cycle (UDC) and for various layouts of wireless charging infrastructure. Simulation results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid energy storage and superimposed EMS algorithm.	algorithm;computer data storage;embedded system;experiment;extended validation certificate;hp utility data center;power inverter;requirement;sensitivity and specificity;simulation	Ahmed Azad;Tarak Saha;Regan Zane;Zeljko Pantic	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7390888	embedded system;electronic engineering;propulsion;engineering;electrical engineering;supercapacitor;energy management	Embedded	60.61237724338178	37.902349154953946	22914

The proposed approach utilizes a static average consensus algorithm to reach agreement on the initial condition to the iterative optimization scheme and a dynamic average consensus algorithm to reach agreement on the gradient direction. The current distributed algorithm is guaranteed to exponentially recover the performance of the centralized algorithm. Though the current formulation focuses on maximum likelihood algorithm built on first-order methods, it can be easily extended to higher order methods.

The fractional operator is decomposed into a local part with memory length $\Delta T$ and a history part, where the local part is approximated by the direct convolution method and the history part is approximated by a fast memory-saving method. The current fast method has $O(n_0+\kappa(N)\log (n_T-n_0))$ active memory and $O(n_0n_T+\kappa(N)(n_T-n_0)\log (n_T-n_0))$ operations, where $n_0={\Delta T}/\tau,n_T=T/\tau$, $\tau$ is the stepsize, $T$ is the final time, and $\kappa{(N)}$ is the number of quadrature points in the truncated Gauss--Laguerre quadrature used in the fast method. We present numerical examples and compare with the known methods to verify the effectiveness of the fast method.	differintegral;stepping level	Fanhai Zeng;Ian W. Turner;Kevin Burrage	2018	J. Sci.

This endeavor requires judicious comparison of analog and digital realizations from the point of view of performance per unit of power consumed. Analog signal processing offers the advantage that power consumption can be minimized at both very low and very high frequencies. This short course explores the limits in reduction of power consumption for important analog blocks. The first presentation defines the physical limits of supply voltages and power consumption based on present-day technologies and transistor models. The second presentation addresses the limits of amplifiers and filters. For all circuit blocks, figures of merit are derived, followed by circuit techniques to improve them. In the third presentation, new opportunities are identified to reduce the power consumption in all types of analog-to-digital converters, with emphasis on the improvement of the FOM with technology. Finally, in the fourth presentation, power minimization techniques are discussed for power management blocks such as dc-dc converters.	amplifier;analog signal processing;analog-to-digital converter;low-power broadcasting;power management;transistor model	Willy M.

75b19bec880423cafccf550b23e4b0157ce38df8	pulsatile mhd flow of a casson fluid through a porous bifurcated arterial stenosis under periodic body acceleration		Abstract A mathematical model on the pulsatile flow of a Casson fluid through a porous stenosed artery with bifurcation in the presence of magnetic field and periodic body acceleration has been developed in the present study. The governing equation is expressed in terms of shear stress and the resulting momentum equation with the initial and boundary conditions is solved numerically by adopting finite difference schemes. The velocity distribution is obtained at different locations of the artery for various values of parameters involved in the study. The combined effects of bifurcation angle, stenotic height, yield stress, Hartmann number, Darcy number and time period on flow variables such as velocity, wall shear stress and resistive impedance have been observed. The shear stress along the outer wall of the parent artery is less than its corresponding value on the inner wall of the daughter artery. The shear stress along the outer wall of the parent artery and the inner wall of the daughter artery increase as Hartmann number increases. It is of interest to note that the flow resistance has a decreasing trend with the increasing value of half of the bifurcation angle and Darcy number. The wall shear stress and flow resistance are increased when the rheology of blood is changed from Newtonian to Casson fluid. It is worthwhile to note that the presence of magnetic field and porous medium increases the plug core radius which is for the first time, added to the literature. The plug core radius increases with increase in yield stress and decrease in stenotic height.		R. Ponalagusamy;S.

The salient characteristics of the proposed approximation theory is that it makes no recourse to the concept of a corresponding continuous-domain elliptic prototype reference transfer function. The approximation theory is based on the derivation of a discrete-domain normalized lowpass elliptic transfer function, and on the transformation of the normalized lowpass transfer function to the desired denormalized elliptic transfer function by using discrete-domain to discrete-domain frequency transformations. u003e	approximation theory	Behrouz Nowrouzian	1993			computer vision;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;elliptic rational functions;computer science;elliptic function;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;jacobi elliptic functions;elliptic curve point multiplication	Crypto	59.740237814700805	17.49659695550152	23000

Using this approximation, closed-form analytical expressions for the output voltage components of the implicit RMS detector are derived. The results obtained are compared with previously published results. This comparison shows that, using the proposed approximation, an improved estimation of the RMS value and the amplitudes of the second- and fourth-harmonic components of the implicit RMS detector can be achieved for any value of the input frequency and is not restricted to large values compared with the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter.	approximation algorithm;low-pass filter;sensor	Muhammad Taher Abuelma'atti	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2005262	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	68.4319677610969	48.40109689947563	23038

In particular we focus on the particle-partition of unity method (PPUM) yet the presented results hold for any partition of unity based enrichment scheme. The goal of our enrichment scheme is to recover the optimal convergence rate of the uniform h-version independent of the regularity of the solution. Hence, we employ enrichment not only for modeling purposes but rather to improve the approximation properties of the numerical scheme. To this end we enrich our PPUM function space in an enrichment zone hierarchically near the singularities of the solution. This initial enrichment however can lead to a severe ill-conditioning and can compromise the stability of the discretization. To overcome the ill-conditioning of the enriched shape functions we present an appropriate local preconditioner which yields a stable and optimally conditioned basis independent of the employed initial enrichment. The construction of this preconditioner is of linear complexity with respect to the number of discretization points. We obtain optimal error bounds for an enriched PPUM discretization with local preconditioning that are independent of the regularity of the solution globally and within the employed enrichment zone we attain a kind of super-convergence. The results of our numerical experiments clearly show that our enriched PPUM with local preconditioning recovers the optimal convergence rate of O(h) of the uniform h-version globally. For the considered model problems from linear elastic fracture mechanics we obtain an improved convergence rate of O(h) with δ ≥ 1 2 for p = 1. The condition number of the stiffness matrix is independent of the employed enrichment zone.	approximation theory;condition number;discretization;experiment;gene ontology term enrichment;meshfree methods;numerical analysis;preconditioner;rate of convergence;stiffness matrix;superconvergence	Marc Alexander Schweitzer	2011	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-010-0323-6	partition;partition of unity;mathematical optimization;uniform convergence;function space;numerical analysis;condition number;finite element method;calculus;linear model;mathematics;preconditioner;geometry;numerical linear algebra;rate of convergence;approximation property;numerical stability;algebra	ML	86.30554527024684	13.474407662868618	23050
51e6a07a358eea68f3265c45692aa542d2cc4e09	on the impact of cyber attacks on data integrity in storage-based transient stability control		Security of smart power systems is a sound concern as more cyber elements are added to the power grid. In this paper, we focus on cyber attacks that target data integrity in smart grid systems. We specifically investigate the impact of false data injection (FDI) attacks on distributed transient stability control schemes. As an example, we focus on the parametric feedback linearization (PFL) controller, and we derive closed-form expressions for the errors in rotors’ speed and angle as a result of cyber attacks on data integrity. Furthermore, we investigate adaptive control strategies to eliminate or minimize the impact of FDI attacks on system dynamics. The IEEE 68-bus test power system is used to numerically evaluate the impact of example attacks and to draw valuable insights.	data integrity;fault detection and isolation;ibm power systems;numerical analysis;parametric polymorphism;system dynamics	Abdallah K.

If the net entrance flow is nonzero, then the fluid velocity will not tend to zero as the distance from the entrance end tends to infinity when the fluid adheres at the cylinder wall and the fluid is initially at rest. Assuming that the entrance velocity data are small enough and that the fluid flow converges to a laminar flow as the distance down the pipe tends to infinity, it is shown that the convergence in energy measure is at least exponential.	cylinder seal;semiconductor industry;the wall street journal;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Changhao Lin;Lawrence E.

By projecting large matrix-valued functions to small subspaces dependent on parameter, linear systems of equations for eigenpair derivatives are greatly reduced from the original matrix size. Error bounds on the eigenpairs and their derivatives computed by OPM are established with trivial conditions, which is one of the main contributions of this paper. It is shown that if the deviations from small subspaces to invariant subspace corresponding to the desired eigenvalues and the derivatives of residuals of the computed eigenpairs tend to zero, then the computed eigenpairs and their derivatives converge to the desired eigenpairs and their derivatives. Next, a strategy to generate small subspaces in OPM is given based on the implicitly restarted Lanczos process IRLP for symmetric matrix-valued function. Convergence of the IRLP-based OPM is analysed in detail, which is the main emphasis of this method. Finally some numerical experiments are reported to show the efficiency of our method.	3d projection	Yaping Hu;Huiqing Xie	2013	Int. J. Comput.

In a polar transmitter, high-efficiency non-linear power amplifiers can be used for linearly modulated waveforms. Because of envelope bandwidth expansion in polar modulated transmitters, the design of a wide-bandwidth high-efficiency supply modulator is one of the most challenging aspects of a polar transmitter. The most common technique for providing wide-bandwidth low-noise supply modulation in a linear system PA is by using linear low-dropout regulators, however at backed-off power levels their efficiencies are low. Envelope tracking is another common technique for transmitter design. Although this technique relaxes the bandwidth requirement of the supply modulator, it uses a less efficient linear power amplifier. A parallel combination of linear and switch-mode regulators for a polar PA is proposed. A similar topology for EDGE PA regulators has been proposed.	audio power amplifier;bandwidth expansion;dropout (neural networks);issue tracking system;linear amplifier;linear system;modulation;nonlinear system;ripple;transmitter	Wing-Yee Chu;Bertan Bakkaloglu;Sayfe Kiaei	2008	2008 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523250	code division multiple access;transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;linear system;modulation	EDA	62.48760710127754	51.54989447280535	23160

One such concept is a smart phased array system on a chip (SoC). The combination of high-performance SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) bipolar devices, well-characterized RF/analog passive components, and dense CMOS digital technology provides the capability to create large multielement, electronically tunable phased arrays with onboard processing intelligence, inside a single die. This SoC will have superior characteristics of lower cost, weight, and size as compared to the large multichip, multitechnology, and multipackage systems in deployment today. Furthermore, using reconfigurable logic and embedded memory, this SoC has the advantage of dynamic software and digital signal processing engine updates, without expensive redesigns of the chip. This publication will describe the necessary ingredients to create such an SoC as well as relevant applications of smart phased arrays that require an SiGe HBT BiCMOS technology. Potential markets for this technology include communications systems, weather tracking, radio astronomy, automotive radar, cellular basestation capacity improvement, satellite and aerial resource imaging, ground-level airplane collision avoidance, as well as military tracking and guidance systems.	aerial photography;bicmos;cmos;computation;digital electronics;digital signal processing;embedded system;guidance system;heterojunction;image scaling;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;on-board data handling;phased array;radar;radio frequency;reconfigurable computing;silicon-germanium;software deployment;system on a chip	Brittin C.

AMS subject classi cations. 65N30, 65N25, 35D10. 2 1 Introduction Since the late 1970s the p-version of the nite element method, which achieves accuracy by increasing the order of polynomial on a xed mesh, has been one of the most used versions of the nite element method. The p-version has been well developed and is used in the approximation theory, numerical computation, and applications to mechanics and engineering. There are several commercial and research codes based on the p and h-p versions of the nite element method such as MSC/PROBE, FIESTA, MECHANICA, PHLEX, STRESSCHECK, and STRIPE. It was shown in 1980 that the p-version nite element solution in two dimensions converges at least as fast as the traditional h-version with quasi-uniform meshes, and that it converges twice as fast as the h-version if the solution has singularity of r -type. The upper bound of errors of the p version is of order O(p 2 +""""), where p is the order of polynomials and """" > 0, arbitrary([9]). In [7, 8] the """" was removed. In the middle of the 1980s the performance of the p-version in three dimensions was addressed in [11, 12]. A comprehensive analysis of the p-version approximation in one dimension is available in [14], where a precise asymptotic expression is given. Although signi cant progress have been made in past two decades, there are several important issues of the p-version in two and three dimensions remained to be answered. First of all, the lower bound of approximation error in energy norm and the optimal rate of convergence for the p-version nite element method has not been established. The precise asymptotic analysis for one dimension can not be carried over in two and three dimensions. The upper bound of approximation in three dimension is not sharp. Secondly, the precise inverse approximation theorems for the p-version are not available. Thirdly, there is a need of a reliable a-posteriori error estimator for the p-version. It is well known that the Sobolev spaces are not adequate for the analysis of the problems on non-smooth domains, and that the Besov spaces is a good tool for the hversion approximation, but is not e ective for the analysis of the p-version when solution is singular at vertices and edges of non-smooth domains. The weighted Besov spaces are introduced in this paper for the analysis of the best approximation of these singular solutions. In terms of the weighted Besov spaces the leading singular terms in local asymptotic expansion are precisely characterized, and the approximability of these singular functions is e ectively analyzed in two dimensions as well as in three dimensions. 3 It is worth noting that the weighted Besov space Bs; in three dimensions is de ned di erently in the neighborhoods of vertices, edges, and vertex-edges according to the different characters of the singularities of the solution for problems on polyhedral domains. With the help of various weighted Besov spaces we are able to derive the sharp lower and upper bounds of the error. It is proved in our papers that the lower and upper bounds are of the same order, which shows the optimal convergence rates of the p-version of the nite element solution. In the framework of the weighted Besov spaces, direct and inverse approximation theorems are established. This paper is the rst of a series devoted to the direct and inverse theorem of the p-version of the nite element method in two and three dimensions in the framework of the weighted Besov spaces. In this paper we shall set the framework for analyzing the pversion in two dimensions. In Section 2 we introduce the weighted Besov spaces Bs; (Q) with Q = ( 1; 1)2 and analyze the approximability of functions of the r -type, with > 0 in terms of the space Bs; (Q). The approximation of functions of r log r-type, with integer > 0, is analyzed in terms of the modi ed weighted Besov space Bs; (Q) in Section 3. Unlike the space Bs; (Q), the space Bs; (Q) is not exact of component , and it is only a uniform interpolation space according to the de nitions of [10]. Various properties of this modi ed spaces have to be carefully studied and strictly proved, in particular, the equivalent norms by the K-method and J -method and the reiteration theorems. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section on the e ectiveness of the Sobolev space Hs, the Besov space Bs, and the weighted Besov spaces Bs; and Bs; for the analysis of the h-version and the p-version of the nite element method. 4 2 Approximation to functions of r -type based on the weighted Besov space Bs; (Q) In order to analyze approximability of functions of r -type by higher-order polynomials, we shall introduce weighted Besov spaces to characterize these singular functions e ectively and precisely, which will lead to the optimal approximation of the p-version of the nite element solutions. 2.1 Sobolev and Besov spaces with Jacobi weights Let Q = In = ( 1; 1)n; n = 1; 2; 3, and let w ; (x) = n Y i=1(1 x2i ) i+ i (2:1) be a weight function with integer i 0 and real number i > 1, which is refereed to as Jacobi weight. Obviously, the Jacobi polynomials and their derivatives are orthogonal with the weight w ; (x).

For q = 2 , we have a theorem on the relation between Bs; 2;2(Q) and Hm; (Q) if s = m, an integer. Theorem 2.1 Bs; 2;2(Q) = Hm; (Q) for s = m, an integer. Proof: For the sake of simplicity we shall prove the theorem in one dimension, and then generalize it to the n-dimensional setting. For any u 2 H`; (Q); ` 0, there holds u(x) = 1 Xi=0 ai Pi(x; ) where Pi(x; ) = ( 1)i i! 2i (1 x2) di(1 x2)i+ dxi is the Jacobi polynomial of degree i.

Two DC/DC pulse-width modulation circuits sharing same power switches with interleaved half switching cycle are adopted in the proposed converter to reduce the current rating of transformer primary windings. Two inductors and four diodes are adopted in the secondary side to achieve current double rectifier, reduce output ripple current, and decrease the transformer secondary winding turns. Based on the pulse-width modulation scheme, the power switchers can be turned on at zero-voltage switching operation.

Raising voltage levels, they concluded, offered the most efficient means of achieving this objective. In the 1960s and 1970s, several of the world’s largest electric power suppliers began exploring the feasibility of building facilities capable of carrying ac/dc voltages in the ultrahigh ranges above 1000 and 600 kV, and China undertook a similar study in 1986. It was concluded that there is no technical barrier to designing and constructing facilities of this magnitude. The study further found that ultra-high-voltage (UHV) transmission lines not only could transport large blocks of electric energy over long distances but also could do so using fewer circuit lines and with minimum energy loss. In fact, UHV transmission is presently technically available in China and awaiting commercial applications. In this paper, the authors review China’s achievements in the field of UHV transmission research, including such key UHV concerns as electromagnetic environments, overvoltage and insulation coordination, lightning performance, liveline working, and equipment manufacture. The paper also covers design, construction, and testing of transmission lines, ac/dc test bases, and state grid simulation. The goal of their paper, say the authors, is to improve the safety and reliability of the future UHV grid in China but also to serve as a reference for other countries working to develop similar UHV grids. The accelerated demand for electric power experienced by expanding industrialized nations in the 1960s drove them toward developing increasingly higher voltage transmission systems. Even as transmission lines carrying 500 and 750 kV were coming online, researchers were working to push voltages above 1000 kV ac and 600 kV dc. The United States started work in this area as early as 1967, aiming to develop a system that could transmit large blocks of power while improving system stability and reducing environmental impact. In the 1970s, the former Soviet Union, seeking to increase its power transfer capacity over long distances and to strengthen the electrical links between integrated power systems, constructed a 1.17 km, 150 kV test line at its Bely Rast substation. In 1973, Japan, pressed by stability problems with its existing transmission network, as well as by problems involving short-circuit currents, considered overlaying its existing 500 kV network with one carrying 1000 kV. Italy began looking into UHV in the mid-1970s as a way to move electricity in bulk from power stations to distant load centers. One station, a kilometer-long test line generating 1000 kV, was used to study air insulation and the potential effects of corona at high voltages. Canada saw the need for UHV transmission systems above 1000 kV to move large quantities of power from remote hydroelectric stations to load centers located in its westernmost province, British Columbia. The main research and test facilities, generating 1000 kV, were situated at Canada’s Hydro-Quebec Institute of Research. Brazil entered the field of UHV research to resolve the problem of transmitting blocks of power on the order of 20 000 MW from the Amazon Basin to load centers at distances ranging from 1500 to 2500 km. Few countries, however, have witnessed the surge in demand for electric power as that experienced by China over the past 20 years. The nation is now at a critical point in its efforts to create an electric power structure able to Thispaper reviewsChina’s achievements in the field of UHV transmission research in order to improve the safety and reliability of the future UHV grid in China, and to serve as a reference for other nations.	columbia (supercomputer);critical point (network science);ibm power systems;kinetic void;logic level;microwave;prolog;simulation;situated;traction substation;transmission line;transmitter	Richard O'Donnell	2009	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2008.2011945	power station;electronic engineering;voltage;electric power;switched-mode power supply applications;base load power plant;power transmission;power control;engineering;high voltage;electrical engineering;stand-alone power system;electric power system;electric power transmission;distributed generation;power engineering;voltage optimisation;china	Mobile	60.62618500008809	36.19326299648265	23307

The attractor of the perturbed IFS is the graph of a bivariate fractal interpolation function (FIF) that interpolates arbitrarily given data on rectangular grids of R^2. We consider the error problem between the FIF generated by the perturbed IFS and the FIF generated by the original IFS. An explicit relation of the difference between the two bivariate FIFs is presented. Furthermore, we investigate the error of moment integrals of the two FIFs. An upper bound estimate for the error of moments is obtained.	bivariate data;error analysis (mathematics);fractal compression;interpolation;iterated function system;iteration;rough set	Hong-Yong Wang;Shou-Zhi Yang;Xiu-Juan Li	2008	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2008.03.026	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;perturbation;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;iterated function system	Logic	73.52530757895778	14.379309346414763	23343

The classical mean squared error (MSE) criterion and its variants have been widely used to solve this problem. However, it is well known that the MSE criterion produces biased parameter estimates when the signals of interest (especially the input) are corrupted with additive noise having arbitrary or no coloring (white). Alternative approaches require additional system constraints and explicit estimation of the noise covariances. Recently, we proposed a new criterion called the error whitening criterion (EWC) along with associated algorithms that solved the problem when the additive disturbances are white. However, the performance of EWC is not satisfactory when the disturbances are correlated (colored). In this paper, we propose a method based on the principles of the EWC that can consistently estimate the parameters of an unknown arbitrary linear system in colored input noise without estimating the noise covariances. We then present a novel stochastic gradient algorithm that estimates the optimal parameters in an on-line fashion. We briefly discuss the convergence of this algorithm and present extensive simulation results to show the superiority of this criterion over MSE.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;colors of noise;eisenstein's criterion;estimation theory;gradient;graph coloring;linear system;mean squared error;online and offline;signal processing;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;whitening transformation	Yadunandana N.

The evolution in time of the population density is determined by a partial differential equation (PDE). Most of the algorithms proposed to solve this PDE have used finite difference schemes. Here, I use the method of characteristics to reduce the PDE to a set of ordinary differential equations, which are easy to solve. The method is applied to leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons and produces an algorithm that is efficient and yields a stable and manifestly nonnegative density. Contrary to algorithms based directly on finite difference schemes, this algorithm is insensitive to large density gradients, which may occur during evolution of the density.	algorithm;biological neuron model;finite difference method;gradient;numerical partial differential equations;population	Marc de Kamps	2003	Neural Computation	10.1162/089976603322297322	calculus;discretization;mathematics;geometry;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	85.09518594147777	12.07799842350817	23406

First of all, a peak-constrained weighted least-squares (PCWLS) method is employed to design a set of FIR fixed fractional delay (FD) filters according to given specifications. The PCWLS FIR filters are implemented by the projected least-squares (PLS) algorithm. An iterative WLS model reduction technique is utilized to design denominators, which can guarantee the stability of designed IIR VFD filter if the iteration converges. The numerator of IIR fixed FD filters can be designed by two approaches: The Approach 1 solves linear equations based on the orthogonality principle; and the Approach 2 formulates the numerator design problem as a standard quadratic programming (QP) problem. The coefficients of IIR fixed FD filters are finally approximated by polynomial functions of FD. Three sets of examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;digital filter;emoticon;finite impulse response;group delay and phase delay;infinite impulse response;iteration;least squares;linear equation;polynomial;quadratic programming;vacuum fluorescent display	Hon Keung Kwan;Aimin Jiang	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378522	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;digital filter;2d filters;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;linear equation;least squares;quadratic programming	EDA	61.01612935764296	16.376310530256877	23451

To determine the best Chebyshev collocation method to do this, the accuracy of the real space Chebyshev differentiation, spectral space preconditioned Chebyshev tau, real space Chebyshev integration and spectral space Chebyshev integration methods are compared in the L2 and W 2,2 norms when solving linear fourth order boundary value problems; and in the L∞([0, T ];L2) and L∞([0, T ];W 2,2) norms when solving initial boundary value problems. We find that the best Chebyshev method to use for high resolution computations of solutions to initial boundary value problems is the spectral space Chebyshev integration method which uses sparse matrix operations and has a comparable computational cost to a Fourier spectral discretization.	approximation algorithm;calculus of variations;chebyshev polynomials;collocation method;commutation theorem;computation;computational complexity theory;discretization;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;periodic boundary conditions;preconditioner;simulation;sparse matrix;stepping level;toby turner;variational principle	B.

A more fundamental approach to settle this discussion is presented. First, it is shown that nonlinear distortions can be split in different contributions, forming the fundamental parts of the NPR or in-band distortions. Next, measurement techniques are presented to obtain these different contributions.	distortion;noise power;nonlinear system	Alain Geens;Yves Rolain;Wendy Van Moer;Kenneth Vanhoenacker;Johan Schoukens	2001	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2002.808034	nonlinear distortion;electronic engineering;telecommunications;nonlinear system;engineering;noise;electrical engineering;physics	Visualization	66.94842726875275	51.71877473158794	23491

The proposed technique is based on inclusion of an LC tank to boost the frequency range. Two frequency sub-ranges are covered with the tank on and off respectively, and they jointly constitute a very wide frequency tuning range. Implemented as a building block of a digital frequency synthesizer, the ring oscillator has a measured tuning range of 2.65–6.3 GHz, with power consumption less than 16 mW from a 1.2-V supply. The worst-case measured phase noise at 1-MHz offset is −85 dBc/Hz.	best, worst and average case;digital clock manager;electronic oscillator;frequency band;frequency synthesizer;lc circuit;normalized frequency (unit);phase noise;ring oscillator	Liangge Xu;Kari Stadius;Jussi Ryynänen	2010	Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537077	control engineering;frequency drift;electronic engineering;digital control;voltage-controlled oscillator;resonance;frequency synthesizer;vackář oscillator;engineering;electrical engineering;ring oscillator;variable-frequency oscillator;digitally controlled oscillator;oscillation;lc circuit;phase noise;local oscillator	Embedded	61.572869746413915	51.62690436789362	23507

A necessary and sufficient condition is proved for a feasible solution to be an optimal solution to this problem. Convex minimization problems subject to linear equality/linear inequality “ ≥” constraint, and bounds on the variables are also considered. A necessary and sufficient condition and a sufficient condition, respectively, are proved for a feasible solution to be an optimal solution to these two problems. Algorithms of polynomial complexity for solving the three problems are suggested and their convergence is proved. Some important forms of convex functions and computational results are given in the Appendix.	algorithm;computation;convex function;linear equation;linear inequality;loss function;optimization problem;polynomial;regular expression;social inequality;time complexity	Stefan M.
