2cc15ccd3e3b83922eea4bc08744ea468be20ee3	the perception and memory of object properties: the role of attention, intention, and information detection		The current study sought to investigate the relationship between attention, perception and memory in the perception and recall of attended and unattended properties of objects. Two experiments tested whether the intention to perceive maximum overhead reaching height with the use of handheld rods with different mass and rotational inertia yielded information for participants to remember the rods’ heaviness after they were removed from view. Participants remembered the difference in heaviness of rods but only when haptic information was solely available during the earlier perception of overhead reaching height and vision was occluded. The results support an ecological approach to perception, attention and memory, and suggest that information detected for perception can be later used to remember other object properties that have a correlated informational basis.	ecology;experiment;handheld game console;haptic technology;machine perception;overhead (computing);reaching definition;star height	Brandon Thomas;Michael Riley	2015			psychology;property (programming);cognitive psychology;social psychology;perception;rod;haptic technology;recall;ecological psychology	HCI	-45.40849749138048	-50.373587836146946	5094

The method is capable of efficiently identifying circular curves with their radii and tangents (straight sections). The average error of identification ranged from 0.01 to 1.30 % for precisely drawn data and 4.81 % in the case of actual road data with noise in the location of vertices. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is faster and more precise than commonly used techniques. This approach can be used by road administrators to complete their databases with information concerning the geometry of roads. It can also be utilized by transport engineers or traffic safety analysts to investigate the possible dependence of traffic accidents on road geometries. The method presented is applicable as well to railroads and rivers or other line features.

6ab7024ee8d08e393188a72cec6f32037905e9bc	a theoretical framework for conversational search	personal agent;conversational search;chatbot	This paper studies conversational approaches to information retrieval, presenting a theory and model of information interaction in a chat setting. In particular, we consider the question of what properties would be desirable for a conversational information retrieval system so that the system can allow users to answer a variety of information needs in a natural and efficient manner. We study past work on human conversations, and propose a small set of properties that taken together could measure the extent to which a system is conversational. Following this, we present a theoretical model of a conversational system that implements the properties. We describe how this system could be implemented, making the action space of an conversational search agent explicit. Our analysis of this model shows that while theoretical, the model could be practically implemented to satisfy the desirable properties presented. In doing so, we show that the properties are also feasible.	information needs;information retrieval;theory	Filip Radlinski;Nick Craswell	2017		10.1145/3020165.3020183	natural language processing;computer science;multimedia;communication	Web+IR	-36.85065935221571	-50.85416465775687	5179
49ecfc98043cd31e5026a788569abbae8fb27561	embracing inference as action: a step towards human-level reasoning		Human-level AI involves the ability to reason about the beliefs of other agents, even when those other agents have reasoning styles that may be very different than the AI’s. The ability to carry out reasonable inferences in such situations, as well as in situations where an agent must reason about the beliefs of another agent’s beliefs about yet another agent, is under-studied. We show how such reasoning can be carried out in a new variant of the cognitive event calculus we call CECAC, by introducing several new powerful features for automated reasoning: First, the implementation of classical logic at the “system-level” and nonclassical logics at the “belief-level”; Second, CECAC treats all inferences made by agents as actions. This opens the door for two more additional features: epistemic boxes, which are a sort of frame in which the reasoning of an individual agent can be simulated, and evaluated codelets, which allow our reasoner to carry out operations beyond the limits of many current systems. We explain how these features are achieved and implemented in the MATR reasoning system, and discuss their consequences. Imagine, in the not-too-distant future, an artificially-general-intelligent robot, r , is in a room with two humans: its master, m, (to whom r is loyal), and an opponent, o. The robot believes it is essential, for the survival of itself and its master, that m understands that q is true, but that o neither learn nor come to believe that q holds (possibly because o may react negatively and attempt to kill m and destroy r). Because all three are in a small room where anything r says is heard by both o and m (r ’s telepathic link with m has been damaged), r must somehow say something that will cause m to believe q , but not allow o to figure it out. What can r possibly say? A human might look at this problem and conclude “r should say some p that m would figure out implies q (due to some beliefs that m already has), but which o would not figure out (since o does not have those same beliefs).” But the AI problem of figuring out that some given p would satisfy this criteria turns out to be non-trivial as we approach situations that are increasingly realistic. For example, assuming that r has to perform some sort of simulation of what o and m would infer given certain beliefs, what if the expressivity of the language in which r reasons is lower than that of the languages in which o and m reason? In 2 John Licato and Maxwell Fowler such a case, any attempt by r to predict the inferences o and m would produce in response to learning p would be disastrous. Furthermore, many contemporary approaches to doxastic reasoning assume all agents are perfect logical reasoners who believe the logical closures of their belief sets are problematic. What if r reasons non-monotonically and o or m do not, or vice versa? What if r reasons according to classical logic, but the humans do not? r ’s ability to simulate the reasoning of o and m is limited if r erroneously believes all three follow the same set of inference rules. Finally, if an artificial agent a has knowledge of which beliefs and inference rules another agent b has, and the ability to simulate inferences using b’s beliefs and rules, it is relatively easy to show that some new inference i can be produced from finite applications of b’s beliefs and rules. But due to computational limitations, it is much harder to show that some inference i ′ does not follow from these same beliefs and rules (note this is different from showing that the negation of i follows from b’s beliefs and rules). Yet a human, reasoning about the beliefs of another agent b, may be able to at least offer a weak argument that b will not come to believe some i , even if the human’s argument relies on inductive rules of inference that are not guaranteed to preserve truth. These are problems that might be faced by AGIs of the future, and understanding how to address them may be necessary to move towards human-level AI. In this paper, we present a way to carry out the sort of reasoning described in the robot-human situation above; this reasoning is based on a new variant of the cognitive event calculus, presented here for the first time, which we will call CECAC. The CECAC formalism embraces several principles, two of which we will describe here: First, the idea that all inferences should be treated as actions; and second, the idea that classical logic (insofar as first-order modal logic can be considered ‘classical’) should be the formalism at the system-level, and non-classical logics should be the default formalisms at the belief-level. We will show how a new type of automated reasoner (called MATR) can meet the unique mechanical needs of CECAC, and close with a discussion of limitations and future work.	artificial intelligence;automated reasoning;cognitive robotics;computation;doxastic logic;event calculus;first-order predicate;intelligent agent;maxwell (microarchitecture);modal logic;reasoning system;robot;semantic reasoner;semantics (computer science);simulation;what if;yet another	John Licato;Maxwell Fowler	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_19	artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm	AI	-15.204727665137076	3.5033464341239053	5182

Such information was traditionally unavailable, except indirectly through local newspapers and periodicals. This paper describes a method of spatially and temporally obtaining specific experiences by extracting association rules from the content of blog articles. For example, we can read about visitors’ activities and evaluations of sightseeing spots. By geographically mapping their experiences, the proposed system enables observation of tourist activities and impressions of specific locations, which can often be more diverse than local guidebooks and more trustworthy than advertisements.	aggregate data;association rule learning;blog;experience;temporal logic	Takeshi Kurashima;Taro Tezuka;Katsumi Tanaka	2005		10.1007/11581062_40	association;the internet;association rule learning;internationalization and localization;computer science;specific activity;data mining;tourism;law;world wide web;information system	HCI	-28.03759494549443	-44.17106449026714	5247

As a form of public transportation service, it is highly critical to have strategies that can reduce traffic accidents and save lives. This study examines the relationship between driver characteristics and occurrences of traffic violations or accidents in a Chinese metropolitan city. Using Chi-square analyses, age, education, and experiences were found to be statistically significant predictors. Since these three variables can be influenced using appropriate hiring policies and implementation of best practices, this report should be of particular importance with regard to standards development, recruitment, and driver training.

Generally speaking, iconic models are physical versions of the real world at some scaled down representation, while symbolic models represent the system in terms of the way they function replacing the physical or material system by some logical and/or mathematical formulae. Traditionally iconic and symbolic models were distinct classes of model but due to the rise of digital computing the distinction between the two is becoming blurred, with symbolic models being embedded into iconic models. However, such models tend to be single user. This paper demonstrates how 3D symbolic models in the form of agent-based simulations can be embedded into iconic models using the multi-user virtual world of Second Life. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates Second Life’s potential for social science simulation. To demonstrate this, we first introduce Second Life and provide two exemplar models; Conway’s Game of Life, and Schelling’s Segregation Model which highlight how symbolic models can be viewed in an iconic environment. We then present a simple pedestrian evacuation model which merges the iconic and symbolic together and extends the model to directly incorporate avatars and agents in the same environment illustrating how ‘real’ participants can influence simulation outcomes. Such examples demonstrate the potential for creating highly visual, immersive, interactive agent-based models for social scientists in multi-user real time virtual worlds. The paper concludes with some final comments on problems with representing models in current virtual worlds and future avenues of research.	agent-based model;computer;conway's game of life;embedded system;immersion (virtual reality);multi-user;second life;simulation;triune continuum paradigm;virtual world	Andrew T.

This approach hyperbolic multi-dimensional scaling (H-MDS) is a synthesis of two important concepts for explorative data analysis and visualization: (i) multi-dimensional scaling uses proximity or pair distance data to generate a low-dimensional, spatial presentation of the data; (ii) previous work on the """"hyperbolic tree browser"""" demonstrated the extraordinary advantages for an interactive display of graph-like data in the two-dimensional hyperbolic space (H2).In the new approach, H-MDS maps proximity data directly into the H2. This removes the restriction to """"quasihierarchical"""", graph-based data--a major limitation of (ii). Since a suitable distance function can convert all kinds of data to proximity (or distance-based) data, this type of data can be considered the most general.We review important properties of the hyperbolic space and, in particular, the circular Poincare model of the H2. It enables effective human-computer interaction: by mouse dragging the """"focus"""", the user can navigate in the data without loosing the context. In H2 the """"fish-eye"""" behavior originates not simply by a non-linear view transformation but rather by extraordinary, non-Euclidean properties of the H2. Especially, the exponential growth of length and area of the underlying space makes the H2 a prime target for mapping hierarchical and (now also) high-dimensional data.Several high-dimensional mapping examples including synthetic and real-world data are presented. Since high-dimensional data produce """"ring""""-shaped displays, we present methods to enhance the display by modulating the dissimilarity contrast. This is demonstrated for an application for unstructured text: i.e., by using multiple film critiques from news:rec.art.movies.reviews and www.imdb.com, each movie is placed within the H2--creating a """"space of movies"""" for interactive exploration."""

345738ae1158a8b56506bce8825d8fcdabf3a476	nested monte-carlo search of multi-agent coalitions mechanism with constraints		This paper develops and evaluates a coalition mechanism that enables agents to participate in concurrent tasks achievement in competitive situations in which agents have several constraints. Here we focus on situations in which the agents are self-interested and have not a priori knowledge about the preferences of their opponents, and they have to cooperate in order to reach their goals. All the agents have their specific constraints and this information is private. The agents negotiate for coalition formation (CF) over these constraints, that may be relaxed during negotiations. They start by exchanging their constraints and making proposals, which represent their acceptable solutions, until either an agreement is reached, or the negotiation terminates. We explore two techniques that ease the search of suitable coalitions: we use a constraint-based model and a heuristic search method. We describe a procedure that transforms these constraints into a structured graph on which the agents rely during their negotiations to generate a graph of feasible coalitions. This graph is therefore explored by a Nested Monte-Carlo search algorithm to generate the best coalitions and to minimize the negotiation time.	monte carlo	Souhila Arib;Samir Aknine;Tristan Cazenave	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26181-2_8	mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;multi-agent system;heuristic;search algorithm;negotiation;graph;computer science	AI	-10.507131728761996	-6.128298621828884	5275
9dc20cedb6e5733210e6068697caa0bad51af5a3	modeling continuous representations in visual working memory		Visual working memory (VWM) is a crucial part of our cognitive system. Currently there is an active debate how the apparent limitations of VWM should be described. Limited-slot and flexible-resource theories are discussed, but so far the temporal dynamics of representations stored in VWM are not fully understood. In this paper we present data that supports the notion of dynamic VWM contents with changing precision. To account for these observations in a qualitative way, we propose a neural network that is able to account for emerging capacity limits as well as for changes in the precision of stored information.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;cognition;dynamical system;lateral computing;lateral thinking;network model;theory	Johannes Lohmann;Martin V.

Doing so allows each of these components to exist in an environment optimized for purpose. We make use of a poorly-known feature of the handle system for assigning persistent identifiers that allows an individual data file from a larger file set to be retrieved according to its file name or its MIME type. The data objects allow facile visualization and retrieval for reuse of the data and facilitates other operations such as data mining.

E-mail addresses: cuzzocrea@si.deis.unical.it (A. URLs: http://si.deis.unical.it/~cuzzocrea (A. Cuzz An innovative event-based lossy compression model for effective and efficient OLAP over data streams, called ECM-DS, is presented and experimentally assessed in this paper. The main novelty of our compression approach with respect to traditional data stream compression techniques relies on exploiting the semantics of the reference application scenario in order to drive the compression process by means of the ‘‘degree of interestingness” of events occurring in the target stream. This finally improves the quality of retrieved approximate answers to OLAP queries over data streams, and, in turn, the quality of complex knowledge discovery tasks over data streams developed on top of ECM-DS, and implemented via ad-hoc data stream mining algorithms. Overall, the compression strategy we propose in this research puts the basis for a novel class of intelligent applications over data streams where the knowledge on actual streams is integrated-with and correlated-to the knowledge related to expired events that are considered critical for the target OLAP analysis scenario. Finally, a comprehensive experimental evaluation over several classes of data stream sets clearly confirms the benefits deriving from the event-based data stream compression approach proposed in ECM-DS. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We adopt the single-index model developed by Weiss, Naik and Tsai as a foundation. However, other than the traditionally used numeric financial information, our model adds textual information about risk sentiment contained in financial reports. We believe such a model can reduce specification errors resulting from pre-assuming linear relationship, thus can predict future earnings more accurately. The empirical results show that the modified model does significantly improve the accuracy of earning prediction.

a78bffbc05e251ad55950903d19caea497403c60	are mobile users more vigilant?	mobile;vigilance;social media;interaction design	As mobile device usage continues to grow, active mobile users frequently interact with mobile devices while doing other things, dividing their attention between the real world and the mediated world. We may infer that these users are highly engaged within a mobile experience or unfulfilled by their real world experience, or maybe they're simply addicted to their social network. But in many cases their frequent usage may be compelled instinctually, by a form of vigilant behavior. This research seeks to understand whether or not mobile usage leads to an increased prevalence of user vigilance, first by establishing criteria that can be used to determine if a specific session of use is vigilant, and then applying these criteria to analyze observed sessions of use for two distinct cohorts: mobile users and situated users. In the analysis, it was found that everyday vigilant usage scenarios are fairly prevalent, and also that mobile users were 3 times more vigilant than situated users. These initial findings need further validation, but may prove significant to interaction design: optimizing a software interface to better support vigilant usage requires an opposing set of considerations when compared to traditional consumer product design. These design considerations are discussed, in addition to the limitations of the study, and guidance for future work.	interaction design;mobile device;situated;social network	Giles Phillips	2014		10.1145/2615569.2615642	simulation;engineering;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-57.618560120450844	-42.87188605350828	5336

The goal of this design space is to facilitate the exploration of novel menu designs, in particular to increase menu capacity without sacrificing performance. The paper demonstrates the generative aspect of this design space with four new menu designs based on poorly explored combinations of input dimensions. For two of these four designs, the paper presents controlled experiments that show that they perform on a par with other menus from the literature.	bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;espace;experiment;linear algebra;meme;quantifier (logic)	Mathieu Nancel;Stéphane Huot;Michel Beaudouin-Lafon	2009		10.1145/1629826.1629829	simulation;engineering;communication;engineering drawing	HCI	-36.65163186354247	-29.02767621648879	5363

An experiment with 24 participants was conducted to test the hypotheses that efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction ratings of colored required-fields exceed those of asterisk-marked required-fields. Results indicate that colored required field marking leads to fewer errors, faster form fill-in in and higher user satisfaction.		Stefan L. Pauwels;Christian Hübscher;Stefan Leuthold;Javier A.

Interactions between the child and robot; the child and learning materials; and the robot and learning materials will each shape the perception and appreciation the child has of himself or herself, of the robot, and of the learning task.

005949adbebf840359f9bbc44ad35f3d09589b79	motion sensing based framework for robot manipulation		To data, outside of controlled environments, robots have normally performed manipulation tasks when operated with human. This pattern requires operators with high technical skills training and targeted knowledge acquiring for varied teach-pendant operating system. Motion sensing technology, enabling human-machine interaction in a novel and natural user interface using gestures, crucial inspires us to adopt a user-friendly and straight-forward interaction mode on robot manipulation. Thus, in this paper, we presented a motion sensing based framework for robot manipulation, which recognizes gesture commands captured by motion sensing input device and drives the action of robots. For compatibility, a general hardware interface layer was also developed in the framework. Simulation and physical experiments have been conducted for preliminary validation. The results have shown that the proposed framework is an effective approach for general robot manipulation with motion sensing control.	coat of arms;dr-dos;experiment;hardware interface design;human–computer interaction;input device;natural user interface;operating system;robot;simulation;usability	Hao Deng;Zeyang Xia;Shaokui Weng;Yangzhou Gan;Peng Fang;Jing Xiong	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR)	10.1109/RCAR.2016.7784082	computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;social robot;gesture recognition;robot control;systems biology	Robotics	-37.804762973515814	-40.8115686258806	5390

2eaed58f8bd999a26efa2b8a293f360a50ea945f	introduction to the special issue on the science behind embodied ai : the robots of the aaai competition and exhibition	aaai competition;special issue	Welcome to the special issue of Autonomous Robots devoted to the topic of The Science Behind Embodied AI : The Robots of the AAAI Competition and Exhibition. The robotics competition held at the annual conference of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) was first held in 1993 as a way to help promote the science of embodied AI as illustrated by the use of robotics. The competition has evolved over the years and has been a driving force to encourage researchers to push the state of the art in deployed AI. For a more detailed history of the competition, please see Balch and Yanco [1]. One of the greatest challenges that any robotics researcher faces is the disparity that occurs between developing and testing an algorithm in the relative safely of an software-only simulation system and then attempting to make that same algorithm work well on a deployed robotic system. Immediately when deployed on a robot, the researchers must contend with problems such as errors in sensing, inaccurate actuation, and unanticipated interactions between the robot and the environment. A common complaint by many who attempt such a challenging venture is something along the lines of “Well, it worked fine in the lab...” Even in the AAAI robot exhibition, where the robots on display do not have to compete but rather demonstrate an interesting aspect of embodied AI that is not part of the competition itself, the robots must operate in the environment provided to them at the venue. There are many lessons learned by the researchers who attend these events, not the least of which is the important balance and intermingling of both scientific and engineering efforts. The AAAI competition consists of two distinct parts. The first is the series of competitions themselves which are structured events with pre-defined rules and scoring mechanisms where teams compete against each other for the best performance in their particular categories. The second is the exhibition which is an open-ended venue that is set up to allow researchers to demonstrate interesting scientific endeavors to the AI community at large. In both categories of events, the robots are expected to operate in an environment that is largely unknown until the researchers arrive. These events serve both as interesting research and pedagogical experiences for faculty and students. Many students have had their first experiences with deploying a fully functional mobile robot at one of these events and in many cases, this leaves a lasting impression that stays until those students are faculty researchers in their own right and are encouraging their own students to participate. The efforts described within this issue provides a window into the kinds of research, both in terms of the science as well as the engineering, that is required to create embodied AI and deploy it in a physical environment. The first four papers describe a number of different research efforts that have participated in the various competitions that have occurred since the creation of the competition. David Miller et al.’s article, “Scarecrow: If I only had AI”, starts out the issue as a historical perspective on the very early days of the competition. This article describes a very low-cost specialized robotic entry in the competition which stood in contrast with the much more expensive general-purpose research robots that were entered by the other teams. This article serves as useful reminder that the research community must	algorithm;artificial intelligence;autonomous car;binocular disparity;embodied agent;experience;general-purpose markup language;interaction;mobile robot;nonlinear gameplay;simulation;venue (sound system)	Paul E.

However, the quantity of training data required to improve state-of-the-art systems seems to be growing exponentially and performance appears to be asymptotic to a level that may be inadequate for many real-world applications. This suggests that there may be a fundamental flaw in the underlying architecture of contemporary systems, as well as a failure to capitalize on the combinatorial properties of human spoken language. This paper addresses these issues and presents a novel architecture for speech-based human-machine interaction inspired by recent findings in the neurobiology of living systems. Called PRESENCE-""""PREdictive SENsorimotor Control and Emulation""""-this new architecture blurs the distinction between the core components of a traditional spoken language dialogue system and instead focuses on a recursive hierarchical feedback control structure. Cooperative and communicative behavior emerges as a by-product of an architecture that is founded on a model of interaction in which the system has in mind the needs and intentions of a user and a user has in mind the needs and intentions of the system."""	cognition;cognitive science;cognitive tutor;computational model;computer science;control flow;dialog system;emergence;emulator;feedback;file spanning;flaw hypothesis methodology;forge;high- and low-level;human–computer interaction;informatics;living systems;mind;recursion;speech synthesis;user interface	Roger K.

Integrating data from databases and automating soil profiling, it offers consolidated knowledge and provides much-needed help to engineers in situ, operating either on-or off-line. Thus, preparatory work volume is reduced, and so is uncertainty. Pythia implements an ICT-based GIS-driven model focusing on the geotechnical aspect of soil conditions, while the mobile component undertakes in situ operations under GIS-guidance, by constantly exchanging and updating data. As the first SI Pythia trials have already been successfully completed, the need for appropriate education and training of future engineers looms large.	geographic information system;pythia;semantic interpretation	Maria A.

The extent to which this occurs is associated with many positive social outcomes. However, existing measures of lexical similarity are either highly labor intensive or too coarse in their temporal resolution. This limits the ability of researchers to study lexical similarity as it unfolds over the course of a conversation. We present a fully automated metric for tracking lexical similarity over time, and demonstrate it on individual conversations, explore general trends in aggregate conversational dynamics, and examine differences in how similarity tracks over time in groups with differing social outcomes.	aggregate data;computer-supported cooperative work;semantic similarity;text-based (computing)	Noah Liebman;Darren Gergle	2016		10.1145/2818048.2820062	natural language processing;speech recognition;similarity;computer science;lexical chain;methodology;communication;management;collaboration	NLP	-52.66181331765853	-48.08481536666384	5450

In a previous paper, I objected that epistemic probabilities are equivalent to rational degrees of belief given a possible epistemic situation and so the probability of Beauty’s indexical knowledge that she is awake now is necessarily 1, precluding such updating. In response, Horgan maintains that the probability claims in his argument are to be taken, not as claims about possible rational degrees of belief, but rather as claims about “quantitative degrees of evidential support.” This paper argues that the most plausible account of quantitative degree of support, when conjoined with any of the three major accounts of indexical thought in such a way as to plausibly constrain rational credence, contradicts essential elements of Horgan’s argument.	dyadic transformation;logical relations;sleeping barber problem;synchronicity;the times;theory	Joel Pust	2011	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-011-9888-6	philosophy;epistemology;mathematics	AI	-13.400068509614345	2.872704619983369	5452

This can be achieved by immersing a user to a place reconstructed in 3D. The reconstructed place can be captured from the real world or can be completely virtual. Another way to realize telepresence is by using robots and virtual avatars that act as proxies for real people. In case a human-mediated interaction is not needed or not possible, the virtual human and the robot can rely on artificial intelligence to act and interact autonomously. In this paper, these forms of telepresence are discussed, how they are related and different from each other and how autonomy takes place in telepresence. The paper concludes with an overview of the ongoing research on autonomous virtual humans and social robots conducted in the BeingThere centre.	as-interface;artificial intelligence;augmented reality;autonomous robot;autonomy;experience;fundamental interaction;haptic technology;humans;human–robot interaction;mixed reality;proxy server;robotics;smart tv;social robot;virtual actor;virtual reality;virtual world	Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann;Zerrin Yumak;Aryel Beck	2014	2014 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)	10.1109/MMSP.2014.6958836	computer vision;simulation;multimedia	Robotics	-46.80413086926235	-37.68550666267885	5461

FAST is the premiere conference for publishing research results in the area of file and storage systems. The program committee received a record 137 submissions and selected 26 of these to appear at the conference held in February, 2012 in San Jose, California. After the conference, we invited the top few of these papers to submit an extended article to appear in this special issue. Papers at the conference covered a wide breadth of topics, and the articles in this special issue reflect that diversity. The first article, “WAN Optimized Replication of Backup Datasets Using Stream-Informed Delta Compression” by Shilane et al., explores how deduplication can be combined with delta compression to replicate data offsite. The ideas described in this article have been included in EMC Data Domain systems, resulting in substantial compression improvements for customers. The next article, “Revisiting Storage for Smartphones” by Kim et al., contradicts established “wisdom” by showing that storage is often a substantial bottleneck for applications running on smartphones. The authors identify several reasons for poor mobile storage performance, and they propose several potential improvements. The final article, “Recon: Verifying File System Consistency at Runtime” by Fryer et al., tackles the challenging and important problem of protecting file system metadata from software bugs. Recon checks per-transaction invariants before committing data to disk in order to preserve file system integrity.	backup;data deduplication;data domain;delta encoding;invariant (computer science);rsa conference;self-replication;smartphone;software bug;system integrity	William J.

Issues of scalability, robustness and performance became progressively interwoven with the concern of creating an overall user experience sustaining consistent high engagement levels. Contextual factors such as audience size, dimensions of the interactive space and length of exposure to the artwork had to be handled gracefully in order not to interfere with the interaction flow. Adopting a research by and through design approach, the work uncovered a series of findings that are pervasive to the design of adaptive interactive experiences.	interactive art;pervasive informatics;scalability;user experience	Luke Hespanhol;Maria Carmela Sogono;Ge Wu;Rob Saunders;Martin Tomitsch	2011		10.1145/2071536.2071559	user experience design;simulation;design process;interactive systems engineering;human–computer interaction;experience design;computer science;multimedia;interactive media	HCI	-58.95027532997593	-37.94647111827126	5571

Many analysts attribute a lack of data or quality information as a contributing factor to the worldwide financial crises that seems to have begun in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. In this paper, a new source of data, key word search statistics recently available from Google, are applied in a experiment to develop a short-term forecasting model for the number of foreclosures in the U.S. housing market. The keyword search data significantly improves forecast of foreclosures, suggesting that this data can be useful for financial risk management. More generally, the new data source shows promise for a variety of financial and market analyses.	internet;risk management;search algorithm;search engine indexing	G.

4e9b9775d14e418c2a712976f90414bb06f9710c	airscript - creating documents in air		This paper presents a novel approach, called AirScript, for creating, recognizing and visualizing documents in air. We present a novel algorithm, called 2-DifViz, that converts the hand movements in air (captured by a Myo-armband worn by a user) into a sequence of x, y coordinates on a 2D Cartesian plane, and visualizes them on a canvas. Existing sensor-based approaches either do not provide visual feedback or represent the recognized characters using prefixed templates. In contrast, AirScript stands out by giving freedom of movement to the user, as well as by providing a real-time visual feedback of the written characters, making the interaction natural. AirScript provides a recognition module to predict the content of the document created in air. To do so, we present a novel approach based on deep learning, which uses the sensor data and the visualizations created by 2-DifViz. The recognition module consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). and two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks. The output from these three networks is fused to get the final prediction about the characters written in air. AirScript can be used in highly sophisticated environments like a smart classroom, a smart factory or a smart laboratory, where it would enable people to annotate pieces of texts wherever they want without any reference surface. We have evaluated AirScript against various well-known learning models (HMM, KNN, SVM, etc.) on the data of 12 participants. Evaluation results show that the recognition module of AirScript largely outperforms all of these models by achieving an accuracy of 91.7% in a person independent evaluation and a 96.7% accuracy in a person dependent evaluation.	augmented reality;canvas element;cartesian closed category;connectionism;convolutional neural network;deep learning;handwriting recognition;hidden markov model;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;language model;long short-term memory;myo armband;portable network graphics;real-time transcription;recurrent neural network;reference surface;scalable vector graphics;smart tv;virtual reality	Ayushman Dash;Amit Sahu;Rajveer Shringi;John Cristian Borges Gamboa;Muhammad Zeshan Afzal;Muhammad Imran Malik;Sheraz Ahmed;Andreas Dengel	2017	2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)	10.1109/ICDAR.2017.153	convolutional neural network;data visualization;support vector machine;computer vision;computer science;hidden markov model;deep learning;visualization;artificial intelligence;handwriting recognition;solid modeling	HCI	-32.14222460138384	-42.62139494008488	5580

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 14 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, while 2013 CAD contest attracted 87 teams from 9 regions. Continuing its great success in 2012 and 2013, 2014 CAD contest attracts 93 teams from 9 regions, including Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, US, Canada, Brazil, and Russian Federation.  Three contest problems on verification, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM.  Topic chair Chih-Jen Hsu of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on efficiently solving the combinational single-output netlists. The efficiency of solving a single-output function highly depends on the CNF encoding and the SAT solving. For the first problem, contestants are required to explore the best CNF encoding and SAT solver setting to solve the most tests within the shortest runtime.  Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on incremental timing-driven placement. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total slack and worst slack are optimized.  Topic chair Rasit O. Topaloglu of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. In a circuit layout, densities of polygons within windows of interest may have a large variation across such windows in the rest of the layout. To balance the density of polygons, fills are inserted to make the density of several windows uniform. For the third problem, contestants are required to minimize the density variation with least fills.  This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.	benchmark (computing);boolean satisfiability problem;circuit diagram;combinational logic;conjunctive normal form;design flow (eda);digital-to-analog converter;electronic design automation;electronic organizer;expect;integrated circuit design;international conference on computer-aided design;international symposium on physical design;moe;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;slack variable;solver	Iris Hui-Ru Jiang;Natarajan Viswanathan;Tai-Chen Chen;Jin-Fu Li	2013	2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)		lithography;embedded system;electronic engineering;verification;simulation;electronic design automation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;algorithm;placement;integrated circuit design	EDA	-50.534278309998186	-2.3297165016305796	5584
99eb63f28f6538f4f15fde08974c065ce09b988c	attribute weighting and samples sampling for collaborative filtering		Item-Based Collaborative filtering is used in many fields. However, it recommends movies for user only according to the useru0027s behavior records. Therefore, it fails to recommend effectively and solve problems such as cold start. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an attribute weighting collaborative filtering (AW - CF). The algorithm not only takes advantage of the moviesu0027 rating information from users but also the moviesu0027 attribute information to measure the similarity between movies. We can calculate the similarity between movies more accurate by using the moviesu0027 attribute information. Besides, we proposed an method of sampling the samples to represent the train dataset so that we can reduce training time (sampling AW-CF). The experiments based on the dataset of MovieLens show that the proposed AW-CF and sampling AW-CF algorithms achieved good effect in MAE, RMSE and make more efficient recommendations. Their effect are superior to the compared algorithms.	adjusted winner procedure;algorithm;cold start;collaborative filtering;experiment;movielens;sampling (signal processing);scalability;the movies	Zhaowei Qu;Jingjing Yao;Xiaoru Wang;Sixing Yin	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)	10.1109/BigComp.2018.00042	collaborative filtering;scalability;sampling (statistics);artificial neural network;machine learning;movielens;weighting;mean squared error;artificial intelligence;computer science	DB	-20.808489955166884	-48.552175803494656	5587

By looking at menu options displayed at different locations on the computer monitor, a disabled user can invoke commands without the need for standard input devices. The design of test entry software for Erica's gaze word processor is described. A basic encoding is accomplished through a static tree-structured menu system, which associates the 85 most common ASCII characters with unique sequences of menus and eye-gaze picks. The expected length of the pick sequences is minimized based on the approximate frequencies of individual characters determined from a 55882 character corpus of English language text. Text entry speeds are further enhanced by adding context-sensitive nodes to the static tree. The menu screens corresponding to these nodes contain the five characters most likely to follow the last two characters entered, based on character transition probabilities derived from the sample corpus. >		Lisa A.

Therefore, we propose an interactive interface allowing the drivers to make a driving plan on an expressway with traffic predictions, and thus change their driving behavior. By visualizing traffic predictions using a diagram with two time axes, drivers can look at multiple futures interactively. Thus, they can obtain enough information to avoid traffic congestion. We compared our interface with conventional traffic congestion presentations, and also investigated its feasibility in a real environment by distributing our interface as an Android application. Our results showed that drivers were able to make a driving plan more efficiently using our interface than with conventional methods, and then follow their planned route on an expressway in a real environment.	android;device driver;diagram;futures and promises;gamification;interactivity;network congestion;protein structure prediction;time of arrival;user interface	Naoya Okada;Naoto Nakazato;Toshiki Takeuchi;Takuji Narumi;Tomohiro Tanikawa;Michitaka Hirose	2015		10.1145/2800835.2800842	simulation;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;traffic flow;computer security	HCI	-34.11754004366733	-32.61929416130589	5656

896972e3eed977adde6e23bf1c671814eb5b53ca	event detection from time-series streams using directional change and dynamic thresholds	dynamic thresholds	Event Detection from data streams is challenging due to the characteristics of such streams, where data elements arrive in real-time and at high velocity, as well as being streams of unbounded size, even more it is not possible to backtrack over the past arrived data elements or review and keep track of the entire history. Financial time-series streams are a source of financial data (tick data) at fine time scales. In this research, we aim to detect events occurring within time-series streams, and our approach utilises the Directional Change Approach, which summarizes price movements based on a given threshold to detect events. In this paper, we propose a dynamic threshold definition method to be used for detecting the directional change events. The threshold is calculated on a daily basis based on previous day price transitions and the current day opening price. An experiment was run for more than 30 weeks to detect the occurring directional change events on a time-series stream, with one minute data flow levels (one minute frequency) to test our threshold definition method against different fixed threshold values. The detected events were evaluated against news headlines published regarding the studied share on the same day the event was found. The results revealed that a daily dynamic calculated threshold more accurately detected events than different static fixed threshold values.	backtrack;dataflow;experiment;real-time clock;sensor;time series;velocity (software development)	Nora Alkhamees;Maria Fasli	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	10.1109/BigData.2017.8258133	machine learning;artificial intelligence;streams;computer science;data stream mining;real-time computing;data flow diagram	SE	-4.99093976789393	-34.80419929709789	5663

The Competing Context Concept, is associated with the Context-Based Reasoning (CxBR) modeling paradigm, and represents an improvement thereof. CxBR uses as its basis an intuitive structure called a Context. One specific context is always in control of the AIP, and it contains all the information required to control that AIP when in that situation. When the situation changes, a new context must be found that properly addresses the new situation. Upon finding such a new context, it becomes activated, and the old context deactivates itself. An AIP, therefore, can be controlled intelligently through a sequence of transitions among various (pre-existing) contexts. The Competing Context Concept introduces a means to control the transition process without the need to predetermine the next contexts. This paper briefly describes the CxBR paradigm and the competing context concept extension. Results from prototype testing will also be discussed.	simulation	Avelino J.

Most of the elders are affected by social situations. In addition, a lack of Telecare technology to support caring processes is exposed. In order to explore the introduction of Telecare approaches for elders in Colombia, a software prototype for a real low-SES Seniors Living Facility was developed. The main contribution of this work is the application of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [8] principles and user-centered design (UCD) practices to formulate an Android software application for elders, taking into account all the challenges at this level of interaction, the kind of population under certain scenarios in Colombia, and also the creation of positive perceptions of the final software considering aspects of emotions, reliability of service and optimal user experience [4].	accessible surface area;human–computer interaction;linear algebra;mind;population;prototype;real life;smartphone;software prototyping;user experience;user-centered design	Arturo C.

As a remedy, an approach that is researcher-centric (rather than document-centric) has been proposed recently in some systems. This paper is devoted to research aimed at tools for building knowledge bases for university research. We focus on the AI methods that have been elaborated and applied practically within our platform for building such knowledge bases. In particular we present a novel approach to data acquisition and the semantic enrichment of the acquired data. In addition, we present the algorithms applied in the real life system for experts profiling and retrieval.	algorithm;data acquisition;digital library;gene ontology term enrichment;information processing;information retrieval;internet access;knowledge base;library (computing);mind;profiling (computer programming);real life;scientific literature;testbed;web mining;web scraping	Jakub Koperwas;Lukasz Skonieczny;Marek Kozlowski;Piotr Andruszkiewicz;Henryk Rybinski;Waclaw Struk	2015	Journal of Intelligent Information Systems	10.1007/s10844-015-0393-0	computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;database	AI	-44.72194686167441	2.6165101693245045	5722

A number of recent technologies, including immersive projection technology systems (IPTs) and head-mounted displays (HMDs), promise a new generation of technologies that are more intuitive to use than desktop-based systems. This paper presents an experiment that compares collaboration in five different settings. Pairs collaborated on the same puzzle-solving task using one of: an IPT connected to another IPT, an IPT connected to an HMD, an IPT connected to a desktop system, two connected desktop systems, or face-to-face collaboration with real objects. The findings demonstrate the benefits of using immersive technologies, and show the advantages of using symmetrical settings for better performance.

It is already opening up new research frontiers in a number of areas such as multimedia data modeling and indexing, data mining, multimedia document management, semantic Web, pervasive computing, distributed sensor networks, computer security, real-time operating systems, human-computer interaction, and storage technology etc. As a result of concerted effort in these areas, many Web-accessible multimedia applications involving different media types, e.g., video, audio, text, images, animation and graphics, are rapidly emerging Examples of such applications abound in the domains of health care, education, entertainment, manufacturing, e-commerce, digital libraries as well as military and critical national infrastructures. The premise is that the integration of Web and multimedia technologies can provide cost effective solutions for management and dissemination of information, which is a primary tool for increasing economic efficiency. Development of Web-based multimedia applications needs a broad range of technological solutions that deal with organizing, storing, and delivering multimedia information in an integrated, secure and timely manner with guaranteed quality of service (QoS). Multimedia database management, when viewed in conjunction with integration of contents from independent Web-based data sources, present formidable research and development challenges. Key challenges include: • content analysis and indexing of distributed multimedia data and documents • semantic modeling and knowledge-based representation of multimedia data • transformation and organization of multimedia data semantics as a part of Semantic Web • security, privacy and QoS related issues concerning Web-based multimedia database applications • emerging Web standards and their role in managing distributed multimedia databases In this talk, we elaborate on these challenges and describe several solutions and tools that have been developed for Web-based multimedia database systems.

We begin by delineating the scope of cognitive vision, and follow this by a survey of the various approaches that can be taken to the realization of artificial cognitive vision systems, focussing on cognitive aspects. These range from the cognitivist symbolic representational paradigm, through connectionist systems and self-organizing dynamical systems, to the enactive cognition paradigm. We then consider various arguments for embodiment, beginning with paradigm-specific cases, and concluding with a paradigm-independent argument for embodied perception and cognition. We explore briefly different forms of embodiment and their relevance to the foregoing viewpoints. We highlight some of the key problems associated with embodied cognitive vision, including the phylogeny/ontogeny trade-off in artificial systems and the developmental limitations imposed by real-time environmental coupling. Finally, we conclude by considering some aspects of natural cognitive systems to see how they can provide insights to help in addressing these problems. q 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.	artificial intelligence;causality;colette rolland;connectionism;dynamical system;embedded system;embodied cognition;emergence;enactivism;goto;icub;noise shaping;organizing (structure);phylogenetics;programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time transcription;recursion;relevance;resultant;self-organization;sion's minimax theorem;trinity	David Vernon	2008	Image Vision Comput.	10.1016/j.imavis.2005.08.009	cognitive model;dynamical systems theory;self-organization;computer science;artificial intelligence;dynamical system;system dynamics;cognitive robotics	AI	-24.87664903550756	-15.403114539135588	5748

Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p (0 < p ≤ 1). Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop a bounding-pruning-refining framework and three algorithms systematically. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Combining the advantages of the bottom-up algorithm and the top-down algorithm, we develop a hybrid algorithm to further improve the performance. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our algorithms are efficient on large data sets.	benchmark (computing);bottom-up parsing;hybrid algorithm;recursion;synthetic data;top-down and bottom-up design;uncertain data	Bin Jiang;Jian Pei;Xuemin Lin;Yidong Yuan	2010	Journal of Intelligent Information Systems	10.1007/s10844-010-0141-4	computer science;probabilistic database;machine learning;data mining;database	DB	-7.606180338613705	-36.13656497663468	5767

The norms enforced in a multi-agent system can be revised in order to increase the likelihood that desirable system properties are fulfilled or that system performance is sufficiently high. In this paper, we provide a preliminary analysis of some types of norm revision: relaxation and strengthening. Furthermore, with the help of some illustrative scenarios, we show the usefulness of norm revision for better satisfying the overall system objectives.	autonomy;belief revision;intelligent agent;linear programming relaxation;multi-agent system;reasoning system;run time (program lifecycle phase);semantics (computer science)	Davide Dell'Anna;Mehdi Dastani;Fabiano Dalpiaz	2018	CoRR		management science;computer science;limiting;autonomy;norm (social);sanctions	AI	-17.30425088601757	-7.915128929063022	5781

ad5c7497afb52e76406fc6a2b342a200821a838d	back to basics and forward to novelty in machine consciousness		Machine consciousness has emerged from the confusion of an oxymoron into an evolving set of principles which, by leaning on information integration theories, define and distinguish what is meant by ‘a conscious machine’. This paper reviews this process of emergence by indicating how it is possible to break away from the Chalmers ‘hardness’ of a computational consciousness by a general concept of A becoming conscious of B where both are formally described. We highlight how this differs from classical AI approaches, by following through a simple example using the specific methodology of weightless neural nets as an instance of a system that owes its competence to something that can be naturally described as ‘being conscious’ rather depending on the use AI algorithms structured by a programmer.	artificial consciousness	Igor Aleksander;Helen Morton	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34274-5_1	artificial intelligence;machine learning;social psychology	ML	-25.630108531456635	-13.531028130314285	5812

We propose a novel formulation to blend input guidance fields to create singularity-free, goal-directed navigation fields. Our method can be easily combined with the most current local collision avoidance methods and we use two such methods as examples to highlight the potential of our approach.

We describe a system we have designed that uses vibration motors wired to a body-worn control box, which in turn communicates with a host computer using a wireless connection. Though we have successfully integrated this system into an existing VR-based dismounted infantry simulator, it is clear that expanding the body coverage and number of vibration points requires a solution that is completely wireless. To this end, we describe a working prototype we have built that, though still somewhat large and feature-limited, has convinced us of the merit of our approach.

About every 10 years, a new type of machine is invented that changes our understanding of computation. From the mysterious glass house mainframes of the 1960s, ministered by white-coated experts, to today's friendly personal computers, our sense of the role of computing in our lives has undergone a dramatic transformation. The next wave of this evolution is the “pen computer.” A small group of early pioneers has quietly redefined how most people will experience computation in the future, and refocused what we will do with this power. The pen computer derives its heritage from pen and paper, rather than from the typewriter, as personal computers do. It can be carried and used as a folder or notebook would, rather than as a piece of office equipment in a box. These new social characteristics allow a pen computer to be used in settings where keyboard devices are inappropriate or disruptive. Data is entered by handwriting, sketching, and scribbling, rather than typing, pointing, and clicking. Images are manipulated directly on a visually active surface, rather than remotely. The subjective experience of using a pen computer is unique and utterly personal. This talk will attempt to present the new face that computing will have for future users.	classes of computers;computation;definition;handwriting recognition;mainframe computer;pen computing;personal computer;turing machine	S.

Thus, the objective of many research teams is to succeed in quantifying these deformations in order to update preoperative images. Anatomical intraoperative deformations correspond to a complex spatio-temporal phenomenon. Our objective is to identify the parameters implicated in these deformations and to use these parameters as constrains for systems dedicated to updating preoperative images. In order to identify these parameters of deformation we followed the iterative methodology used for cognitive system conception: identification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation and validation. A state of the art about cortical deformations has been established in order to identify relevant parameters probably involved in the deformations. As a first step, 30 parameters have been identified and described following an ontological approach. They were formalized into a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. We implemented that model into a web-based application in order to fill a database. Two surgical cases have been studied at this moment. After having entered enough surgical cases for data mining purposes, we expect to identify the most relevant and influential parameters and to gain a better ability to understand the deformation phenomenon. This original approach is part of a global system aiming at quantifying and correcting anatomical deformations.	artificial intelligence;class diagram;computational anatomy;conceptualization (information science);data mining;database;expect;formal system;iterative method;knowledge modeling;neural oscillation;unified modeling language;web application	Julien Cohen-Adad;Perrine Paul;Xavier Morandi;Pierre Jannin	2006		10.1117/12.655752	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;biological engineering	Vision	-32.64351670370661	-4.528963038687939	5825

BACKGROUND Human performance, more often than not, constitutes complex adaptive phenomena with emergent properties that exhibit nonlinear dynamical (chaotic) behaviors.   METHOD The complexity challenges in the design and management of contemporary work systems, including service systems, are explored. Examples of selected applications of the concepts of nonlinear dynamics to the study of human physical performance are provided.   RESULTS Understanding and applications of the concepts of theory of complex adaptive and dynamical systems should significantly improve the effectiveness of human-centered design efforts of a large system of systems.   CONCLUSION Performance of many contemporary work systems and environments may be sensitive to the initial conditions and may exhibit dynamic nonlinear properties and chaotic system behaviors. Human-centered design of emergent human-system interactions requires application of the theories of nonlinear dynamics and complex adaptive system.   APPLICATION The success of future human-systems integration efforts requires the fusion of paradigms, knowledge, design principles, and methodologies of human factors and ergonomics with those of the science of complex adaptive systems as well as modern systems engineering.	behavior;cns disorder;chaos theory;complex adaptive system;complexity;dynamical system;emergence;human factors and ergonomics;initial condition;interaction;nonlinear system;objective-c;system dynamics;system integration;system of systems;systems engineering;user-centered design;work systems	Waldemar Karwowski	2012	Human factors	10.1177/0018720812467459	complex adaptive system;simulation;human factors integration;system of systems;nonlinear system;engineering;artificial intelligence;socio-ecological system;management science;human dynamics;complex systems biology;mechanical engineering	AI	-19.673240599320867	-18.215254672034668	5858
6a74a89b4dbaa81d809ae29a62a7b959094bff5d	simple but not simpler	computational simulation;realistic approach;agement scholar;computational social;simple closed form	As I attend conferences with modelers and visit various schools to interact with management scholars using computer simulation methods to model dynamic systems, I am struck by a powerful philosophical difference affecting our model design. Some scholars feel strongly that models should follow the “Keep it simple, stupid” (KISS) principle. They claim that models should be used to assist our intuition by showing proof about processes and mechanisms. Others see the value of realistic models— ones that can make predictions and deal with highly specified problems. While the two sides each make substantial contributions to our nascent area of computational organization studies, the two sides rarely integrate their work or lay out when one side’s approach is more or less useful than the others’. I put together a panel of speakers at the 2004 North American Association for Computational Social and Organization Sciences (NAACSOS) conference held at Carnegie-Mellon University to stimulate discussion on this topic. This special issue of Computational and Mathematical Organization Studies arose from that initial panel. For thousands of years, philosophers of science have explored this issue without reaching any satisfactory resolution. The debate shows up framed in terms of Occam’s Razor, Realist vs. Anti-Realist programs, Realism vs. Constructive Empiricism and more (see for example, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/ #ModReaVerAntDeb, July 24, 2008; http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/realism. html, July 24, 2008).

Existing digital news description standards such as NITF and NewsML are analysed and compared with Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES), which results in that the use of Dublin Core is encouraged for interoperability of the resources. The suggested metadata elements are carefully selected and defined considering the characteristics of news articles. Some elements are detailed with refinement qualifiers and recommended encoding scheme. This set of metadata has been developed as a part of the tasks in the IST (Information Society Technologies)-funded European project OmniPaper (Smart Access to European Newspapers, IST-2001-32174).	dublin core;information discovery;internet;interoperability;line code;national imagery transmission format;newsml;prototype;refinement (computing)	Tomoko Yaginuma;Teresa Susana Mendes Pereira;Ana Alice Baptista	2003			interoperability;computer science;database;metadata;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-46.75544577237176	-19.451931513838016	5873

Most of existing approaches treat all resources equally without any categorizing mechanism. We propose, Resource Category Tree (RCT), which organizes resources based on their characteristics represented by primary attributes (PA). RCT adopts a structure of distributed AVL tree, with each node representing a specific range of PA values. Though RCT adopts a hierarchical structure, it does not require nodes in higher levels maintain more information than those in lower levels, which makes RCT highly scalable. RCT is featured by self-organization, load-aware self-adaptation and fault tolerance. Based on RCT, commonly used queries, such as range queries and multi-attribute queries, are well supported. We conduct performance evaluations through comprehensive simulations. c © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The goals of The Marchitecture are domain independence, operating in the absence of knowledge engineering, learning an ontology of parameterized relational concepts, and elegance of design. Representation change comes about through a pair of primary mechanisms, which we term “assimilation” and “accommodation”. Accommodation is the formation of concepts, which builds an ontology, and assimilation amounts to explaining or recasting data in terms of the developed ontology. This model is inspired by Piaget’s Constructivist theory of learning. The Marchitecture assumes an ample amount of raw data to develop its representations, and it is therefore appropriate for	autonomous robot;cognitive architecture;data assimilation;knowledge engineering;marchitecture;ontology (information science);piaget's theory of cognitive development	Marc Pickett	2007			computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-26.215532893345316	-13.548779617569366	5889
a4ab34aa742d1810789c24794552b6ac5c8e5dec	min-forest: fast reachability indexing approach for large-scale graphs on spark platform		Reachability query is an important graph operation in graph database which answers whether a vertex can reach another vertex through a path over the graph, and it is also fundamental to real applications involved with graph-shaped data. However, the increasingly large amount of data in real graph database makes it more challenging for query efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose Min-Forest approach to handle with reachability problem in large graphs. We present Min-Forest structure to transfer and label the original DAG, and introduce a 4-tuple labeling scheme to construct index for each vertices, which integrate interval labels for trees and non-tree labels. We design efficient reachability query algorithms for Min-Forest approach on the Cloud Platform of Spark. The experiment results show that query time of Min-Forest approach is also on average about 10−4 ms for large dense graphs, and query time and index construction time of our approach are linear for both sparse graphs and dense graphs. It can answer reachability queries much faster than the state-of-art approaches on real graphs database, especially on large and dense ones.	reachability	Liu Yang;Tongyong Liu;Zhigang Hu;Zhifang Liao;Jun Long	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94289-6_28	database;spark (mathematics);computer science;theoretical computer science;vertex (geometry);scalability;search engine indexing;graph database;cloud computing;reachability problem;reachability	DB	-9.41085085931799	-39.76912515506206	5893

In this study, we investigate the prediction of article’s position based on the analysis of article’s content using different text analytics methods. The evaluation is performed in 4 main scenarios using articles from different time frames. The result of the analysis shows that the article’s freshness plays an important role in the prediction of a new article’s position. Also, the results from this work provides insight on how to find an optimised solution to automate the process of assigning new article the right position. We believe that these insights may further be used in developing content based news recommender algorithms.	algorithm;online and offline;personalization;recommender system;replay attack;text mining	Parisa Lak;Ceni Babaoglu;Ayse Basar Bener;Pawel Pralat	2016			world wide web;content time;information retrieval;computer science	Web+IR	-26.876260512894337	-48.66852220819075	5938

We show that this formal framework can advantageously complete a traditional analysis based on expected utilities, in particular when hyper-rational or omniscient agents are not assumed. This has significant implications for the design of self-organising electronic institutions, where the cost of monitoring and enforcement of laws and norms has to be taken into consideration.

12599498640fb65f64f6bbfdeae7c67d94abc5c0	a coalition structure-based decision method in b2b e-commerce model with multiple-items		This paper proposes a new B2B electronic commerce model by using bid- ding information in double auctions. In B2B electronic commerce, buyers try to pur- chase in multiple items at the same time, since a buyer develops something products by using purchased items. Also suppliers have an incentive of making coalitions, since buyers want to purchase in multiple items. A mechanism designer has to con- sider an optimal mechanism which calculates an optimal matching between buyers and suppliers. But to find an optimal matching is very hard, since a mechanism cal- culates all combinations between buyers and suppliers. Consequently, we propose a calculation method which has two steps, first a mechanism determines winners of buyers' side, then, determines coalitions and winners of suppliers by using the re- sult of buyers' side. This paper also discusses the improved method with dynamical mechanism design by using the bidding information. The auction protocol trees are expressed by all possible results of auctions. The result of each auction is recorded and stored with bidding data and conditions for subsequent auctions. Advantages of this paper are that each developer can procure the components to develop a certain item and tasks are allocated to suppliers effectively. The previous result of auction data can be available to shorten the period of winner determinations.	e-commerce	Satoshi Takahashi;Tokuro Matsuo	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-24696-8_6	eauction;marketing;operations management;business;commerce;forward auction	ECom	-7.368144274314991	-8.705534043782198	5967
f37dba0761f11961f81d3c7d29f56f73faf1f6a8	bringing constitutive dynamics to situated artificial institutions		The Situated Artificial Institution (SAI) model, as proposed in the literature, conceives the regulation of Multi-Agent Systems as based on a constitutive state that is consequence of the institutional interpretation of facts issued by the environment. The different nature of these facts (e.g. past sequence of events, states holding) implies various dynamic behaviours that need to be considered to properly define the life cycle of the constitutive state. This paper aims to bring such a dynamic to SAI. It defines a formal apparatus (i) for the institutional interpretation of environmental facts based on constitutive rules and (ii) for the management of the resulting constitutive state.	situated	Maiquel de Brito;Jomi Fred Hübner;Olivier Boissier	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23485-4_63	artificial intelligence	Robotics	-22.125653248396137	-12.431923378861669	5970

Some of them are located in the Inner Mongolia, Western China. These large fortresses are surrounded by moats. For some of them it is still possible to see earthworks, trenches and ditches, the planning of which could have a symbolic meaning. We can argue this result form their digital outlining, obtained after an image processing of satellite images, based on edge detection.	edge detection;image processing	Amelia Carolina Sparavigna	2012	CoRR		image processing;artificial intelligence;earthworks;computer science;machine learning;remote sensing;satellite;china;edge detection	Robotics	-34.563806413551376	-23.79349948264804	5984

Wearable sensor devices were developed and deployed in a real organization, a bank, for a month in order to study the effectiveness and potential of using sensors at the organizational level. It was found that patterns of physical interaction changed dynamically while e-mail is more stable from day to day. Different patterns of behavior between people in different rooms and teams (p < 0.01), as well as correlations between communication and a worker’s subjective productivity, were also identified. By analyzing a fluctuation of network parameters, i.e., “betweenness centrality,” it was also found that communication patterns of people are different: some people tend to communicate with the same people in regular frequency (which is hypothesized as a typical pattern of throughput-oriented jobs) while some others drastically changed their communication day by day (which is hypothesized as a pattern of creative jobs). Based on these hypotheses, a reorganization, such that people having similar characteristics work together, was proposed and implemented.	betweenness centrality;email;human–computer interaction;job stream;mental model;organizational behavior;quantum fluctuation;sensor;throughput;wearable computer	Koji Ara;Naoto Kanehira;Daniel Olguín Olguín;Benjamin N.

We exploit a fundamental relationship between the structure of motor skills, intention, and communication. Communicative actions are acquired using the same learning framework and the same primitive states and actions that the robot uses to construct manual behavior for interacting with other objects in the environment. A prospective behavior algorithm is used to acquire modular policies for conveying intention and goals to nearby human beings and recruiting their assistance. The learning framework and a preliminary case study are presented in which a humanoid robot learns expressive communicative behavior incrementally by discovering the manual affordances of human beings. Results from interactions with 16 people provide support for the hypothesized benefits of this approach. Behavior reuse makes learning from relatively few interactions possible. This approach compliments other efforts in the field by grounding social behavior, and proposes a mechanism for negotiating a communicative vocabulary between humans and robots.	algorithm;humanoid robot;humans;interaction;prospective search;vocabulary	Shichao Ou;Roderic A.

456321676ecfe1953ebd3624f6ff9bed1cd5bdc3	distance-aware selective online query processing over large distributed graphs		Performing online selective queries against graphs is a challenging problem due to the unbounded nature of graph queries which leads to poor computation locality. It becomes even difficult when a graph is too large to be fit in the memory. Although there have been emerging efforts on managing large graphs in a distributed and parallel setting, e.g., Pregel, HaLoop and etc, these computing frameworks are designed from the perspective of scalability instead of the query efficiency. In this work, we present our solution methodology for online selective graph queries based on the shortest path distance semantic, which finds various applications in practice. The essential intuition is to build a distance-aware index for online distance-based query processing and to eliminate redundant graph traversal as much as possible. We discuss how the solution can be applied to two types of research problems, distance join and vertex set bonding, which are distance-based graph pattern discovery and finding the structure-wise bonding of vertices, respectively.	computation;dspace;database;graph traversal;locality of reference;scalability;shortest path problem;synthetic intelligence;tree traversal	Xiaofei Zhang;Lei Chen	2016	Data Science and Engineering	10.1007/s41019-016-0023-z	graph product;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;graph;modular decomposition;complement graph;graph operations;graph database	DB	-9.638144933960191	-40.102374738099186	6034

In particular, emphasis is laid on Interactive Evolutionary processes, by presenting a Weighted Mutation Interactive Genetic Algorithm, followed by its thorough investigation and discussion. This computational structure provides the user with the capability of deeply integrating into a strictly defined evolutionary procedure, while guiding the morph genetic development with respect to personal and intuitive decisions. Reference is also made to Gordon Pask's Theory of Conversation, which appears to serve as a suitable conceptual tool to further explore the proposed algorithm's capacities. It is finally suggested that the presented process favors the creation of a symbiotic, circular relationship between the user and the computer, forming a scheme which can be potentially generalised and implemented in different, multiple ways.	experiment;genetic algorithm;in-game advertising;interactivity;unification (computer science)	Eirini Vouliouri	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2011.61	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	-28.477584927546484	-24.742121860843984	6045

A broad panoply of tools assisting designers when building realistic 3D scenes exists. In a near future, a new challenge will be to control the quantity of 3D contents that will be available. For instance, large amounts of 2D or 3D geographic data are spread all over the Internet. Nevertheless, appropriate description techniques and tools for the deployment and the retrieval of such data are still lacking. Our global objective is to propose a geographic digital library which can be exploited for describing, annotating and indexing geographic contents using geometric and topologic descriptions, geographic and appearance features, and semantics. Descriptions, annotations, and indexations are then exploited in queries to retrieve contents. The existing 3D scene description languages are generally free of any semantic information which could improve the management of 3D data (and especially research and re-use). In this paper, we propose the construction of geographic 3D data warehouses managed by a semantic digital library 3DSDL (3D Semantic Digital Library). This library, through a standardized communication interface, gives access to all the 3D models indexed in the warehouse and facilitates their exploitation. Each object is characterized by a set of both semantic and geographic annotations and some common features (colour, geometry, and topology).	2d computer graphics;3d modeling;assembly language;blackwell (series);compiler;computer-aided design;correctness (computer science);digital library;geographic information system;geometric modeling;geospatial analysis;heart rate variability;internationalization and localization;internet;relevance;scene description language;software deployment;web service;x3d	Ioan Marius Bilasco;Jérôme Gensel;Marlène Villanova-Oliver;Hervé Martin	2007	Trans.

bbc8254b170918d619574496c138dac101dee61f	context-aware robot navigation using interactively built semantic maps		We discuss the process of building semantic maps, how to interactively label entities in it, and use them to enable new navigation behaviors for specific scenarios. We utilize planar surfaces such as walls and tables, and static objects such as door signs as features to our semantic mapping approach. Users can interactively annotate these features by having the robot follow him/her, entering the label through a mobile app and performing a pointing gesture toward the landmark of interest. These landmarks can later be used to generate context-aware motions. Our pointing gesture approach can reliably estimate the target object using human joint positions and detect ambiguous gestures with probabilistic modeling. Our person following method attempts to maximize future utility by searching future actions, assuming constant velocity model for the human. We describe a simple method to extract metric goals from a semantic map landmark and present a human aware path planner that considers the personal spaces of people to generate socially-aware paths. Finally, we demonstrate context-awareness for person following in two scenarios: interactive labeling and door passing. We believe as the sensing technology improves and maps with richer semantic information becomes commonplace, it would create new opportunities for intelligent navigation algorithms.	context awareness;entity;interactivity;map;mobile app;robot;robotic mapping;robotics;semantic mapper;velocity (software development)	Akansel Cosgun;Henrik I.

In this paper, we aim to investigate how the location and heterogeneity of influencers in social networks can improve convergence. We propose a voter model with dynamic self-conviction and heterogeneous individual influence which is related to the underlying network topology. An agent may keep its current opinion according to personal conviction, or otherwise, it may preferentially choose the opinion of the neighbor that has a great influence. Individual conviction evolves during the dynamic process, and can be strengthened by social recognition. Simulations indicate our model has three nontrivial results. First, the conservation of average magnetization in the voter model is broken under the effect of individual conviction and influence, and the system evolves to an ordered state in which one opinion is dominant, but total consensus is prevented by extremists. Furthermore, individual influence has a subtle action on opinion evolution. The heterogeneity of individual influence accelerates the relaxation process, but, with the action of dynamic conviction, more heterogeneous influence does not mean the average magnetization will be more ordered. In addition, when competing with agents’ conviction, more heterogeneous individual influence plays a more significant role in agents’ decisions. These results are helpful for understanding some aspects of collective phenomena that occur on online social media.

204b751b5d194871b2e304bffd173dd88e3aaae0	monte carlo sort for unreliable human comparisons		Algorithms which sort lists of real numbers into ascending order have been studied for decades. They are typically based on a series of pairwise comparisons and run entirely ’on chip’. However people routinely sort lists which depend on subjective or complex judgements that cannot be automated. Examples include marketing research; where surveys are used to learn about customer preferences for products, the recruiting process; where interviewers attempt to rank potential employees, and sporting tournaments; where we infer team rankings from a series of one-on-one matches. We develop a novel sorting algorithm, where each pairwise comparison reflects a subjective human judgement about which element is ’bigger’ or ’better’. We introduce a finite and large error rate to each judgement, and we take the ’cost’ of each comparison to significantly exceed the cost of other computational steps. The algorithm must request the most informative sequence of comparisons from the user; in order to identify the correct sorted list with minimum human input. Our ”Discrete Adiabatic” Monte Carlo approach exploits the gradual acquisition of information by tracking a set of plausible hypotheses which are updated after each additional comparison.	bit error rate;computation;information;monte carlo method;sorting algorithm	Samuel L.

Even though 2D and 3D modeling and animation systems have been around for a while, none of the existing packages other than those which focus on cartoon animation have been used for the production of quality cartoons. The study highlights the special needs of the cartoonist and discusses the hardware and software requirements of systems that can effectively assist him in his work. Lessons learned from the early development efforts of such a system are presented here. Such lessons may turn out to be useful to computer graphics engineers at large, who may be working on other animation systems of similar ambition and scope.		Charles X.

The acquisition, processing, and rendering of movement data can be local or distributed, real-time or off-line. Key features of the m+m middleware are a small footprint in terms of computational resources, portability between different platforms, and high performance in terms of reduced latency and increased bandwidth. Examples of systems that can be built with m+m as the internal communication middleware include those for the semantic interpretation of human movement data, machine-learning models for movement recognition, and the mapping of movement data as a controller for online navigation, collaboration, and distributed performance.	affective computing;canonical account;computational resource;confluence;data visualization;embodied cognition;feature extraction;graphical user interface;machine learning;middleware;modal logic;online and offline;open-source software;quantified self;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time web;semantic interpretation;software deployment;software framework;software portability	Ulysses Bernardet;Dhruv Adhia;Norman Jaffe;Johnty Wang;Michael Nixon;Omid Alemi;Jordon Phillips;Steve DiPaola;Philippe Pasquier;Thecla Schiphorst	2016		10.1145/2948910.2948942	middleware;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;middleware;distributed computing	HPC	-43.9397655414313	-34.89250292587704	6115

This work focused on the development of a scalable interface for a single human-multiple robot system. This interface introduces a relational """"halo display that augments a camera view to promote situational awareness and the management of multiple robots by providing information regarding the robots' relative locations with respect to a selected robot.

This paper investigates the performance of explanatory or abductive inference in certain hypothesis selection tasks. The strategy is to use various measures of explanatory power to compare competing hypotheses and then make an inference to the best explanation. Computer simulations are used to compare the accuracy of such approaches with a standard approach when uncertainty is present and when several causal scenarios occur including one where the conditions for explaining away are met. Results show that some explanatory approaches can perform well and in certain scenarios they perform much better than the standard approach.	abductive reasoning;causal filter;causality;interaction information;lr parser;simulation	David H.

The main functionality of the system is the generation of alternatives to the decision processes concerning: (a) the allocation of separate collection vehicles, as well as the determination of their routes, and (b) the determination of the daily amount of solid waste to be sent to each sorting unit, in order to avoid waste of labor force and to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfills. To develop the computer system, a combination of quantitative techniques was used, such as: simulation of discrete events and algorithms/heuristics for vehicle allocation and routing. The system was validated using a field test in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul.	decision support system	Eugenio de Oliveira Simonetto;Denis Borenstein	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-48137-1_12	water resource management;waste management	Robotics	-11.636736802819355	-21.405994044790525	6150
7768b43b6eaa1e5ada576977b2fc4258c7975803	searching for geometric theorems using features retrieved from diagrams	knowledge management;graph matching;degree of relevance;theorem searching	Searching for knowledge objects from knowledge bases is a basic problem that need be investigated in the context of knowledge management. For geometric knowledge objects such as theorems, natural language representations may not exactly reveal the features and structures of geometric entities, and that is why keyword-based searching is often unsatisfactory. To obtain high-quality results of searching for theorems in plane Euclidean geometry with images of diagrams as input, we propose a method using geometric features retrieved from the images. The method consists of four main steps: 1 retrieve geometric features, with formal representations, from an input image of a diagram D using pattern recognition and numerical verification; 2 construct a graph G corresponding to D from the retrieved features and weaken G to match graphs produced from formal representations of theorems in OpenGeo, an open geometric knowledge base; 3 calculate the degree of relevance between G and the graph for each theorem found from OpenGeo; 4i¾?rank the resulting theorems according to their degrees of relevance. This method, based on graph matching, takes into account the structures of diagrams and works effectively. It is capable of finding out theorems of higher degree of relevance and may have potential applications in geometric knowledge management and education.	diagram	Wenya An;Xiaoyu Chen;Dongming Wang	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-32859-1_33	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometric networks	Robotics	-29.4235797105324	-11.391722063100202	6173

0eece4732eaf6ae60b01a777b2cb874ef9a66010	efficient level-based top-down data cube computation using mapreduce		Data cube is an essential part of OLAP(On-Line Analytical Processing) to support efficiently multidimensional analysis for a large size of data. The computation of data cube takes much time, because a data cube with d dimensions consists of 2 d (i.e., exponential order of d) cuboids. To build ROLAP (Relational OLAP) data cubes efficiently, many algorithms (e.g., GBLP, PipeSort, PipeHash, BUC, etc.) have been developed, which share sort cost and input data scan and/or reduce data computation time. Several parallel processing algorithms have been also proposed. On the other hand, MapReduce is recently emerging for the framework processing huge volume of data like web-scale data in a distributed/parallel manner by using a large number of computers (e.g., several hundred or thousands). In the MapReduce framework, the degree of parallel processing is more important to reduce total execution time than elaborate strategies like short-share and computation-reduction which existing ROLAP algorithms use. In this paper, we propose two distributed parallel processing algorithms. The first algorithm called MRLevel, which takes advantages of the MapReduce framework. The second algorithm called MRPipeLevel, which is based on the existing PipeSort algorithm which is one of the most efficient ones for top-down cube computation. (Top-down approach is more effective to handle big data, compared to others such as bottom-up and special data structures which are dependent on main-memory size.) The proposed MRLevel algorithm tries to parallelize cube computation and to reduce the number of data scan by level at the same time. The MRPipeLevel algorithm is based on the advantages of the MRLevel and to reduce the number of data scan by pipelining at the same time. We implemented and evaluated the performance of this algorithm under the MapReduce framework. Through the experiments, we also identify the factors for performance enhancement in MapReduce to process very huge data.	computation;data cube;mapreduce	Suan Lee;Jinho Kim;Yang-Sae Moon;Wookey Lee	2015	Trans.

c2b8d84e33e889dc2c80597363f606b433e78326	applications of deep knowledge		Expert systems have been built for applications in very different domains over the past few years, but one experience has been common in all of these domains. The expert system application needs to be chosen very carefully or the expert system which is produced will be unable to deal correctly with a reasonable proportion of the cases which it encounters. It is believed that many of the problems with such systems are due to their lack of underlying (deep) knowledge about their domains. When a human expert has no experience of a particular problem (and so is unable to apply shallow heuristic knowledge gained from experience), he uses his knowledge of the basic principles of the domain to produce new heuristics. Today's expert systems are unable to do this, because they have no such knowledge. This paper contrasts the shallow and deep knowledge approaches to problems and gives examples of some domains in which deep knowledge systems are being experimentally built. Section 2 deals with the problems inherent in the shallow representational approach to expert systems development. In Section 3, the general features of a deep knowledge approach to expert systems are outlined. Both Section 2 and Section 3 use a simple example from the domain of car electrics. Sections 4, 5 and 6 look at three application areas: control, design and diagnosis. Examples are given of projects which are using deep knowledge in those areas.	experiment;expert system;heuristic (computer science);knowledge-based systems;software development process	Chris J.

0b22eff8d024bab97405db40a2c363855821e529	e-bridge 3.0: a strategic approach to structural health monitoring of bridges in costa rica		The general condition of road infrastructure is a major weakness of the Costa Rican economy. In particular, a significant percentage of national bridges show an average or critical condition regarding parts of their structure. On the other hand, road and bridge infrastructure is crucial for the national economy since it promotes activities such as tourism and commercial trade. In this context, proper planning and prioritization of infrastructure projects is of high importance for related government institutions. In order to support these strategic activities, it is necessary to gather and monitor up-to-date information originating from different distributed systems and tools. e-Bridge 3.0 is a recent on-going project at the Costa Rica Institute of Tech‐ nology (TEC) aimed at the design of a bridge monitoring system to integrate stra‐ tegic information about bridge structures. Modern business intelligence techniques will be applied to generate strategic performance indicators regarding for instance general reliability and remaining lifespan. This paper introduces the e-Bridge 3.0 project as an initiative towards the establishment of a national bridge monitoring system, which would have a significant impact on the effectiveness of national civil infrastructure management.

We propose an investigation into expressive ambient media in the form of visual surfaces as digital enhancements for Human-Human Interaction. The goal is to allow new modalities for self-expression as well as to enhance communication by displaying personal digital content in the form of Presence Bubbles. Ambient media allow thus communication, presence and socialization opportunities and transform into responsive and expressive media for supporting and enhancing human-human interaction.	digital recording;download;emotion recognition;flickr;gesture recognition;interaction;mobile phone;natural language processing;sensor;social network;socialization;streaming media;upload;velocity (software development)	Radu-Daniel Vatavu	2010	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-010-0674-0	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-52.56267473650549	-45.01908579307496	6244

0cb053d5cd1c84247fe1e369c9dd03ebef9f7a86	exploration of spreadsheet formulae with fency		Spreadsheets are well-known to be frequentlyused but error-prone communication devices. They are useful since they are active (e.g., automatic computation), provide a cognitive notation system drawing on visualizing values, meanings and relations at the same time (enabled by labeled, color-coded grids), and provide easy-touse domain-specific operations (e.g., computational functions). The latter, in particular, is enabled by the text-style formula format in spreadsheets, in which variables are replaced by cell references. For simply-structured formulae this works very well. To keep the formulae simple, computations are modularized into subformulae and as such distributed over and beyond the spreadsheet. This makes the provenance (tree) of spreadsheet values difficult to understand – a probable cause for the high error rate in spreadsheets. To explore and navigate the subformulae involved in the computation of a cell value we present the subformula explorer “Fency”, a treebased, explorative interface: Whenever a user clicks on a cell its formula becomes the root of a cell-dependency graph. Each child node displays the formula of a cell (or range) reference used in the parent formula. Moreover, each node represents a direct link to the respective cell (or range), so that it can be used for formula navigation as well.	cognitive dimensions of notations;computation;data architect;database;inline linking;spreadsheet;tree (data structure);well-formed formula	Andrea Kohlhase;Alexandru Toader	2013			word error rate;theoretical computer science;notation;computation;computer science;graph	ML	-31.706798682417766	-31.76015773361967	6261

This paper presents a system for product retrieval inspired by psychology of women's shopping activity, and an implementation of the system for apparel products. Our study supposes products which pre-defined keywords are assigned, and prepares icons representing the combination of the keywords. The system intuitively displays various icons in a display space to demonstrate the diversity of the products. When a user selects an interested icon, the system switches the display to a set of images corresponding to the selected icon, so that the user can visually compare the similar products.

With an increasing number of items, visual search becomes difficult. Recently, it has been suggested that the so-called contextual cueing effect, which is known from psychological experiments, can be applied to improve visual search performance. Contextual cueing leads to decreased search times for target objects within familiar context configurations. It is assumed that associations between context configurations and target locations are learned implicitly and then used to guide the allocation of attention to the relevant object. In accordance with demands for interface consistency, this mechanism could be interesting for the development of user interfaces. The present study investigated which object features (e.g. color or orientation) can establish the learning process. The results show that implicit learning of color and orientation arrangements are possible, but the transfer to configuration with changed features depends on the recent learning history. Implications of these results are discussed with respect to the design of user interfaces.	color;contextual inquiry;experiment;image;maximal set;mobile phone;programming paradigm;user interface design	Sonja Stork;Laura Voss;Andrea Schankin;Anna Schubö	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16607-5_19	computer vision;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-46.40115733113448	-47.356307309844816	6283

As a result, trust has been widely studied in multiagent systems and related fields such as the semantic web. Here we introduce a simple approach to reasoning about trust with logic, describe how it can be combined with reasoning about beliefs using logic, and demonstrate its use on an example. The example highlights a number of issues related to resolving weighted arguments.	agent-based model;authorization;autonomous robot;decentralised system;entity;formal system;multi-agent system;semantic web;software propagation;software system	Simon Parsons;Elizabeth Sklar;Peter McBurney	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-33152-7_12	knowledge management;mathematics;management science;social psychology	AI	-21.381279021616358	-10.790782157337476	6291

Since then, RTB has fundamentally changed the landscape of the digital marketing by scaling the buying process across a large number of available inventories. The demand for automation, integration and optimisation in RTB brings new research opportunities in the IR/DM/ML fields. However, despite its rapid growth and huge potential, many aspects of RTB remain unknown to the research community for many reasons. In this tutorial, together with invited distinguished speakers from online advertising industry, we aim to bring the insightful knowledge from the real-world systems to bridge the gaps and provide an overview of the fundamental infrastructure, algorithms, and technical and research challenges of this new frontier of computational advertising. We will also introduce to researchers the datasets, tools, and platforms which are publicly available thus they can get hands-on quickly.	algorithm;computation;digital marketing;hands-on computing;image scaling;inventory;mathematical optimization;online advertising;real-time bidding;real-time transcription;world-system	Shuai Yuan	2015		10.1145/2684822.2697041	real-time bidding;computer science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-37.331170804207446	-9.712207902116743	6331

The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can explain the complicated relationship between antecedents, consequences, and different types of involvement at the same time to understand the internal state of consumers better. Specifically, this model has to be capable of handling the vague interactions between different types of involvement. We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions.	automata theory;automaton;causal filter;causal model;fuzzy concept;interaction;intuitionistic logic;mobile phone;vagueness	Ting-Yu Chen;Li-Hsuan Yen;Che-Wei Tsui	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/FUZZY.2008.4630461	discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;mathematics;fuzzy set;consumer behaviour;causal model	Embedded	-6.228478464440184	-22.774808676450778	6353

In the design of the system, the teaching world is divided into the meta-knowledge-base for dialog management, the text knowledge-base, the problem-solving expert knowledge, the rule-base for tutoring strategy, and the bug knowledge. The modular structure is thus considered for the knowledge-base. The representation of knowledge and the method of inference are considered, utilizing the characteristics of such knowledge as follows.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The text knowledge is based on the semantic network representation, where the procedural knowledge is supplemented. Other knowledge bases are described by the production rules. The knowledge structure is simplified so that the interpretation and the execution are made by a single meta-inference engine. The response of the student as well as his level of understanding are recognized and diagnosed utilizing those knowledges, and the individual guidance process is developed. In the intelligent CAI, important mechanisms are those for identifying the cause of the error, and the determination of the micro- and macroscopic means of remedy from the knowledge-base. In this paper, a schema is described where the bug generation, diagnosis mechanism, problem-solving expert mechanism and the student model called MOD are closely interrelated.	commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)	Toshio Okamoto	1989	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/scj.4690200203	natural language processing;knowledge representation and reasoning;systems modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;knowledge-based systems;machine learning;open knowledge base connectivity;procedural knowledge;knowledge extraction;algorithm	NLP	-24.316885667208528	-5.044631837216537	6378

An early prominent view held that the explanatory relevance of content consists in its supervenience on the the formal properties of computational states (see, e.g., Fodor 1980). For reasons that derive from the familiar Twin Earth thought experiments, it is usually thought that if content is to supervene on formal properties, it must be narrow; that is, it must not be the sort of content that determines reference and truth-conditions. An interesting alternative to this view has recently been proposed by Egan (1995). According to Egan, the explanatory role of content is such that contents must in general be broad to be explanatorily relevant. But Egan’s view involves a non-realist interpretation of content assignments. I will argue here that this non-realism about contents is undermotivated. A realist variation on her view of the explanatory role of content, however, would survive this criticism. This realist variation, I suggest, shares with the views of other commentators on Marr’s theory (e.g., Burge 1986; Shapiro 1993; forthcoming) certain commitments concerning the supervenience base of visual contents and processes. I will argue, however, that these commitments beg important questions regarding the individuation of cognitive states and processes. I conclude, contrary to Burge and Shapiro, that Marr’s theory does not favor anti-individualism.	cognition;computation;experiment;relevance	Keith Butler	1998	Synthese	10.1023/A:1004996729912	cognition;philosophy;epistemology	AI	-13.177449920250687	3.260502920606003	6386

However, the recommended items cover the coarse subject level and the accuracy performance is poor. Taking into account ontology structure of subject, user's actual interests can distribute in multiple sub-subject structures. In this paper, multi-granularity recommendation mechanism relying on multi-granularity similarity is proposed to fit user's actual detail demands. Specially, a personalized ontology user model is learned to represent user's multi-granularity interests. According to ontology structure, the multi-granularity similarity method is implemented by combing content closeness and semantic closeness between user models at different grained subjects. Lastly, recommendation method distributed in multi-granularity subjects is achieved to compare against traditional single subject's recommendation for their performances. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is more successful.	centrality;mathematical optimization;performance;personalization;precision and recall;recommender system;user experience;user modeling	Jianxing Zheng;Bofeng Zhang;Guobing Zou	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.414	upper ontology;user modeling;computer science;ontology;ontology;data mining;ontology-based data integration;world wide web;information retrieval;process ontology	DB	-22.244158931964126	-48.07095424225098	6407

The method has been applied to a real-world problem of noisy sensor-data fusion: the position estimation of an autonomous mobile robot navigating in an approximately and partially known office environment using a topological map. Each place in the map is characterized by a set of logical formulae axiomatizing both symbolic knowledge and uncertain information from the sensors. At each time instant during navigation, the necessity for each place is calculated using a function generated by a proof system based on sequent calculus. Several test runs using a real robot have shown the adequacy of the approach in interpreting and disambiguating the information coming from independent perceptual sources, in combination with symbolic knowledge.	algebraic semantics (computer science);autonomous robot;blueprint;estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques;formal methods;mobile robot;online and offline;philips nino;proof calculus;robotic mapping;salem;sensor;sequent calculus;type signature	Claudio Sossai;Paolo Bison;Gaetano Chemello	2001	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/S0165-0114(00)00067-1	fuzzy logic;internationalization and localization;uncertainty;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;sensor fusion;robotics;sequent calculus;reason;algorithm	Robotics	-20.026287323719373	-1.8814366719818048	6414

But typically the approach assumes that links between groups are non-existent, and interdependence among the individuals derives solely from common group membership. It is not plausible that such groups have no internal structure nor they have no links between each other. Networks provide a more complex representation of interdependence. Drawing on a small but crucial body of existing work, we present a general formulation of a multilevel network structure. We extend exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to multilevel networks, and investigate the properties of the proposed models using simulations which show that even very simple meso effects can create structure at one or both levels. We use an empirical example of a collaboration network about French cancer research elites and their affiliations (Lazega et al., 2006, 2008) to demon-strate that a full understanding of the network structure requires the cross-level parameters. We see these as the first steps in a full elaboration for general multilevel network analysis using ERGMs.	apollonian network;embnet.journal;exponential random graph models;interdependence;line printer daemon protocol;mesoscopic physics;multilevel model;simulation;social network analysis;time complexity;word lists by frequency	Peng Wang;Garry Robins;Philippa Pattison;Emmanuel Lazega	2013	Social Networks	10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.004	psychology;combinatorics;artificial intelligence;mathematics;sociology;exponential random graph models;algorithm;statistics	AI	-24.138176958436958	-27.343869998507746	6420

Power transformers' failures carry great costs to electric companies since they need resources to recover from them and to perform periodical maintenance. To avoid this problem in four working transformers, the authors have implemented the measurement system of a failure prediction tool, that is the basis of a predictive maintenance infrastructure. The prediction models obtain their inputs from sensors, whose values must be previously conditioned, sampled and filtered, since the forecasting algorithms need clean data to work properly. Applying Data Warehouse (DW) techniques, the models have been provided with an abstraction of sensors the authors have called Virtual Cards (VC). By means of these virtual devices, models have access to clean data, both fresh and historic, from the set of sensors they need. Besides, several characteristics of the data flow coming from the VCs, such as the sample rate or the set of sensors itself, can be dynamically reconfigured. A replication scheme was implemented to allow the distribution of demanding processing tasks and the remote management of the prediction applications. VCs and the modular architecture proposed make the system scalable, reconfigurable and easy to maintain.	algorithm;central processing unit;data acquisition;dataflow;dreamwidth;entity;modular programming;personal digital assistant;power supply;preprocessor;sampling (signal processing);scalability;sensor;system of measurement;transformers	Perfecto Mariño Espiñeira;César A.

34e56653fbdbc9c5f471f54472aa54e4890d47b3	a change of the leading player in flow visualization technique	flow visualization	It is our great pleasure to publish the Journal of Visualization Volume 9, Number 1 to a worldwide audience. In this issue, six frontispieces, twelve general papers including one short paper, and one report of the 8th ASV (Asian Symposium on Visualization) are presented. The papers presented in this issue encompass those on simple flow such as vortex and jet flows to those addressing complex flows, such as hypersonic flow and fluid-induced vibration and even fluid machinery and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Flow visualization techniques also vary greatly, and those such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), color Schlieren method, Liquid Crystal Thermography (LCT) have recently become popular and are very interesting topics to readers. The last paper was written by Prof. Banterng Suwantragul, the chairman of the 8th Asian Symposium on Visualization that was held in Chiangmai, Thailand. The symposium was attended by more than 110 participants from 11 countries, and 71 technical papers covering a wide range of topics related to flow visualization techniques were presented. The symposium was a great success, and the next will be held in Hong Kong SAR, China from June 4 to 9, 2007. The papers published in this issue are testimony to the amazing range of visualization techniques being employed. Techniques such as PIV and Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) are considered the leading players in the Journal of Visualization today, and several papers in this issue also deal with these techniques. Recently I had the opportunity to attend an international conference for turbomachinery and aircraft engines that was held in Europe, and to my surprise, many designers and researchers are still using “outdated” techniques such as the oil-film method, tuft method, and dye injection method. For some designers and researchers, the “latest” techniques may not be practical in terms of cost and ease of use. The Journal of Visualization is the only academic journal dedicated to flow visualization techniques, and it hopes to create an environment inclusive of techniques of the past and present. A thorough review of this issue offers a glimpse of visualization techniques of the future. Lastly, we would like to thank all contributing authors, reviewers, and individuals who were involved in the publication of this issue.	hemodynamics;linear canonical transformation;liquid-crystal display;low insertion force;scientific visualization;usability;vortex	A.

However, real life databases are frequently updated. To the best of our knowledge, the discovery of functional dependencies in dynamic databases has never been studied. A naive solution consists in re-applying one of the existing algorithms to discover functional dependencies holding on the updated database. Nevertheless, in many domains, where response time is crucial, re-executing algorithms from scratch would be inacceptable. In this paper, we propose a new technique that makes use of the previously discovered results to cut down the amount of work that has been done to discover the new set of functional dependencies satisfied by the updated database.	functional dependency	Ghada Gasmi;Lotfi Lakhal;Yahya Slimani	2012	Intell.

Our work is motivated by a lack of evidence supporting the extension of previously established benefits on substantially large, room-shaped displays. Using the Reality Deck, a gigapixel resolution immersive display, as its apparatus, our study spans four display form-factors, starting at 100 megapixels arranged planarly and up to one gi-gapixel in a horizontally immersive setting. We focus on four core tasks: visual search, attribute search, comparisons and pattern finding. We present a quantitative analysis of per-task user performance across the various display conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in user performance as the display form-factor changes to 600 megapixels. At the 600 megapixel to 1 gigapixel transition, we observe no tangible performance improvements and the visual search task regressed substantially. Additionally, our analysis of subjective mental effort questionnaire responses indicates that subjective user effort grows as the display size increases, validating previous studies on smaller displays. Our analysis of the participants' physical navigation during the study sessions shows an increase in user movement as the display grew. Finally, by visualizing the participants' movement within the display apparatus space, we discover two main approaches (termed “overview” and “detail”) through which users chose to tackle the various data exploration tasks. The results of our study can inform the design of immersive high-resolution display systems and provide insight into how users navigate within these room-sized visualization spaces.	computer form factor;coupling (computer programming);display size;form factor (design);gigapixel image;ibm notes;image resolution;immersion (virtual reality);mapquest;pixel;scalability;usability testing;web mapping	Charilaos Papadopoulos;Seyedkoosha Mirhosseini;Ievgeniia Gutenko;Kaloian Petkov;Arie E.

Some children, however, find it difficult to initiate interaction and there are only few tools that can create opportunities for children to interact with others.#R##N##R##N#This study presents a small wireless device that can measure and visualize geometric relationships in a gymnasium or playground. The estimation of geometric relationships is proposed based on signal strength of wireless communication, bodily orientation and statistical geometric consistency. A light-emitting visualization method is used in real-time according to geometric relationships among devices. Several wearable interfaces were developed to facilitate communication and social interaction of children by using the developed wireless device. Several experiments were done with typically developing children and children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) to evaluate the proposed technology.

In this paper, we address this issue from two directions. First, we present the outcome of an online survey where we analyze users' opinion about gamification in a workplace environment. Then, we analyze the interaction logs of a re-designed gamified enterprise book marking system to compare the employees' subjective perception of gamification with their actual behavior when using a gamified system. Results indicate that there is a strong relationship between employees' perception of gamification and their actual interaction with such system.	enterprise bookmarking;gamification;item unique identification	Michael Meder;Till Plumbaum;Frank Hopfgartner	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing	10.1109/UCC.2013.95	experiment;games;questionnaire;lead;knowledge management;multimedia;encyclopedia	HPC	-60.174261681730705	-44.719089195960855	6482

Concentration and accumulation of the industrial areas and their inappropriate location are the main reasons of pollution. While, concerning Tehran’s topographical and geological status and existence of many active faults, these areas can potentially be considered the main pollutant resources of air pollution once natural disasters occur. Therefore creating a suitable headstock for both optimized management to control air pollution and a management of crisis seems to be necessary.

6796478dfde9f6c1d44b7e40675cb6ec154aa1e8	health literacy for the general public: making a case for non-trivial visualizations		Health literacy is concerned with the degree to which individuals can access and understand information to make health decisions. The multifaceted nature of health data presents challenges for individuals seeking to improve their understanding of health. To aid health literacy efforts, we have developed HealthConfection, a visualization tool that uses elaborate and non-typical interactive visualizations to represent health data. In this paper, we report on two studies we conducted with HealthConfection. In the first study, we investigate whether individuals can learn to use non-typical visualizations, and the impact that short, minimalist video tutorials will have on participants’ understanding of the visualizations. The findings from this study suggest that individuals can learn to use non-typical visualizations and that participants who used the tutorials achieved higher scores than those without tutorials. This work indicates that non-typical visualizations are a viable option for conveying complex datasets. Based on this foundation, we conducted a second study to investigate if non-typical visualizations can improve health literacy for the general public. Results show that participants who used HealthConfection achieved higher scores than those who did not interact with the tool. Our work suggests that non-typical visualizations can be used to improve health literacy.	mechatronics	Oluwakemi Ola;Kamran Sedig	2017	Informatics	10.3390/informatics4040033	knowledge management;visualization;human–computer interaction;global health;health literacy;consumer health informatics;computer science	HCI	-59.29748585503473	-49.09627980922632	6491
3008824488fc1249d81159f89697c22d57a842d0	fusing probe speed and flow data for robust short-term congestion front forecasts		In this paper a robust and flexible method is proposed that combines the strengths of detector as well as Floating Car (FC) data in order to provide short-term congestion front forecasts. Based on the high spatio-temporal resolution of FC data, congested regimes and according congestion fronts are identified accurately. Subsequently, the flow data provided by loop detectors are utilized in order to predict these congestion fronts for a time horizon of up to ten minutes. Three variations of the method are presented which focus the difficulty of estimating traffic density in congested traffic conditions with given data. The evaluation is based on real FC as well as loop detector data collected during a congestion on the German Autobahn A9. Comparisons of the variants of the proposed method and a naive predictor emphasize the advantage of combining both data sources and point out the strategy that results in the most accurate front forecasts.	algorithm;kerrison predictor;microsoft outlook for mac;network congestion;real-time computing;sensor;smoothing	Felix Rempe;Lisa Kessler;Klaus Bogenberger	2017	2017 5th IEEE International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)	10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005695	kernel (linear algebra);robustness (computer science);real-time computing;floating car data;mathematical optimization;detector;time horizon;engineering	Robotics	-15.743805503752197	-30.202870275019283	6498

443428c4d382eed4daf5f84b155b2ea075d32cab	morphognosis: the shape of knowledge in space and time		Artificial intelligence research to a great degree focuses on the brain and behaviors that the brain generates. But the brain, an extremely complex structure resulting from millions of years of evolution, can be viewed as a solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. The environment generates signals that produce sensory events within an organism. Building an internal spatial and temporal model of the environment allows an organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. Higher intelligence might be the ability to process information coming from a larger extent of space-time. In keeping with nature’s penchant for extending rather than replacing, the purpose of the mammalian neocortex might then be to record events from distant reaches of space and time and render them, as though yet near and present, to the older, deeper brain whose instinctual roles have changed little over eons. Here this notion is embodied in a model called morphognosis (morpho = shape and gnosis = knowledge). Its basic structure is a pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of the pyramid are the most recent and nearby events. Receding from the apex are less recent and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a structure of progressively larger chunks of space-time knowledge. A set of morphognostics forms long-term memories that are learned by exposure to the environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the morphognosis model, using a simulated organism that learns to forage in its world for food, build a nest, and play the game of Pong.	apex (geometry);artificial intelligence;cellular automaton;gnosis	Thomas E.

These requests are called continuous queries because they are executed continuously during tag movement. To enhance the performance of the middleware, an index must be built to process these continuous queries efficiently. Several approaches to building an index on queries rather than data records, called query index, have been proposed and are widely used to evaluate continuous queries over streaming data. EPCglobal proposed an Event Cycle Specification (ECSpec) model, which is a de facto standard query interface for RFID applications. Continuous queries based on ECSpec consist of a large number of segments that represent the query conditions. The problem when using any of the existing query indexes on these continuous queries is that it takes a long time to build the index because it is necessary to insert a large number of segments into the index. To solve this problem, we propose an aggregate transformation that converts a group of segments into compressed data. We also propose an efficient query index scheme for the transformed space. We compare the performance of the proposed index with existing query indexes. Our experiments show that the proposed index outperforms the others on various datasets.	aggregate data;algorithm;congruence of squares;data compression;experiment;information retrieval;middleware;radio-frequency identification;stream (computing);streaming media	Jaekwan Park;Bonghee Hong;ChaeHoon Ban	2007	13th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA 2007)	10.1109/RTCSA.2007.5	data compression;sargable;search engine indexing;query optimization;web query classification;computer science;operating system;middleware;data mining;database;information technology;information retrieval;query language;spatial query;data collection	DB	-27.05536444053898	-0.9483465626452836	6545

However, there are other reasons to store data redundantly, which are often not recognized when designing data warehouses. Especially in Business Data Warehouses, data management via multiple persistence levels is necessary to condition the huge amount of data into an adequate format for its final usage. Redundant data allocates additional disk space and requires time-consuming processing and huge effort for complex maintenance. That means in reverse: avoiding data persistence leads to less effort. The question arises: What data for what purposes do really need to be stored? In this paper, we discuss decision support and evaluation approaches beyond cost-based comparisons. We use a compendium of purposes for data persistence. We define a model that includes objective indicators and subjective user preferences for decision making on data persistence in Business Data Warehouses. We develop an indicator system that enables the measurement of technical as well as business-related facts. With multi-criteria decision methodology, we present a framework to objectively compare different alternatives for data persistence. Finally, we apply our developed method to a real world Business Data Warehouse and show applicability and integration of our model in an existing system.	boehm–demers–weiser garbage collector;compendium;data cube;decision support system;disk space;dreamwidth;internet movie database (imdb);mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;olap cube;persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;real life;redundancy (information theory);semiconductor industry;user (computing)	Veit Köppen;Thorsten Winsemann;Gunter Saake	2015	2015 IEEE 9th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)	10.1109/RCIS.2015.7128896	data modeling;data quality;computer science;data science;data warehouse;data mining;database;business decision mapping	DB	-26.77092340139668	3.1549487973943626	6592

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to make efficient demographic prediction based on smartphone application usage. Specifically, we firstly consider to characterize the data set by building a matrix to correlate users with types of categories from the log file of smartphone applications. Then, by considering the category-unbalance problem, we make use of the correlation between users’ demographic information and their requested Internet resources to make the prediction, and propose an optimal method to further smooth the obtained results with category neighbors and user neighbors. The evaluation is supplemented by the dataset from real world workload. The results show advantages of the proposed prediction approach compared with baseline prediction. In particular, the proposed approach can achieve 81.21 percent of Accuracy in gender prediction. While in dealing with a more challenging multi-class problem, the proposed approach can still achieve good performance (e.g., 73.84 percent of Accuracy in the prediction of age group and 66.42 percent of Accuracy in the prediction of phone level).	baseline (configuration management);information privacy;mobile app;personalization;smartphone	Zhen Qin;Yilei Wang;Hongrong Cheng;Yingjie Zhou;Zhengguo Sheng;Victor C.

To date, technological advances in data modeling and data management have not focused on the special needs and challenges of data management for cellular and molecular biology. These needs as well as the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions for biological data integration are summarized. Next, we discuss challenges and potential solutions to the emerging data management needs of biologists. If these issues are not addressed satisfactorily, it is unclear if the adoption of data management technology will be of benefit to the biological scientist.	computational biology;data management;data modeling;molecular biology;solutions;weakness	Louiqa Raschid	2003	Omics : a journal of integrative biology	10.1089/153623103322006607	idef1x;biology;data modeling;data model;data management;data science;integrated enterprise modeling;data warehouse;data mining;database;enterprise data management	Comp.	-36.92340956530122	-7.477325304729403	6602

The data management platform enables the ontological annotation of VPH-relevant datasets, their provisioning in the Cloud, and supports different data integration approaches. In this paper we present the architecture and implementation of this VPH-Share Cloud and data management platform and we go into detail about two different data integration approaches: relational data mediation, which has been realized on top of a distributed data mediation engine, and semantic data integration, which is supported on the basis of the SPARQL federation extension. Both approaches are examined on top of a project-specific scenario executed in the VPH-Share Cloud environment.	authorization;cloud computing;concurrency (computer science);dedicated hosting service;elegant degradation;internet;middleware;provisioning;sparql;scalability;security token;virtual appliance;web service	Siegfried Benkner;Chris Borckholder;Marian Bubak;Yuriy Kaniovskyi;Richard Knight;Martin Koehler;Spiros Koulouzis;Piotr Nowakowski;Steven Wood	2013	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2013.58	cloud computing;relational database;computer science;data virtualization;data integration;data mining;database;semantics;atmosphere;mediation;ontology-based data integration;world wide web	DB	-40.558098331480466	1.0229705108678901	6612

The Gamelan Sampul is a laptop sleeve with embedded circuitry that allows users to practice playing Javanese gamelan instruments without a full set of instruments. It is part of a larger project that aims to develop a set of portable and mobile tools for learning, recording and performing classical Javanese gamelan music. The accessibility of a portable Javanese gamelan set introduces the musical genre to audiences who have never experienced this traditional music before, passing down long established customs to future generations. But it also raises the question of what is and what isn’t appropriate to the musical tradition. The Gamelan Sampul attempts to introduce new technology to traditional folk music while staying sensitive to cultural needs.	accessibility;electronic circuit;embedded system;laptop	Antonius Wiriadjaja	2013			multimedia;musical;laptop;computer science	HCI	-58.49667193414432	-36.524781410544364	6619

This study is a part of an ongoing research toward the design of a constraint-based 3-D separation assistance interface that can present all the relevant properties of the spatiotemporal separation problem. A display concept is proposed that presents speed, heading, and altitude action possibilities in two planar projections of the maneuver action space. The interface also visualizes how these projections interact with each other.	airborne ranger;clutter;coplanar waveguide;course (navigation);experiment;iteration;microsoft visio;separation kernel;velocity (software development)	Joost Ellerbroek;Koen C.

5e6fefa476d3ffc54cd41a0814328dafbaaa4b94	best-action planning for real-time response - an approach in orica	real time;action plan	A planner for real-time response aims at building a plan to safely guide the world to its goal state by guaranteeing response deadlines. Ideally, it should find the paths most suitable for guaranteeing real-time behaviour and goal achievement. To achieve this ideal behaviour, it must possess maximum information about the world behaviour and be able to plan the responses of the system under-control to its advantage. It should be able to reason about one path with respect to the other, based on the execution duration, the amount of resources used and the system safety. In this paper, we present the ORICA (OSIRIS real-time intelligent control architecture) real-time response planner, which builds plans that permit the real-time system to strive to achieve its goal in un-guaranteed environment behaviour, while still ensuring system safety. It does heuristic reasoning for comparison of different paths when a choice of path is possible.	heuristic;heuristic analysis;intelligent control;java;knowledge representation and reasoning;qnx;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;system safety	Tariq Ali Omar;Ana Simonet;Michel Simonet	2004			computer science	AI	-19.447400098444657	-7.636741535268826	6698

Although the logical aspects of the negotiation protocol have been analyzed, the properties of protocol dynamics remain unclear. This paper introduces our quantitative analysis of protocol dynamics which is essential for constructing continuous reaitime applications. We carried out a simulation which based on queueing theory to practice the purpose described above. Two kinds of agent, manager and contractor, exist within the simulation. Managers provide tasks to contractors which undertake them as follows: first, when a task arrives, the manager responsible for it announces it with a bidding deadline to all of contractors immediately; second, each contractor selects from all the announced tasks, the one that best matches its own standards, and bids for it; finally, the manager chooses the most appropriate bid, and awards it to that agent; a manager can make multiple announcements simultaneously while a contractor can bid for only one task at a time. Each manager and contractor has a evaluation function fi and gj, respectively. Manager i awards a bidder that achieves maxj []i(j)] and contractor j selects task that achieves max~Lqj(i)]. The .?i and gj is generated as a list containing the natural numbers from I to 100. The service time for a task and the bidding period is fixed at 1 and 0.1 respectively. We say managers or contractors are homogeneous when fix(J) = fib(J) gj, (i) = gj2(i), otherwise heterogeneous.

And then the weighting matrix was introduced into fuzzy integrative evaluation. By combining the AHP method with fuzzy theory, the authors presented the AHP-Fuzzy methd for stability evaluation of rockfall. By engineering applications, compared to typical stability analysis method of rockfall, the AHP-Fuzzy method has preferable reliability. Besides, this method is based on partial quantitative, partial qualitative, and facile parameters, and avoiding the disadvantage of typical stability method that extremely depends on investigation quality and mechanics parameters of rockfall.	fuzzy logic	Siqiao Ye;Hongmei Tang;Hongkai Chen;Hui Zhu	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569089	rockfall;von neumann stability analysis;stability;reliability theory;hazard;reliability;mathematics;fuzzy set;statistics	Robotics	-7.294942178485019	-19.22556588958198	6729

These cognitive states are legally relevant when agents are delegated by their users to engage, without users’ review, in choices based on their the agents’ own knowledge. Consequently, both with regard to torts and to contracts, legal rules designed for humans can also be applied to software agents, even though the latter do not have rights and duties of their own. The implications of this approach in different areas of the law are then discussed, in particular with regard to contracts, torts, and personality.	artificial intelligence;automata theory;automaton;cognition;cyberspace;experience;intelligent agent;intentionality;interaction;multiple inheritance;programming paradigm;robot;software agent;substrate (electronics);value (ethics)	Giovanni Sartor	2009	Artificial Intelligence and Law	10.1007/s10506-009-9081-0	delegation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software agent;representation	AI	-23.45589200138953	-12.556240121451616	6744

Most of the processing techniques, however, suffer from various bottlenecks worsening their time and/or space efficiency. We assume that the main reason is they consider XML collections too globally, involving all their possible features, although real-world data are often much simpler. Even though some techniques do restrict the input data, the restrictions are mostly unnatural. This paper aims to introduce Analyzer—a complex framework for performing statistical analyses of realworld documents. Exploitation of results of these analyses is a classical way how data processing can be optimized in many areas. Although this intent is legitimate, ad hoc and dedicated analyses soon become obsolete, they are usually built on insufficiently extensive collections and are difficult to repeat. Analyzer represents an easily extensible framework, which helps the user with gathering documents, managing analyses and browsing computed reports.	complex system;computation;data (computing);document;download;emoticon;hoc (programming language);interrupt;linked data;markup language;mathematical optimization;object composition;ontology (information science);plug-in (computing);scheduling (computing);the computer journal;thread (computing);vii;windows task scheduler;world wide web;xml;xquery	Jakub Stárka;Martin Svoboda;Jan Sochna;Jirí Schejbal;Irena Holubová;David Bednárek	2012	Comput.

c84bac8e586f7f47943539ed48d4a7e07176c4cc	four lenses for designing morally engaging games		Historically the focus of moral decision-making in games has been narrow, mostly confined to challenges of moral judgement (deciding right and wrong). In this paper, we look to moral psychology to get a broader view of the skills involved in ethical behaviour and how these skills can be employed in games. Following the Four Component Model of Rest and colleagues, we identify four “lenses” – perspectives for considering moral gameplay in terms of focus, sensitivity, judgement and action – and describe the design problems raised by each. To conclude, we analyse two recent games, The Walking Dead and Papers, Please, and show how the lenses give us insight into important design differences between these games.	moral psychology;the walking dead: season two	Malcolm Ryan;Dan Staines;Paul Formosa	2016			moral psychology;social psychology;empathy;political science;judgement;game design;lens (optics)	HCI	-61.31014513363775	-31.149152615779045	6766

Many approaches have been proposed on this aspect. However, none of them considers the timing constraints held by high-level reactive applications. In this paper, we present an event-oriented inference algorithm with timing constraints, called RTEIA, to make automatic decisions about how to react to continuously arriving events (i.e., event streams) so that the deadlines of inference delay for rules can be met as much as possible. Simulation results show that the heuristic searching policy used by RTEIA effectively improves the number of times that rules are fired within the deadlines of their inference delay (NAFS).	algorithm;heuristic;high- and low-level;simulation	Ying Qiao;Hongan Wang;Xiang Li	2012		10.1145/2401603.2401696	real-time computing;computer science;machine learning;data mining	EDA	-19.258689831124013	-6.520815015580695	6781

The updates are frequent, usually daily, according to the site owner's editorial purposes—or whims. Blogs contribute to Web content by linking and filtering evolving content in a structured way and by establishing interlinked com-munities—the blogosphere—connect-ing people through shared interests. Bloggers can link to news feeds, personal journals, and topic-specific blogs of almost every sort. Figure 1 shows a sample news blog for the Texas A&M University System's Health Science Center. The number of blogs is growing exponentially—from a handful in 1998, according to an informal history popular in the blog community (www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog _history.html), to more than a million in 2003, according to Technorati (www.technorati.com), a blog that tracks change activity at a rate of 150,000 blogs per hour. SlashDot is probably the best-known technology-specific blog. Table 1 lists a few other topic-centric blogs. There are two basic blog styles: filters and journals. The filter style focuses on a collection of links to other Web sites. The journal style is an online personal diary with dated entries presented in a """" stream of consciousness. """" Both styles use headlines and ex-cerpts—putting the most recent entry at the top of the Web page—to entice readers to investigate further. Blogging systems are emerging tools that make it easier to set up a blog; to update, distribute, and archive its information; and to enhance its func-tionality. Historically, the Internet has followed the separation of consumer and producer roles perpetuated in the mass media. According to this model, content consumers needed minimal skills and resources, while producers required production expertise and sophisticated tools to control content presentation and substance. The blogosphere has expanded the roles of both consumers and producers. Consumers can subscribe to any blogs that interest them simply by linking to them through a syndication protocol that automatically updates content. Consumers can customize their subscriptions for both format and content. They can also produce content by augmenting existing articles with their own comments through templates that blog-ging systems provide. Blog administrators define and control the processes for posting blog content on their sites. Blogging systems provide an array of tools and templates for administering the site. Site administrators can restrict content production on a per-user basis. Producing relevant, navigable Web content requires technical and artistic capabilities that are beyond the expertise of most Web users, who …"""	archive;blog;blogosphere;consciousness;gnu variants;internet;slashdot;the filter;web content;web page;web syndication;world wide web	Charlie Lindahl;Elise Blount	2003	IEEE Computer	10.1109/MC.2003.1244542	web service;web development;web mapping;web standards;computer science;web navigation;web page;multimedia;internet privacy;electronic publishing;web 2.0;world wide web	Web+IR	-45.89055745480895	-24.369499947580678	6788

Advanced rendering systems are rife with long command lines and parameters for tuning the sample densities, thresholds and other algorithm-specific variables, and the novice user is quickly lost in a sea of possibilities. This paper details a successful effort of making one such global illumination system usable by people who understand their problems, even if they do not understand the methods needed to solve them, through an assisted oracle approach. A single program is introduced to map a small set of intuitive control variables to the rendering commands and parameter settings needed to produce the desired output in a reasonable time. This new executive program then serves as the basis for a graphical user interface that is both friendly in its appearance and reliable in its performance. Finally, we conclude with some future directions for improving this interface.	algorithm;global illumination;glossary of computer graphics;graphical user interface;rife;sampling (signal processing)	Gregory J.

This particular column reflects my general thinking about this department, both in terms of the kinds of technologies I intend to visit in future issues and in terms of the way I intend to discuss those technologies. I considered making this department a forum for philosophical discussion about where software is going: mobility, distributed computing, patterns, components, you name it. I thought about covering anything that amounts to an attempt to work around the complexity of software design. But I also considered defining the column with a theme: the diversity of ideas coming down the pipeline. Analysis by a variety of columnists will expose readers to technologies that they wouldn’t typically see at work, except maybe three, six, or even eight years from now. My goal is similar to the goal of editors everywhere: to offer compelling editorial that entertains while informing. I’ll give you some essential information and I’ll present you with technologies that you otherwise might have missed. In Software Technologies, we will explore everything from the mainstream to the marginal. Whether it’s something just now coming out of the research labs or something that’s already on the market, this department will keep you up to date about beneath-the-surface developments affecting the future of software technology. SOFTWARE PRACTICES This department will continue in the spirit of Bertrand Meyer’s column by looking at components and objects; but it will also look at practical technologies that are on the verge of becoming widely accepted.

It has as its main goal to provide tools for geographical knowledge building and exploration, by providing conventional spatial information plus geographical interpretation and appreciation artifacts. These artifacts are delivered in an interactive multimedia environment. This research examines the formulation of an initial prototype component to assist in providing geographical knowledge. The prototype is based on a study site in Townsville, Australia, and is being used as a vehicle to explore enhanced spatial information provision through the use of rich media. The research examines new ways to prospect for, discover and disseminate spatial knowledge within an intelligence-briefing context. The paper reports on the concepts behind the design of the application developed for the test site, and presents initial findings from the early evaluation of the prototype.	adobe dreamweaver;adobe flash;adobe photoshop;blackwell (series);compiler;geographic information system;html;interactive media;jess;new media;prototype;swish max;what if;while	William E.

The degrees of freedom of a crowd is much higher than that provided by a standard user input device. As a result most crowd control systems require the user to design the crowd movements through multiple passes, such as first specifying the crowd's start and goal points, then providing the agent trajectories with streamlines. Such a multi-pass control would spoil the responsiveness and excitement of real-time games. In this paper, we propose a new, single-pass algorithm to control crowds using a deformable mesh. When controlling crowds, we observe that most of the low level details are related to passive interactions between the crowd and the environment, such as obstacle avoidance and diverging/merging at cross points. Therefore, we simplify the crowd control problem by representing the crowd with a deformable mesh that passively reacts to the environment. As a result, the user can focus on high level control that is more important for context delivery. Our algorithm provides an efficient crowd control framework while maintaining the quality of the simulation, which is useful for real-time applications such as strategy games.	algorithm;console game;control system;high-level programming language;input device;interaction;obstacle avoidance;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;responsiveness;simulation	Joseph Henry;Hubert P.

Computational and developmental evidence suggest that such inferences are enabled by a principle of rational action: the expectation that agents act efficiently, within situational constraints, to achieve their goals. Here we propose that the expectation of rational action is instantiated by a naïve utility calculus sensitive to both agent-constant and agent-specific aspects of costs and rewards associated with actions. In four experiments, we show that, given an agent's choices, children (range: 5-6 year olds; N=96) can infer unobservable aspects of costs (differences in agents' competence) from information about subjective differences in rewards (differences in agents' preferences) and vice versa. Moreover, children can design informative experiments on both objects and agents to infer unobservable constraints on agents' actions.	calculi;choice behavior;computation;experiment;financial cost;humans;inference;information;mental state;naivety;rewards;desire	Julian Jara-Ettinger;Hyowon Gweon;Joshua B.

AR is a relatively new field and seeks applications in a wide range of areas from medicine to industry. Applying AR with mobile computing, we present a new method for information access in industrial environments. We, in this paper, present a framework that is applicable to different scenarios in larger industrial settings for spatial data access, navigation, and image augmentation in realtime. In the core of our framework lies a mobile computer equipped with a camera. The camera observes the environment for visual coded markers. These markers are registered to a global coordinate system through available drawings or floor plans. The tracker software processes images coming from the camera at moderate frame rates (typically 12fps) and estimates the location of the user. The system then can guide the user through the environment, provide the user with location relevant data from a spatial database, and augment the view of the user through the camera. Data exchange is done via a wireless network and the user interface allows the user to access various types of data without considerable effort.	augmented reality;data access;information access;mobile computing;music tracker;real-time computing;real-time data;spatial database;user interface	Xiang Zhang;Yakup Genc;Nassir Navab	2001	ETFA 2001. 8th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

The resulting archives of both the content and the context of the interactions contain valuable information that is often not available elsewhere, and can be helpful for the development of novel ranking algorithms, and natural language processing, text mining, and information retrieval techniques. We review machine learning techniques for modeling CGC, focusing on tasks such as learning to estimate content quality, relevance, and searcher intent and satisfaction with the retrieved results. We describe how this information can be incorporated into learning-based ranking methods for searching social media, and how CGC could be used to improve performance on key text mining and search tasks.	algorithm;archive;information access;information ecology;information retrieval;information seeking;interaction;machine learning;natural language processing;relevance;social media;text mining;user-generated content;web search engine	Eugene Agichtein;Evgeniy Gabrilovich;Hongyuan Zha	2009	IEEE Data Eng.

Recent work suggests people have imperfect understanding of system outputs, often assuming sophisticated capabilities and deferring to feedback. We explore how people construe algorithmic interpretations of emotional data in personal informatics systems. A survey (n=188) showed strong interest in automatic stress and emotion tracking, but many respondents expected these systems to provide objective measurements for their emotional experiences. A second study examined how algorithmic sensor feedback influences emotional self-judgments, by comparing three system framings of physiological ElectroDermal Activity data (EDA): Positive (""""alert and engaged""""), Negative (""""stressed""""), and Control (no frame) in a mixed-methods study with 64 participants. Despite users reporting strategies to test system outputs, users still deferred to feedback and their perceived emotions were significantly influenced by feedback frames. Some users overrode personal judgments, believing the system had access to privileged information about their emotions. Based on these findings, we explore design implications for personal informatics including risks of users trusting systems that seemingly """"unlock"""" hidden aspects of the self. We propose design approaches that provide opportunities for future emotion-monitoring systems to exploit these framing effects, and for users to more actively construe emotional states."""	algorithm;feedback;framing (world wide web);informatics;quantified self;sim lock;sensor;trust (emotion)	Victoria Hollis;Zden&#x011B;k Kehl;Adrien Beauveil;Steve Whittaker	2018	IMWUT	10.1145/3264924	self;framing (construction);cognitive psychology;framing effect;affective computing;exploit;informatics;emotion perception;imperfect;psychology	HCI	-60.871602012428475	-43.33700192500299	6929

Unstructured documents have different internal encodings, one of the most diffused encoding is the visualization-oriented Adobe portable document format (PDF). Although several sophisticated and indeed complex approaches were proposed, they are still limited in many aspects. In particular, existing information extraction systems cannot be applied to PDF documents because of their completely unstructured nature that pose many issues in defining IE approaches. In this paper the novel ontology-based system named XONTO, that allows the semantic extraction of information from PDF documents, is presented. The XONTO system is founded on the idea of self-describing ontologies in which objects and classes can be equipped by a set of rules named descriptors. These rules represent patterns that allow to automatically recognize and extract ontology objects contained in PDF documents also when information is arranged in tabular form. This way a selfdescribing ontology expresses the semantic of the information to extract and the rules that, in turn, populate itself. In the paper XONTO system behaviors and structure are sketched by means of a running example.	attribute grammar;information extraction;information management;ontology (information science);parsing;population;portable document format;programming paradigm;self-documenting code;semantic web;table (information);upper ontology;web ontology language;web standards	Ermelinda Oro;Massimo Ruffolo;Domenico Saccà	2009	International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools	10.1142/S0218213009000354	natural language processing;knowledge representation and reasoning;relationship extraction;augmented transition network;computer science;ontology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;attribute grammar;information extraction;information retrieval	AI	-38.98105294961727	3.3367831584851073	6945

To design an accessible lifelogging application for older users we firstly need to explore what lifelogging features the application should include. We carried out a questionnaire study to investigate what lifelogging items people from different age groups are currently collecting. Also of interest to us was what items the participants would like to collect and the differences in lifelogging choices between age groups. The results from this questionnaire will contribute to the design of a lifelogging application which focuses on older users' preferences, motivations and abilities.	computer memory;experience;lifelog	Niamh Caprani;Cathal Gurrin;Noel E.

My motivation was both practical and theoretical. On the practical side, I argued, our long-term goal should be an integrated analysis/planning/retrieval system that matches as closely as possible the way a lawyer actually thinks about a legal problem. On the theoretical side, my work with Sridharan on the TAXMAN project [31, 32, 441 had clarified the importance of an adequate domain theory in any attempt to model the arguments of lawyers in hard cases, For both purposes, I claimed, deep conceptual models are essential.	domain theory;information system	L.

The era of big data, however, has been posing challenges on existing information systems in general and on similarity search in particular. Aiming at large-scale data processing, we propose an adaptive similarity search in massive datasets with MapReduce. Additionally, our proposed scheme is both applicable and adaptable to popular similarity search cases such as pairwise similarity, search-by-example, range queries, and k-Nearest Neighbour queries. Moreover, we embed our collaborative refinements to effectively minimize irrelevant data objects as well as unnecessary computations. Furthermore, we experience our proposed methods with the two different document models known as shingles and terms. Last but not least, we conduct intensive empirical experiments not only to verify these methods themselves but also to compare them with a previous related work on real datasets. The results, after all, confirm the effectiveness of our proposed methods and show that they outperform the previous work in terms of query processing.	similarity search	Trong Nhan Phan;Josef Küng;Tran Khanh Dang	2016	Trans.

Emerging projector phones could overcome this bottleneck with their capability to project a separated interface onto nearly any kind of surface. But still the problem exists of how to control this projection. In this paper we present and evaluate a one-handed interaction paradigm for projector phones that allows accessing the full phone capabilities during a phone call, such as apps and personal information management tools. This interaction paradigm is robust and easy to implement. In a user study we evaluate one possible implementation of the proposed paradigm.	email;headset (audio);interaction technique;joystick;mathematical optimization;mobile device;personal information management;pointing stick;programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);touchpad;usability testing;user interface;video projector	Markus Löchtefeld;Antonio Krüger	2013			embedded system;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.93471699946602	-40.950940424014206	6977

9f2fb938054b37495396505fe5d1f71801ea7294	sound and music computing meets philosophy		Philosophy was born in Greece: it raised fundamental questions, some of which were revived since 1957, when it became possible to compute sound and music. All material substances are made of atoms: modularity is at work in chemistry, linguistics, but also in music. Sounds can be synthesized from other sounds, but one cannot exhibit genuine atoms of sound. The question of simple versus multiple is crucial: as Chowning demonstrated, a mix of sound components can be heard as a single sonic entity or as a multiplicity of sounds. Sounds have objective reality, but auditory illusions demonstrate the idiosyncrasies of perception and remind us of Protagoras’ claim that “of all things the measure is man”. Chaos was present in the views of Anaxagoras. Pythagoras – echoed by Leibniz insisted that numbers rule the world, including musical harmony, whereas Aristoxenus argued that the justification of music is in the ear of the listener rather in a mathematical rationale. Sound and music computation follows Pythagoras, but the importance of aural perception supports the motto of Aristoxenus. Myths like the New Atlantis and the Nietzschean distinction between apollinian and dyonisiac are still with us. Sound and music computing is still an Odyssey.	computation;design rationale;modularity (networks);sound and music computing	Jean-Claude Risset	2014			auditory illusion;musical;harmony (color);perception;music psychology;humanities;objectivity (philosophy);mythology;modularity;art	PL	-55.18833477140307	-23.231181289037277	7037

Given a hierarchy of newly-published news articles, news groups that the user might prefer are differentiated using the long-term profile, and then in each selected news group, a list of news items are chosen based on the short-term user profile. Extensive empirical experiments on a collection of news articles obtained from various popular news websites demonstrate the efficacy of our method.	experiment;personalization;recommender system;user profile;world news (wn) network	Lei Li;Li Zheng;Tao Li	2011		10.1145/2043932.2043992	computer science;machine learning;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;recommender system;news aggregator	Web+IR	-24.581839199698248	-46.94360654776912	7044

However, vast amounts of data also exist in non-standard or ad hoc data formats, which often lack standard or extensible tools. This deficiency forces data analysts to implement their own tools for parsing, querying, and analyzing their ad hoc data. The resulting tools typically interleave parsing, querying, and analysis, obscuring the semantics of the data format and making it nearly impossible for others to resuse the tools. This proposal describes PADS, an end-to-end system for processing ad hoc data sources. The core of PADS is a declarative language for describing ad hoc data sources and a data-description compiler that produces customizable libraries for parsing the ad hoc data. A suite of tools built around this core includes statistical data-profiling tools, a query engine that permits viewing ad hoc sources as XML and for querying them with XQuery, and an interactive front-end that helps users produce PADS descriptions quickly."""	angular defect;compiler;declarative programming;end system;end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);library (computing);parsing;xml;xquery	Mark Daly;Yitzhak Mandelbaum;David Walker;Mary F.

ba1d47430ac6932e2598973779736705dbe9d815	imprecision and uncertainty in information representation and processing - new tools based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets and generalized nets		The book offers a comprehensive and timely overview of advanced mathematical tools for both uncertainty analysis and modeling of parallel processes, with a special emphasis on intuitionistic fuzzy sets and generalized nets. The different chapters, written by active researchers in their respective areas, are structured to provide a coherent picture of this interdisciplinary yet still evolving field of science. They describe key tools and give practical insights into and research perspectives on the use of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets and logic, and generalized nets for describing and dealing with uncertainty in different areas of science, technology and business, in a single, to date unique book. Here, readers find theoretical chapters, dealing with intuitionistic fuzzy operators, membership functions and algorithms, among other topics, as well as application-oriented chapters, reporting on the implementation of methods and relevant case studies in management science, the IT industry, medicine and/or education. With this book, the editors wish to pay homage to Professor Krassimir Todorov Atanassov for his pioneering work on both generalized nets and intuitionistic fuzzy set.	fuzzy set	Plamen Angelov;⋅ Sotir Sotirov;Sotir Sotirov;Krassimir T.

In this paper we show how the problem of reasoning under bounded resources can be recast as a planning problem. Focusing on propositional reasoning, we propose different recasting styles, which are equally interesting, since they require solving different classes of planning problems, and allow representing different reasoner architectures. We implement our approach by automatically encoding problems for the MBP planner. Our experimental results demonstrate that even simple problems can give rise to non-trivial (and often counter intuitive) time and memory saving strategies.	anytime algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;compiler;computation;computational resource;distributed multi-agent reasoning system;experiment;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;memory address;million book project;natural deduction;norm (social);paradigm;rationality;requirement;resource exhaustion attack;scalability;semantic reasoner;software agent	Alexandre Albore;Natasha Alechina;Piergiorgio Bertoli;Chiara Ghidini;Brian Logan	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-02734-5_6	qualitative reasoning;computer science;artificial intelligence;social psychology;algorithm	AI	-19.595891787696264	-5.449062354734266	7103

Nevertheless, it was a moderate success and served as a basic reference for many developers in the industry for at least 10 years after its publication.

The citizen, assisted by a personal tool (Chappie), is responsible to gather all the information required by the service he wants to apply to, possibly from services of other providers. In this paper we discuss how life event e-government services are provided in CHAPAS, from the point of view of the interactions of Chappie with services. The immediate advantage of this approach is that services do not need to directly interact with each other to provide complex life event services, thereby citizens having full control of the flow of their personal information.	chappie;e-government;interaction;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;pa-risc;personally identifiable information	Helder Gomes;André Zúquete;Gonçalo Paiva Dias	2012			world wide web;computer science	HCI	-60.342067053877756	1.7255204851468455	7107

Many apps have been developed to turn a smart phone into a handy video magnifier using digital zoom. As digital zoom normally cannot provide sufficient magnification for distant objects, optical telescopic devices attached to the smart phone cameras can be used to increase magnification power. However, image jitter of hand held phone cameras is greatly enlarged too, and can impair patients' reading efficiency, especially for distant objects. Gyro-sensor based stabilization methods are not effective for this application due to the limited precision of the gyro-sensor in common mobile devices. We have implemented an image motion based video stabilization method on iOS that is more sensitive than the gyro-sensor. The image motion based stabilization not only appeared to be able to remove most of the image jitter visually, it also improved the performance of human subjects, including 2 visually impaired, at discerning distant details.	digital zoom;gyro;gyroscope;handy board;mobile device;smartphone;turned a;ios	Zewen Li;Shrinivas J.

Because domain closedness conditions play an important role in much of rational choice theory, we examine the consequences of these requirements on the logical relationships among different versions of rationalizability. It turns out that closedness under intersection does not lead to any results differing from those obtained on arbitrary domains. In contrast, closedness under union allows us to prove an additional implication.

We clarify the difference between GS and SNS and give the corresponding abstract models. Different SNS have different sorts of abilities of facilitating the social activities, so we propose a concept 'degree of sociability (DoS)' as a key attribute of SNS to depict such differences. On account that a user's daily behaviour sequence is intertwined by the usage of various GS and SNS, we import SNS into traditional service processes and to form a novel socialised service process (SSP) model that has the ability of satisfying users' functional and social needs simultaneously. Criteria for selecting SNS in terms of a user's social needs are briefly summarised. A real-world case study is conducted to validate this research.	social network	Zhongjie Wang;Xiaofei Xu	2016	IJES	10.1504/IJES.2016.076104	social science;computer science;management;world wide web;computer security;social network	ECom	-22.357889670615638	-44.40021094255887	7150

694701c790ca86a45c1c0a96eb9f0b3b7ae1cff5	high-frequency trading, computational speed and profitability: insights from an ecological modelling		High-frequency traders (HFTs) account for a considerable component of equity trading but we know little about the source of their trading profits and how those are affected by such attributes as ultra- low latency or news processing power. Given a fairly modest amount of empirical evidence on the subject, we study the relation between the com- putational speed and HFTs' profits through an experimental artificial agent-based equity market. Our approach relies on an ecological mod- elling inspired from the r/K selection theory, and is designed to assess the relative financial performance of two classes of aggressive HFT agents endowed with dissimilar computational capabilities. We use a discrete- event news simulation system to capture the information processing dis- parity and order transfer delay, and simulate the dynamics of the market at a millisecond level. Through Monte Carlo simulation we obtain in our empirical setting robust estimates of the expected outcome.	computation;high-frequency trading	Alexandru Stan	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39426-8_1	financial economics;simulation;economics;artificial intelligence;marketing;operations management;management	NLP	-6.376222667666399	-9.47382328207237	7164

bab2ef6eaa0e7ebad87c61ee20e394488e11e8c9	foreword: special section on performance evaluation methodologies	performance evaluation	This special section contains a selection of three papers whose original versions were presented at the Valuetools conference, held in Pisa, Italy, from October 20 to 22, 2009. All three papers have gone through a new and complete reviewing process. They were thoroughly reworked, enlarged, and improved with respect to the conference versions. The three papers of the section provide an overview of various mathematical models of stochastic discrete event systems. The paper by M. Draief and A. Ganesh studies the spread of an infection on a graph, and the effect of the graph topology on the speed of contamination. The paper by R. Jain, S. Juneja, and N. Shimkin tackles a specific optimisation problem based on a queueing model in which customers can choose their arrival time. Finally, N. Gast and B. Gaujal propose a framework to study the asymptotic limit of large Markov decision processes. The second paper received the Best Paper Award of the Valuetools conference, and the third one received the Best Student Paper Award. The aim of the Valuetools conference is to gather researchers from various communities working on performance evaluation and tools. The conference in Pisa was the fourth of the Valuetools conferences. Precisely 70 papers were submitted, and 27 of them were selected for presentation at the conference. The 8 best papers were selected for possible publication in two journals: Discrete Event Dynamic Systems and Performance Evaluation. I thankfully acknowledge the help of the sponsors of Valuetools: ICST/Createnet, ACM, ACM Sigmetrics, the Society for Modelling and Simulation International, and MIMOS (Movimento Italiano Modellazione e Simulazione). I am grateful to all the reviewers for their time, effort and useful suggestions. And last but not least, my special thanks go to the members of the Steering and Organizing Committees, and in particular to Giovanni Stea, the very efficient Conference General Chair.	asymptote;goto;graph (discrete mathematics);institute for computer sciences, social informatics and telecommunications engineering;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;organizing (structure);performance evaluation;queueing theory;simulation;time of arrival;topological graph theory	Jean Mairesse	2011	Discrete Event Dynamic Systems	10.1007/s10626-010-0098-z	computer science;mathematics	EDA	-57.638094017183874	-15.55165499500381	7181

Mobile information and navigation aids can assist travellers  in non-trivial navigation and orientation tasks in unknown geographical regions or transport systems. Whereas car navigation  has reached a certain level of maturity, assistance for multimodal travellers especially in public transport networks is still  in its infancies. Integration of mobile multimodal journey planning and navigation and guidance in complex public interchange  facilities is not adequately addressed by existing systems. Thus, in this paper we propose a personal travel companion on  Smartphones for assisting multimodal travellers. We focus on the topics mobile journey planning, pedestrian route calculation,  navigation and guidance in public interchange buildings and seamless transition between indoor and outdoor positioning. Moreover  the paper describes the prototypical implementation on Off-the-shelf Smartphones and evaluation results.  	smartphone	Karl Rehrl;Nicolas Göll;Sven Leitinger;Stefan Bruntsch;Hans-Jörg Mentz	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-36728-4_37	geography;telecommunications;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-50.16154915407296	-41.661573408079256	7190

Previous work has identified the benefits of LHRDs for Visual Analytics tasks, where the user is analyzing complex data sets. However, LHRDs are fundamentally different from desktop and mobile computing environments, presenting some unique usability challenges and opportunities, and need to be better understood. There is thus a need for additional studies to analyze the impact of LHRD size and display resolution on content spatialization strategies and Visual Analytics task performance. We present the results of two studies of the effects of physical display size and resolution on analytical task successes and also analyze how participants spatially cluster visual content in different display conditions. Overall, we found that navigation technique preferences differ significantly among users, that the wide range of observed spatialization types suggest several different analysis techniques are adopted, and that display size affects clustering task performance whereas display resolution does not.

A variety of multiscale visualization techniques provide solutions to handle and depict data at different scales. Yet the mere existence of multiple scales does not necessarily imply the existence of additional information on each of them: Data on a more fine-grained scale may not always yield new details, but instead reflect the already known data from more coarse-grained scales - just at a higher resolution. Nevertheless, to be sure of this, all scales have to be explored. We address this issue by guiding the exploration of simulation trajectories according to information about the deviation of the data between subsequent scales. For this purpose, we apply different dissimilarity measures to the simulation data at subsequent scales to automatically discern heterogeneous regions that exhibit deviating behavior on more fine-grained scales. We mark these regions and display them alongside the actual data in a multiscale visualization. By doing so, our approach provides valuable visual cues on whether it is worthwhile to drill-down further into the multi-scale data and if so, where additional information can be expected. Our approach is demonstrated by an exploratory walk-through of stochastic simulation results of a biochemical reaction network.	adjacency matrix;approximation;data drilling;data visualization;experiment;high-throughput computing;image resolution;interpolation;parallel coordinates;scientific visualization;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;systems biology;throughput;treemapping	Martin Luboschik;Carsten Maus;Hans-Jörg Schulz;Heidrun Schumann;Adelinde M.

0ee3bc198b497eee457aaea69145c60b7cc7f881	an evidential clustering based framework for cyber terrorist cells topology identification		Nowadays, social networks media are heavily used by cyber terrorist organizations to exchange information, and manage their malicious activities. Effective approaches to understand cyber terrorist organizations structures, working strategies, and operation tactics are required to develop security solutions to prevent their activities. Usually, a terrorist organization includes several sub-groups sharing common proprieties. However, the subgroups may differ in their degree of activities and roles. Hence, understating the topology of a terrorist organization and its operations methods is important to develop efficient prevention solutions. In this paper, we discuss the foundation of an approach for detecting cyber terrorist subgroups, as well as its evaluation and efficiency using data on cyber terrorist groups. The approach is based on an evidential clustering method. In fact, objects (known also as network members) within a cyber terrorist group can be classified into various sub-classes, such as military, finance and local leaders committees. Belief functions are used to describe the membership of nodes to clusters (sub-communities). The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a set of clustering results, regarding the classification of cyber terrorist actors and the allocation of the appropriate degree to each member of a given class. Experimental results show the efficiency and the accuracy of our CECM based approach not only in classifying cyber terrorist actors into the aforementioned communities, but also in allocating a degree of membership for each member to each sub-class.	cluster analysis;cyber spying;malware;sensor;social network	Firas Saidi;Zouheir Trabelsi;Henda Ben Ghazela	2018	2018 17th IEEE International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications/ 12th IEEE International Conference On Big Data Science And Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE)	10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00070	terrorism;cluster analysis;social network;computer science;topology	DB	-51.65209721535622	3.91675289513033	7264

15a1aad7ba72815559658f571011a349146fee6b	discovering the foundations of a universal system of ethics as a road to safe artificial intelligence		Intelligent machines are a risk to our freedom and our existence unless we take adequate precautions. In order to survive and thrive, we are going to have to teach them how to be nice to us and why they should do so. The fact that humans have evolved to have what appear to be multiple different systems of ethics and morality that frequently conflict on any but the simplest issues complicates this task. Most people have interpreted these conflicts, caused by the fact that each of the systems is incompletely evolved and incorrectly universalized, to mean that no reasonably simple foundation exists for the determination of the correctness or morality of any given action. This paper will solve this problem by defining a universal foundation for ethics that is an attractor in the state space of intelligent behavior, giving an initial set of definitions necessary for a universal system of ethics and proposing a collaborative approach to developing an ethical system that is safe and extensible, immediately applicable to human affairs in preparation for an ethical artificial intelligence (AI), and has the side benefit of actually helping to determine the internal knowledge representation of humans as a step towards AI.	artificial intelligence;correctness (computer science);knowledge representation and reasoning;state space	Mark R.

This is yet another book on PHP, but reading it will bring a number of pleasant surprises for many readers. From the beginning, it’s clear that the book is not targeted at beginners. You need a good knowledge of both PHP and Web development in general to read and understand it. That said, author Matt Zandstra has done a great job of writing far more than just a PHP manual. Developing in PHP can be extremely fast, often at the expense of the maintainability and security of the code developed. The first part of the book focuses on objectoriented programming, providing readers with a good overview of how to stay away from jigsaw PHP development and use object-oriented programming effectively. The second part of the book is not a light read; it digs deeply into software engineering concepts that are often left aside in PHP books. This is one of the more theoretical sections of the book. While it often fails to be readable enough, it can be helpful if PHP is one of the first programming languages you studied. The third and final part of the book is focused on practice. It discusses PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository), documenting the code, versioning, testing, and building. It’s quite focused on PHP-specific tools rather than on more general tools; the reader will have to decide whether this is a downside or an advantage. This book will give readers an opportunity to become more familiar with the advanced aspects of PHP, look at software engineering methods for Web development, and get a feel for tools that are, or at least should be, well known to experienced developers. —Andres Baravalle	human-readable medium;international standard book number;pear;php;programming language;software documentation;software engineering;version control;web development;yet another	Matt Zandstra;Robert Martin	1952		10.1145/1515964.1555744		SE	-62.58460721682829	-23.085320474099	7324

54efa01e0e882eff626031feed43979f4d62787e	the ‘alice in wonderland’ mechanics of the rejection of (climate) science: simulating coherence by conspiracism	conspiratorial thinking;climate science denial;coherence in science;coherence;global warming;conspiracy;rationality;consistency	Science strives for coherence. For example, the findings from climate science form a highly coherent body of knowledge that is supported by many independent lines of evidence: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human economic activities are causing the global climate to warm and unless GHG emissions are drastically reduced in the near future, the risks from climate change will continue to grow and major adverse consequences will become unavoidable. People who oppose this scientific body of knowledge because the implications of cutting GHG emissions—such as regulation or increased taxation—threaten their worldview or livelihood cannot provide an alternative view that is coherent by the standards of conventional scientific thinking. Instead, we suggest that people who reject the fact that the Earth’s climate is changing due to greenhouse gas emissions (or any other body of well-established scientific knowledge) oppose whatever inconvenient finding they are confronting in piece-meal fashion, rather than systematically, and without considering the implications of this rejection to the rest of the relevant scientific theory and findings. Hence, claims that the globe “is cooling” can coexist with claims that the “observed warming is natural” and that “the human influence does not matter because warming is good for us.” Coherence between these mutually contradictory opinions can only be achieved at a highly abstract level, namely that “something must be wrong” with the scientific evidence in order to justify a political position against climate change mitigation. This high-level coherence accompanied by contradictory subordinate propositions is a known attribute of conspiracist ideation, and conspiracism may be implicated when people reject well-established scientific propositions.	coexist (image);coherence (physics);computer cooling;domain of discourse;high- and low-level;rejection sampling;simulation;the australian	Stephan Lewandowsky;John Cook;Elisabeth A.

The proposed system provides users with annotation information from a server via a wireless network so that the wearable computers do not need to hold it in advance and information providers can easily update and add the database with a web browser. In experiments, the user's position-based annotations have been proven to be shown to the user effectively.	augmented reality	Koji Makita;Masayuki Kanbara;Naokazu Yokoya	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30543-9_63	augmented reality;computer-mediated reality;wearable computer;computer science;operating system;wireless network;database;multimedia;world wide web	Visualization	-43.03337912410955	-35.99840069060005	7376

This paper proposes an estimation method of driver's mental workload using physiological information. We defined mental workload as NASA-TLX score, and used the multiple linear regression to quantify driver's mental workload. As a result, higher accuracy was achieved by considering driver's aggression.	device driver;driving simulator;heart rate variability;mental state;simulation	Eiji Kawakita;Michimasa Itoh;Koji Oguri	2010	13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625079	simulation;engineering;forensic engineering;computer security	Robotics	-19.001463779926066	-26.895692197673142	7380

While influence maximization has been extensively studied as the fundamental solution, it neglects the reality that a user may purchase a product/service repeatedly, incurring cumulative sales of the product/service. In this paper, we explore a new problem of cumulative influence maximization that brings the influence maximization a step closer to real-world viral marketing applications. In our problem setting, repeated activation exists and we aim to find a set of initial users, through which the maximal cumulative influence can be stimulated in a given time period. To describe the repeated activation behavior, we adopt the voter model to reflect the variation of activations over time. Under the voter model, we formulate the maximization problem and present an effective algorithm. We test and compare our method with heuristic algorithms on real-world data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.	cobham's thesis;entropy maximization;exact algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;heuristic;maximal set;propagation time;social network;software propagation;voter model	Chuan Zhou;Peng Zhang;Wenyu Zang;Li Guo	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.038	mathematical optimization;mathematics	AI	-16.94612117373824	-43.72367525398067	7400

db5fbcfd25bb0b6b1536e4b24ba863a7eefdf158	elimination based algorithm for link prediction on social networks		Link prediction is a very well studied problem as it has applications in different areas. Many algorithms have been presented in the literature for link prediction problem. The link prediction problem can be explained as follows: given the topology of graph G at a certain time t, we need to predict the topology of the graph at time t0 where t0[ t. The techniques used for link prediction are categorized as follows: nodes based techniques, Link based techniques and path based techniques. There are some other techniques that use meta-approaches. In this paper we present a new algorithm for link prediction on social networks. The algorithm tries to identify nodes that may get deleted by time t0 and use this information to predict new links that might appear in the future. Our tests show that our algorithm shows better result for link prediction on social networks compared to the previous algorithms. We had implemented our algorithm in C# on Pentium Core 2 Duo processor. The data used for testing is Gnutella peer to peer network.	algorithm;categorization;gnutella;peer-to-peer;social network;word lists by frequency	Upasana Sharma;Dolly Sharma;Sunil Kumar Khatri	2015	Int.

In this study, however, we take a step back from such work in order to investigate how regular people may already be employing, or trying to employ, context-awareness in their everyday lives using existing mobile tools (such as mobile phones, paper notepads, etc.). We believe that an understanding of these existing real-world uses and needs of context-awareness will help to better inform and direct research efforts in this domain. Towards this aim we present the findings of a user study in which twelve randomly selected individuals recorded a diary on their use of mobile tools over the period of two days. The findings clearly demonstrate that people do indeed currently employ a wide variety of contexts and context-aware behaviours, albeit in a manner that is often imperfect and at a sub-conscious level.	context awareness	Jason Pascoe;Kirsten Thomson;Helena Rodrigues	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-76888-3_39	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-57.34170558649578	-42.91192280493122	7435

Such systems are typically comprised of plural decisionmakers at each organizational level, each with multiple risk management objectives. In this paper, we propose a Multiobjective Multi-Decisionmaker Resource Allocation (MOMDRA) framework to model this process; we also offer a discussion of risk modeling methods under the MOMDRA framework. Furthermore, using a Hierarchical Multiobjective (HMO) approach, this paper derives strategies for generating Pareto optimal resource allocation options for different cases of decisionmakers. An illustrative example demonstrates the effectiveness of the MOMDRA framework in risk-based modeling and decisionmaking within large-scale hierarchical systems. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

According to the """"modelling view"""" of knowledge acquisition proposed by Clancey, the modeling activity must establish a correspondence between a knowledge base and two separate subsystems: the agent's behavior (i.e. the problem-solving expertize) and its own environment (the problem domain). Current knowledge modelling methodologies tend to focus on the former subsystem only, viewing domain knowledge as strongly dependent on the particular task at hand: in fact, AI researchers seem to have been much more interested in the nature of reasoning rather than in the nature of the real world. Recently, however, the potential value of task-independent knowlege bases (or """"ontologies"""") suitable to large scale integration has been underlined in many ways. In this paper, we compare the dichotomy between reasoning and representation to the philosophical distinction between epistemology and ontology. We introduce the notion of the ontological level, intermediate between the epistemological and the conceptual level discussed by Brachman, as a way to characterize a knowledge representation formalism taking into account the intended meaning of its primitives. We then discuss some formal ontological distinctions which may play an important role for such purpose."""	formal ontology;integrated circuit;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;knowledge engineering;knowledge representation and reasoning;ontology (information science);problem domain;problem solving;semantics (computer science)	Nicola Guarino	1995	Int.

It embodies generic descriptions of cognition in computer algorithms and programs. Social simulation with multi-agent systems can benefit from incorporating cognitive architectures, as they provide a realistic basis for modeling individual agents (as argued in Sun 2001). In this article, an example of a cognitive architecture will be given, and its application to social simulation will be outlined.

Researchers have sought to involve older adults in the design of emerging technologies like smartphones, with which older adults often have little experience. Therefore, their effectiveness as co-designers could be questioned. We examine whether older adults can create novel design ideas, and whether critiquing existing applications prior to ideation helps or hinders creativity. Panelists from industry and academia evaluated design ideas generated by focus groups of older adults. Out of five groups, the most creative design idea came from one with no smartphone experience or critique exposure. We found that while only some designs scored high on the novelty dimension of creativity, participants were enthusiastic about participating and adapted quickly. We found evidence that critiquing existing applications prior to ideation did more harm than good, potentially due to design fixation. We recommend continuing to involve older adults in the technology design ideation phase.	focus group;smartphone	Jennifer L.

Extensive checking of input is performed. The designer has the possibility to restrict the solution space of the design algorithm by prescribing implementation strategies for parts of the binary model. 1. Chalmers University of Technology, S41296 Gothenburg, Sweden 2. University of Stockholm, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden 8. This work has been supported by the National Swedish Board for Technical Development Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Very Large Data Bases Before we can design a data base schema, compatible with some existing Data Base Management System, we have to determine what kind of data it should contain and what kind of work-load, in terms of queries, updates, inserts and deletes it must be able to handle. In order to permit examination of alternative solutions the requirements must be stated in as implementation independent terms as possible. By 'implementation independent' we mean that there have been made no decisions on how to group data items in records, which access techniques to use and how to navigate in a structure of records and sets. Designing a data base is thus only a (relatively small) part of a systems development process. It is preceded by a number of activities the purpose of which is to analyze corporate information needs and to specify the requirements of an information system to be developed. The Interactive Data Base Designer (IDBD) presented in this paper has been developed to be compatible with two kinds of system design (philosophies) approaches. The first kind, the analytical approach, proceeds through development phases like goal and problem analysis activity analysis etc. and arrives at a comprehensive set of requirements specifications. This set also includes a conceptual information model of relevant parts of the enterprise and a set of information requirements [Bub-801. The conceptual information rode1 (CIM) describes and defines relevant phenomena (entities, relations, events, assumptions, inference rules etc.) of the Universe of Discourse (UoD). The CIM models the UoD in an extended time 108 Mexico City, September, 1982 perspective in order to capture dynamic rules and constraints. The next step in this approach is to 'restrict' the CIM (from a time perspective point of view) and to decide what information to store in the data base and how to conceptually navigate in this set of information in order to satisfy stated information requirements (see Gus-82 for a comprehensive exposition of this problem). If the information to be stored in the data base is defined in terms of a binary data model and the conceptual navigations are specified assuming such a model then this is the required input to IDBD. The other approach to data base design is the experimental one. In this case we assume that a 'fast prototype' is developed by the use of the CS4 system [Ber-77A]. CS4 employs a binary data model and is thus compatible with IDBD. Experimental use of the prototype system can provide us with statistics of navigation types and frequencies. It is, of course, also advantageous to use the experimental approach as a complement to the purely analytical one in order to avoid guesswork concerning the requirements and the work-load. The DBTG-schema design algorithm of IDBD has the binary data model and a set of implementation strategies in common with design-aids developed at the University of Michigan [Mit-75, Ber-77B, Pur-791. It differs, however, from them in several important respects the tool is interactive which gives the designer a possibility to monitor the design process comprehensive checking of the consistency of input data is performed (we have empirically found that it is difficult to supply a tool of this kind with correct input the first time; a waste of time and computer resources is the result of optimizing incorrect input) the designer has a possibility to prescribe certain implementation alternatives for parts of the model (or the whole model). This has the following advantages the designer can test his/hers own solution alternatives which may be 'natural' or which have other, preferred, non-quantifyable properties unnormal or *non-sensesolutions can be avoided Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Very Large Data Bases + + the tool can be used to augment an existing DB-schema the solution space can be drastically reduced thereby making IDBD a realistic tool also for design of large, complex data base schemata the description of the work-load is practically realistic as navigation in the conceptual binary model can be defined. This paper describes and explains IDBD in terms of running a small sample case. Section 2 describes the input to IDBD the conceptual binary data model and how to describe the work-load in terms of navigating in the model. User interaction, checking of input and how to supply IDBD with design directives is presented in section 3. The design algorithm and the results of performing a design run are given in section 4.	adobe creative suite;algorithm;binary data;codasyl;complement (complexity);computer-integrated manufacturing;data base task group;data model;database;design tool;domain of discourse;entity;feasible region;information model;information needs;information retrieval;information system;interactive design;management system;problem solving;prototype;requirement;software development process;systems design;vldb	Roland Dahl;Janis A.

At the core of the AHP are various prioritization procedures which elicit priorities for alternative solutions for complex decisional problems. Certainly, the procedures coincide when decision makers’ preferences of alternative solutions are cardinally transitive, otherwise the results differ. This is why consistency measurement of human judgments is so important. It has been scientifically proven that a high inconsistency of decision makers’ preferences concerning alternative solutions of decisional problems may lead to fallacious choices. Research verifies the thesis that consistency measures derived from different prioritization procedures are interrelated. It turns out that one of the independent consistency measures is extremely closely related to the consistency index embedded in original approach of the AHP. The main objective of this study is realized through the novel and sophisticated simulation algorithm designed for the AHP and executed within its exemplary decisional framework for three levels. The outcome of the research proves that consistency can be measured in various ways, but recently devised concepts can indicate better solutions as a result of significantly improved methodology.

Consciousness is self-determination, an aggressive mode, spiritual, which is different from the brain signal. It be decided by the environment, a passive mode, physiological character. The brain signal results in the relevant incident and average stimulation. Consciousness have the psychological offense mechanism. The brain have the psychological defense mechanism. Consciousness can produce the consciousness field in the brain and the solar cell, and it can produce the physical effect in the brain and the solar cell. And the consciousness field can build the relation between the brian and the solar cell, and can get the information from them. And consciousness control the brain signal to act on photoelectric system and change the output signal of the solar cell. The author proposes a new cognitive model, one in which consciousness can change the physical signal which is outside the human's body, a sign of consciousness's evolution. Advanced consciousness is the sign (characteristic) differentiate the human from animal. Mass energy space and time system theory-MEST and the conversion equation between mass-energy and space-time are being put forward, and get new space-time particle equation and mass-energy wave equation. MEST make the Platforms and the interface for signal, information and Arithmetical. Using the MEST theory, which has been never taken into consideration, prepare and handle signals, information and algorithm in order to provide a computing system based on mind, material and information and create a new perception model.	cognitive model;solar cell	Dayong Cao	2008		10.1109/CIMCA.2008.20	cognitive model;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;intelligent control	HCI	-22.367707677688095	-18.77669948740359	7563

In that case one option is to merge the knowledge bases into one knowledge base. It can happen that some of the information contained in one or more knowledge bases may be in conflict with information in the other knowledge bases. There may be several such points of conflict and any information may be involved in several different such points of conflict. In that case, the integrator of the knowledge bases may prefer a certain claim to another in one conflict-point without necessarily preferring that claim in another conflict-point. Our work constructs a framework within which the consequences of a set of such preferences (expressed as priorities among sets of statements) can be computed. We give three types of semantics for priorities, two of which are shown to be equivalent to one another. The third type of semantics for priorities is shown to be more cautious than the other two.

To structure and classify current as well as facilitate and give direction to future research, this methodology proposes a top-down two-dimensional design space. This design space has been developed for exhaustiveness so as to cover all possible design options, existing or yet to be conceived. A comprehensive survey of P2P search systems serves as a reference for the reader while at the same time validating the framework. An identification of areas in the design space not covered by current systems leads to the design of a novel peer-to-peer-based keyword routing scheme. Finally, an evaluation of possible design options along the most important requirement will help guide system designers.	distributed web crawling;high- and low-level;lookup table;middleware;peer-to-peer;requirement;routing;shark;scalability;switzerland;top-down and bottom-up design	Jan Mischke;Burkhard Stiller	2004	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2004.1265831	middleware;computer science;peer-to-peer;top-down and bottom-up design;middleware;database;distributed computing;distributed design patterns;world wide web;computer network;systems design	Networks	-33.802897275114454	2.3514222929099877	7607

Ours is the first platform to make DSGS place name signs accessible in geolocalized form, i.e., by linking them to a map, and to use synthesized signing. The latter mode of display is advantageous over videos of human signers, since place name signs for any sign language are subject to language change. Our web application targets both deaf and hearing DSGS users. The underlying programming code is freely available. The application can be extended to display any kind of geolocalized data in any sign language.	geolocation;switzerland;web application	Anna Jancso;Xi Rao;Johannes Graën;Sarah Ebling	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-41267-2_62	natural language processing;speech recognition;linguistics	HCI	-48.11603124259933	-38.71144401240998	7614

Just as a digital library is based on a general structure and conventional means of access to diverse collections of materials, a community memory will help cull and shape the structure and contents of this collection to meet more particular needs. But it is by no means straightforward for people to collect, maintain, share, and apply the materials that are part of a community memory. Useful and usable community memories require support for: (1) the acquisition and evolution of content and structure; (2) the identification of materials and community members relevant to a particular task; and (3) the maintenance of organizations that are mutually intelligible across the community. In this paper, we explore issues related to these three requirements based on a meta-analysis of our collective experiences with the development and use of shared hypermedia information resources.

73a260c02a9dfad530a0d107428a8f20e6f38c34	anomaly detection in dynamic networks of varying size		ABSTRACT Dynamic networks, also called network streams, are an important data representation that applies to many real-world domains. Many sets of network data such as e-mail networks, social networks, or internet traffic networks are best represented by a dynamic network due to the temporal component of the data. One important application in the domain of dynamic network analysis is anomaly detection. Here the task is to identify points in time where the network exhibits behavior radically different from a typical time, either due to some event (like the failure of machines in a computer network) or a shift in the network properties. This problem is made more difficult by the fluid nature of what is considered ”normal” network behavior. The volume of traffic on a network, for example, can change over the course of a month or even vary based on the time of the day without being considered unusual. Anomaly detection tests using traditional network statistics have difficulty in these scenarios due to their Density Dependence: as the volume of edges changes the value of the statistics changes as well making it difficult to determine if the change in signal is due to the traffic volume or due to some fundamental shift in the behavior of the network. To more accurately detect anomalies in dynamic networks, we introduce the concept of DensityConsistent network statistics. These statistics are designed to produce results that reflect the state of the network independent of the volume of edges. On synthetically generated graphs anomaly detectors using these statistics show a a 20400% improvement in the recall when distinguishing graphs drawn from different distributions. When applied to several real datasets Density-Consistent statistics recover multiple network events which standard statistics failed to find, and the times flagged as anomalies by Density-Consistent statistics have subgraphs with radically different structure from normal time steps.	anomaly detection;clustering coefficient;data (computing);degree distribution;email;graph edit distance;hoc (programming language);most bus;sensor;social network;synthetic intelligence;the times;vertex-transitive graph	Timothy La Fond;Jennifer Neville;Brian Gallagher	2014	CoRR		computer science;dynamic network analysis;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;network simulation;interdependent networks;network delay;statistics	ML	-15.373587704538664	-41.149020915767	7636

Existing methods suffer two problems, 1) The aggregate functions which could be monitored are restricted to be first-order statistic or monotonic with respect to the window size. 2) Only a limited number of granularity and time scales could be monitored over a stream, thus some interesting patterns might be neglected, and users might be misled by the incomplete changing profile about current data streams. These two impede the development of online mining techniques over data streams, and some kind of breakthrough is urged. In this paper, we employed the powerful tool of fractal analysis to enable the monitoring of both monotonic and non-monotonic aggregates on time-changing data streams. The monotony property of aggregate monitoring is revealed and monotonic search space is built to decrease the time overhead for accessing the synopsis from O(m) to O(logm), where m is the number of windows to be monitored. With the help of a novel inverted histogram, the statistical summary is compressed to be fit in limited main memory, so that high aggregates on windows of any length can be detected accurately and efficiently on-line. Theoretical analysis show the space and time complexity bound of this method are relatively low, while experimental results prove the applicability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in different application settings.	aggregate function;algorithm;computer data storage;first-order reduction;fractal analysis;inverted index;microsoft windows;online and offline;overhead (computing);regular expression;time complexity;video synopsis	Shouke Qin;Weining Qian;Aoying Zhou	2006	22nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'06)	10.1109/ICDE.2006.22	time complexity;application software;information engineering;fractal;daylight saving time;fractal analysis;computer science;data science;theoretical computer science;electrical impedance;first-order logic;data mining;database;statistics	DB	-8.0339411149227	-34.995624626981304	7663

We investigate how interactive wearable technology can support expression and communication through laughter as prosocial behaviour within the context of a public art installation. We base our design on psychological research that explores emotional contagions and psychophysiological mirroring. While most of this research has focused primarily on internal biological data, there is little design research that has investigated the phenomenon of emotional contagion in a social space utilizing wearable technology, particularly within HCI. We conducted a mixed methods pilot study, which has indicated that wearable technology can create affordances for emotional mimicry by testing the effectiveness of visual and auditory cues embedded within the wearable design. Our research provides insight to help evaluate effective design strategies in wearable interaction that can ameliorate positive social interaction between people.	disk mirroring;embedded system;human–computer interaction;responsive web design;wearable computer;wearable technology	Sunmin Lee;Wynnie Wing Yi Chung;Emily Ip;Thecla Schiphorst	2014		10.1145/2559206.2581360	mimicry;wearable computer;emotional contagion;perception	HCI	-54.2471321185455	-48.77045047657539	7664

As a result, generated process plans lack flexibility and may not be optimal. This paper proposes a modified fuzzy Petri net, named OPN, to model alternative and optimal operation planning. Operation selection knowledge, which is a basis for operation planning, is formalized in OPN. By solving the T-invariants of OPN, alternative operation plans can be obtained for each feature of a machined part. After the execution of OPN, each alternative operation plan is assigned a numerical value that reflects its confidence degree. Based on alternative operation plans, the final optimal operation plan of each machining feature and the corresponding machine tools can be produced using resource-constrained algorithms.	algebraic equation;algorithm;endeavour (supercomputer);enumerated type;expert system;generative model;knowledge base;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;petri net;planning;prototype;requirement	Rui-Rong Wu;Lin;Joseph Mathew;Guang-Hong Duan	2002	Int.

In our ordinary environment, social robots could be important tools for education and entertainment (edutainment) in a variety of ways. This paper presents a Natural Programming System (NPS) that is geared to non-expert users. The main goal of such a system is to provide an enjoyable interactive platform for the users to build different programs within their social robot platform. The end-user can build a complex net of actions and conditions (a sequence) in a social robot via mixed-initiative dialogs and multimodal interaction. The system has been implemented and tested in Maggie, a real social robot with multiple skills, conceived as a general HRI researching platform. The robot’s internal features (skills) have been implemented to be verbally accessible to the end-user, who can combine them into others more complex following a bottom-up model. The built sequence is internally implemented as a Sequence Function Chart (SFC), which allows parallel execution, modularity and re-use. A multimodal Dialog Manager System (DMS) takes charge of keeping the coherence of the interaction. This work is thought for bringing social robots closer to non-expert users, who can play the game of “teaching how to do things” with the robot.	bottom-up parsing;dialog manager;educational entertainment;end-user development;human–robot interaction;maggie;multimodal interaction;social robot;space-filling curve;usability	Javier F.

Should a principal then compensate an agent based on early but noisy information about performance, or later but more accurate information, or both? To answer this question, I study a two-period model in which a principal can pay a risk-averse agent based on both true output, which is realized with delay, and an early signal of output. The agent can borrow against future income, and can commit to a long-term contract. I show that under very general conditions the optimal wage contract depends on the early signal as well as on output even if the signal is merely a noisy version of output; that is, if the signal is uninformative of effort, given output. Specifically, for given output levels, better signals are on average associated with higher wages. Thus, an important characteristic of any performance measure is the time at which it is generated, which expands the range of signals useful for contracting well beyond that implied by the classic Informativeness Principle. The results also shed light on the use of forward-looking performance measures such as stock returns in managerial incentive contracts.

The tangiBook is based on an off-the-shelf laptop computer that incorporates an accelerometer and a webcam as standard equipment. Custom software allows the orientation of the laptop screen and the position of the observer to be tracked in real-time. Using this information, realistic images of surfaces with complex textures and material properties, illuminated by environment-mapped lighting, are rendered to the screen at interactive rates. Tilting the laptop or moving in front of the screen produces realistic changes in surface lighting and material appearance. Thus the tangiBook allows virtual surfaces to be observed and manipulated as naturally as real ones, with the added benefit that the material properties of the surfaces can be changed in real-time. We demonstrate the potential utility of the tangiBook in three application areas: material perception research, computer-aided appearance design, and enhanced access to collections in digital libraries and museums. With its unique capabilities and commodity roots, the tangiBook can be broadly deployed and should be useful in a wide range of applications. Introduction Advances in computer graphics technology have provided the capabilities for realistic image synthesis, allowing images of virtual objects to be rendered that are indistinguishable from photographs of real-world objects [1]. The ability to create realistic renderings of virtual objects has proven to be valuable in a variety of application domains including the film and game industries, computer-aided design and manufacturing, medical imaging and digital libraries and museums. With standard computer graphics systems, a user is a step removed visually and physically from the virtual objects they are interacting with. The screen acts as a window separating the real and virtual worlds, and the user does not interact directly with the virtual objects, but instead uses indirect means, such as a mouse or keyboard, to manipulate the objects or shift the point of view. Our objective is to remove these barriers between the real and virtual worlds by developing a tangible display system, which we call the tangiBook, that gives users much of the same experience they would have if the virtual object were situated in a real environment (see Figure 1). Instead of providing a view into a virtual world, this system presents the virtual object, situated in the real world, at the physical location of the display. It supports natural interaction with the object, through direct manipulation of the object’s orientation by rotating the display, and dynamic viewpoint changes through observer tracking. The tangiBook is based on an off-the-shelf laptop computer that contains a triaxial accelerometer and a webcam as standard components. Through custom software that integrates these devices, we are able to actively sense the orientation of the laptop display and dynamically track the observer’s viewpoint with camera-based head-tracking. This information is used to drive a physically-based rendering algorithm that generates an accurately oriented and realistically shaded view of a virtual surface to the laptop’s display. The custom rendering system also allows the user to change the material properties of the rendered virtual surface in real-time, a capability that allows the tangiBook to be used in psychophysical experiments and computer-aided appearance design applications. Related Work There has been a strong interest in developing natural interfaces for viewing virtual objects and scenes since Sutherland and colleague’s pioneering work on the design of a see-through 260 ©2009 Society for Imaging Science and Technology head-mounted display (HMD) and 3D input wand in the 1960’s and 1970’s [2, 3]. Significant advances have been made in both display systems [4, 5, 6], and 3D input devices [7, 8, 9] for virtual environments. The focus in these systems is on immersing a user in a virtual world delivered through a HMD. An alternative approach is represented by the CAVE system [10] that surrounds a user with projection screens on which virtual content is displayed. Further innovations in this projection-based approach include the shaderLamps and iLamps systems [11,12, 13] that project pre-warped images on real three-dimensional objects to create physical objects whose appearance can be changed under computer control. Bimber and colleagues have also been early innovators in this area (see [14] for a comprehensive review). A third major approach to bridging real and virtual worlds incorporates spatially aware displays and tangible interfaces. The Chameleon systems [15,16] coupled 6 DOF trackers with computer displays to create spatially aware display systems whose content changes depending on its position and context. The Virtual Mirror system [17] took the spatially aware display concept a step further by incorporating a video camera pointed toward the user holding the display to create the impression of a real mirror. The device also allowed interactive viewing of reflective daguerreotype images [18]. A significant feature of these systems is the capability to grasp and directly manipulate the display to change the viewpoint on the virtual environment. The virtue of tangible interfaces such as these is that affordances of the object (in these cases lifting, tilting, and rotating the display) support rich and natural modes of interaction with the virtual world. System Design Our objective in designing the tangiBook was to create a lowcost-of-entry tangible display system for interacting with virtual surfaces. The tangiBook is based on an off-the-shelf laptop computer (Apple MacBook Pro) that incorporates all the components necessary to create a tangible display system: an LCD display, an accelerometer, and a webcam. The accelerometer is used to estimate the orientation of the display, and the camera provides a means to estimate the observer’s viewing position with computer vision-based head tracking. This information is used within a custom 3D shader to dynamically render a realistically shaded view of the virtual surface to the laptop’s display. By integrating these components in a custom software system, virtual surfaces can be observed and manipulated in the same manner as real surfaces, such that tilting the laptop or moving in front of the screen produces realistic changes in surface appearance. An additional capability is that the material properties of the virtual surface can be changed in real-time. In the following sections we describe the implementation of each of these capabilities.	algorithm;bittorrent tracker;bridging (networking);computer control company;computer graphics;computer keyboard;computer monitor;computer mouse;computer vision;computer-aided design;digital library;direct manipulation interface;experiment;head-mounted display;input device;interaction;lambda lifting;laptop;library (computing);medical imaging;motion capture;point of view (computer hardware company);projection screen;radar tracker;real-time clock;real-time computing;rendering (computer graphics);shader;shading;simulation;situated;software system;virtual reality;virtual world;webcam	Benjamin A.

In order to integrate textual annotations smoothly into the dynamic graphical content of interactive information systems, fast yet high-quality label layout algorithms are required. With the ongoing pervasion of mobile applications these requirements are shifted from workstations to comparatively low-performance mobile devices.

I highlight some of the problems that the four principles of expertise run into, when we try to implement them in concrete contexts of application (e.g. in science committees). I suggest some possible alternatives and adjustments to the principles, arguing in general that the epistemology of expertise should be informed both by case studies and by the literature on the use of experts in science practice.	extrapolation;hume (programming language);numerical analysis;statistical model	Carlo Martini	2013	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-013-0321-1	philosophy;epistemology;management science	HCI	-13.799094943515652	1.7861745280580796	7820

There is no doubt text information existing on our real life conveys meaningful messages. It is obviously necessary to capture text images in any place and time in pervasive computing in order to recognize and keep text information in digital forms. In this background, a new mobile-based Korean character recognition system is designed and implemented which is capable of capturing text images and recognizing Korean characters under PDA devices. The algorithm begins with taking images from PDA client followed by skew correction and normalization of character blocks for matching. Experimental results show the proposed scheme is quite novel and efficient.	personal digital assistant	Seongah Chin;Youngmee Choi;Moonwon Choo	2006		10.1007/11816171_57	computer vision;speech recognition;image processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;algorithm;korean	Robotics	-34.98475411618107	-44.99497379453329	7826

Unmanned Air Vehicles are also demanded commercially because of their advantages in comparison to manned vehicles such as their low manufacturing and operating cost, configuration flexibility depending on customer request, not risking pilot in the difficult missions. Nevertheless, they have still open issues such as integration to the manned flight air space, reliability and airworthiness. Although Civil Unmanned Air Vehicles comprise 3% of the UAV market, it is estimated that they will reach 10% level within the next 5 years. UAV systems with their useful equipment (camera, hyper spectral imager, air data sensors and with similar equipment) have been in use more and more for civil applications: Tracking and monitoring in the event of agriculture / forest / marine pollution / waste / emergency and disaster situations; Mapping for land registry and cadastre; Wildlife and ecologic monitoring; Traffic Monitoring and; Geology and mine researches. They can bring minimal risk and cost advantage to many civil applications, in which it was risky and costly to use manned air vehicles before. When the cost of Unmanned Air Vehicles designed and produced for military service is taken into account, civil market demands lower cost and original products which are suitable for civil applications. Most of civil applications which are mentioned above require UAVs that are able to take off and land on limited runway, and moreover move quickly in the operation region for mobile applications but hover for immobile measurement and tracking when necessary. This points to a hybrid unmanned vehicle concept optimally, namely the Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAVs. At the same time, this system requires an efficient cost solution for applicability / convertibility for different civil applications. It means an Air Vehicle having easily portability of payload depending on application concept and programmability of operation (hover and cruise flight time) specific to the application. The main topic of this project is designing, producing and testing the TURAC VTOL UAV that have the following features : Vertical takeoff and landing, and hovering like helicopter ; High cruise speed and fixed-wing ; Multi-functional and designed for civil purpose ; The project involves two different variants ; The TURAC A variant is a fully electrical platform which includes 2 tilt electric motors in the front, and a fixed electric motor and ducted fan in the rear ; The TURAC B variant uses fuel cells.	adobe air;data acquisition;fan-in;image sensor;mathematical optimization;mobile app;uncrewed vehicle;unmanned aerial vehicle	Ugur Ozdemir;Yucel Orkut Aktas;Aslihan Vuruskan;Yasin Dereli;Ahmed Farabi Tarhan;Karaca Demirbag;Ahmet Erdem;Ganime Duygu Kalaycioglu;Ibrahim Özkol;Gökhan Inalhan	2013	2013 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)	10.1007/s10846-013-9900-0	simulation;aerospace engineering;engineering;aeronautics;control theory	Robotics	-19.848103041919043	-25.20367134126757	7827

Unlike traditional genetic operators that perform syntactic manipulations of programs regardless of their behavior, semantic driven operators promote direct search on the underlying behavioral space. Based on previous work on semantic Genetic Programming and Genetic Morphing, we propose and implement semantic driven crossover and mutation operators for evolutionary art. The experimental results focus on assessing how these operators compare with traditional ones.	evolutionary art;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;genetic programming;morphing	Penousal Machado;João Correia	2014		10.1145/2576768.2598293	evolutionary programming;natural language processing;computational creativity;genetic programming;semantic computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;genetic representation	AI	-27.93347860407556	-25.84032583465835	7830

Besides goal-inference rules, the simulation machinery adapts and combines plan-recognition and generation algorithms.

f2a7a6f1078ddb57986f88e215aa26419b021ca4	predicting human behavior based on web search activity: greek referendum of 2015		The enormous volumes of data generated by web users are the basis of several research activities in a new innovative field of research: online forecasting. Online forecasting is associated with the proper computation of web users’ data with the aim to arrive at accurate predictions of the future in several areas of human socio-economic activity. In this paper an algorithm is applied in order to predict the results of the Greek referendum held in 2015, using as input the data generated by users of the Google search engine. The proposed algorithm allows us to predict the results of the referendum with great accuracy. We strongly believe that due to the high internet penetration, as well as, the high usage of web search engines, the proper analysis of data generated by web search users reveals useful information about people preferences and/or future actions in several areas of human activity.	web search engine	Spyros E.

In order to solve this problem, we are developing an acupuncture training system based on a force feedback device, called Acupuncture Trainer (ACT). We added a new automatic camera functionality, in which the camera position automatically adjusts to the target area of the force feedback device. As a result, the user can easily practice an insertion operation at a fixed position, and the convenience of our system has improved.	force trainer;haptic technology	Meguru Yamashita;Zhiyi Gao;Akio Doi;Hajime Ogawa	2018	2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2018.00083	training system;simulation;distributed computing;computer science;haptic technology;acupuncture;dry needling;trainer	Robotics	-41.80114120413314	-46.44425407244007	7904

The aim of this study is to use a hybrid multi criteria decision making approach that can assist in evaluating a set of hospital web site alternatives. ? This study includes a combined fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods to measure electronic service quality performance. ? Tangibles, responsiveness, reliability, information quality, assurance and empathy are determined as the main criteria for evaluating web based healthcare service quality. ? The proposed approach is used to evaluate the performance of some leading hospitals' web sites in Turkey. ? The electronic service quality instrument developed in this study can be used to monitor and improve the quality of service delivered to customers via internet. Service sector is under pressure to deliver continuing performance and quality improvement while being customer-focused. In recent terms, there exists web based or electronic service quality (e-sq) concept. With the birth of electronic commerce, it has become important to be able to monitor and enhance e-sq. Therefore, this study will examine the e-sq concept and determine the key components of e-sq. The e-sq framework is employed by the aid of service quality (SERVQUAL) methodology as the theoretical instrument. Finally, proposed e-sq framework is illustrated with a web service performance example of healthcare sector in Turkey by using a combined multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology containing fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The work presented in this paper shows the applicability of the e-sq framework in explaining the complexity of aspects observed in the implementation of healthcare services via internet.

de79f595cdc0661d250d444727045ea49a77fa00	mining popular mobility patterns from user gps trajectories		With the development of wireless communications and embedded systems technologies, many smartphones are equipped with a multitude of sensors such as GPS and powerful computational, storage and communication capabilities. By these smartphones, location-based services provide the potentialto understand people's mobility pattern at an unprecedented level. How to discover people's personal mobility patterns is key phase for location-based services to provide high-quality service. Therefore, we focus on mining popular mobility patterns from user GPS trajectories. Firstly, we propose a transform method that transforms a GPS trajectory into a sequence of POI(points of interest) based on the spatial and temporal property of GPS points. Then, we propose a periodic-frequent POI sets mining method to discover the POI sets which are not only occurring frequently, but also appearing periodically. Finally, experimental results show the efficiency and stability of the algorithm.	algorithm;embedded system;global positioning system;location-based service;quality of service;sensor;smartphone	Zhou Fang;Chao Ma;Xizhong Wang;Jiaxing Qu	2016	2016 9th International Conference on Service Science (ICSS)	10.1109/ICSS.2016.33	point of interest;simulation;global positioning system;wireless;assisted gps;distributed computing;personal mobility;geography	Mobile	-17.040248386414056	-35.06803543990974	7932

Yet, little is known about how different cross-device interaction techniques impact group collaboration, including how their impact on independent and joint work that often occurs during group work. In this work, we explore the impact of two XDE data browsing techniques: TOUCH and TILT. Through a mixed-methods study of a collaborative sensemaking task, we show that TOUCH and TILT have distinct impacts on how groups accomplish, and shift between, independent and joint work. Finally, we reflect on these findings and how they can more generally inform the design of XDEs.		Leila Homaeian;Nippun Goyal;James R. Wallace;Stacey D.

fbe5fbffeaca5e785892d027893d1447c461ba36	social-topical affiliations: the interplay between structure and popularity		Information popularity and social relationships are intimately connected. However, measuring the extent to which they affect each other has remained an open question. Because we now have access to rich and large data sets from online social networks, we can begin to quantitatively understand the interplay between them. We examine the interface of two decisive structures forming the backbone of online social media: the graph structure of social networks — who is friends with whom — and the set structure of topical affiliations — who talks about what. In studying this interface, we identify key relationships whereby each of these structures can be understood in terms of the other. The context for our study is Twitter, where we look at the social network of both follower relationships and communication relationships, alongside the affiliations outlined by the hashtags used by people to label their communications. On Twitter, we demonstrate how the hashtags that a user adopts can be used to predict their social relationships, and also how the social relationships between the adopters of a hashtag can be used to predict the future popularity of that hashtag. Importantly, we find that both relationships are driven by highly computationally simple structural determinants. While our analysis focuses on Twitter, we view our analysis of social-topical affiliations as broadly applicable to a host of diverse affiliations, including the movies people watch, the brands people like, or the locations people frequent.	embedded system;hashtag;information;internet backbone;kerrison predictor;linkage (software);recommender system;social media;social network;the movies;user-generated content	Daniel M.

d48055f77b67e9c4a8c494a9158820dd368fe1ca	re-engineering the gis&t body of knowledge	visualization;cyberinfrastructure;semantic web;reference system;ontology	A computational framework is presented for re-engineering the Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge GIS&T BoK. At its core is an ontology that is meant to simplify and extend the original BoK hierarchical structure to better capture relationships existing among concepts. Our approach builds on several key ideas. First is the notion of a knowledge corpus, an aggregate of both the internal cognitive forms of knowledge held by domain actors and the content of external artifacts that are produced and consumed by domain activities. Second is the notion of a reference system within which such artifacts are located and relationships among artifacts can be expressed. Third is the idea that by structuring the GIS&T concepts through the use of semantic web standards for formal ontologies and envisaging it as a reference system for GIS&T artifacts, activities, and actors, a fundamentally different approach to the redesign, content generation, and maintenance of the GIS&T BoK is enabled. This new approach affords replacing the top-down strategies used to generate the original GIS&T BoK, with a bottom-up strategy that combines analytical and participatory components. On the analytical side, computational and visual techniques are used to provide alternative means for accessing BoK content, examining the semantic consistency of current BoK structures, transforming the existing hierarchy into a semantic network, identifying overlaps and gaps in the current BoK, and performing projection of knowledge artifacts onto the BoK to inform its maintenance and update. Participatory approaches to bottom-up restructuring and maintenance of the BoK will support authoring, editing, and validation of concepts using a wiki-like community editing service. The system we describe is deployed as a web service that can be accessed by a range of applications for visualization, analysis, exploration, and contextualization of concepts and their related classes in the new GIS&T Body of Knowledge. The goal is for the new GIS&T BoK2 to evolve into the centerpiece of a cyberinfrastructure ecosystem for the GIS&T domain.	geographic information science and technology body of knowledge	Sean Ahearn;Ilknur Icke;Rajashree Datta;Michael N.

This paper introduces a multimodal stroked-based predictive input for the Chinese language. The proposed method requires users to write only the first few strokes of each character and the system will intelligently infer the intended characters by making use of contextual information. Specifically, a statistical n-gram language model is used. Motivated by the work on Haptic Voice Recognition, this paper also incorporates voice input as an additional modality to further enhance the prediction accuracy. Empirical simulation results show that the predictive handwriting input method with 3 initial strokes outperforms the predictive Pinyin input method. Further improvements can be obtained by considering both the initial stroke order and the corresponding stroke layout. Finally, with voice overlay, the proposed multimodal stroke-based predictive input method achieved more than 85% and 95% 1-best prediction accuracies with 2 and 3 initial strokes respectively.	haptic technology;input method;language model;mobile device;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;n-gram;simulation	Khe Chai Sim	2014	2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)	10.1109/SLT.2014.7078616	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science	HCI	-47.00166259958198	-45.21925040206565	7979

The working memory is modeled as a buffer containing nodes of the long-term memory. Computations are defined as processes in which working memory content is transformed according to rules that are stored in the long-term memory. In this architecture, symbolic and subsymbolic reasoning steps can be combined and resourcebounded computations can be defined ranging from formal proofs to association chains.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);coexist (image);cognitive architecture;computation;haskell;interaction;speculative execution;statistical classification	Claes Strannegård;Rickard von Haugwitz;Johan Wessberg;Christian Balkenius	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39521-5_15	cognitive architecture;computer science;dual process theory;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;computation;distributed computing;algorithm;memory map	AI	-25.780271984140075	-17.269604559831006	7983

The system allows one to draw lines, meshes and particle clouds using a one-hand wand in a virtual room with stereoscopic display. In its more mature state the software will allow for two-handed interaction with new interaction devices. Ten professional artists participated for two days each in a test, performing both given tasks and free artistic sketching. Their experiences were collected through observation and interviews. At this stage, we found that common technical limitations of virtual environments, such as latency and tracking inaccuracy as well as clumsiness of the hardware devices, may considerably hinder handicraft work. On the other hand, every single participant felt that immersion offers new potential for artistic expression and was definitely willing to continue in the second phase of the test later this year.	experience;immersion (virtual reality);stereoscopy;usability;virtual reality	Wille Mäkelä;Markku Reunanen;Tapio Takala	2004		10.1145/1027527.1027649	simulation;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;virtual reality;multimedia;world wide web;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.24385794037682	-37.07957543762011	7993

(Neutrally stable strategies are also known as weakly evolutionarily stable strategies.) Such neutrally, but not evolutionarily stable strategies can however still be relatively stable or unstable, depending on whether or not the neutral mutants it allows for – which by definition do not have a selective advantage themselves – can open doors for other mutants that do have a selective advantage. This paper defines robustness against indirect invasions in order to be able to discern between those two very different situations. Being robust against indirect invasions turns out to be equivalent to being an element of a minimal ES set, where this minimal ES set is the set that consists of this strategy and its (indirect) neutral mutants. This is useful, because we know that ES sets are asymptotically stable in the replicator dynamics.

08e2f3fff0de87d6a911685fd2ec733cb7f52dbe	an artificial stock market with interactions network and mimetic agents		Agent-based artificial stock markets attracted much attention over the last years, and many models have been proposed. However, among them, few models take into account the social interactions and mimicking behaviour of traders, while the economic literature describes investors on financial markets as influenced by decisions of their peers and explains that this mimicking behaviour has a decisive impact on price dynamics and market stability. In this paper we propose a continuous double auction model of financial market, populated by heterogeneous traders who interact through a social network of influence. Traders use different investment strategies, namely: fundamentalists who make a decisions based on the fundamental value of assets; hybrids who are initially fundamentalists, but switch to a speculative strategy when they detect an uptrend in prices; noise traders who don’t have sufficient information to take rational decisions, and finally mimetic traders who imitate the decisions of their mentors on the interactions network. An experimental design is performed to show the feasibility and utility of the proposed model.	agent-based model;design of experiments;dot-com bubble;experiment;interaction;offset binary;population;simulation;social network;speculative execution;traders;volatility	Sadek Benhammada;Frédéric Amblard;Salim Chikhi	2017		10.5220/0006118803900397	artificial intelligence;machine learning;computational economics;computer science;financial market;stock market;intrinsic value (finance);microeconomics;double auction;social network;interaction network;investment strategy	AI	-7.993989075842043	-9.688333652509412	8049

This method possesses various paradoxes as was observed through two centuries of application. So we propose a modification where the seats are allocated at a first stage by the lower Hare-Quota and the additional ones using the method of major fractions (Webster) restricted simultaneously by the upper quota. This method may produce paradoxes but they are observed extremely rare. Extended simulations over the Greek electoral data indicate that the frequency that the new method violates monotonicity is by far less than the frequency that Webster method violates quota.	simulation	Charalampos Tsitouras	2011	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2011.09.015	operations research	Comp.	-6.24971229344696	-4.352672680740164	8058

In this sense maintenance operations associated with the technical skills and environment factors through sensory perception can represent important strategy to improve the IMS. This approach considers the Cyber-Physical Systems (or CPS) paradigm to acquire human and context factors once that CPS system combines coordinates physical and computational elements. Thus this study proposes the CPS use for taking account the operator's skill and environment conditions for maintenance strategies. This proposal aims the developing of Advanced Human Computer Interface for Intelligent Maintenance Systems that consider the operator's skill and environment. The validation will be accomplished by interface named Toogle where two case studies will be tested.	blender (software);computer-aided design;cyber-physical system;entity;human computer;human–computer interaction;interoperability;middleware;multimodal interaction;programming paradigm;robot operating system;sensor;stereoscopy;usability;user interface	Silvia Silva da Costa Botelho;Nelson Duarte Filho;Danúbia Bueno Espíndola;Marcos Amaral;Leonardo R.

Previous hardware experiments of computer is built on a computer connected to a hardware equipment locally, and then student operate the hardware devices on the switches, buttons, etc. to carry out experiments and verify the developed hardware code is correct. Such experimental methods have lots of significant limitations. To solve the problems, we have developed a cloud-based real hardware experiment system platform. Students can use the experiment board anywhere internet available at any time. They can land at any place where they can access the cloud platform server, that will help them to get a hardware device, and then they can operate, and get results the same as local. We set up a cloud, and many sub-clouds in different cities. Each sub-clouds have a certain number of the special hardware experiment devices. The hardware device is assigned automatically, especially it can solve the problem of insufficient experiment hardware within a university. The platform has been set up with an experimental database, to analysis what is the difficult points for students and make a big data to help for improving computer hardware experiment educational methods. It provided a good experimental support for the online hardware experiment teaching content of MOOC.	cloud computing;computer hardware;teaching method	Chengbin Quan;Yongqiang Chen;Shanshan Li;Youjian Zhao	2016		10.1109/FIE.2016.7757457	hardware compatibility list;simulation;computer security compromised by hardware failure;hardware acceleration;computer science;theoretical computer science;hardware architecture;open source hardware;computer engineering	Vision	-53.514161284373536	4.074670192772499	8085

Many different types of cognitive impairments can result in functional difficulties: • With impairment of information-processing speed, the person’s response time will be slow. The person will take longer to process and respond to visual, verbal and/or written information. Not just language, but instead all information-laden stimuli, will be processed slower. Thus, the person may still be processing one piece of information, when the next (and the next) “intrude”.	freedom of information laws by country;response time (technology)	Wayne A.

4a278e8d2b895a543b16a999f8513051d2b38254	specialization versus re-specialization: effects of hebbian learning in a dynamic environment.		Specializing on a subset of tasks available within a system allows agents to more efficiently fulfill system demands. When demands change, agents need to Re-Specialize. Since ReSpecialization inherently requires undoing some prior Specialization, the opposing effort often results in agents settling on a worse task allocation than after Specialization, even when presented with similar demands. In this work, we demonstrate these task allocation differences by looking at how well demands are fulfilled, as well as how much task switching is happening within the system. We analyze what causes the observed differences and discuss potential approaches to improving Re-Specialization in the future.	hebbian theory;partial template specialization	Vera A. Kazakova;Annie S.

A learning agent shell consists of a learning and knowledge acquisition engine as well as an inference engine and supports building an agent with a knowledge base consisting of an ontology and a set of problem solving rules. The paper describes a specific learning agent shell and its associated agent building methodology. The process of developing an agent relies on importing ontologies from existing repositories of knowledge, and on teaching the agent how to perform various tasks, in a way that resembles how an expert would teach a human apprentice when solving problems in cooperation. The shell and methodology represent a practical integration of knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, learning and problem solving. This work is illustrated with an example of developing a hierarchical non-linear planning agent.	inference engine;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;knowledge engineer;knowledge representation and reasoning;nonlinear system;ontology (information science);problem solving;software repository	Gheorghe Tecuci;Mihai Boicu;Kathryn Wright;Seok Won Lee;Dorin Marcu;Michael Bowman	1999			knowledge base;knowledge integration;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;knowledge-based systems;machine learning;knowledge engineering;open knowledge base connectivity;data mining;procedural knowledge;knowledge extraction;domain knowledge	AI	-30.805727436912264	-5.993059280571706	8103

This research has spanned several communities (databases, AI, World Wide Web), but unfortunately, there has been little crossfertilization between the communities considering the problem. To bring these communities together, we organized the Workshop on Semantic Integration at the Second International Semantic Web Conference on Sanibel Island, Florida. In addition to presenting the state of the art of semantic integration research, we wanted to start a discussion on what semantic integration really is, what different communities bring to the table, and how to develop a common research agenda and outline the next big challenges. Hence, the emphasis on the day of the workshop was on discussion rather than formal presentations. The workshop generated a lot of interest: There were more than 70 registered participants, twice as many as for any other workshop at the conference. We received more than 40 research papers and demonstration proposals for review. The workshop proceedings contain 19 research papers and 7 demonstration descrip■ In numerous distributed environments, including today’s World Wide Web, enterprise data management systems, large science projects, and the emerging semantic web, applications will inevitably use the information described by multiple ontologies and schemas. We organized the Workshop on Semantic Integration at the Second International Semantic Web Conference to bring together different communities working on the issues of enabling integration among different resources.

ef10bea2c29f7e31faff7e36e1631f7990aadc78	inferring relationships from trajectory data		Devices like smart phones and GPS navigators are very popular nowadays. These equipments can save the location of an object with an associated time, generating a new kind of data, called trajectories of moving objects. With these data it is possible to discover several interesting patterns, among which is the interaction between individuals, allowing to infer their relationship. This work addresses the discovery of relationship degree between moving objects based on their encounters. To calculate the relationship degree we propose different measures based on frequency, duration, and area of the encounters. These measures were evaluated in experiments with a running example and real trajectory data, and show that the method correctly infers relationships.	algorithm;experiment;gps navigation device;global positioning system;smartphone	Areli Andreia dos Santos;Andre Salvaro Furtado;Luis Otávio Alvares;Nikos Pelekis;Vania Bogorny	2015			computer vision;simulation;data mining	HCI	-16.503443895317325	-34.81505341020837	8127

An alternative modeling approach using relational learning algorithms is developed to incorporate social network effects within a customer churn prediction setting, in order to handle large scale networks, a time dependent class label, and a skewed class distribution. An innovative approach to incorporate non-Markovian network effects within relational classifiers and a novel parallel modeling setup to combine a relational and non-relational classification model are introduced. The results of two real life case studies on large scale telco data sets are presented, containing both networked (call detail records) and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. A significant impact of social network effects, including non-Markovian effects, on the performance of a customer churn prediction model is found, and the parallel model setup is shown to boost the profits generated by a retention campaign.	social network analysis	Wouter Verbeke;David Martens;Bart Baesens	2014	Appl.

Using cellular technology, the speed and location of each vehicle can be gathered in real-time over a continuous flow, which will allow more novel applications, such as incident identification and probabilities of an incident occurring, to be developed. In addition, as vehicles transmit updated speeds to the system, the fastest path of each commuter from his current location to his destination is maintained.

In order to overcome the limitations of standard behavior selection, a novel method for decision-making, the extended utility function (EUF) method, has been developed. Based on the concept of utility as a common currency for decision-making, the method handles decision-making involving both cognitive processes and (motor) behaviors, and is applicable as a general-purpose framework for decision-making in autonomous robots (as well as software agents). The EUF method is introduced and described, and it is then illustrated by means of an example. Preliminary tests indicate that the method performs well, allowing users rapidly to set up a decision-making system.

These statistics could be updated in a lazy manner during query execution time. A user query is often broken into several query fragments, and a centralized task scheduler schedules the execution of the respective query fragment, fetching data from the various data sources. This is then integrated at the central site and presented to the user. As data sources are introduced, there is a need to update the global catalog from time to time. However, due to the autonomous nature of the data sources, which are maintained by local administrators, it is difficult to ensure accurate statistics as well as the availability of the data sources. In addition, since the data are integrated at the central site, the central site could become a potential bottleneck. The unpredictable nature of the wide area environment further exacerbate the problem of query processing.In this paper, we present our ongoing work on dbRouter, a distributed query optimization and processing framework for open environment. The dbRouter provides mechanisms to faciliate the discovery of new data sources, performs distributed query optimization, and manages the routing of data to its destination for processing.

To better understand the context of these stories journalists, social scientists and other scholars use news collections to find temporal and topical insights. However these insights are devoid of user impressions, derived from click-through data and query logs, and are only reliable if the collection is complete and consistent. In this work we introduce the notion of combining user impressions from Wikipedia with news collection based insights for long running news story exploration and outline promising new research directions. We also demonstrate our initial attempts with a prototype system called NewsEX.	prototype;wikipedia	Jaspreet Singh;Abhijit Anand;Vinay Setty;Avishek Anand	2015		10.1145/2786451.2786489	engineering;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-33.40013192557679	-49.90402897804215	8176

This innovative book critically interrogates the global utopian vision for smart energy and the ultimate consumer-the Resource Man-who is intended to realise its aims. Delving into domains of everyday life where this vision is largely absent, the book provides a unique conceptualisation of energy and technology in everyday practice. Through a lively analysis of energy feedback, dynamic pricing, home automation and micro-generation, the book enriches and extends the possibilities for smart energy technologies in everyday life. It proposes that prices can convey u0027meaningsu0027 about energy, that automation technologies can u0027act backu0027 like the Golems of Jewish mythology and that u0027home madeu0027 energies can matter to everyday practices in important ways. Crossing disciplines including sociology, human-computer interaction design and science and technology studies, the book reimagines what the Smart Utopia is and how its aims can be realised.

Simulation, using the SIMAN simulation language (Systems Modeling Corp., Sewickley, Pennsylvania), was first employed to determine the effects of certain proposed changes. Thorough model validation and accurate analysis were facilitated through the use of computer-collected machine fault data. By fitting probability distributions to the data, the data could be easily manipulated for experimentation.When the simulation showed that the proposed changes would fail to produce the required output, the simulation study continued, with the objectives of isolating the areas of greatest opportunity and steering redesign efforts in the direction of greatest return.And finally during the course of the study, the simulation model came to be relied on as an operational tool, used to understand the implications of, and requirements for, short-term changes in operating patterns and production requirements.This paper will explore the methodology employed, including data preparation, and the conclusions reached.	simulation	Cynthia J.

As a result, there is a growing literature regarding their moral status with many suggesting it is justified to regard manufactured entities as having intrinsic moral worth. However, the question of whether artificial agents could have the high degree of moral status that is attributed to human persons has largely been neglected. To address this question, the author developed a respect-based account of the ethical criteria for the moral status of persons. From this account, the paper employs an empirical test that must be passed in order for artificial agents to be considered alongside persons as having the corresponding rights and duties.

It is an important goal of this research not simply to merge the verbalization results of a natural language generator and the visualization results of a knowledge-based graphics generator, but to carefully coordinate graphics and text in such a way that they complement each other. We describe the architecture of the knowledge-based presentation system WIP which guarantees a design process with a large degree of freedom that can be used to tailor the presentation to suit the specific context. In WIP, decisions of the language generator may influence graphics generation and graphical constraints may sometimes force decisions in the language production process. In this paper, we focus on the influence of graphical constraints on text generation. In particular, we describe the generation of cross-modal references, the revision of text due to graphical constraints and the clarification of graphics through text.	criss-cross algorithm;graphical user interface;graphics;intelligent user interface;modal logic;multimodal interaction;natural language generation	Wolfgang Wahlster;Elisabeth André;Winfried Graf;Thomas Rist	1991		10.1007/3-540-54712-6_213	natural language processing;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-38.56669755051787	-28.987309813730292	8217
1d78764ed63b6c1daef51056d590894af4ceed0f	control systems engineering for optimizing behavioral mhealth interventions		Control systems engineering is a broad-based field that examines how system variables can be adjusted over time to improve important process outcomes. In recent years, control engineering approaches have been proposed as the basis for modeling and optimizing personalized, timevarying interventions in behavioral health. This chapter describes how control systems engineering principles, particularly system identification and model predictive control, can be applied to serve as dynamic modeling methods and optimal decision policies, respectively, for intensively adaptive interventions in behavioral mHealth applications. The role that behavioral theory plays in determining model structure and enabling semiphysical system identification is explained. The combined system identificationmodel predictive control strategy is illustrated with examples of interventions for fibromyalgia, smoking cessation, and enhancing physical activity. D.E.

More and more interfaces are used in public on an everyday basis. Simultaneously, metaphors from performance and theatre studies find their way into research on these interfaces, addressing how interaction with technology can be understood in a performative sense. However, the term 'performativity' is rarely addressed in ways that accentuate its nuances and its analytic power, and this is the focus of the workshop. We will examine the design of performative technologies, the evaluation of user experience, the importance of spectator and performer roles, and the social acceptability of performative actions in public spaces.	interaction;user experience	Lone Koefoed Hansen;Julie Rico Williamson;Giulio Jacucci;Stephen A.

In OSN, micro-blogging has grown rapidly to a popular online social network recently and provides a large number of real-time tweets for users. With the popularity of micro-blogging and the increase of active users, many users are faced with an information overload problem, especially for those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day. In this paper, we aim to investigate the problem of recommending valuable tweets that users are really interested in personally, so as to reduce their efforts to find useful information. We consider three major aspects in our proposed ranking model, including the popularity of a tweet itself, the intimacy between the user and the tweet publisher, and the interest fields of the user. The detailed indicators for each aspect are introduced by analyzing users’ behaviors and their meanings on micro-blogs. The experimental results show that the proposed model can help improve the ranking performance in precision and greatly outperform several baseline methods.

These techniques offer precision in both timing and limb placement, but they lack physical realism. On the other hand, physical simulation offers physical realism, but does not provide the precision offered by procedural motion. We introduce a new animation technique that combines the advantages of procedural animation and physical simulation. The technique is based upon simultaneously using kinematics and physics, applied to different regions of the human body, combined with a torque feedback method that couples the two. It is efficient and easy to implement as a plugin for a wide range of physical simulation engines.

The clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio, two commonly used measures effectively quantify the triangle density in order to quantify the fact that friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Furthermore, several successful graph-mining applications rely on the number of triangles in the graph. In this paper, we study the problem of counting triangles in large, power-law networks. Our algorithm, SparsifyingEigenTriangle, relies on the spectral properties of power-law networks and the Achlioptas–McSherry sparsification process. SparsifyingEigenTriangle is easy to parallelize, fast, and accurate. We verify the validity of our approach with several experiments in real-world graphs, where we achieve at the same time high accuracy and considerable speedup versus a straight-forward exact counting competitor. Finally, our contributions include a simple method for making link recommendations in online social networks based on the number of triangles as well as a procedure for estimating triangles using sketches.	adjacency matrix;algorithm;clustering coefficient;computer data storage;diana mcsherry;experiment;low-rank approximation;social network;speedup;structure mining;the matrix;vertex-transitive graph	Charalampos E.

Website links turn purple after we visit them, for example, showing us information we have yet to explore. These “footprints” of interaction offer substantial benefits in information saturated environments - they enable us to easily revisit old information, systematically explore new information, and quickly resume tasks after interruption. While applying these design principles have been successful in HCI contexts, direct encodings of personal interaction history have received scarce attention in data visualization. One reason is that there is little guidance for integrating history into visualizations where many visual channels are already occupied by data. More importantly, there is not firm evidence that making users aware of their interaction history results in benefits with regards to exploration or insights. Following these observations, we propose HindSight - an umbrella term for the design space of representing interaction history directly in existing data visualizations. In this paper, we examine the value of HindSight principles by augmenting existing visualizations with visual indicators of user interaction history (e.g. How the Recession Shaped the Economy in 255 Charts, NYTimes). In controlled experiments of over 400 participants, we found that HindSight designs generally encouraged people to visit more data and recall different insights after interaction. The results of our experiments suggest that simple additions to visualizations can make users aware of their interaction history, and that these additions significantly impact users' exploration and insights.	chart;data visualization;experiment;human–computer interaction;imagery;interrupt;physical object;the new york times;umbrella term;web site;benefit	Mi Feng;Cheng Deng;Evan M.

The system is based on a particular characteristic of the pronunciation of Kanji (Japanese ideographs borrowed or adapted from Chinese). The keyboard layout of 30 unique keys reduces the number of keystrokes required for input of Japanese text. It uses a transliteration of the Kanji reading into Roman letters, enabling the operator to use a combination of two keys, one that is vowel based and the other consonant based, to input almost any character. The keys are arranged so that vowels and consonants are input with separate hands, facilitating attenuate touch-typing. Since the layout of keys is one that is familiar to the Japanese public, being based on the """"50 on-hyo"""" used to teach the Japanese syllabaries, even an unskilled person can easily use the system. The keyboard is designed for ease of use and less fatigue from the standpoint of human engineering."""	event (computing);human factors and ergonomics;plover;touch typing;unique key;usability	Masasuke Morita	1985	Computer	10.1109/MC.1985.1662891	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;multimedia;writing	HCI	-47.958444064514765	-44.27382495560831	8287

As has long been recognized, centralized architectures impose severe scaling limitations for distributed systems due to the enormous communication overheads. We propose a strictly decentralized approach in which only nearby platforms exchange information. They do so through an interactive communication protocol aimed at maximizing information flow. Our approach is evaluated in the context of a distributed surveillance scenario that arises in a robotic system for playing the game of laser tag. Our results, both from simulation and using physical robots, illustrate an unprecedented scaling capability to large teams of vehicles.	centralized computing;communications protocol;distributed computing;image scaling;particle filter;robot;scalability;simulation	Matthew Rosencrantz;Geoffrey J.

To retrieve information from these resources, users must understand the underlying data schemas even though they often are not content experts. Many other domains share this problem.We developed an interface, TaxonTree, to visualize the taxonomic hierarchy of animal names. We applied integrated searching and browsing so that users need not have complete knowledge either of appropriate keywords or the organization of the data.Our qualitative user study of TaxonTree in an undergraduate course is the first to describe usage patterns in the biodiversity domain. We found that tree-based interaction and visualization aided users' understanding of the data. Most users approached biodiversity data by browsing, using common, general knowledge rather than the scientific keyword expertise necessary to search using traditional interfaces. Users with different levels of interest in the domain had different interaction preferences.	biodiversity informatics;database;usability testing	Bongshin Lee;Cynthia Sims Parr;Dana Campbell;Benjamin B.

Third party supporters normally have an incentive to vote strategically in the election by voting for one of the major candidates. But these voters would vote third party if the third party candidate is doing surprisingly well in the polls. Because voters are more likely to vote third party if the third party candidate is doing well in polls, voters who like the third party candidate best have an incentive to claim they will vote third party in the polls so that more voters will ultimately vote third party in the election. The differing incentives faced during polls and elections accounts for why third party candidates do better in polls than in elections.	polling (computer science)	Patrick Hummel	2014	Social Choice and Welfare	10.1007/s00355-013-0724-4	split-ticket voting;public relations;blanket primary;public opinion;economics;duverger's law;primary election;single non-transferable vote;contingent vote;group voting ticket;public administration	ECom	-4.787424685132975	-7.1715309590037855	8325

Our approach is based on stratifying the drawing into layers with desired properties; layers can be explored and combined by the user to gradually acquire details. We present stratification heuristics, a user study, and an experimental analysis that evaluates how our stratification heuristics behave on the drawings computed by a variety of popular force-directed algorithms.

We do so by analyzing a concrete algorithm which we claim is faithful to what practical solvers do. In particular, before making any new decision or restart, the solver repeatedly applies the unit-resolution rule until saturation, and leaves no component to the mercy of non-determinism except for some internal randomness. We prove the perhaps surprising fact that, although the solver is not explicitly designed for it, with high probability it ends up behaving as width-k resolution after no more than O(n) conflicts and restarts, where n is the number of variables. In other words, width-k resolution can be thought of as O(n) restarts of the unit-resolution rule with learning.	constraint learning;dpll algorithm;randomness;resolution (logic);software propagation;solver;unit propagation;with high probability	Albert Atserias;Johannes Klaus Fichte;Marc Thurley	2011	J.

We show that three-dimensional displays hold the promise of improving spatial perception, complex scene understanding, memory, and related aspects of performance, but primarily for (1) tasks that are multidimensional or spatial in nature; (2) for tasks that are difficult, complex, or unfamiliar; and/or (3) when other visual spatial cues are degraded or missing. No current 3D display system is capable of satisfying all visual depth cues simultaneously with high fidelity, though stereoscopic 3D displays offer the distinct advantage of binocular stereopsis without incurring substantial costs, or loss in the fidelity of other depth cues. Human factors problems that continue to plague 3D displays and that are especially pertinent to stereoscopic visualizations are considered. We conclude that stereo 3D displays may be an invaluable tool for some applications of data or information visualization, but warn that it is a tool that must be utilized thoughtfully and carefully.	3d computer graphics;binocular vision;capacitor plague;human factors and ergonomics;information visualization;relevance;stereo display;stereopsis;stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy	John P.

a689d7309d28130243d173e1c404b9b8a4e874b2	deviant interdisciplinarity as philosophical practice: prolegomena to deep intellectual history	biology;deviant interdisciplinarity;energy;idealism;integration;kant;naturphilosophie;normal interdisciplinarity;positivism;reduction;university;lamarck;william james	Philosophy may relate to interdisciplinarity in two distinct ways On the one hand, philosophy may play an auxiliary role in the process of interdisciplinarity, typically through conceptual analysis, in the understanding that the disciplines themselves are the main epistemic players. This version of the relationship I characterise as ‘normal’ because it captures the more common pattern of the relationship, which in turn reflects an acceptance of the division of organized inquiry into disciplines. On the other hand, philosophy may be itself the site for the production of interdisciplinary knowledge, understood as a kind of second-order understanding of reality that transcends the sort of knowledge that the disciplines provide, left to their own devices. This is my own position, which I dub ‘deviant’ and to which most of this article is devoted. I begin by relating the two types of interdisciplinarity to the organization of inquiry, especially their respective attitudes to the history of science. Underlying the two types are contrasting notions of what constitutes the ‘efficient’ pursuit of knowledge. This difference is further explored in terms of the organization of the university. The normal/deviant distinction was already marked in the institution’s medieval origins in terms of the difference between Doctors and Masters, respectively, an artefact of which remains in the postgraduate/undergraduate degree distinction. In the context of the history of the university, the prospects for deviant interdisciplinarity were greatest from the early sixteenth to the early nineteenth century—the period called ‘early modern’ in the philosophy curriculum. Towards the end of that period, due to Kant and the generation of idealists who followed him, philosophy was briefly the privileged site for deviant interdisciplinarity. After Hegel’s death, the mantle of deviant interdisciplinarity increasingly passed to some version of ‘biology’. I explore the ‘Natur-’ and ‘Geisteswissenschaft’ versions of that post-philosophical vision, which continue to co-exist within today’s biological science. I then briefly examine the chequered reputation of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, someone who exemplified the promise and perils of deviant interdisciplinarity over the past 200 years. I conclude with an Epilogue that considers contemporary efforts to engage philosophy in interdisciplinary work, invoking William James as an exemplar.	jean;jamie wilkinson;mantle;visual artifact	Steve Fuller	2012	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-012-0208-6	interdisciplinarity;philosophy;epistemology;mathematics	HCI	-55.54583371980651	-22.58937067516556	8378

The result is an unsatisfy ing, artificial experience, in which the user must halt avatar movement until the new scene slowly assembles before the avatar a nd sounds pick up, or allow the avatar to continue moving and risk bumping into objects that are revealed later when the view fully assembles.

2bfe594a843d02d5127e039e3b723b6e9b9ca888	improving the pruning ability of dynamic metric access methods with local additional pivots and anticipation of information		Metric Access Methods (MAMs) have been proved to allow performing similarity queries over complex data more efficiently than other access methods. They can be considered dynamic or static depending on the pivot type used in their construction. Global pivots tend to compromise the dynamicity of MAMs, as eventual pivot-related updates must be propagated through the entire structure, while local pivots allow this maintenance to occur locally. Several applications handle online complex data and, consequently, demand efficient dynamic indexes to be successful. In this context, this work presents two techniques for improving the pruning ability of dynamic MAMs: (i) using cutting local additional pivots to reduce distance calculations and (ii) anticipating information from child nodes to reduce unnecessary disk accesses. The experiments reveal significant improvements in a dynamic MAM, reducing execution time in more than 50 % for similarity queries posed on datasets ranging from moderate to high dimensionality and cardinality.	experiment;feature vector;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;run time (program lifecycle phase);tree (data structure);type system	Paulo H.

This requires a large amount of human effort and often delays publication of this important figure. In this paper, by leveraging ubiquitous positioning techniques and open data, we propose a two-phase approach to estimation of port container throughput in real-time. First, we obtain the number of container ships arriving at berth by analyzing the ships' GPS traces. Then we estimate the throughput of each ship, in terms of number of containers transshipped, by considering the ship's berthing time, capacity, length, breadth, and crane operation performance, as extracted from different data sources. Evaluation results using real-world datasets from Hong Kong and Singapore show that the proposed approach not only estimates the container throughput quite accurately, but also outperforms the baseline method significantly.	baseline (configuration management);global positioning system;real-time clock;throughput;tracing (software);two-phase locking	Longbiao Chen;Daqing Zhang;Gang Pan;Leye Wang;Xiaojuan Ma;Chao Chen;Shijian Li	2014		10.1145/2632048.2632050	simulation	Mobile	-16.61399144539458	-31.56531163051257	8437

4348a002a22db6ce40fc67d6df3bfd27e4da0d5d	modeling topologically resilient supply chain networks	network modeling;supply chains;topological resilience	The ubiquity of supply chains along with their increasingly interconnected structure has ignited interest in studying supply chain networks through the lens of complex adaptive systems. A particularly important characteristic of supply chains is the desirable goal of sustaining their operation when exposed to unexpected perturbations. Applied network science methods can be used to analyze topological properties of supply chains and propose models for their growth. Network models focusing on the critical aspect of supply chain resilience may provide insights into the design of supply networks that may quickly recover from disruptions. This is vital for understanding both static and dynamic structures of complex supply networks, and enabling management to make informed decisions and prioritizing particular operations. This paper proposes an action-based perspective for creating a compact probabilistic model for a given real-world supply network. The action-based model consists of a set of rules (actions) that a firm may use to connect with other firms, such that the synthesized networks are topologically resilient. Additionally, it captures the heterogeneous roles of different firms by incorporating domain specific constraints. Results analyzing the resilience of networks subjected to node disruptions show that networks synthesized using the proposed model can generally outperform its real-world counterpart.	complex adaptive system;domain-specific modeling;markov chain;network science;semantic network;statistical model	Viplove Arora;Mario Ventresca	2018	Applied Network Science	10.1007/s41109-018-0070-7	network science;psychological resilience;network model;distributed computing;supply chain;business;supply network;complex adaptive system	ML	-16.64322917280774	-19.74806979150821	8474
e3c0d91d007de82650280219f8a296a126d24a30	on correctness in rdf stream processor benchmarking	informatica	Two complementary benchmarks have been proposed so far for the evaluation and continuous improvement of RDF stream processors: SRBench and LSBench. They put a special focus on different features of the evaluated systems, including coverage of the streaming extensions of SPARQL supported by each processor, query processing throughput, and an early analysis of query evaluation correctness, based on comparing the results obtained by different processors for a set of queries. However, none of them has analysed the operational semantics of these processors in order to assess the correctness of query evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a characterization of the operational semantics of RDF stream processors, adapting well-known models used in the stream processing engine community: CQL and SECRET. Through this formalization, we address correctness in RDF stream processor benchmarks, allowing to determine the multiple answers that systems should provide. Finally, we present CSRBench, an extension of SRBench to address query result correctness verification using an automatic method.	benchmark (computing);central processing unit;contextual query language;correctness (computer science);database;operational semantics;sparql;stream processing;throughput	Daniele Dell'Aglio;Jean-Paul Calbimonte;Marco Balduini;Óscar Corcho;Emanuele Della Valle	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41338-4_21	computer science;sparql;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;rdf query language;world wide web	DB	-32.41807885182943	2.9755437405064638	8481
37eb005c760d9dffaa2b136e104cce6946d0e0e6	implementation of 3d spatial indexing and compression in a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation database for rapid atomic contact detection	saccharomyces cerevisiae;data compression;saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins;molecular dynamics simulation;computational biology bioinformatics;proteins;algorithms;combinatorial libraries;computer appl in life sciences;databases protein;microarrays;bioinformatics	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer the ability to observe the dynamics and interactions of both whole macromolecules and individual atoms as a function of time. Taken in context with experimental data, atomic interactions from simulation provide insight into the mechanics of protein folding, dynamics, and function. The calculation of atomic interactions or contacts from an MD trajectory is computationally demanding and the work required grows exponentially with the size of the simulation system. We describe the implementation of a spatial indexing algorithm in our multi-terabyte MD simulation database that significantly reduces the run-time required for discovery of contacts. The approach is applied to the Dynameomics project data. Spatial indexing, also known as spatial hashing, is a method that divides the simulation space into regular sized bins and attributes an index to each bin. Since, the calculation of contacts is widely employed in the simulation field, we also use this as the basis for testing compression of data tables. We investigate the effects of compression of the trajectory coordinate tables with different options of data and index compression within MS SQL SERVER 2008. Our implementation of spatial indexing speeds up the calculation of contacts over a 1 nanosecond (ns) simulation window by between 14% and 90% (i.e., 1.2 and 10.3 times faster). For a 'full' simulation trajectory (51 ns) spatial indexing reduces the calculation run-time between 31 and 81% (between 1.4 and 5.3 times faster). Compression resulted in reduced table sizes but resulted in no significant difference in the total execution time for neighbour discovery. The greatest compression (~36%) was achieved using page level compression on both the data and indexes. The spatial indexing scheme significantly decreases the time taken to calculate atomic contacts and could be applied to other multidimensional neighbor discovery problems. The speed up enables on-the-fly calculation and visualization of contacts and rapid cross simulation analysis for knowledge discovery.

Specifically, in this paper we focus on the mobile version of the system. This framework has two main characteristics: firstly, it summarizes the results of one or more search services (like search engines) requests by organizing them into labeled clusters that are better rendered on a small screen than a long ranked list of documents.  Secondly, the user interface provides some high level operators for cluster manipulation, combination, and re-ranking; the user can easily select them from a menu, without much burden to capture the relevant documents hidden in the large set of retrieved ones. These operators are part of a novel conception language, specifically defined for exploring the results retrieved by several internet search services.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;high-level programming language;organizing (structure);television;user interface;web search engine	Gloria Bordogna;Alessandro Campi;Giuseppe Psaila;Stefania Ronchi	2008		10.1145/1497185.1497225	semantic search;computer science;database;world wide web;information retrieval;query language	Web+IR	-30.674591024606126	-46.07285451147612	8508
0cf6376cd4574d3bb11f3f22ea817a87e0971371	a universal model for war and peace	cs si;cs cy;physics soc ph	Human flourishing is often severely limited by violent conflict, yet the root causes of war and peace are intricate and difficult to quantify. In recent years, the increasing availability of data has led to models which attempt to explain the complexities of warfare from various perspectives [1]–[5]. However, a universal spatial model that can predict areas of war and peace on a global scale remains absent. Here, we take up the oft-cited hypothesis that land trade routes play a key role in determining both the strategic importance and the vulnerability to conflict of cities and regions around the world [6], [7]. Using population data from cities, we infer a global network by means of the ‘gravity law’. We find that two standard network measures, degree and betweenness, together predict with high accuracy whether a given region will be at risk of suffering conflict. We use these results to propose a metric called strategic centrality, and find that it accounts for over 80% of the variance in number of attacks among the world’s main population zones. It is also a good predictor of the distance to a conflict zone, and can be used to provide an estimate of the conflict risk for a given region. Our results demonstrate that despite the complexities underlying human violence, a pattern exists at the global scale such that it is possible to make predictions based on simple network measures, significantly outperforming predictions based on established socioeconomic or geopolitical factors. These findings suggest a particular connection between conflict and trade routes which should be explored in more depth. We also anticipate that the model can be used to guide developing regions in the construction of new cities and major transport links. Human conflict in one guise or another has shaped our world, enthralled historians for millennia, and continues to represent an existential threat to humanity. The conditions which lead to war or peace are multi-dimensional, and seem so specific and interwoven that it is often considered simplistic or naive to search for general patterns which might provide real predictive power. The mathematical analysis of conflict goes back as far as the 1940s [8] (and more recently in [2]), where it was found that both the cumulative and non-cumulative intensity of conflict followed power-law distributions and exhibited fractal properties. However, the conflict data for earlier eras are sparse, inaccurate, and often aggregated across a whole war (i.e. the death-tolls were in the 10s to 100s of thousands). In recent years, the greater availability of data has	betweenness;centrality;fractal;global network;information-theoretic death;kerrison predictor;our world;sparse matrix	Weisi Guo;Xueke Lu;Samuel Johnson	2016	CoRR		social science;conflict resolution research;sociology;social psychology	ML	-20.71164747366503	-34.49862730719646	8509

243c20903347b9a112db2dba1cb281f8ba4fa633	limits to science or limits to epistemology?		, Vol. 2, No. 3 CCC 1076-2787/97/03031-07 INTRODUCTION A recent spate of writings has argued that in a fundamental sense, science is reaching limits. The basic claims of this work are twofold. First, it is argued that for many areas of inquiry, notably physics, chemistry, and biology, science has provided an essentially accurate view of nature. The theories of evolution, relativity, and quantum mechanics are taken as primary examples of scientific success. Further advances in understanding physical, chemical, and biological phenomena will be derivative of these existing broad theories. Second, it is argued that in those areas where scientific inquiry cannot claim great empirical successes, fundamental advances are impossible, either because their theories do not admit verifiable empirical predictions or because experiments that discriminate between theories cannot be carried out. Cognitive and social sciences are often cited as examples of disciplines doomed to permanent failure. This article argues that the claims about limits to science are essentially unpersuasive. First, I claim that there is no basis for concluding that a successful science is at the end of fundamental breakthroughs. Second, I argue that the claim that social science, as an example of a supposedly unsuccessful science, is incapable of producing successful models, is unsupported. Here, I focus on economics given my professional training, but the arguments apply more broadly. In short, it appears more plausible that there are fundamental barriers to our ability to identify bounds on science than that we have reached such barriers. Further, as the arguments of this article support the position that it is impossible to ever identify such limits to science, in this sense I would argue that there exist limits to some aspects of scientific epistemology itself.	existential quantification;experiment;formal verification;quantum mechanics;reaching definition;theory	Steven Durlauf	1997	Complexity	10.1002/(SICI)1099-0526(199701/02)2:3%3C31::AID-CPLX6%3E3.0.CO;2-Q		ML	-56.391705066801435	-21.94377009363954	8541

While traditional Decision Support Systems (DSSs) ignore the spatial dimension of the problem, most Geographic Information System (GIS)-based Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs) focus mainly on the spatial analysis of the problem, avoiding other relevant factors like uncertainty and incompleteness of data sets. This research is based on a recently developed intelligent belief rule-based DSS, called RIMER+, which is shown to be capable of capturing vagueness, incompleteness, uncertainty, and nonlinear causal relationships in an integrated way. The main contribution of this research is to explore the possibilities of achieving a higher degree of integration of DSSs in a GIS environment, i.e., integration of RIMER+ within GIS system by using an embedded approach, which not only enhances further the capability and applicability of the RIMER+ by integrating the spatial component of the problem into the decision making process, but also takes advantage of the GIS software capabilities in terms of spatial analysis and visualization. Finally, this research employs a comparative case study to demonstrate performance of the proposed Spatial RIMER+ methodology against the well-known Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) methodology.	causality;decision problem;embedded system;geographic coordinate system;geographic information system;guinness world records;intelligent decision support system;interpretation (logic);logic programming;nonlinear system;spatial analysis;vagueness;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alberto Calzada;Jun Liu;Hui Wang;Anil Kashyap	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.114	enterprise gis;geomatics;decision support system;intelligent decision support system;decision analysis;decision engineering;computer science;knowledge management;geospatial analysis;data mining;management science;spatial intelligence;evidential reasoning approach;data visualization;business decision mapping	Robotics	-5.9976667889351125	-25.711568694732463	8545

Since these contributions were envisaged not to fill a full issue, the EURO 2000 Programme Committee (PC) decided in addition to solicit papers on real-world applications. This ‘‘call for applied papers’’ which appeared in the Second Announcement and was repeated in the final Programme resulted in an overwhelming number of contributions, far beyond expectations. A few comments on the Invited Review, the Opening Plenary Lecture, and the 12 semi-plenary papers are given below.

Storylines are windows that offer glimpses into interesting themes latent among the top search results for a query; they are different from, and complementary to, clusters obtained through traditional approaches. Our framework is axiomatically developed and combinatorial in nature, based on generalizations of the maximum induced matching problem on bipartite graphs. The core algorithmic task involved is to mine for signature structures in a robust graph representation of the search results. We present a very fast algorithm for this task based on local search. Experiments show that the collection of storylines extracted through our algorithm offers a concise organization of the wealth of information hidden beyond the first page of search results.	algorithm;graph (abstract data type);graph theory;local search (optimization);microsoft windows	Ravi Kumar;Uma Mahadevan;D.

Seriously, this editorial might be the first editorial written in english in the history of this journal. The question is: do we really need this? Why don’t we stick with what we had before? Why do we have to do what everybody else does? I am sure you find a lot of reasons why we should keep our German language active in this journal. You can refer to our neighbors, the French, who are a little more conservative with regard to keeping the mother language in their everyday business. May be we should do the same? So, what makes me think otherwise? When I read the contributions of this new special issue on AI & Agriculture, I noticed that there is not a single article written in German. As a consequence, I thought that an english written editorial would be more appropriate. This is also in line with our policy to open up to international readers. Our publisher Springer has confirmed that more and more papers are downloaded from outside the German speaking countries. So, maybe this step was long overdue. Our guest editor Andreas Dengel introduces us readers into the topic of this special issue and I don’t want to be repetitive here.

Visualization lends itself well to the challenge of exploring and analyzing these information spaces by harnessing the strengths of the human visual system. Most visualization techniques are based on the assumption that the display device has sufficient resolution, and that our visual acuity is adequate for completing the analysis tasks. However, this may not be true, particularly for specialized display devices (e.g., PDAs or large-format projection walls).  In this article, we propose to: (1) determine the amount of information a particular display environment can encode; (2) design visualizations that maximize the information they represent relative to this upper-limit; and (3) dynamically update a visualization when the display environment changes to continue to maintain high levels of information content. To our knowledge, there are no visualization systems that do this type of information addition/removal based on perceptual guidelines. However, there are systems that attempt to increase or decrease the amount of information based on some level-of-detail or zooming rules. For example, semantic zooming tags objects with """"details"""" and adds or removes them as the user zooms in and out. Furnas's original fisheye lens system [9] used semantic details to determine how much zoom was necessary to include certain details. Thus, while zooming for detail, you see not only a more detailed graphic representation, but also more text details (e.g., more street names on the zoomed-in portion of a map). Level-of-detail hierarchies have also been used in computer graphics to reduce geometric complexity where full resolution models are unnecessary and can be replaced with low-detail models where the resulting error cannot be easily recognized. Our approach is motivated by all these ideas, but our key contribution is that we use human perception constraints to define when to add or remove information."""	computer graphics;display device;encode;fisheye;george furnas;large-format projection;level of detail;personal digital assistant;self-information;zooming user interface	Amit P.

d6efad9a4643875d2d65d4ebb2244863f82163e6	guest editors' introduction to special issue on the 2012 nsf workshop	design;general	The 2012 NSF Workshop on Simulation Methodology took place in the School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China from July 23, 2012 to July 25, 2012. The workshop was sponsored by the National Science Foundation (USA) under Grant Number CMMI-1219403, the School of Management of Fudan University, and the Financial Engineering and Financial Risk Management Branch of the Operational Research Society of China. The theme of the 2012 NSF Workshop was computer simulation: opportunities and challenges. With new technologies, such as parallel computing, graphic processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing, and emerging areas, such as health systems and environmental systems, there are opportunities for the simulation community to broaden and advance research and applications. Thus, there is a need for identifying new opportunities and challenges in research related to emerging technologies and application areas. More specifically, emerging computing technologies and application areas include parallel computing environments, GPU, cloud computing, financial engineering, healthcare and health system, and environmental system, etc. Under this theme, the goal of the meeting was to scope new opportunities and challenges in simulation research related to new emerging computing technologies and application areas, and brainstorm how to successfully approach them. In addition, compared to other areas of operations research, the simulation community is small in China and many other countries in East Asia. The workshop was to promote simulation research attracting more researchers to the field and build international collaborations. The workshop featured four 1-hour plenary talks, complemented by two 30-minute regular presentations followed by discussion sessions.

This paper studies the model by examining which part of the data is essential and which part is redundant for defining the mixing system and proposes an idea called redundant data elimination. Statistical properties change in the direction of uniform distribution as redundant data are eliminated, yet the model still holds and the solution still exists. A theoretical explanation is given of the geometrical transformation of independent sources. The above reasoning is verified by separation experiment. It is shown that this idea can also improve model match for unsymmetrical sources.	data security;independent component analysis;mixing (mathematics);redundancy (engineering);separation kernel	Xianhua Liu;Robert B.

Difficult to understand even visually, it requires explanation and contextualization. In accordance with the legislation regarding the accessibility of cultural works, and to allow its understanding, we have implemented various devices, via digital technology, to make it accessible to as many people as possible. Different criteria of accessibility and perception of sensory modalities have been studied. After an analysis of the already existing accessibility design we have designed and evaluated different prototypes of enhanced digital and tangible maps.

To address this issue, alternative combination rules have been proposed for resolving the appeared con°icts of evidence. An underlying assumption is that con°ict evidences exist, which, however, is not always true. Moreover, it has been veri ̄ed that con°ict factors may not be accurate to characterize the degree of con°ict. Instead, the Jousselme distance has been regarded as a quanti ̄cation criterion for the degree of con°ict because of its promising properties. To avoid the counter-intuitive results, multiple sources of evidence should be classi ̄ed ̄rst. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to quantify the classi ̄cation of multiple sources of evidence based on a core vector method, and the algorithm is further veri ̄ed by two examples. This study also explores the relationship between complementary information and con°icting evidence and discusses the stochastic interpretation of basic probability assignment functions.	algorithm;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical analysis;oracle bpa suite;stochastic matrix	Jian-Ping Yang;Hong-Zhong Huang;Yu Liu;Yanfeng Li	2015	International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making	10.1142/S0219622014500242	econometrics;dempster–shafer theory;artificial intelligence;data mining;mathematics;statistics	AI	-5.21331392674536	-22.91758837412144	8707

Such activities often require a significant amount of effort, thus, become a distraction to creative tasks. Common approaches to this problem focus on creation of tools that promote and directly support creativity and impose their use. In contrast to the above view, this work proposes a novel approach that significantly differs from the commonly suggested direct support for creativity. Instead, we argue creativity can be supported indirectly through minimisation of effort related to the non-creative activities. We demonstrate how this idea can be applied with the post-production assistant (PPA), a tool that gives suggestions for solving problems arising from non-creative activities. Thus, we promote a process, where the creative part of the post-production is only marginally distracted. This paper presents the design of the PPA tool including an overview of the crucial technologies used and discusses their application in specific post-production use cases and scenarios. In this context, we emphasise applicability and usefulness of semantic web technologies in the creative processes of film making.	semantic web	Anna Dabrowska;Michael Hausenblas	2013	IJIDS	10.1504/IJIDS.2013.055924	simulation;decision support system;post-production;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;semantic web;data mining;multimedia;creativity;management;operations research	Vision	-61.10385107486105	-36.80272233191039	8723

For it, tools that describe aspects such as spatial dependence or autocorrelation in patterns are used. The statistic techniques that measure the spatial dependence are very varied, but all of them provide only scalar information about the variation of spatial properties in the pattern, without analyzing the possible directedness of the dependence mentioned. In this work, we make a vector approach to the analysis of spatial dependence, therefore, given a pattern, besides quantifying its autocorrelation level, we will determinate if statistics evidence of directedness exists, calculating the angle where the direction appears. For this we will use a parametric method when the normality of population can be assumed, and a non-parametric method for uniform distribution.

It can be produced in different shapes and sizes to suit various locations of the body such as the finger, forearm, or ear. Integrating capacitive and resistive touch sensing, the sensor is capable of detecting touch input with two levels of pressure, even when stretched by 30% or when bent with a radius of 0.5cm. Furthermore, iSkin supports single or multiple touch areas of custom shape and arrangement, as well as more complex widgets, such as sliders and click wheels. Recognizing the social importance of skin, we show visual design patterns to customize functional touch sensors and allow for a visually aesthetic appearance. Taken together, these contributions enable new types of on-body devices. This includes finger-worn devices, extensions to conventional wearable devices, and touch input stickers, all fostering direct, quick, and discreet input for mobile computing.	design pattern;mobile computing;multi-touch;sensor;wearable technology;wheels	Martin Weigel;Tong Lu;Gilles Bailly;Antti Oulasvirta;Carmel Majidi;Jürgen Steimle	2015		10.1145/2702123.2702391	embedded system;wearable computer;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;electronic skin	HCI	-42.698777899606874	-41.686970770324415	8738
4fbac734a2971555812a5f35830add3e1b32086d	edge representation learning for community detection in large scale information networks		It is found that networks in real world divide naturally into communities or modules. Many community detection algorithms have been developed to uncover the community structure in networks. However, most of them focus on non-overlapping communities and the applicability of these work is limited when it comes to real world networks, which inherently are overlapping in most cases, e.g. Facebook and Weibo. In this paper, we propose an overlapping community detection algorithm based on edge representation learning. Firstly, we sample a series of edge sequences using random walks on graph, then a mapping function from edge to feature vectors is automatically learned in an unsupervised way. At last we employ the traditional clustering algorithms, e.g. K-means and its variants, on the learned representations to carry out community detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on a group of synthetic networks and two real world networks with ground truth. Experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of evaluation metrics.	machine learning	Suxue Li;Haixia Zhang;Dalei Wu;Chuanting Zhang;Dongfeng Yuan	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-73521-4_4	data mining;machine learning;random walk;feature vector;cluster analysis;computer science;community structure;ground truth;feature learning;graph;artificial intelligence	NLP	-15.029572013937486	-44.55709881367847	8751

Especially the exploration of geographical data, which until today mostly relies on mice and keyboard input, could benefit from this interaction paradigm. However, the gestures that are required to interact with complex systems like Geographic Information Systems (GIS) increase in difficulty with every additional functionality. This paper describes a novel interaction approach that allows non-expert users to easily explore geographic data using a combination of multi-touch gestures and handpostures. The use of the additional input modality -- handpose -- is supposed to avoid more complex multi-touch gestures. Furthermore the screen of a wearable device serves as another output modality that on one hand avoids occlusion and on the other hand serves as a magic lens.	complex systems;geographic information system;hidden surface determination;modal logic;modality (human–computer interaction);multi-touch;plover;programming paradigm;wearable technology	Florian Daiber;Sven Gehring;Markus Löchtefeld;Antonio Krüger	2012		10.1145/2406367.2406377	computer vision;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;geographic information system	HCI	-46.12892478559644	-40.5112330140393	8765

A less known equilibrium, called the (k,t)-robust equilibrium, has recently been used in the context of distributed computing. The (k,t)-robust equilibrium combines the concepts of k-resiliency and t-immunity: a strategy profile is k-resilient if there is no coalition of k players that can benefit from improving their payoffs by collective deviation, and it is t-immune if any action of any t players does not decrease the payoffs of the others. A strategy profile is (k,t)-robust if it is both k-resilient and t-immune. In this paper an evolutionary approach of approximating (k,t)-robust equilibria is proposed. Numerical experiments are performed on a game that models node behavior in a distributed system.	approximation;distributed computing;experiment;game theory;iterative and incremental development;nash equilibrium	Tudor Dan Mihoc;Rodica Ioana Lung;Noémi Gaskó;Mihai Alexandru Suciu	2016		10.1145/2908812.2908877	implementation theory;game theory;simulation;best response;potassium;artificial intelligence;management science;correlated equilibrium;chicken;normal-form game;outcome;equilibrium selection;symmetric game;solution concept;nash equilibrium;symmetric equilibrium	ECom	-9.446379559699691	-6.2784951331550065	8787

Individuals play indirect reciprocity game within their group and follow second order norms. Individuals are norm-followers, and imitate their successful group mates. Aside from direct observation individuals can be informed about the previous actions and reputations by information transferred by others. A potential donor estimates the reputation of a potential receiver either by her own observation or by the opinion of the majority of others (indirect observation). Following a previous study (Scheuring, 2009) we assume that norms determine only the probabilities of actions, and mutants can differ in these probabilities. Similarly, we assume that individuals follow a stochastic information transfer strategy. The central question is whether cooperative norm and honest social information transfer can emerge in a population where initially only non-cooperative norms were present, and the transferred information was not sufficiently honest. It is shown that evolution can lead to a cooperative state where information transferred in a reliable manner, where generous cooperative strategies are dominant. This cooperative state emerges along a sharp transition of norms. We studied the characteristics of actions and strategies in this transition by classifying the stochastic norms, and found that a series of more and more judging strategies invade each other before the stabilization of the so-called generous judging strategy. Numerical experiments on the coevolution of social parameters (e.g. probability of direct observation and the number of indirect observers) reveal that it is advantageous to lean on indirect observation even if information transfer is much noisier than for direct observation, which is because to follow the majorities' opinion suppresses information noise meaningfully.	biological evolution;classification;estimated;experiment;probability;reputation;stochastic process	István Scheuring	2010	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2010.04.009	biology;reciprocity;group selection;information transfer;coevolution;second-order logic;norm	ML	-14.687194099306865	-14.249573847421482	8798

We argue that the data-processing support is not neutral and conditions the representations that are built. In addition, the requirements ofmedical activity work with the computerized record, needs for indexing, constraints ofcoding, etc. have consequences for modelling and for applications which each correspond to different assumptions about the handling of information and knowledge. In particular, the diversity of the activity is such that the question ofthe documents and their supports has to be considered, as they generally provide poorly structured information; formal models ofknowledge as ontologies also have to be addressed. We propose to model the exchange and the production of information and knowledge within care units of the hospital in the context of the knowledge management, so as to account for these diversities ofmodelling and to direct future research and development. In addition, we consider the organisational training made possible by this type ofanalysis grid. These proposals are illustrated by research and medical applications developed in a hospital context.	information system;knowledge management;ontology (information science);requirement	Jean Charlet	2007	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03253291	search engine indexing;systems modeling;data processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;coding;operations research;information system	AI	-25.47741735944013	-2.563928639574076	8826

The reported n-person Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma shows that the relative differences in the reproductive effort between sexes can explain the evolution of paternal care. When female reproductive costs are higher than male reproductive costs, males cooperate with females even when females do not reciprocate. Paternal care is thus an evolutionary achievement to compensate for the energy demands that reproduction involves for mothers. Paternal care, in turn, produces a sustained population growth, since females can reproduce at higher rates.	agent-based model;iterated function;prisoner's dilemma;social computing	Ariel M.

We prove in the present paper that this set is the unique stable set for the assignment game that excludes thirdparty payments with respect to a fixed optimal matching. Moreover, the stable sets that we characterize, as well as any other stable set of the assignment game, have a lattice structure with respect to the same partial order usually defined on the core.	crystal structure;optimal matching;stable marriage problem	Marina Núñez;Carles Rafels	2013	J.

However, the experts recommended from such systems often do not meet users’ needs since the network semantic information is largely ignored. In this study, we used conditional logistic analysis to quantitatively examine the semantics of two social networks in a large open source community called Ohloh. It was found that homophily in nationality, location, programming language preference, and community reputation are determinants for forming evaluation and collaboration relationships among the Ohloh members. Moreover, past collaborations and mutual acquaintances are also found to significantly affect the formation of evaluation links but not collaboration links. In addition, we demonstrated how to embed the discovered network semantics into the design of expert recommendation systems through two mechanisms user-based link prediction and Top-N most recognized mechanism.

77eed508dd5e79d1d3d3269cd881d9c14369769c	un modèle d'environnement pour la simulation multi-agents des déplacements en milieu urbain. (an environment model for the multi-agent simulation of mobility in urban areas)		Simulation constitutes a major approach for the conception, development, analysis and evolution of urban systems. This thesis focusses on the modeling and simulation of movements (pedestrian, vehicle, cycle) within urban environments. The industrial context associated with this thesis requires to consider the movements of each entity in a three dimensional universe. In this thesis, we propose to address the scientific and technological challenges by using autonomous entities, called agents, to model the individuals. In agent-based simulation three elements must be defined : the agent behaviors, their interactions with other agents, and with the environment. The environment models the structure of the world and its endogenous dynamics. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to find an environment model that answers all the different scientific and technological problems addressed in this thesis. Consequently, an environment model named HEterogenous Dual Graph Environment (or HEDGE) is proposed. The HEDGE model is based on a decomposition of the environment using zones that are linked with navigation and perception links. This graph structure is at the center of our model. It is designed to “naturally” model the environment, and it allows an efficient simulation of the system composed of the environment and the agents. The environment’s missions and dynamic processes are modeled using mechanisms, which are inspired by the laws of Physics. The actions provided by the agents and the endogenous dynamics algorithms correspond to physical forces to apply to objects in the world. A model of conflict detection and resolution between those forces is used to ensure the coherence of the environment model state. In the last part of this thesis, the HEDGE model is used in the context of two urban planning projects in the city of Belfort, and its metropolitan area. The product of this model’s application is used in the context of technical studies (preliminary studies, pre-project), communication (consultation and public debates) and promotion (exposition, valorization) in the form of interactive 3D software.

More recently, the integrated use of traditional data mining techniques such as clustering and pattern recognition with data warehousing technique of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) have motivated diverse research areas for leveraging knowledge discovery from complex real-world datasets. Recently, a number of such integrated methodologies have been proposed to extract knowledge from datasets but most of these methodologies lack automated and generic methods for schema generation and knowledge extraction. Mostly data analysts need to rely on domain specific knowledge and have to cope with technological constraints in order to discover knowledge from high dimensional datasets. In this paper we present a generic methodology which incorporates semi-automated knowledge extraction methods to provide data-driven assistance towards knowledge discovery. In particular, we provide a method for constructing a binary tree of hierarchical clusters and annotate each node in the tree with significant numeric variables. Additionally, we propose automated methods to rank nominal variables and to generate candidate multidimensional schema with highly significant dimensions. We have performed three case studies on three real-world datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository in order to validate the generality and applicability of our proposed methodology.	binary tree;cluster analysis;data mining;level of measurement;machine learning;online analytical processing;pattern recognition;semiconductor industry	Muhammad Usman;Russel Pears;Alvis Cheuk M.

a351b14cc8c72ab165d87bc51b1b071bb14c18da	social media image recognition for food trend analysis		An increasing number of people share their thoughts and the images of their lives on social media platforms. People are exposed to food in their everyday lives and share on-line what they are eating by means of photos taken to their dishes. The hashtag #foodporn is constantly among the popular hashtags in Twitter and food photos are the second most popular subject in Instagram after selfies. The system that we propose, WorldFoodMap, captures the stream of food photos from social media and, thanks to a CNN food image classifier, identifies the categories of food that people are sharing. By collecting food images from the Twitter stream and associating food category and location to them, WorldFoodMap permits to investigate and interactively visualize the popularity and trends of the shared food all over the world.	computer vision;hashtag;instagram;interactivity;online and offline;selfie;social media	Giuseppe Amato;Paolo Bolettieri;Vinicius Monteiro de Lira;Cristina Ioana Muntean;Raffaele Perego;Chiara Renso	2017		10.1145/3077136.3084142	computer science;trend analysis;multimedia;popularity;internet privacy;social media	AI	-26.136807790574498	-45.5913334090409	8920

As an example, the paper describes a class of formalized metrics for reasoning about the relative difficulties of agent navigation in various environments —not just whether one scenario is more difficult than another, but how much more difficult a scenario might be— and presents results of relative difficulty reasoning using a specific example metric. This illustrates that qualitative or heuristic agent properties, which are commonly unformalized and imprecise, may be formalized and rigorously analyzed using this approach. The paper also discusses the potential implementation of relative difficulty metrics in meta-intelligent agents.

Building credible characters requires a multidisciplinary approach, the behaviors that must be reproduced are very complex and must be decoded by their interlocutors. In this paper we introduce a kinesics model in order to select the nonverbal expression of intelligent virtual agents able to express their emotions and purposes using gestures and face expressions. Our model select the nonverbal expressions based on causal analysis, and data mining algorithms applied to perceptual studies in order to identify significant attributes in emotional face expressions.	algorithm;behavioral modeling;causal filter;data mining;intelligent agent;linear algebra;naive bayes classifier;symantec endpoint protection	María Lucila Morales-Rodríguez;Fabián Medellín-Martínez;Juan Javier González Barbosa	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-15534-5_19	artificial intelligence;multimedia	AI	-52.55849540388355	-47.73253428083249	8968

In these workflows, data describing biomedical entities, such as patients, bio-materials but also processes itself, is typically produced, modified and analyzed at different locations and by several systems. Therefore, both tracking entities within inter-organizational workflows and data integration are often crucial steps. To address these problems, we centrally register entities and their relationships by using a multi-layered model. The model utilizes an ontology and a typed system graph to semantically describe and classify entities and their relationships but also to access entity data on demand in their original source. Moreover, this integration approach allows to centrally track entities along the project workflows and can be used in explorative data analyses as well as by other data integration approaches using the registered entity relationships. We describe the model, the utilized ontology, and a system implementing this approach, which is applied in a large biomedical research project.	british informatics olympiad;entity;field (computer science);ontology (information science);system information (windows)	Toralf Kirsten;Alexander Kiel	2010			ontology-based data integration;data integration;data mining;ontology;database;data integrity;workflow;graph;computer science	DB	-41.29832495655321	1.457785055888141	9025

900c0a29557fb0b239cbaf9de1f60924eb32405c	the rise of the creative computers		There is common opinion that artificial intelligence and robotics may replace many jobs. This scenario is not limited to low-skill, low-knowledge jobs, but could also apply to automatization of activities that require highly specialistic expertise, such as medical problems and even scientific research. However, most people would agree that there exists at least one human ability that is nearly impossible to automate: creativity. We can build a computer capable of beating chess champion Garry Kasparov, but a machine could never write poetry or a piece of great music. But is this really true? In the last years, this question is attracting the interest of a growing number of researchers worldwide, leading to the emergence of a new scientific field—computational creativity—with dedicated conferences, books, and special issues in international journals. According to Colton and Wiggins (2012), computational creativity is ‘‘The philosophy, science and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative.’’ A more inclusive definition is provided by the Steering Committee of the Computational Creativity conference, which describes computational creativity as ‘‘a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy and the arts. The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends: to construct a program or computer capable of human-level creativity; to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans; to design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.’’ Yet, besides the above definitions, what are the concrete applications of this computational creativity? One example comes from the tech giant IBM, which is using its artificial intelligence system Watson to explore the potential of this approach in the food domain. IBM researchers have developed a system that is able to invent new recipes based on chosen ingredients or cooking styles. First, the machine uses natural language processing techniques to analyze thousands of existing recipes and recombine them into new recipes. Then, the system compares the ideas generated with data on the chemistry of food ingredients and the psychology of people’s likes and dislikes to model how the human palate might respond to different combinations of flavors. Other computational creativity applications are trying to simulate creativity in the creative domain ‘‘par excellence’’: art. In a paper, presented at the 2017 International Conference on Computational Creativity, researchers from the Art and AI Laboratory Rutgers University, Facebook AI Research, and Department of Art History at College of Charleston have described a new system for generating art by looking at paintings and learning about style. To build their system, these researchers have drawn on Colin Martindale’s psychological theory of art creation, which posits that artists produce novel works by increasing the arousal potential of their art to push against habituation. Starting from this hypothesis, they have realized a computational version of Martindale’s model using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two neural networks that are trained in an adversarial manner to generate data to simulate a given distribution. One of these networks was trained to recognize a large collection of art images from the 15th century to the 21st century with their style labels. A second network was used to generate random images and show them to the trained network, which either recognizes them as representing a particular artistic style or rejects them. Thus, the second network learns what the first network recognizes as art by a process of trial and error. To generate new styles, the researchers modified the GAN in order to make it capable of maximizing deviation from established styles and minimizing deviation from art distribution. Finally, the authors carried out an experiment to compare the response of human subjects to the generated art with their response to art created by artists. The results showed that human subjects could not distinguish art CyberSightings is a regular feature in CYBER that covers the news relevant to the Cyberpsychology community, including scientific breakthroughs, latest devices, conferences, book reviews, and general announcements of interest to researchers and clinicians.

2f2753b4b0632f2ed733206fe43c439fadbe6ecd	a study on the application of cultural elements in product design	cultural elements;design competition;consumer electronics industry	"""In recent years, there has been a trend of using Chinese/ Taiwanese cultural elements in consumer electronics (CE) products. This innovative design method has resulted in many works that won significant awards in Taiwan and international design competitions. The award-winning works included massproduced products and conceptual design works, and the great appraisals have proven that this kind of design method could create added-value for a product. Therefore, """"how to use design elements with cultural meanings"""" has become an important issue. This research has studied cases that used Chinese/Taiwanese cultural elements in product design, including five cases in Taiwan's electronics industry and 15 award-winning works in international design competitions. The purpose was to compare how the design methods used in mass-produced products are different from the ones used in conceptual design works. The results revealed that: 1) The mass-produced products utilized Chinese calligraphy and paintings as the main cultural elements, while the conceptual design works used Chinese calligraphy and paintings in not only artifacts and daily-use items, but also in the expression of custom and behavior, aesthetics, religion rituals, or even Chinese philosophy. 2) The mass-produced products made direct use of Chinese/Taiwanese cultural elements. Namely, some Chinese calligraphy and painting totems were copied on the products, thus presenting Chinese-style appearances. On the contrary, the award-winning works selected and translated the cultural elements more skillfully. The application of cultural elements was used in product appearances and functions. The designers were expressing their interpretation and deeper meanings of Chinese culture by their unique renovation. If the industrial designers could learn from these award-winning works and use the same kind of design method in CE products, new industrial opportunities could be created."""

a574cd1f2ae7771f7f5c64d7966d78573994cefa	radiallight: exploring radial peripheral leds for directional cues in head-mounted displays		Current head-mounted displays (HMDs) for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have a limited field-of-view (FOV). This limited FOV further decreases the already restricted human visual range and amplifies the problem of objects going out of view. Therefore, we explore the utility of augmenting HMDs with RadialLight, a peripheral light display implemented as 18 radially positioned LEDs around each eye to cue direction towards out-of-view objects. We first investigated direction estimation accuracy of multi-colored cues presented on one versus two eyes. We then evaluated direction estimation accuracy and search time performance for locating out-of-view objects in two representative 360° video VR scenarios. Key findings show that participants could not distinguish between LED cues presented to one or both eyes simultaneously, participants estimated LED cue direction within a maximum 11.8° average deviation, and out-of-view objects in less distracting scenarios were selected faster. Furthermore, we provide implications for building peripheral HMDs.	augmented reality;head-mounted display;peripheral;radial (radio);virtual reality;visual basic[.net]	Uwe Gruenefeld;Tim Claudius Stratmann;Abdallah El Ali;Susanne Boll;Wilko Heuten	2018		10.1145/3229434.3229437	peripheral;absolute deviation;light-emitting diode;virtual reality;computer vision;augmented reality;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-44.92592494497359	-47.260457452264795	9087

It ensures that all evaluator-users manipulate a unique shared corpus of data with a shared set of parameters to design and retrieve their evaluations. It therefore answers both the need for convergence among the evaluation practices and the consideration of several analytical points of view addressed by the evaluators involved in Spoken Dialogue System projects. After introducing the system architecture, we argue the solution’s added value in supporting a both data-driven and goal-driven process. We conclude with future works and perspectives of improvement upheld by human processes.	application framework;dialog system;interpreter (computing);spoken dialog systems;systems architecture;usability	Marianne Laurent;Philippe Bretier	2010			artificial intelligence;natural language processing;computer science;added value;systems architecture;studio;convergence (routing)	HCI	-39.64927708638841	-27.326316732612142	9108

In addition, there are some methods which based on the network community structure information to predict the missing links, however, these studies only concerned about the obvious information between different communities such as direct links. We found that it is hard to predict the missing links if the two communities have little direct connections. In fact, there is similarity between communities such as the similarity between nodes and this similarity is significant for prediction. So, we define a community similarity feature which named community relevance by using not only the obvious information but also the latent information between different communities in this paper. Then a novel algorithm which based on the community relevance and ruler inference is proposed to predict missing links. In this method, we extract the community structure by using the local information of the network first. Next, calculate the relevance of each pair of communities by using the new community relevance indices. Finally, a simple prediction model which based on ruler inference is applied to estimate the probability of the missing links. It is shown that the proposed method has more effective prediction accuracy and the community relevance features improve the predictor with low time complexity, with experiments on benchmark networks and real-world networks in different scales, and compared with other ten sate of the art approaches.	relevance	Jingyi Ding;Licheng Jiao;Jianshe Wu;Fang Liu	2016	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2016.01.034	computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;complex network	DB	-15.24930696541642	-43.30902635974617	9117
8257d26e810ef6c3b0cf7e09a073908ef6579ed4	formal aspects of component software (facs 2013)		Component-based software development is a paradigm that has been proposing sound engineering principles and techniques for coping with the complexity of software-intensive systems. However, many challenging conceptual and technological issues require further research. In particular, the advent of service-oriented and cloud computing has brought to the fore new dimensions, such as quality of service and robustness to withstand inevitable faults, which require established concepts to be revisited and new ones to be developed in order to meet the opportunities offered by those architectures. As software applications become themselves components of wider socio-technical systems, further challenges arise from the need to create and manage interactions, which can evolve in time and space, and rely on the use of resources that can change in non-computable ways. Formal methods have provided foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and certification. Whilst those avenues still need to be further explored, time is also ripe to bring new techniques to the fore, such as those based on stochastic models and simulation. The International Symposium on Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS) is an annual venue for researchers and practitioners interested in how formal methods can be used to make component-based development fit for the new architectures of today and the systems that are now pervading the socio-economic world. Its 10th edition was held in Nanchang, China, between October 27th and 29th, 2013, and attracted 51 submissions, of which 19 were accepted for presentation. This special issue includes four of the nine articles that the programme committee selected for further revision and significant extension to a journal version. They all underwent a thorough review process, with at least one international referee and a referee who had not reviewed the original submission to the symposium.	audio engineer;bcs-facs;cloud computing;component-based software engineering;computable function;formal methods;interaction;mathematical model;programming paradigm;quality of service;service-oriented infrastructure;simulation;sociotechnical system;software deployment;software development;stochastic process;venue (sound system);while	José Luiz Fiadeiro;Zhiming Liu	2015	Sci.

The paper presents a formal analysis of a notion of dependence between players, given in terms of standard game-theoretic notions of rationality such as dominant strategy and best response. This brings the notion of dependence within the realm of game theory providing it with the sort of mathematical foundations which still lacks. Concretely, the paper presents two results: first, it shows how the proposed notion of dependence allows for an elegant characterization of a property of reciprocity for outcomes in strategic games; and second, it shows how the notion can be used to define new classes of coalitional games, where coalitions can force outcomes only in the presence of reciprocal dependencies.	best practice;cognitive science;fold (higher-order function);foremost;game theory;multi-agent system;rationality	Davide Grossi;Paolo Turrini	2011	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1007/s10458-011-9176-3	combinatorial game theory;game theory;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;sequential game	AI	-10.048785127478101	-1.186596724413344	9242

While such decoding is an essential underpinning, much recent work suggests that natural language interlaces will never appear cooperative or graceful unless they also incorporate numerous non-literal aspects of communication, such as robust communication procedures. This toaper defends that view. but claims that direct imitation of human performance =s not the best way to =mplement many of these non-literal aspects of communication; that the new technology of powerful personal computers with integral graphics displays offers techniques superior to those of humans for these aspects, while still satistying human communication needs. The paper proposes interfaces based on a judicious mixture of these techniques and the still valuable methods of more traditional natural language interfaces. 1. I n t roduc t ion Most work so far on natural language communication between man and machine has dealt with its literal aspects. That is. natural language interlaces have implicitly adopted the position that their user's input encodes a request for intormation of; action, and that their job is tO decode the request, retrieve the information, or perform the action, and provide appropriate output back to the user. This is essentially what Thomas [24J cnlls the Encoding-Decoding model of conversation. While literal interpretation is a basic underpinning of communication, much recent work in artificial intelligence, linguistics, and related fields has shown that it is tar from the whole story in human communication. For example, appropriate interpretation of an utterance depends on assumptions about the speaker's intentions, and conversely, the sl.)eaker's goals influence what is said (Hobbs [13J, Thomas [24]). People often make mistakes in speaking and listening, and so have evolvod conventions for affecting regalrs-(Schegloll et el. [20J). There must also be a way of regulating the turns of participants in a conversation (Sacks et el. [10t). This is just a sampling of what we will collectively call non literal ~lspects ol communicat ion. The primary reason for using natural language in man-machine communication is to allow the user to express himsell mtturallyo and without hawng to learn a special language. However, it is becoming clear that providing for n,'ttural expression means dealing will1 tile non-literal well as the literal aspects ol communication; float the ability to interpret natural language literaUy does not in itself give a man-machine interlace the ability to communicate naturally. Some work on incorporating these non-literal aspects of communication into man-machine interfaces has already begun([6, 8, 9, 15, 21, 25]). The position I wish to stress in this paper is that natural language interfaces will never perform acceptably unless they deal with the non-literal as well as the literal aspects of communication: that without the non-literal aspects, they will always appear uncooperative, inflexible, unfriendly, and generally stupid to their users, leading to irritation, frustration, and an unwillingness to continue to be a user. This pos=tion is coming to be held fairly widely. However, I wish to go further and suggest that, in building non-literal aspects of communication into natural-language interfaces, we should aim for the most effective type of communication rather than insisting that the interface model human performance as exactly as possible. I believe that these two aims are not necessarily the same. especially given certain new technological trends (.lis(J ti ,'~s£~l below. Most attempts to incorporate non-literal aspects of communication into natural language interlaces have attempted to model human performance as closely as possible. The typical mode of communication in such an interface, in which system and user type alternately on a single scroll of pager (or scrolled display screen), has been used as an analogy to normal spoken human conversation in Wlllcll contmunicallon takes place over a similar half-duplex channel, i.e. a channel that only one party at a time can use witllout danger of confusion. Technology is outdating this model. Tl~e nascent generation of powerful personal computers (e.g. the ALTO ~23} or PERQ [18J) equipped with high-resolution bit-map graphics display screens and pointing devices allow the rapid display of large quantities of information and the maintenance of several independent communication channels for both output (division ol the screen into independent windows, highlighting, and other graphics techniques), and input (direction of keyboard input to different windows, poinling ,~put). I believe that this new technology can provide highly effective, natural language-based, communication between man and machine, but only il the half-duplex style of interaction described above is dropped. Rall~er than trying to imitate human convets~mon d=rectty, it will be more fruitful to use the capabilities of this new technology, whicl~ in some respects exceed those possessed by humans, to achieve the snme ends as the non-literal aspects of normal human conversation. Work by. for instance, Carey [31 and Hiltz 1121 shows how adaptable people aro to new communication situ~.~tlons, and there is every reason Io believe that people will adapt well to an interaction in which their communication ne~,ds are satisfied, even if they are satislied in a dilterent way than in ordinary human conversation. In the remainder of the paper I will sketch some human communication needs, and go on to suggest how they can be satisfied using the technology outlined above. 2.

COMOPTEVOR tests new systems (weapons, ships, aircraft, etc.) that industry develops and dependent upon test results, the Navy purchases. Each development spans several years and has a large number of documents in various formats. These related documents that all belong to a specific program are required to be available electronically to aid workflow, provide controlled dissemination, facilitate document discovery, and ensure achieves are maintained as personnel leave the organization. As a solution we have developed XMLCOT, an XML based language, to describe the family of files related to a specific programs as digital objects with a complex structure. The search tools to permit secondary users to find specific the files, retrieve them and simultaneously view the storage structure that provides addition meaning also use the same structure. To support interoperability with other digital libraries, the DL-COTF will present its metadata in compliance with the Open Archive Initiative (OAI). A key feature of this digital library environment is its ability to publish, search (discovery), navigate the complex digital objects and dynamically tailor the objects structure within the digital library.	archive;digital library;interoperability;library (computing);purchasing;xml	Kurt Maly;Mohammad Zubair;S.

In view of these specificities, a preprocessing model was designed, based on the main perceptual cues involved in the auditory perception of moving sound sources, such as the intensity, timbre, reverberation, and frequency shift processes. This model is the first step toward a more general moving sound source system, including a system of spatialization. Two applications of this model are presented: the simulation of a system involving rotating sources, the Leslie Cabinet and a 3D sound immersion installation based on the sonification of cosmic particles, the Cosmophone.	3d film;cosmic;coherence (physics);complex systems;covox speech thing;doppler effect;elementary;immersion (virtual reality);java;leslie speaker;max;mental representation;motion detector;open-source software;preprocessor;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;rendering (computer graphics);simulation;sonification;surround sound	Richard Kronland-Martinet;Thierry Voinier	2008	EURASIP J.

Although various visual interfaces for digital libraries have been developed in prototypical systems, very few of these visual approaches have been integrated into today’s digital libraries. In this position paper we argue that this is most likely due to the fact that the evaluation results of most visual systems lack comparability. There is no fix standard on how to evaluate visual interactive user interfaces. Therefore it is not possible to identify which approach is more suitable for a certain context. We feel that the comparability of evaluation results could be improved by building a common evaluation setup consisting of a reference system, based on a standardized corpus with fixed tasks and a panel for possible participants.	digital library;digital rights management;graphical user interface;library (computing);text corpus	Wilko van Hoek;Philipp Mayr	2014				HCI	-49.273693797936126	-39.92797176597148	9320

However, so far there is no any easy-to-use DEMATEL application software. Moreover, for DEMATEL, the threshold value setup may vary in different researchers. Later MMDE method was developed, which could obtain clear threshold value. However, its concept and complicated computing process hinder the common researchers to use it quickly. Without any related application software either, it is quite inconvenient to the researchers. Therefore, the study develops an application software that combines with these two methods and incorporates with friendly interfaces. In the paper, it takes how to develop Taiwan into a passenger transport center of East Asia as an example, to illustrate the operation and application of the software. It provides the researchers using DEMATEL and MMDE methods with an excellent and easy-to-good tool.

We propose, herein, a formal framework within which we investigate whether this ability can be autonomously learned. The framework makes explicit certain premises that we contend are central in such a learning task: (i) slow sensors may prevent the sensing of an action’s direct effects during learning; (ii) predictions need to be made reliably in future and novel situations. We initiate in this work a thorough investigation of the conditions under which learning is or is not feasible. Despite the very strong negative learnability results that we obtain, we also identify interesting special cases where learning is feasible and useful.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;causal filter;causality;deterministic finite automaton;learnability;rippling;sensor;side effect (computer science);test set	Loizos Michael	2011		10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/IJCAI11-174	simulation;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-20.294380404149496	-18.996091210045474	9335

b5d6084955f6c95a941a04e13335d4e61a5a822c	common understanding in a multi-agent system using ontology-guided learning		Traditionally, communication among agents has been established based on the group commitment to a common ontology which is unfortunately often too strong or unrealistic. In the real world of communicating agents, it is preferred to enable agents to exchange information while they keep their own individual ontology. While this assumption makes agents represent their knowledge more independently and give them more flexibility, it also adds to the complexity of communication. We believe that agents can overcome this complexity by using their learning capability. The agents can learn any concept they do not know but want to communicate about with other agents in the multi-agent system where they work in. Our goal in this paper is to present a general method for agents using ontologies to teach each other concepts to improve their communication, and therefore cooperation abilities. In our method, a particular agent that understands a concept only ambiguously intends to learn it by receiving positive and negative examples for that concept from the other agents. Then, utilizing one of the known concept learning methods, the agent learns the concept in question. In case of conflicts in the received set of examples, the learning agent asks other agents again to get involved in the learning process by taking votes. While this method allows agents not to share common ontologies, it enables agents to establish common grounds on the concepts known only by some of them if these common grounds are needed during cooperation. In fact, the learned concepts by an agent are compromised among the views of other agents the method improves the autonomy of agents using them significantly.	autonomy;concept learning;conceptualization (information science);experiment;filter (signal processing);instance (computer science);knowledge representation and reasoning;multi-agent system;need to know;ontology (information science);peer-to-peer	Mohsen Afsharchi;Arman Didandeh;Nima Mirbakhsh;Behrouz Homayoun Far	2012	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-012-0524-7	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	AI	-20.565956605282313	-10.173439883256503	9345

To be able to achieve this main objective, three distinct control methods were implemented in the IW: manual, shared and automatic. Several algorithms were developed for each of these control methods. This paper presents three of the most significant of those algorithms with emphasis on the shared control method. Experiments were performed by users suffering from cerebral palsy, using a realistic simulator, in order to validate the approach. The experiments revealed the importance of using shared (aided) controls for users with severe disabilities. The patients still felt having complete control over the wheelchair movement when using a shared control at a 50% level and thus this control type was very well accepted. Thus it may be used in intelligent wheelchairs since it is able to correct the direction in case of involuntary movements of the user but still gives him a sense of complete control over the IW movement.	algorithm;automatic control;experiment;iw engine;internationalization and localization;joystick;machine learning;prototype;simulation;usability;virtual reality	Brígida Mónica Faria;Luís Paulo Reis;Nuno Lau	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-013-0010-9	control engineering;embedded system;simulation;intelligent decision support system;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-40.6974265217367	-45.52969799308191	9354

We point out a naive solution to the main research question and justify the choices we make in the model we propose.	batch processing;brute-force search;entity;information extraction;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scalability;world wide web	Ndapandula Nakashole;Gerhard Weikum	2012			engineering;data science;data mining;management science	AI	-34.67827070206154	0.8212318001520144	9361
856da0d2913bbc73e7f12db9a6a95d7240487d72	identifying and weighting integration hypotheses on open data platforms	open data platforms;crowdsourcing;data integration	Open data platforms such as data.gov or opendata.socrata. com provide a huge amount of valuable information, publicly available to anyone. This data has the potential to drive innovation and lead to a more democratic and transparent society. Still, the platforms it is offered on have some unique problems: Their free-for-all nature, the lack of publishing standards and the multitude of domains and authors represented on these platforms lead to new integration and standardization problems, such as duplicated or partitioned datasets.  At the same time, crowd-based data integration techniques are emerging as new way of dealing with data integration problems. However, these methods still require input in form of specific questions or tasks that can be passed to the crowd. This paper identifies several classes of integration problems on Open Data Platforms, and proposes a method for identifying and ranking potential them in this context. In this method, an Open Data Platform is modeled as a graph of datasets, so that potentital integration problems, called integration hypotheses, can be identified by analyzing the graph for specific patterns.  The paper concludes with a comprehensive evaluation using one of the largest Open Data platforms, opendata.socrata.com.	algorithm;crowdsourcing;data mining;decision problem;discoverability;linked data;recommender system;resource description framework	Julian Eberius;Katrin Braunschweig;Maik Thiele;Wolfgang Lehner	2012		10.1145/2422604.2422608	computer science;data science;data integration;data mining;database;ontology-based data integration;world wide web;crowdsourcing	DB	-40.10599857050886	2.1708338989084686	9373

To estimate selectivity, we need an efficient and flexible structure to store a summary of the path expressions that are present in an XML document collection. In this paper we propose a new structure called SF-Tree to address the selectivity estimation problem. SF-Tree provides a flexible way for the users to choose among accuracy, space requirement and selectivity retrieval speed. It makes use of signature files to store the SPEs in a tree form to increase the selectivity retrieval speed and the accuracy of the retrieved selectivity. Our analysis shows that the probability that a selectivity estimation error occurs decreases exponentially with respect to the error size.

Adopting the model to analyze these data's clustering, the results show 9 in 22 enterprises lacked investment dynamic, which show that China's coal mine enterprises lacks safety investment dynamic, and governments and enterprises need strengthen the safety investment management.	cluster analysis;coal;government;statistical cluster	Li Bangsan;Cai Weihua	2010	2010 Third International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	10.1109/WKDD.2010.72	statistical classification;investment;computer science;data mining;occupational safety and health	ML	-8.34262332361195	-19.816059333921498	9396
7cf4614072230ef0ccc6215fca3eb21254e64e4d	discussions about lying with an ethical reasoning robot		The conversational ethical reasoning robot Immanuel is presented. Immanuel can reason about moral dilemmas from multiple ethical views. The reported study evaluates the perceived morality of the robot. The participants had a conversation with the robot on whether lying is permissibile in a given situation. Immanuel first signaled uncertainty about whether lying is right or wrong in the situation, then disagreed with the participant's view, and finally asked for justification. The results indicate that participants with a higher tendency to utilitarian judgments are initially more certain about their view as compared to participants with a higher tendency to deontological judgments. These differences vanish towards the end of the dialogue. Lying is defended and argued against by both utilitarian and deontologically oriented participants. The diversity of the reported arguments points to the variety of human moral judgment and calls for more fine-grained representations of moral reasons for social robots.

We present the design approach and philosophy of the UFC that is wearable, aesthetic, and intuitive. The UFC supports the interoperability of various communication interfaces among WLAN, Bluetooth and ZigBee devices. We developed a wireless gesture recognition device, called i -Throw, which is small enough to be worn on one's finger like a ring. The UFC, with the help of i -Throw, can control ubiquitous environment using an intuitive hand motion. To explain the practical use of the UFC platform and the user-friendly interaction with ubiquitous environment, we implemented a ubiquitous testbed where multiple UFC users interact with various ubiquitous devices or other UFC users. In addition, we implemented a practical application which makes it possible to exchange the various objects and control ubiquitous devices very easily.	bluetooth;coexist (image);environment variable;gesture recognition;implicit shape model;input device;interoperability;location-based service;testbed;ubiquitous computing;usability;user interface;wearable computer;wearable technology	Jupyung Lee;Seung-Ho Lim;Jong-Woon Yoo;Ki-Woong Park;Hyun-Jin Choi;Kyu Ho Park	2007	21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)	10.1109/AINAW.2007.63	embedded system;real-time computing;wearable computer;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;ubiquitous robot;ubiquitous computing	HCI	-42.393384645885746	-42.544032132142874	9410

We use computational game theory to model such data as the result of distributed decision-making at the reported granularity level (e.g., nations and states). To achieve our task, we posit the view of aggregated behavioral data as jointly randomized, or mixed, strategies of multiple agents. We propose a novel general machine-learning approach to learn game-theoretic models within a given hypothesis class of games from any potentially noisy dataset of mixed strategies. We illustrate our framework using publicly available data on vaccination rates in the continental USA. ACM Reference Format: Hau Chan and Luis E. Ortiz. 2018.

Prior work has been limited to extracting the most informative subgraph connecting two entities of interest. This paper extends and generalizes the state of the art by considering the relationships between two sets of entities given at query time. Our method, coined ESPRESSO, explains the connection between these sets in terms of a small number of relatedness cores: dense sub-graphs that have strong relations with both query sets. The intuition for this model is that the cores correspond to key events in which entities from both sets play a major role. For example, to explain the relationships between US politicians and European politicians, our method identifies events like the PRISM scandal and the Syrian Civil War as relatedness cores. Computing cores of bounded size is NP-hard. This paper presents efficient approximation algorithms. Our experiments with real-life knowledge graphs demonstrate the practical viability of our approach and, through user studies, the superior output quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.	approximation algorithm;entity;entity–relationship model;experiment;information;knowledge graph;np-hardness;prism (surveillance program);real life;social media;text corpus;usability testing;world wide web	Stephan Seufert;Klaus Berberich;Srikanta J.

80e45f697c7eda45af8f577aad649df976d52c74	data donors: sharing knowledge for mobile accessibility		Individuals regularly face challenges when interacting with their mobile devices particularly if they are not tech savvy users. When such difficulties occur, individuals often rely on more knowledgeable users to overcome difficulties. However, many do not have a support network of knowledgeable individuals available. Moreover, some challenges go beyond the need for guidance, as for example difficulties in performing swipes for motor impaired people. In this paper, we propose Data Donors, a conceptual framework proposing the enablement of users with the capacity to help others to do so by donating their mobile interaction data and knowledge. Inspired by charitable donations, we outline the Data Donors framework and discuss three applications that are being developed under the data donning paradigm. Through this work, we will explore the consequences and opportunities of sharing ones' data for the greater good and discuss the creation of global data donation programs.	accessibility;mobile device;mobile interaction;programming paradigm	Kyle Montague;Tiago João Vieira Guerreiro	2018		10.1145/3170427.3188627	data science;donation;human–computer interaction;data collection;conceptual framework;human computation;computer science;mobile computing;mobile device;mobile interaction;crowdsourcing	HCI	-59.30987062255453	-41.74902371367231	9471

We explored the potential of integrating gaze with hand gestures for remote interaction on a large display in terms of user experience and preference. We conducted a lab study to compare interaction in a photo-sorting task using gesture only, or the combination of gaze plus gesture. Results from the study show that a combination of gaze and gesture input can lead to significantly faster selection, reduced hand fatigue and increased ease of use compared to using only hand input. People largely preferred the combination of gaze for target selection and hand gestures for manipulation. However, gaze can cause particular kinds of errors and can induce a cost due to switching modalities.

In this contribution a novel approach for the numerical control of such a system based on human cognition and a cognitive engineered approach for the encoding of the system's a priori knowledge is introduced. The implementation using an established method in the field of design of cognitive systems is compared to a schema describing human decision making. Finally, simulation results of the implementation are compared to empirical tests with individuals.		Marcel Ph.

Social and cultural aspects (in particular derived from proxemics theory) are explicitly modeled in order to study the social network resulting from local spatial interactions and cultural differences. To this aim, an agent-based model based on SCA*PED (Situated Cellular Agents for PEdestrian Dynamics) is presented, where pedestrian dynamics result from the local interaction and behavior of an heterogeneous system of autonomous entities situated into a structured environment. The proposed model represents pedestrians' behaving according to local information and knowledge on two separated yet interconnected layers representing different aspects of the overall system dynamics (i.e. Spatial and Proxemic layer). The model explicitly represents on Proxemic layer how cultural differences can influence the perception of neighbors. The model is presented as a formal approach to study comfort properties in spaces where multicultural crowds share a limited structured environment.	multi-agent system;situated	Paola Lembo;Lorenza Manenti;Sara Manzoni	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15979-4_46	simulation;artificial intelligence;system dynamics;social network	AI	-18.82076183402479	-15.527362712798642	9558

A major advantage of UCAIR over many existing toolbars (e.g., Google toolbar) is that it can collect implicit feedback information from a user and exploit such information to improve retrieval accuracy for this user without requiring any additional effort from the user. While implicit feedback has been recognized as an effective technique for improving search accuracy [2, 1, 5, 6, 3], such functionality has not yet been delivered to users in assisting their web search. UCAIR is the first web search toolbar to support online implicit feedback effectively and efficiently. Specifically, it can (1) log a user’s interaction history with a search engine; (2) identify query coherence and search session boundaries; (3) perform implicit user modeling based on the past queries and the user-viewed results in the same search session; (4) selectively modify user queries based on implicit user modeling; (5) immediately re-rank search results once the user model is updated. As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a user’s search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module re-ranks any unseen search results immediately whenever the user model is updated. For example, when the user clicks on a search result to view the corresponding web page, UCAIR would assume that the clicked result summary is appealing to the user and may reflect the user’s information need. It would immediately re-rank the not-yet-viewed results based on the viewed summaries and attempt to pull up results that match the clicked summaries well while pushing down those results that are originally ranked high, but do not match the clicked summaries well. Thus when the user clicks on the “Back” button of the web browser or “Next” link of the search result page to view more re-	client-side;information needs;personalization;personalized search;plug-in (computing);session (web analytics);user modeling;web page;web search engine	Xuehua Shen;Bin Tan;ChengXiang Zhai	2005		10.1145/1076034.1076193	personalization;multimedia;world wide web;contextual advertising;information retrieval	Web+IR	-33.50641281933313	-51.55887303499797	9580

Yet, a design team must consider all these within an HII design in order to maximize the communication potential. This paper considers how simple and complex information requires different design strategies and how those strategies differ.	display resolution;human–computer interaction;information needs;information overload;relevance;self-information;spatial contextual awareness	Michael J.

5004dce0418e69d6b4a2db6abb2fcbc4311d33a0	sharededge: gps-free fine-grained travel time estimation in state-level highway systems		Estimating travel time on the highway in real time is of great importance for transportation services. Previous work has been mainly focusing on the city scale for a particular transportation system, e.g., taxi, bus, and metro. Little research has been conducted to estimate fine-grained real-time travel time in state-level highway systems. This is because the traditional solutions based on probe vehicles or loop sensors cannot scale to state-level highway systems due to their large spatial coverage. Recently, the adoption of Electric Toll Collection (ETC) systems (e.g. EZ-pass) brings a new opportunity to estimate the real-time travel time in the highway systems with little marginal cost. However, the key challenge is that ETC data only record the coarse-grained total travel time between a pair of toll stations rather than fine-grained travel time in each individual highway edge. To address this challenge, we design SharedEdge to estimate the fine-grained edge travel time with large-scale streaming ETC data. The key novelty is that we estimate real-time fine-grained travel time (i.e., edge travel time) without using fine-grained data (i.e. GPS trajectories or loop sensor data), by a few techniques based on Bayesian Graphical models and Expectation Maximization. More importantly, we implement our SharedEdge in the Guangdong Province, China with an ETC system covering 69 highways and 773 toll stations with a length of 7, 000 km. Based on this implementation, we evaluate SharedEdge in details by comparing it with some baselines and the state-of-the-art models. The evaluation results show that SharedEdge outperforms other methods in terms of travel time estimation accuracy when compared with the ground truth obtained by 114 thousand GPS-equipped vehicles.	concatenation;crowdsourcing;dijkstra's algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;fastest;game demo;global positioning system;goto;graphical model;ground truth;jam;marginal model;real-time clock;real-time locating system;sensor;shortest path problem;smartphone;sparse matrix;streaming media;throughput;traffic exchange;wearable technology	Yu Kyung Yang;Fan Zhang;Desheng Zhang	2018	IMWUT	10.1145/3191780	real-time computing;global positioning system;cyber-physical system;computer science	HCI	-16.565267945369385	-31.750752321122913	9651

For resource allocation problems, the well-known VCG mechanism satisfies a list of desired properties, including efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property. However, VCG is generally not budget-balanced. Under VCG, agents pay the VCG payments, which reduces social welfare. To offset the loss of social welfare due to the VCG payments, VCG redistribution mechanisms were introduced. These mechanisms aim to redistribute as much VCG payments back to the agents as possible, while maintaining the aforementioned desired properties of the VCG mechanism. We continue the search for worst-case optimal VCG redistribution mechanisms – mechanisms that maximize the fraction of total VCG payment redistributed in the worst case. Previously, a worst-case optimal VCG redistribution mechanism (denoted by WCO) was characterized for multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values [7]. Later, WCO was generalized to settings involving heterogeneous items [4], resulting in the HETERO mechanism. [4]conjecturedthat HETERO is feasible and worst-case optimal for heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand. In this paper, we propose a more natural way to generalize the WCO mechanism. We prove that our generalized mechanism, though represented differently, actually coincides with HETERO. Based on this new representation of HETERO, we prove that HETERO is indeed feasible and worst-case optimal in heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand. Finally, we conjecture that HETERO remains feasible and worst-case optimal in the even more general setting of combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes.	agent-based model;best, worst and average case;marginal model;multi-agent system;rationality;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mingyu Guo	2012			mechanism design	ECom	-4.672586372099287	-3.0391767168201733	9672
2e816794d1531d145bdaca8a7648cb56d65b6f05	an approach for context-based reasoning in ambient intelligence		Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a scientific field that refers to environments consisting of smart devices (sensors and actuators) that can sense and respond to the presence of people [1] . The availability of small, wearable, low-cost, power-efficient sensors, combined with advanced signal processing and information extraction, is driving the revolution in AmI domain. This revolution has enabled novel approaches and technologies for accurate measurements in the area of healthcare, enhanced sports and fitness training, and life-style monitoring. Early AmI systems included a single type of sensors that has made it possible to develop the first proof-ofconcept applications. As the field has matured, these systems have gained additional sensors, resulting in the development of advanced and more accurate multisensor techniques and applications. However, combining multiple sources of information from multiple sensors is a challenging task. The first issue is that each sensor has its own technical configuration (for example, the data sampling rate) and requires different data-processing techniques in order to first align the different sensor data, and later to extract useful information. The second issue is that even if the multi-source data is aligned, it can be challenging to find an intelligent way to combine this multi-source information in order to reason about the user or the environment. While several approaches for combining multiple sources of information and knowledge have been developed (such as Kalman filters, ensemble learning, and co-training), these approaches have not been specialized for AmI tasks. The doctoral dissertation [2] addresses the problem of combining multiple sources of information extracted from sensor data by proposing a novel context-based approach called CoReAmI (Context-based Reasoning in Ambient Intelligence). In particular, CoReAmI creates a multi-view perspective, in which each source of information is used as a context separately. 2 The CoReAmI approach	as-interface;align (company);ambient intelligence;co-training;ensemble learning;information extraction;information source;kalman filter;multi-source;sampling (signal processing);sensor;signal processing;smart device;source data;wearable computer	Hristijan Gjoreski	2015	Informatica (Slovenia)		computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining	AI	-10.654842610621138	-30.320224512856328	9687

Responsibilities are contracts or obligations of objects that they should assume, by aligning them to classes appropriately, quality designs realize. Typical conditions of a desirable design are having a low coupling between highly cohesive classes. However, because of a trade-off among such conditions, solutions that satisfy the conditions moderately are desired, and computer assistance is needed. Additionally, if we have an initial assignment, the improved one by our technique should keep the original assignment as much as possible because it involves with the intention of human designers. We represent such conditions as fuzzy constraints, and formulate CRA as FCSP. That enables us to apply common FCSP solvers to the problem and to derive solution representing a CRA. The conducted preliminary evaluation indicates the effectiveness of our technique.	constraint satisfaction problem;credit bureau;display resolution;loose coupling;norm (social)	Shinpei Hayashi;Takuto Yanagida;Motoshi Saeki;Hidenori Mimura	2014	2014 6th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice	10.1109/IWESEP.2014.13	mathematical optimization;generalized assignment problem;operations management;constraint satisfaction dual problem;mathematics;algorithm	SE	-12.263930213194156	-7.079360185990797	9721

Incident reporting systems are indeed complex systems that include many actors including the users reporting incidents, user’s colleagues and neighbors, stakeholders, policymakers, systems integrations. Incident report systems might change (positively or negatively) the users’ environment in many ways. In recent years, this kind of technique has been also been used in crisis management such as the hurricane Katrina. However, despite the fact that incident reporting systems using mobile technology are becoming more common, little is known about its actual use by the general population and which factors affect the user experience when using such system. In this paper we discuss the use of incident reporting system in critical context of use. In this paper we discuss the use of incident reporting system in several application domains. In particular we report findings in terms of dimensions that are aimed to identify social and technical aspects that can affect the design, development and use of incident reporting systems.	application domain;complex systems;user experience	Marco A.

Because of the difficulty of employing and scaling formal methods in this context, decision makers typically resort to informal methods, sacrificing structure and rigor. We are developing a new methodology that retains the ease of use, the familiarity, and (some of) the free-form nature of informal methods, while benefiting from the rigor, structure, and potential for automation characteristic of formal methods. Our approach records analysts' thinking in a corporate knowledge base consisting of structured arguments. The foundation of this knowledge base is an ontology of arguments that includes two main types of formal objects: argument templates and arguments. An argument template records an analytic method as a hierarchically structured set of interrelated questions, and an argument instantiates an argument template by answering the questions posed relative to a specific situation. This methodology emphasizes the use of simple inference structures as the foundation of its argument templates, making it possible for analysts to independently author new templates. When authoring an argument template, the analyst can choose to embed discovery tools, which are recommended methods of acquiring information pertaining to the questions posed. An analyst wanting to record an argument selects an appropriate template, uses the discovery tools to retrieve potentially relevant information, selects that information to retain as evidence and records its relevance, answers the questions, and records the rationale for the answers. The result is a recorded line of reasoning that breaks down the problem, bottoming out at the documents and other forms of information that were used as evidence to support the answers. The resulting collection of arguments and templates constitutes a corporate memory of analytic thought that can be directly exploited by analysts or automated methods.	design rationale;document;electronic discovery;formal methods;image scaling;knowledge base;relevance;usability	John D.

The simulation and analysis of models of these systems typically explore behaviour over a wide range of parameter values; as such, they are usually characterised by the need for non-trivial amounts of computing power. Grid computing provides access to such computational resources. In previous research we created the grid-enabled Biochemical Networks Simulation Environment (BioNessieG) to attempt to speedup system biology simulations over a grid (the UK National Grid Service and ScotGrid). Following on from this work, we have created the SIMAP Utility, a standalone simulation tool dedicated to the modelling and analysis of the EGFR-MAP kinase pathway. This builds on experiences from BioNessieG by decoupling the simulation modelling elements from the Grid middleware. This new utility enables us to interface with different grid technologies. This paper therefore describes the new SIMAP Utility and an empirical investigation of its performance when deployed over a desktop grid based on the High Throughput Computing middleware Condor. We present our results based on a case study with a model of the mammalian ErbB signaling pathway, a pathway strongly linked to cancer.	computational resource;coupling (computer programming);desktop computer;gene regulatory network;grid computing;high-throughput computing;middleware;simulation;speedup;systems biology;throughput	Xuan Liu;Simon J.

We have shared details of how VoyeurServer was developed and how it works so that data mining developers can develop their own customized data mining solutions built upon the Web-Harvest framework. We conclude the chapter with future directions of our data mining project so that developers can incorporate relevant features into their data mining applications.	data mining;social network analysis	Dhiraj Murthy;Alexander Gross;Alexander Takata;Stephanie Bond	2013		10.1007/978-94-007-6359-3_10	concept mining;engineering;data science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-43.284026155341984	-1.0769832475065264	9767

Anatomic knowledge represented in SNOMED CT uses SEP triplets; we anticipate that property chains will allow a more parsimonious organization of anatomic concepts. However, these constructs may lead to unanticipated inference, especially when scaling to large numbers of concepts [1]. We used a bottom-up approach based on targeted use case questions to iteratively develop a “micro theory” that both identifies the sensible locations of fractures in long bones and also supports logic-based classification of fractures. Alternative representations of the statement “fractures occur in bone” were explored with the aim of creating rich clinical descriptors that support classification for inference and data mining. The process of creating this micro theory is discussed, where pragmatic decisions were made with an intention of both constraining data entry and enabling inferences within the scope of the use cases.	bottom-up parsing;data mining;image scaling;occam's razor;symantec endpoint protection;systematized nomenclature of medicine;top-down and bottom-up design	Howard Goldberg;Vipul Kashyap;Kent A.

Our experience is that a representation system only supporting description logic is not able to master all the requirements that come along with the multiple usage of the knowledge to be represented. For an application with a dynamically changing knowledge base of deenitions, rules and facts additional paradigms like data{ driven programming and object{oriented programming are needed. To verify this, we discuss those aspects of our representation which play key roles, in order to support the demands of the domain representation and the requirements of the text generation.	description logic;documentation;knowledge base;knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language generation;requirement;simulation	Thorsten Liebig;Dietmar F.

41258bf98fa2a58851a8415fb962ff51aa400a32	feedback of flying disc throw with kinect and its evaluation	kinect;capture;feedback	Abstract This paper proposes a three-dimensional motion capture and feedback system for flying disc learners with use of Kinect device. Compared with conventional 3-D motion capture systems, Kinect has advantages of cost merit, easy system development and operation. The proposing system captures learners’ body movement, checks their skeleton positions in pre-motion/motion/post-motion in several aspects, and displays feedback messages to improve their motions. A novice learner of flying disc is trained to keep arm movement in steady height, to twist the waist, and to stretch the elbow according to the waist angle. A result of controlled experiment shows that the proposing system is effective for beginners to improve their movements.	kinect	Koji Yamaoka;Masataka Uehara;Takeshi Shima;Yasuhisa Tamura	2013		10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.174	computer vision;simulation;computer graphics (images)	NLP	-41.12491393578809	-40.76671438283267	9905

We consider the problem of exploratory search in large DLs of time-oriented data. We propose a novel approach for overview-first exploration of data collections based on user-selected metadata properties. In a 2D layout representing entities of the selected property are laid out based on their similarity with respect to the underlying data content. The display is enhanced by compact summarizations of underlying data elements, and forms the basis for exploratory navigation of users in the data space. The approach is proposed as an interface for visual exploration, leading the user to discover interesting relationships between data items relying on content-based similarity between data items and their respective metadata labels. We apply the method on real data sets from the earth observation community, showing its applicability and usefulness.	archive;dataspaces;digital library;entity;exploratory search;library (computing)	Jürgen Bernard;Tobias Ruppert;Maximilian Scherer;Jörn Kohlhammer;Tobias Schreck	2012		10.1145/2232817.2232844	earth observation;digital library;scientific method;information visualization;computer science;data mining;world wide web;data element;information retrieval;data mapping;metadata repository;data collection	DB	-30.504286004289355	-33.897796536751606	9908

The next advancement is the introduction of the stereoscopic display. Although a DPF with a stereoscopic display has already been released on the market, it only enables horizontal parallax. In this paper, we describe a different type of 3D display system based on a DPF and a fly's eye lens, both of which are commercially available. Our system enables not only horizontal but also vertical parallax because integral photography (IP) is used. IP was thought to be a technology of the future because a very high resolution LCD and a dedicated fly's eye lens were believed to be necessary. However, the extended fractional view (EFV) method[1] proposed by one of the authors enabled freely combining a wide range of LCDs and the relatively inexpensive fly's eye lenses available on the market to produce IP. It greatly contributed to the initial cost reduction. This new system uses the EFV method. The main problem is how to supply good content. Therefore, we also developed a method of producing the animation of IP by using CG technology.	cg (programming language);digital photo frame;digital photography;image resolution;integral imaging;liquid-crystal display;parallax;stereo display;stereoscopy	Masahiko Yoda;Akifumi Momose;Kazuhisa Yanaka	2009		10.1145/1666778.1666808	active shutter 3d system;computer vision;stereo display;computer science;stereopsis;multimedia;television;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-39.394896810394314	-40.277510214498086	9934

2650aa4d5ce8f909c813366ebcf671b30e157209	an efficient method of sharing mass spatio-temporal trajectory data based on cloudera impala for traffic distribution mapping in an urban city	data sharing;traffic distribution;information retrieval;bus transit;beidou positioning sensor;data retrieval;spatial temporal data;vehicle trajectories;cloud computing	The efficient sharing of spatio-temporal trajectory data is important to understand traffic congestion in mass data. However, the data volumes of bus networks in urban cities are growing rapidly, reaching daily volumes of one hundred million datapoints. Accessing and retrieving mass spatio-temporal trajectory data in any field is hard and inefficient due to limited computational capabilities and incomplete data organization mechanisms. Therefore, we propose an optimized and efficient spatio-temporal trajectory data retrieval method based on the Cloudera Impala query engine, called ESTRI, to enhance the efficiency of mass data sharing. As an excellent query tool for mass data, Impala can be applied for mass spatio-temporal trajectory data sharing. In ESTRI we extend the spatio-temporal trajectory data retrieval function of Impala and design a suitable data partitioning method. In our experiments, the Taiyuan BeiDou (BD) bus network is selected, containing 2300 buses with BD positioning sensors, producing 20 million records every day, resulting in two difficulties as described in the Introduction section. In addition, ESTRI and MongoDB are applied in experiments. The experiments show that ESTRI achieves the most efficient data retrieval compared to retrieval using MongoDB for data volumes of fifty million, one hundred million, one hundred and fifty million, and two hundred million. The performance of ESTRI is approximately seven times higher than that of MongoDB. The experiments show that ESTRI is an effective method for retrieving mass spatio-temporal trajectory data. Finally, bus distribution mapping in Taiyuan city is achieved, describing the buses density in different regions at different times throughout the day, which can be applied in future studies of transport, such as traffic scheduling, traffic planning and traffic behavior management in intelligent public transportation systems.	arabic numeral 100;automated planning and scheduling;beidou navigation satellite system;blu-ray;bus network;computation;computer;computers;data retrieval;effective method;experiment;futures studies;hl7publishingsubsection <query>;indexes;million;mongodb;network congestion;nosql;partial;question (inquiry);real-time clock;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;sensor	Lianjie Zhou;Nengcheng Chen;Sai Yuan;Zeqiang Chen	2016		10.3390/s16111813	embedded system;simulation;cloud computing;telecommunications;computer science;data mining;data retrieval	ML	-15.811850057391677	-32.77555512619325	9945

This sizable special issue is intended to mark this special anniversary and take the opportunity to look back at what has been achieved in the last 10 years of Genetic Programming (GP) and to start charting the terrain for potential new developments in the next 10 years. When putting together this special issue, we were particularly interested in high quality papers that reviewed or analysed progress in the field, presented the state-ofthe-art in the evolution of software and hardware, described promising new approaches and paradigms, suggested important new application areas, or provided an in-depth coverage of foundational topics and theoretical analyses in genetic programming and evolvable machines. Three articles were invited to act as reference points for the special issue: one on theoretical results in GP, a review of human-competitive applications of GP and one aimed at providing a snapshot of the published literature in GP. We then encouraged submissions that would complement these seeds thereby providing a full coverage of the topics we aimed for in this special issue. Twelve further papers were obtained through the open submission process. We would like to thank their authors for their willingness to contribute to this special issue. Some of the papers submitted, while very good contributions to the field, did not have the necessary breadth for inclusion in this special issue.

The InCA architecture relies on a personal agent that is aware of the user’s characteristics, and that coordinates the intervention of a set of expert cognitive agents (such as story telling agents, assessment agents, stimulation agents or help agents). This InCA architecture has been applied for the design of K-InCA, an e-learning system aimed at helping people to learn and adopt knowledge-sharing management practices.	cognition;intelligent agent	Thierry Nabeth;Albert A.

231729b92d3e6a99795d5ac959e7897ef9d92b69	revisiting the role of place in geographic information science		Although place-based investigations into human phenomena have been widely conducted in the social sciences over the last decades, this notion has only recently transgressed into Geographic Information Science (GIScience). Such a place-based GIS comprises research from computational place modeling on one end of the spectrum, to purely theoretical discussions on the other end. Central to all research that is concerned with place-based GIS is the notion of placing the individual at the center of the investigation, in order to assess human-environment relationships. This requires the formalization of place, which poses a number of challenges. The first challenge is unambiguously defining place, to subsequently be able to translate it into binary code, which computers and geographic information systems can handle. This formalization poses the next challenge, due to the inherent vagueness and subjectivity of human data. The last challenge is ensuring the transferability of results, requiring large samples of subjective data. In this paper, we re-examine the meaning of place in GIScience from a 2018 perspective, determine what is special about place, and how place is handled both in GIScience and in neighboring disciplines. We, therefore, adopt the view that space is a purely geographic notion, reflecting the dimensions of height, depth, and width in which all things occur and move, while place reflects the subjective human perception of segments of space based on context and experience. Our main research questions are whether place is or should be a significant (sub)topic in GIScience, whether it can be adequately addressed and handled with established GIScience methods, and, if not, which other disciplines must be considered to sufficiently account for place-based analyses. Our aim is to conflate findings from a vast and dynamic field in an attempt to position place-based GIS within the broader framework of GIScience.	geographic information science	Helena Merschdorf;Thomas Blaschke	2018	ISPRS Int.

The smallest AFLP, i.e. the family of linear bounded automata, and the family of context-sensitive languages defined by it are characterized as the smallest families having certain containment and closure properties. These properties motivate the definition of an ''abstract family of length-preserving operations,'' (AFLO), and a ''closed abstract, family of languages'' (closed AFL).

While broadcasting is a very energy-expensive protocol, it is also widely used as a building block for a variety of other network layer protocols. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption by optimizing broadcasting is a major improvement in heterogenous sensor networking. QoS-GBP is a distributed algorithm where nodes make local decisions on whether to transmit based on a geometric approach. QoS-GBP enables a tradeoff among the need for neighborhood information (communication overhead) and the delay. QoS-GBP is scalable to the change in network size, node type, node density and topology. QoS-GBP accommodates seamlessly such network changes, including the presence of actors and mobile nodes in heterogeneous sensor networks. Through simulation evaluations, we show that QoS-GBP is very scalable and guarantees minimum delay.	distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);quality of service;scalability;simulation	Arjan Durresi;Vamsi Paruchuri;Leonard Barolli	2005	8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)	10.1109/ISPAN.2005.71	broadcasting;real-time computing;broadcast communication network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	-40.06993984428339	-15.406784505080495	9987

As the demand for their use increases, particularly in providing backhaul for mobile networks, it is important that the microwave spectrum is exploited efficiently. This paper investigates the use of equipment selection algorithms within the microwave fixed-links frequency assignment problem. Standard data-rates are often supported by two alternative radio system types; one utilising a relatively lower-order modulation scheme and the other using relatively higher-order modulation. The higher-order modulation radios use less bandwidth to achieve the same data rate, but at the expense of higher wanted signal levels and lower interference thresholds. Hence while higher-order modulation is the more spectrally efficient option for an individual link considered in isolation, it may not be the most efficient when the wider network is taken into account. In this paper we provide a new model for the fixed link frequency assignment problem with equipment selection, formulated as an integer program, and investigate the nature of the trade-off between local and global spectral efficiency on a range of representative data.

Configuration and version management, added to maintenance cost are major players on this decision. However, heavy traffic loads and network latency impose severe penalties on users. A candidate solution to this problem must optimize users ergonomics whilst keeping maintenance costs low. In a straightforward approach, client architectures should provide web deployable local processing facilities. This paper describes an architecture based on the MVC paradigm capable of porting portions of the system to client executable scripts. Required entities are encapsulated in XML carriers and exchanged on demand between client and server side systems. Numerous user interactions are executed on the client side, relieving the network and improving responsivity. This solution not only enhances ergonomics but is also highly scalable, delegating tasks to the greater number of client machines, whereas focusing server activity on more relevant operations.	client-side;client–server model;entity;executable;high- and low-level;human factors and ergonomics;information system;interaction;model–view–controller;programming paradigm;requirement;scalability;server (computing);server-side;software deployment;software design pattern;systems design;thin client;version control;web service;while;world-system;xml	Ana Paula V.

This paper identifies the factors underlying this trend, finding that all three factors – technological opportunity, the market conditions factor, and the innovation policy factor – are important. Our study also found that Japanese pharmaceutical companies typically use foreign rather than domestic technologies, despite considerable investment by the Japanese government in biotechnology projects in the public sector. This underscores the importance of devising a mechanism to facilitate the application of research results in the public sector to innovation at private firms.	complex system	Kazuyuki Motohashi	2007	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2007.013439	economics;marketing;technology management;network information service;public sector;management;commerce	HCI	-40.068219850783485	-15.404643324250522	9993

However, it is not known if NDC architectures can improve the performance of big data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark.

The algorithm has two important characteristics: low computational complexity, comparable to that of orthogonal matching pursuit techniques, and recons truction accuracy of the same order as that of LP optimization methods. The presented analysis shows that in the noiseless setting, the proposed algorithm can exactly reconstruct ar bitrary sparse signals provided that the sensing matrix satisfies th e restricted isometry property with a constant parameter. In the noisy setting and in the case that the signal is not exactly sp arse, it can be shown that the mean squared error of the reconstruct ion is upper bounded by constant multiples of the measurement an d signal perturbation energies.	algorithm;autoregressive model;closing (morphology);compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;matching pursuit;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;restricted isometry property;sparse matrix	Wei Dai;Olgica Milenkovic	2008	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;machine learning;sparse approximation;mathematics;matching pursuit	ML	-40.05324973046364	-15.409791713118398	9995

This requires the robots to perform humanlike actions that are easily understandable byhumans. Learning by imitation is an effective framework that enables the robots to generate the same motions that humans do. However, it is generally not useful for the robots to generate motions that are precisely the same as learned motions because the environment is likely to be different from the environment where the motions were learned. The humanoid robot should synthesize motions that are adaptive to the current environment by modifying learned motions. Previous research encoded captured human whole-body motions into hidden Markov models, which are hereafter referred to as motion primitives, and generated human-like motions based on the acquired motion primitives. The contact between the body and the environment also needs to be controlled, so that the humanoid robot’s whole-bodymotion can be realized in its current environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to synthesizing kinematic data using the motion primitive and controlling the torques of all the joints in the humanoid robot to achieve the desired whole-bodymotions and contact forces. The experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach to synthesizing and controlling wholebody motions by humanoid robots. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The technique's biggest challenge is to reduce the time taken in finding the frequent patterns. Though there are various works available in literature on pattern mining, improving efficiency and scalability is still an important research issue. This paper presents a methodology using numerical approach to analyse large datasets and minimise the amount of data examined for generating candidate sets. The proposed algorithm uniquely encodes the data and the entire encoded database can be stored in main memory. This leads to the reduction in both space and time complexity. The frequent patterns are generated without any candidate set or tree construction. The performance of the algorithm is better with respect to both time and space compared to FP-growth and PFM algorithms.		K. V. Shanthi;J. Akilandeswari;G.

fd37104e8a8df773ea8003b2024dbad894d63f0c	deep learning for malicious flow detection		Cyber security has grown up to be a hot issue in recent years. How to identify potential malware becomes a challenging task. To tackle this challenge, we adopt deep learning approaches and perform flow detection on real data. However, real data often encounters an issue of imbalanced data distribution which will lead to a gradient dilution issue. When training a neural network, this problem will not only result in a bias toward the majority class but show the inability to learn from the minority classes. In this paper, we propose a Tree-Shaped Deep Neural Network (TSDNN) which classifies the data in a layer-wise manner. To better learn from the minority classes, we propose a Quantity Dependent Backpropagation (QDBP) algorithm which incorporates the knowledge of the disparity between classes. We evaluate our method on an imbalanced data set. Experimental result demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and justifies that the proposed method is able to overcome the difficulty of imbalanced learning. We also conduct a partial flow experiment which shows the feasibility of realtime detection and a zero-shot learning experiment which justifies the generalization capability of deep learning in cyber security.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;binocular disparity;computer security;deep learning;end-to-end principle;gradient;malware;multilayer perceptron;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;sensor;vii	Yun-Chun Chen;Yu-Jhe Li;Aragorn Tseng;Tsungnan Lin	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292316	machine learning;artificial neural network;artificial intelligence;deep learning;malware;flow (psychology);backpropagation;computer science	AI	-40.02691648538426	-15.405664601772836	9998

The results show that explicit power ramping can provide reasonable performance differentiation among traffic classes but it still cannot overcome coupling among traffic classes which exists due to preamble collisions and insufficient PDCCH resources.	angular defect;capture effect;compaq lte;coupling (computer programming);downtime;pool (computer science);priority queue;random access;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Jelena V.

Based on the model of the water hydraulic vane actuator, the simulation experiments with VSC controller are done and compared with PID controller. Simulation experiment results show that in position control applications, the use of VSC as the controller of the system can improve the dynamical and static state performances of the system. Especially, the VSC system provides higher-precision position as well as stronger robustness to parameters varieties than the PID control system. Also, the chattering has been effectively controlled and reduced in the VSC application by adding a boundary layer. The position control properties of the water hydraulic rotary actuator validate the effectiveness of the proposed VSC method.	control system;dynamical system;experiment;pid;performance;rotary woofer;shadow copy;simulation	Yang Yong	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485348	robust control;control engineering;rotary actuator;controller;engineering;hydraulic motor;control theory;servomotor;mechanical engineering	Robotics	-40.04975567573087	-15.422326048616512	10002

For this, we use a Bell-type inequality whose violation is considered as a signature for confirming the presence of genuine nonlocal correlations between the qubits. In order to demonstrate the effects of noise and weak measurements, an analytical relation is established between the maximum expectation value of three and four-qubit Svetlichny operators for the systems under study, noise parameter and strengths of weak measurements. Our results show that for a set of three- and four-qubit GHZ class states, maximal nonlocality does not coincide with maximum entanglement for a given noise parameter and a certain range of weak measurement parameter. Our analysis further shows an excellent agreement between the analytical and numerical results.	quantum nonlocality;weak measurement	Parvinder Singh;Atul Kumar	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-018-2016-5	qubit;inequality;quantum information;quantum entanglement;quantum mechanics;quantum nonlocality;robustness (computer science);expectation value;weak measurement;physics	HPC	-40.058947560704055	-15.414562447558001	10003

MultiNav, a prototype from GTE Laboratories, is based upon a multidimensional information model that affords new data exploration and semantically structured browsing interactions. The primary visual metaphor is based on sliding rods, each of which is associated with an information dimension from the underlying model. Users can interactively select value ranges along the rods in order to reveal hidden relationships as well as query and restrict the set through direct manipulation. A novel focus+context view is afforded in which detail about individual items is revealed within the context of the global multidimensional attribute space. We propose a novel interaction technique to change focus, which is based on dragging rods from side to side. We relate this work on multidimensional information visualization to other research in the area, including Parallel Coordinates, Dynamic Histograms, Dynamic Queries, and focus+context tables.*.	direct manipulation interface;drag and drop;information dimension;information model;information visualization;interaction technique;interactivity;parallel coordinates;prototype;rigs of rods	Tom Lanning;Kent Wittenburg;Michael Heinrichs;Christina Fyock;Glenn Li	2000		10.1145/345513.345306	computer vision;information visualization;parallel coordinates;human–computer interaction;information model;computer science;data mining;world wide web;interaction technique	HCI	-30.782166726877595	-33.70121982824209	10051

Phillips had shown this previously in a local area. However, with the satellite connection and projection screen, the authors were able to demonstrate the concept over a long distance to 1,000 people in an evening. This form of image distribution is certainly feasible over campus- or community-wide geographies today. Many academic and industry facilities are already wired for video distribution. One of the authors (R.A.E.) lives in a community where the cable service is implemented with fiber- optic distribution of up to 120 channels. Video displays fully integrated into computer workstations are rapidly becoming a reality. While full-motion video in a window is still expensive, video interfaces at slower rates are readily available. A separate video monitor adjacent to the workstation can also be used. Finally, video compression and decompression techniques make possible transmission at less than the full broadcast bandwidths. The capabilities the authors demonstrated will not become routine until there are wide-geography, fiber-optic networks dedicated to supporting scientific computing. These networks will carry image (both compressed and uncompressed), graphical, and numerical data at high speeds from centralized sources of computation, and image generation to users located around themore » country. The first high-speed network facilities are currently being implemented. The development of computer software and hardware to implement and take advantage of these local networks will prepare us for the day when they can be expanded nationally and internationally.« less	computational science	Robert B.

We therefore emphasize the role of legal story schemes (as opposed to factual story schemes that formed the heart of our previous proposal). Legal story schemes steer what needs to be proven, but are also selected on the basis of what can be proven. They provide a coherent, holistic legal perspective on a criminal case that steers investigation and decision making. We present an extension of our previously proposed hybrid theory of reasoning with evidence, by making the connection with reasoning towards legal consequences. We discuss the phenomenon of legal shifts that shows that the step from evidence to (proven) facts cannot be isolated from the step from proven facts to legal consequences. We show how legal shifts can be modelled in terms of legal story schemes. Our model is illustrated by a discussion of the Dutch Wamel murder case.	coherence (physics);enterprise legal management;holism	Floris Bex;Bart Verheij	2011		10.1145/2018358.2018360	case-based reasoning;computer science;artificial intelligence;empirical legal studies;management science;evidential reasoning approach	AI	-14.13006366928923	2.7878325365279046	10122

337d9548e9fccde03e9ed2c17faaf15ac4b85933	cae/vr integration - a qualitative assessment of advanced visualization for interactive conceptual simulations (ics) in industrial use		One of the key driving technologies for a better communication, representation, interaction, and visualization of design and engineering data has been Virtual Reality (VR). The idea of Interactive Conceptual Simulations (ICS) combines real-time interaction and visualization in a turn-around loop with the CAE simulation. However, the automation of the processes between the changes of the domain and the resulting simulation requires update rates within min 30 Hz, in order to remain interactive, not blocking the CG engine redrawing the update. Here, the overall simulation requires an advanced CAE process chain from model import, model manipulation, simulation results generation and visual preparation. Although many publications have been addressing the CAD/VR and only few the CAE/VR process chain, one might assume that endeavors for this are regarded as unnecessary, as a tidy showcase with a low-level quality visualization would be sufficient for engineers. This paper will object this hypothesis by presenting the results of a qualitative validation based on industrial use of our established VR environment for ICS. It follows the methodology and complements the quantitative analysis presented in earlier work providing the results of a qualitative assessment of engineers for our established VR based ICS post-processing unit (IDEFix – Immersive Data Explorer for CAx Integration).	computer simulation;interactivity;x/open	Holger Graf;André Stork	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91584-5_21	automation;simulation;visualization;immersion (virtual reality);virtual reality;computer science	HCI	-37.49923482285731	-31.637423336290336	10139

We summarily present experiments that show how a reinforcement learning backbone coupled with neural networks for approximation can indeed serve as a mechanism of the acquisition of game playing skill and we derive game interestingness measures that are inexpensive and straightforward to compute, yet also capture the relative quality of the game playing engine. We draw direct analogues to classical genetic algorithms and we stress that evolutionary development should be coupled with more traditional, expert-designed paths. That way the learning computer is exposed to tutorial games without having to revert to domain knowledge, thus facilitating the knowledge engineering life-cycle.	human–computer interaction;knowledge engineering;machine learning;pc game	Dimitrios Kalles;Christos Kalantzis	2008		10.3233/978-1-58603-900-4-59	game design;biological life cycle;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;game mechanics;machine learning;knowledge engineering	AI	-28.201042163846484	-17.73600740571907	10144

This can reduce the complexity of knowledge formulation, which can lead to wider user involvement in ontology authoring and improved efficiency of the knowledge engineering process. However, CNL-based tools for ontology engineering focus solely on providing a CNL interface, while ignoring the whole ontology construction process, and still require good knowledge engineering skills. We have developed a novel approach where a CNL-based tool has been designed to support the involvement of domain experts without knowledge engineering background in the overall ontology authoring process. This work has been inspired by the ontology authoring experience at Ordnance Survey, the mapping agency of Great Britain. The Ordnance Survey is developing a modular topographic domain ontology to facilitate the description and reuse of its topographic data by third parties [7]. At the heart of ontology development is the active involvement of domain experts (e.g. geographers and ecologists), which is reflected in the Ordnance Survey’s methodology for ontology construction [7], comprising of several steps: • Identifying the scope, purpose and other requirements of the ontology; • Gathering source knowledge and documents and identifying ontologies for reuse; • Capturing the ontology content in a knowledge glossary; • Formally defining core concepts and relationships between concepts by using structured English sentences; • Converting the structured English sentences into OWL1;	compute node linux;controlled natural language;glossary;knowledge engineering;ontology (information science);ontology engineering;requirement;structured english;topography;web ontology language	Ronald Denaux;Vania Dimitrova;Anthony G.

It is composed of a mobile base platform with obstacle detection sensors and a so-called application module with a head and movable arms. The embedded controller is programmed for various play scenarios like following a child or dancing. The system is intended to help children with minor motor disabilities or communication deficiencies like for instance autism, who are thereby expected to overcome their shortcomings. It is evident that an autonomous robot represents a potential hazard to its surrounding, in particular to handicapped children who cannot be assumed to react properly in the presence of an autonomously moving robot. Therefore, a RAMS analysis with emphasis on safety issues was performed with special respect to this specific therapeutic situation. This paper describes the methods used and the results found by applying a holistic HAZOP study with a novel two-fold approach to this specific case of a robotic system.	rams;robot	Petr Böhm;Thomas Gruber	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15651-9_2	reliability engineering;embedded system;simulation;engineering;autonomous system;artificial intelligence;social robot;dependability;computer security	Robotics	-40.02487101298165	-46.857594910258186	10168

Of the various maneuvers that comprise the highly complex driving task, each one requires understanding on the connections between driving states, vehicle performance and drivers' actions. This paper attempts to flesh out a complete picture of driving maneuvers on highways. Eighteen drivers participated in this study. They drove an instrumented vehicle on highways to accumulate 2,600 km naturalistic driving data. The data were segmented and classified into 11 maneuver groups manually. Analysis on the maneuvers revealed that: 1) A maneuver transition probabilities model was proposed. According to this model, 7 typical driving patterns were drawn based on the transition probabilities. Transition events pertaining to approaching/following/lane changing accounted for 95% of all the highway transition events. 2) The durations were 7.6/6.6 s and 7.1/7.0 s for free left/right lane changes and overtake from left/right lane changes, respectively. The numbers were 22.5, 21.4 and 16.3 s for far, middle and near following maneuvers, respectively. Statistical significances were found within both groups. 3) How drivers behave in each maneuver was analyzed. Drivers drove faster in free lane changes than did in overtake lane changes. For overtake lane changes, two driving patterns were observed: accelerate to change lane and decelerate to change lane.	device driver;markov chain;software deployment;statistical model;transition system	Guofa Li;Shengbo Eben Li;Lijuan Jia;Wenjun Wang;Bo Cheng;Fang Chen	2015	2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2015.286	simulation;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	-18.91577760469715	-27.534944889232094	10183

However, people differ regarding the way they seek, retrieve, process, comprehend, organize and recall information, based on their individual perceptual characteristics, cognitive skills, abilities and styles. Therefore, the point and the motion of the eye gaze could reveal behavioural patterns related to individual cognitive differences; patterns that are extracted using eye tracking tools which quantify and provide compelling data regarding eye gaze movement. In this paper we review the current literature regarding the effect between the FD-I cognitive style of users in visual exploration and search activities and to correlate these with objective measures gathered through eye-tracking.	behavioral pattern;cognition;eye tracking;graphical user interface;microsoft windows;soul	George E.

Many socioeconomic as well as ecological factors must be considered, requiring the integration of spatially explicit multidisciplinary data. The Land-Use Change Analysis System or LUCAS has been developed to study the effects of land-use on landscape structure in such areas as the Little Tennessee river basin in western North Carolina and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. These effects include land-cover change and species habitat suitability. The map layers used by LUCAS are derived from remotely sensed images, census and ownership maps, topological maps and output from econometric models. A public-domain geographic information system (GIS) is used to store, display and analyze these map layers. A parallel version of LUCAS (pLUCAS) was developed using the parallel virtual machine (PVM) on a network of workstations giving a speedup factor of 10.77 with 20 nodes. A parallel model is necessary for simulations on larger domains or for maps with a much higher resolution.	distributed computing environment;simulation	Brett C. Hazen;Michael W. Berry	1997	Simul. Pr.

Broadly speaking, Web Intelligence is a new direction for scientific research and development that explores the fundamental roles as well as practical impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI)1 and advanced Information Technology (IT) on the next generation of Web-empowered systems, services, and environments. The WI technologies revolutionize the way in which information is gathered, stored, processed, presented, shared, and used by virtualization, globalization, standardization, personalization, and portals. As more detailed blueprints and issues of Web Intelligence (WI) are being evolved and specified [4,13,17,19,24], it has been recognized that one of the fundamental goals of WI research is to understand and develop Wisdom Web based intelligent systems that integrate all the human-level capabilities such as realtime response, robustness, autonomous interaction with their environment, communication with natural language, commonsense reasoning, planning, learning, discovery and creativity. Turing gave the first scientific discussion of human level machine intelligence [12]. Newell and Simon made a start on programming computers for general intelligence [8]. McCarthy argued that reaching human-level AI requires programs that deal with the commonsense informative situation, in which the phenomena to be taken into account in achieving a goal are not fixed in advance [6]. Laird and Lent proposed using interactive computer games that are the killer application for human-level AI research, because they can provide the environments for research on the right kinds of problem that lead to the type of incremental and integrative research needed to achieve human-level AI [2]. The new generation of WI research and development needs to understand multiple natures of intelligence in depth, by studying integrately the three intelligence related research areas: machine intelligence, human intelligence, and social intelligence, as shown in Figure 1, towards developing truly human-level Web intelligence.

Often, however, the source database may have been updated since the result was derived, and the source tuples of interest are not in the database any more. In such situations, the provenance management system has to reconstruct relevant historical fragments of the source database as they were at derivation time. In this paper, we develop techniques to address this problem. Our experimental assessment shows that these techniques do so efficiently, and with low storage overhead.	overhead (computing)	Jing Zhang;H. V.

With the rise of ubiquitous computing, there is the opportunity to improve such models with data that make for better proxies of human presence in cities. In this paper, we leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for crime prediction, as informed by theories in criminology and urban studies. We employ averaging and boosting ensemble techniques from machine learning, to investigate their power in predicting yearly counts for different types of crimes occurring in New York City at census tract level. Our study shows that spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on census and POI data. The proposed models achieve absolute R2 $R^{2}$ metrics of up to 65% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89% (on a temporal out-of-sample test set). This proves that, next to the residential population of an area, the ambient population there is strongly predictive of the area’s crime levels. We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults are already well predicted by the census features. Furthermore, we identify and discuss top predictive features for the main crime categories. These results offer valuable insights for those responsible for urban policy or law enforcement.

The feasibility of a full on-body UHF RFID-based FAD is here investigated for the first time. The system is aimed at providing impaired people suffering from a lack of thermal feeling, due to pathological disorders, with a realtime feedback of the temperature sensed by the fingertips. The considered RFID-FAD comprises an epidermal tag suitable to conformal application over the fingertip and an interrogation wrist patch antenna. The electromagnetic challenge concerns the possibility to establish a robust RFID link when both the reader antenna and the passive fingertip tag are attached onto the lossy human skin. The occurring near-field interaction is modeled by a two-port system and experimentally tested by means of a 3D hand mockup made by additive manufacturing. Simulations and measurement permitted to derive the upper-bound performance and to estimate the required power budget. The idea is finally demonstrated with a proof of concept in a realistic application.	3d printing;computer simulation;experiment;lossy compression;peripheral;radio-frequency identification;real-time computing;ultra high frequency;utility functions on indivisible goods;wearable technology	V.

17dbefd3992cacc5f410f5b5cc9bb6182f821004	new method to measure end-to-end delay of virtual reality	virtual reality;end to end delay	A virtual reality (VR) system tracks one or more objects to generate the depiction of a virtual environment from the user's vantage point. No system achieves this instantaneously: changes in the depicted virtual environment are delayed from changes in the position of the objects being tracked. In this paper, a method is proposed to quantify this time difference, the end-to-end delay of the VR system. Two light-sensing devices and two luminance gradients are used to simultaneously encode the position of one tracked object and its virtual counterpart. One light-sensing device is attached to the tracked object and it captures light from the gradient in the physical environment. The other device captures light from the gradient in the virtual environment. A measurement is obtained by moving the tracked object repetitively (by hand) across the gradient. The end-to-end delay is the asynchrony between the signals generated by the two light-sensing devices. The results collected with oscillatory movements performed at different frequencies indicate that for some VR systems, the end-to-end delay might not be constant but could vary as a function of the oscillation frequency.	encode;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;gradient;virtual reality	Massimiliano Di Luca	2010	PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments	10.1162/pres_a_00023	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;end-to-end delay;virtual reality;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-39.15408883496072	-41.72714687001501	10286

d1cd76b9fee2acf695ae11118fea253a32546b5c	detecting perceived quality of interaction with a robot using contextual features	computer vision and robotics autonomous systems;human computer interaction;manniska datorinteraktion interaktionsdesign;datorseende och robotik autonoma system	This work aims to advance the state of the art in exploring the role of task, social context and their interdependencies in the automatic prediction of affective and social dimensions in human–robot interaction. We explored several SVMs-based models with different features extracted from a set of context logs collected in a human–robot interaction experiment where children play a chess game with a social robot. The features include information about the game and the social context at the interaction level (overall features) and at the game turn level (turn-based features). While overall features capture game and social context at the interaction level, turn-based features attempt to encode the dependencies of game and social context at each turn of the game. Results showed that game and social context-based features can be successfully used to predict dimensions of quality of interaction with the robot. In particular, overall features proved to perform equally or better than turn-based features, and game context-based features more effective than social context-based features. Our results show that the interplay between game and social context-based features, combined with features encoding their dependencies, lead to higher recognition performances for a subset of dimensions.	robot;sensor	Ginevra Castellano;Iolanda Leite;Ana Paiva	2017	Auton.

ee6cd5949e752b80fcf376a56540e5ac174fb6da	personal portrait of giorgio levi	giorgio levi;personal portrait	Giorgio Levi has two great fortunes: he has a noble smile and he survived a heart attack. These are the important facts about his personality, and they are so evident that there is no need for this modest portrait, which does little more than stating the obvious. I should perhaps start by sketching my relation with Giorgio, so that my point of view is clear: I owe my life to him. In 1991, he gave me a PhD position, at a point where I was despising myself and what I had studied before. Of course, a PhD could have been the coup de grâce, but it turned out to be what I needed to get back to life and to a more balanced judgement. Giorgio wanted to advise me just after being in a talk I gave, without knowing me before, and without me asking him for a PhD. He must have guessed. The PhD affair between Giorgio and me had as much to do with personal relationship as with science and research. At the end of my studies, I left Pisa, and I never went back to Italian academia. However, Giorgio and I have had frequent personal and professional contacts ever since. I think that my detachment from Italian academia makes for a dispassionate portrait, as much as it can be about somebody who saved my life. The first thing that everybody notices is that Giorgio talks and talks fast, all the time. This is an unmistakable mark of people from the northeast of Italy, where Giorgio was born. They are the descendants of the Venice merchants, who used to trade with all the civilisations and built wonderful cities in their homeland. Giorgio has inherited their curiosity and charm, and their passion for the sea. When he swims, Giorgio’s urge to talk stops. He swims slowly in all the seas of the world, for hours at a time, often with others, sometimes in friendly challenges, around rocks and islands, silently. I think that he is listening to the sea, maybe as he would listen to his mother. I never met her, but I saw the hand-knitted sweaters she made for him, and that he reverently wears. I imagine that when Giorgio was with her, at her house in front of the sea in Varigotti, he would listen. Giorgio grew up among many women, and maybe this is why he is so good at speaking with his eyes and with his smile. He knows all the ways of subliminal communication. On the other hand, I have the impression that, despite his immediate empathy with everybody, he does not have many close friends, especially among colleagues. He seems to enjoy the natural solitude of the kings for his most private feelings. For sure, Giorgio is potently seductive, so maybe this is his way to defend himself from the adoring crowds. In the mid 1980s, Giorgio had his heart attack, and he had to have a difficult multi-bypass operation in Texas, something that only a few surgeons in the world would perform. Maybe because of that, he has a sense of urgency in his expression, something that says hurry, there’s little time. He does not wait until tomorrow, and is justified in living more freely than he would otherwise. So many times he told me that he would likely not be alive the next year. But Giorgio’s body is not failing him: quite the contrary. With the excuse of having little time, Giorgio does not save his energies, and he does not miss opportunities.	crosstalk;failure;michael friendly;my baby (series);point of view (computer hardware company)	Alessio Guglielmi	2009	Theor.

Moreover, if these multiagent systems are viewed as open systems , the problem is complicated even further by the fact that adherence to such a supposedly agree d sp cification cannot be ensured on the side of other agents. This paper presents an architecture for dealing with a very g neric type of prespecified communication patterns (which contain surface st ructure and logical constraint specifications) based on an empirical semanticsmodel of communication. This model allows for flexible adaptation to evolvin g communication semantics by combining existing expectations about the use of communication with empirical observation. This architecture is based on the InFFrA social reasoning framework and the concept of interaction frames. We show how interaction frames t hat represent classes of interaction situations can be used to conduct decision-t heoretic reasoning about communication when interpreted using the empirical semant ics approach. We introduce the abstract architecture, a formal model for i ts probabilistic semantics and present results of an experimental validation o f our approach in a complex domain that illustrate its effectiveness.	access control list;agent architecture;agent-based model;cluster analysis;decision theory;exploit (computer security);formal language;frequency counter;fuzzy clustering;game theory;high- and low-level;interaction protocol;machine learning;mathematical model;mental state;messaging pattern;multi-agent system;open system (computing);probabilistic semantics;semantics (computer science)	Felix A.

fb35bdee14ee24010c94ab445a20e1d9f4ba5ef1	on the representation and the impact of reliability on expert system weights	expert system	Rule-based expert systems employ weighting schemas that associate weights with a rule. In the development of an expert system the reliability of the rules may be a critical variable. However, currently, weighting systems do not facilitate accounting for reliability. Accordingly, this paper demonstrates how to introduce reliability into one of the primary systems for weighting the rules. After the introduction of reliability a number of findings are discovered. First, small changes in reliability can lead to substantial changes in the adjusted weights. Second, when reliability is completely uncertain the weights become 0. Third, introducing reliability can change the signs of the revised weights. Fourth, it is unlikely that heuristics can be effectively used instead of an analytic approach.	expert system	Daniel E.

But one of the disadvantages is that it can only access the full‐text image CD‐ROM database via local area network environment. This paper proposes a new method to solve this problem. The method uses hash function as data structure and image document process technique to perform a practical library full‐text image CD‐ROM database retrieving system. The results of its function can reduce users storage space, allow multi‐users to retrieve the same CD‐ROM database, and allow users to retrieve and print out full text image CD‐ROM database via campus network.	ascii art;cd-rom;digital library	Ruey-Shun Chen;C.

These line congruences are the solution space of spatial 4C mechanisms which will guide a moving body through the four prescribed poses. Hence, the contributions of this paper are applicable to developing interactive tools for designing spatial 4C mechanisms for four pose motion generation. Moreover, the strategies employed to address this difficult interactive visualization challenge are presented. The goal here being to facilitate future works which address other interactive visualization challenges. First, a methodology for generating a parameterized representation of the line congruences is reviewed. This is followed by strategies for visually representing the line congruences which are appropriate for both workstation and immersive virtual reality computer graphics. Next, strategies and supporting algorithms for interacting with the line congruences to obtain solution mechanisms with fixed links or coupler links in desired regions of the workspace are presented. The result is an intuitive interactive visual design methodology for generating and interacting with the line congruences associated with four general finite spatial poses for spatial 4C mechanism design. It is our desire that this effort, albeit focused upon the challenge of creating computer-aided design environments for spatial 4C mechanisms, will facilitate as well as motivate other efforts to address the inherent visualization and interaction challenges in designing three dimensional mechanical systems.	acoustic coupler;algorithm;computer graphics;computer-aided design;feasible region;immersion (virtual reality);interaction;interactive visualization;virtual reality;workspace;workstation	Pierre M.

There is a lack of specialized interface devices for tabletop computing environments. G-raffe overcomes the limitation of conventional 2-D interactions inherited from the vertical desktop computing setting. We adopted a rollable metal tape structure to create up and down movements in a small volume of the block. This also becomes a connecting device for a mobile display to be used with the tabletop computer.

601ef1be71391c63b4c36e2b3cc883e3e8c6da7f	the applied issues in visual perception and action: preface to a special issue	article	Perception and action is an essential part of human behavior. To design user-friendly interfaces and displays that provide users with precise and appropriate information, display and interaction design engineers must understand how people perceive and act in the world. Much research has studied the underlying mechanisms responsible for human perception and action (e.g., regarding perception and control of self-motion: [7,8]; regarding vergence control under accommodation mismatch: [13]; regarding ocular movements during vection perception: [6]). The findings of such fundamental research are important but usually cannot be directly applied to display and interaction designs. To bridge this gap, the purpose of this special issue is to collect a number of innovative research and review articles to highlight some interesting and important recent examples of links between human perception and action and their applications in display and interaction designs. Three related aspects of human perception and action are addressed. First, regarding perception and control of self-motion, humans use multiple visual strategies for the control of steering toward a goal [9]. Some of these strategies are simple heuristics based on perceptual variables, which can also guide intercepting moving targets and obstacle avoidance [12]. In addition, human brain responses to visual collision events are modulated by change in size (looming) and stereo-depth (binocular motion) cues [2]. The applications of these research findings include the design of effective navigational interfaces, biomimetic robots, and unmanned vehicles. As aging affects the precision of steering control during driving under low-contrast visibility conditions [11], design engineers should take the controller’s age into consideration when designing effective navigational interfaces. For brain-damaged patients, training stroke survivors with interactive motion videogames to induce constrained movement helps their balance control [5]. Second, regarding space perception, several methods are proposed to help improve the interface design of Virtual Reality (VR) systems. The proposed methods include a set of techniques that use known perceptual limitations and illusions to allow seemingly natural walking through a large virtual environment in a confined lab space [4], a novel technique to correctly render 3D virtual objects to an observer who moves freely in front of the display [14], and techniques to compensate for the underestimation of egocentric distance in large screen immersive displays [1]. To mitigate user perception of spurious image motion in VR systems arising from head tracking latency, design engineers should consider	binocular vision;biomimetics;color vision;depth perception;heuristic (computer science);interaction design;interaction technique;modulation;motion capture;obstacle avoidance;robot;unmanned aerial vehicle;usability;vergence;virtual reality	Li Li;Richard H.

Even inexperienced users with little computer graphics and digital design background can use them to create 3D models rapidly. However, the development of sketch-based applications is usually difficult and time consuming. In this paper, we present a framework for simplifying the development of sketch-based 3D modelling applications. The framework integrates existing techniques for 3D sketch processing with a processing pipeline for sketch input, a state-machine for defining processing parameters and modes, and a customised event handler. The modular design means that the functionality of the framework can be easily extended in the future. Experimental results suggest that the framework is easy to use and the implemented functionalities work correctly.	3d modeling;application programming interface;computer graphics;event (computing);experience;finite-state machine;location-based service;logic synthesis;modular design;sketch	Yi Zeng;Zijiang Song;Burkhard Wünsche	2014			surface reconstruction;sketch-based modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;sketch recognition;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-40.93754682247534	-31.455541133624223	10464

71cd93572d0a539f6e5a5beb8835c0f8dd7dc251	the information-theoretic and algorithmic approach to human, animal and artificial cognition		We survey concepts at the frontier of research connecting ar tificial, animal and human cognition to computation and information pro cessing—from the Turing test to Searle’s Chinese Room argument, from Integra d Information Theory to computational and algorithmic complexity. We start b y arguing that passing the Turing test is a trivial computational problem and that i ts pragmatic difficulty sheds light on the computational nature of the human mind mor e than it does on the challenge of artificial intelligence. We then review our proposed algorithmic information-theoretic measures for quantifying and chara cterizing cognition in various forms. These are capable of accounting for known biases in human behavior, thus vindicating a computational algorithmic view of cogni tion as first suggested by Turing, but this time rooted in the concept of algorithmic pr obability, which in turn is based on computational universality while being indepen dent of computational model, and which has the virtue of being predictive and testa ble s a model theory of cognitive behavior.

Extensible Style Language-Formatting Objects, or XSL-FO, is a set of tools developers and web designers use to describe page printouts of their XML (including XHTML) documents. If you need to produce high quality printed material from your XML documents, then XSL-FO provides the bridge. #R##N#XSL-FO is one of the few books to go beyond a basic introduction to the technology. While many books touch on XSL-FO in their treatment of XSLT, this book offers in-depth coverage of XSL-FO's features and strengths. Author Dave Pawson is well known in the XSLT and XSL-FO communities, and maintains the XSLT FAQ. An online version of this book has helped many developers master this technology. XSL-FO is the first time this reference is available in print. #R##N#The first part of the book provides an overview of the technology and introduces the XSL-FO vocabulary. Pawson discusses how to choose among today's implementations, explains how to describe pages, and shows you what is going on in the processor in terms of layout. You'll learn about the basics of formatting and layout as well as readability. #R##N#The second part focuses on smaller pieces: blocks, inline structures, graphics, color and character level formatting, concluding by showing how to integrate these parts into a coherent whole. XSL-FO also explores organizational aspects you'll need to consider, such as how to design your stylesheets strategically rather than letting them evolve on their own. #R##N#XSL-FO is more than just a guide to the technology; the book teaches you how to think about the formatting of your documents and guides you through the questions you'll need to ask to ensure that your printed documents meet the same high standards as your computer-generated content. Written for experienced XML developers and web designers, it contains more -- and more useful -- information on this practical technology than any other work of its kind.

cc722e5b043d6f6902b210196a8265798704b704	a model for interactive computation: applications to speech research	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	"""The speech research community has developed numerous toolkits to support ongoing research (e.g., Sapphire, Spire, Waves, HTK, CSLU Tools, LNKNet). While such toolkits contain extensive and useful functionality, they offer limited user interactivity under the pre-compute and browse paradigm: images are first pre-computed in entirety, then displayed, at which point the user is able to superficially browse them, by scrolling, placing cursors and marks, etc. Such isolation of computation from user-interaction limits what speech researchers are able to explore and learn. This thesis proposes a novel speech toolkit architecture, called MUSE, that enables highly interactive tools by integrating computation with interaction and display into a seamless architecture. MUSE, embedded in the Python language, allows the programmer to abstractly express a tool's functionality without concern as to details of the tool's implementation. At run-time, MUSE combines incremental computation, lazy-evaluation, change propagation and caching to enable interactivity. MUSE tools exhibit a powerful continuous user interface, offering real-time response to a continuous series of actions taken by the user. In addition, MUSE's incremental computation model enables new forms of interaction. One tool allows the user to interactively """"edit"""" a spectrogram; a lexical access tool allows the user to phonetically transcribe an utterance in any order and view a real-time word graph of matches; a Gaussian mixture tool illustrates fitting a model to data using the K-Means and EM algorithms. Because Sapphire is one of the more interactive speech toolkits, I directly compare MUSE and Sapphire on the basis of six proposed metrics of interactivity (high coverage, rapid response, pipelining, backgrounding, flexibility and scalability). MUSE demonstrates faster response times to change, and, unlike Sapphire, does not degrade with longer utterances. Such scalability allows MUSE users to effectively interact with very long utterances. Further, MUSE's adaptable memory model can quickly trade off memory usage and response time: on one example tool where Sapphire consumes 56 MB of memory and offers a 61 msec response time, MUSE can be configured between 26 MB/30 msec and 9.3 MB/471 msec. These results demonstrate that MUSE is a viable architecture for creating highly interactive speech tools. Thesis Supervisor: James R.

cd722091ccadbd8946c514f510e9000192943410	partitioned indexes for entity search over rdf knowledge bases	index;clustering;entity search;sparql query	The rapid growth of RDF data in RDF knowledge bases calls for efficient query processing techniques. This paper focuses on the star-style SPARQL join queries, which is very common when users want to search information of entities from RDF knowledge bases. We observe that the computational cost of such queries mainly comes from loading a large portion of predicate-ahead indexes. We therefore propose to partition the whole RDF knowledge bases based on the schema of individual entities, so that only entities of similar schemas are allocated into the same cluster. Such a partitioning strategy generates a pruning mechanism that effectively isolate the correlations of partitions and the queries. Consequently, queries are only conducted over a small number of partitions with small predicate-ahead indexes. Experiments over a large real-life RDF data set show the significant performance improvements achieved by our partitioned indexing techniques.

The concept and system of  MR-Collab are developed based on the Benford's Mixed-Reality boundaries theory. This paper presents how this theory is used as a tool to analyze the system framework and guide the design of the  MR-Collab system. The technique details of prototype and application scenario of this system are also elaborated in the paper. The system,  MR-Collab , is designed in the purpose of facilitating collaboration between distributed users through the Mixed Reality environment. Experimentation that can measure the correlations between the design performance/behaviors with the increased degree of co-presence is also planned in this paper.	mixed reality;prototype	Rui Wang;Xiangyu Wang	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88011-0_15	augmented reality;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;operating system;multimedia;user interface	HCI	-52.00631818362617	-36.3594642863344	10563

Just as it is common today to read starting conditions such as initial weather conditions, for a scientific simulation from a file, it should be equally as easy to draw starting conditions on-demand from live data streams. But efforts to date to bring streaming data to the grid have lacked generality. In this article we introduce a new model for bringing existing data streams systems onto the grid. The model is predicated on the ability to identify stream systems that meet the criteria of being a “data resource”. We establish the criteria in this article, and define a grid service architecture for a data streams resource that leverages standardization efforts in the Global Grid Forum. We discuss key research issues in realizing the data streams model. We are currently developing a prototype of this architecture using our dQUOB system.	prototype;simulation;stream (computing)	Beth Plale	2004	Scientific Programming		semantic grid;data management;computer science;data grid;data mining;database;publish–subscribe pattern;world wide web;drmaa;grid computing	HPC	-37.76281406535442	0.9605684371977351	10594

The focus of this paper is to investigate the multiplex power-law distributions and retweeting patterns on Twitter platform. To achieve this goal, we analyze the multiplex power-law distributions from relationship network based on unidirectional and bidirectional follow connections and interaction network based on user and tweet entities. Further, we explain the observed features on each network. Additionally, we also explore the emergent pattern of tweet retweeting path and analyze their generative mechanisms. The observed results show that mining Twitter data from various angles could obtain more interesting discoveries in social networks.	agent-based model;directed graph;emergence;entity;information exchange;interaction network;mined;multiplexing;reblogging;simulation;social network;software propagation;time complexity;truncation	Bin Jiang;Lei Wang;Chao Yang;Renfa Li	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382155	computer science;data science;pareto distribution;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;social network	Web+IR	-19.32061113600031	-42.16889250091346	10618

Then an algorithm is proposed which uses the least possible number of a prior and conditional probabilities as its input and which computes the lower and upper bounds for higher order conditional and joint probabilities, so that these be consistent with the input probabilities provided. In the case, when inconsistent lower and upper bounds are obtained, it is suggested how the latter can be turned into consistent ones, by changing the values of only these input probabilities which are directly represented in the higher order probability under consideration. Secondly, a number of typical cases with respect to the problems of aggregation and propagation of uncertainty in expert systems is considered. It is shown how these can be treated by using higher order joint probabilities. For this purpose no global assumptions for independence of evidence and for mutual exclu-siveness of hypotheses are required, since the presence of independent and/or dependent pieces of evidence, as well as the presence of mutually exclusive hypotheses, is explicitly encoded in the input probabilities and thus, such a presence is automatically detected by the algorithm when computing higher order joint probabilities. © 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	expert system	Dimiter Driankov	1989	Int.

Touch may provide us with an extra tool in this quest. In this paper we demonstrate the role of touch in interaction between a robot and a human. We show how infrared sensors located on robots can be easily used to detect and distinguish human interaction, in this case interaction with individual children. This application of infrared sensors potentially has many uses; for example, in entertainment or service robotics. This system could also benefit therapy or rehabilitation, where the observation and recording of movement and interaction is important. In the long term, this technique might enable robots to adapt to individuals or individual types of user. c © 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.	human–robot interaction;robot;robotics;sensor	Tamie Salter;Kerstin Dautenhahn;I.

c1841bad5cbd18eb6537e343fbc9bfcd13cb8850	distributed publisher-subscriber architectures performance for robotics virtual reality applications: a case study on mqtt		Virtual Reality has been traditionally explored in many robotics systems, with applications such as off-line programming, trajectory planning, teleoperation, education, design, natural user interfaces and rehabilitation. Implementing these features in an all-in-one monolithic solution can be complex and slow. Also, new trends in automation, notably the Internet of Things, represent promissing technological improvements to the robotics field. This paper presents an alternative for developing such distributed and evolutive applications by defining a minimalistic set of commands for physical and virtual robots and integrating them with a publisher-subscriber network, commonly used with Internet of Things. This allows several configurations, depending on the available modules and on which elements subscribe to each topic. Thus, we discuss the performance of a small network comprising 3 agents: one input application acting as a real-time publisher and two subscribers associated with a physical and a virtual robot. All machine clocks are synchronized with the IEEE 1588-2008 protocol and the application packages are stored with timestamps on log files for evaluating metrics such as the package transmission rate and the latency. Results indicate that the overall performance on a local area network for this kind of application is beyond the physical robot's maximum update rate. Further tests might consider other time syncing mechanisms, wireless networks and different configurations with more network nodes.	3d rendering;algorithm;data logger;global positioning system;internet of things;interpolation;mqtt;multi-function printer;natural user interface;online and offline;precision time protocol;real-time transcription;robot;robotics;row hammer;smt placement equipment;virtual reality	Leandro Mattioli;Daniel S.

Built for many reasons and appliances, the use of ontologies in real-life applications remains limited. The WalkOnWeb project has developed ontologies in the area of recreational routing and applied them in a real application. This demonstration will show these applications and explain how they use ontologies. With the “Walk Planner” hikers can plan their trip by looking for trails, creating new routes and getting detailed information in print, web or mobile format. Authors can create and describe routes using the “Authoring Tool”. By creating ontologies and using them in these applications the WalkOnWeb project has developed a system to publish electronic routes in a flexible and personalized way.	ontology (information science);personalization;real life;routing	Bert Paepen	2007			idef5;navigation;xml;computer science;ontology;data mining;scalable vector graphics;database;world wide web	AI	-40.13118151644812	-24.634153700247193	10775

The common origin of traffic accidents is driver error. This is not going to change anytime soon thanks to the immense number of cell-phone users, in-car entertainment audio and video systems, and finally abundant traffic. There's one death every four minutes due to road accident in India. Such severe situation asks for a better scope that can propitiate the burden on the human drivers in certain critical instants. This demands a computationally efficient and fast responsive decision-making methods. But the course of autonomous vehicles is still in its early stages with companies still booming to build a fully autonomous vehicle. Volvo, Google, Tesla, BMW and more are still in the autonomous car research area. The mechanization and industrial science related to this field will mature over time, it is only a matter of time where the capability of driverless cars will outpace the outlook of any vehicle in the city. This paper exemplifies a novel approach to figure out the steering angle required to control the vehicle in the center of the road.	action potential;algorithmic efficiency;anytime algorithm;assembly language;autonomous car;autonomous robot;computation;existential quantification;hough transform;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile phone;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;tesla (microarchitecture);time complexity	Vishnu S.

b8dd1ad15e2048c0e660312b85ad05cbbe1bc6f0	cooperation among rational agents in co-action equilibrium of prisoner's dilemma and other single-stage symmetric games		The conventional solution concept used for solving non-cooperative games is that of the Nash equilibrium a strategy choice by each player so that no player can do better by deviating unilaterally from it. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework referred to as the co-action equilibrium for solving such games. This equilibrium is guaranteed to exist for all games having a symmetric payoff structure. It also has the advantage of being unique for a given game. We analyze in detail three well-known two-person single-stage games, viz., Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD), Chicken and Stag Hunt, to illustrate the differences between Nash and co-action solutions. The latter, in general, lead to “nicer” strategies being selected by the agents resulting in globally more efficient outcomes. For example, the co-action equilibrium in PD corresponds to full cooperation among agents at lower values of temptation to defect, while for higher temptation each agent employs a probabilistic (or mixed) strategy, thus essentially solving the dilemma. The key idea underlying the co-action solution is that agents make independent choices from the possible actions available, taking into account that other agents will behave the same way as them and they are also aware of this. It defines a new benchmark strategy for agents in non-cooperative games which is very different from the existing ones. The concept can be generalized to game situations where the symmetry assumption does not hold across all agents by clustering players into different symmetry groups that results in a novel class of games.	benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;nash equilibrium;prisoner's dilemma;rational agent;software bug;viz: the computer game	V.

A list finder extracts logical tables from a webpage. A record and replay (R+R) system records a user's interactions with a webpage, and replays them programmatically. The research community has invested substantial work in list finding --- variously called wrapper induction, structured data extraction, and template detection. In contrast, researchers largely considered the browser R+R problem solved until recently, when webpage complexity and interactivity began to rise. We argue that the increase in interactivity necessitates the use of new, more robust R+R approaches, which will facilitate the PBD web tools of the future. Because robust R+R is difficult to build and understand, we argue that tool developers need an R+R layer that they can treat as a black box. We have designed an easy-to-use API that allows programmers to use and even customize R+R, without having to understand R+R internals. We have instantiated our API in Ringer, our robust R+R tool. We use the API to implement WebCombine, a PBD scraping tool. A WebCombine user demonstrates how to collect the first row of a relational dataset, and the tool collects all remaining rows. WebCombine uses the Ringer API to handle navigation between pages, enabling users to scrape from modern, interaction-heavy pages. We demonstrate WebCombine by collecting a 3,787,146 row dataset from Google Scholar that allows us to explore the relationship between researchers' years of experience and their papers' citation counts.

Researchers in Gaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality are interested in what it is that draws and holds a user's attention. Most of these works are focused on active engagement and high stimulus. nite_aura is an audio-visual, interactive installation exploring physical, auditory and visual motion within an immersive environment. In this project, we tried to create an alternative immersive environment focusing on sensual and physical interaction with audio and visual aspects. The immersive environment created is an environment of introspection rather than achievement. The work investigates the effect of the texture of space, light and sound in providing a comforting, relaxed immersion.	augmented reality;human–computer interaction;immersion (virtual reality);introspection;virtual reality	Jinsil Seo;Greg Corness	2007		10.1145/1280720.1280773	simulation;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-54.86818420356166	-36.192959116826266	10842

We present a system, GeoFaceExplorer, for collecting, processing, browsing, and analyzing this data. GeoFaceExplorer allows for the crowdsourced collection of human facial images, as well as automated and interactive visual analysis of the geo-dependence of facial appearance and visual attributes, such as ethnicity, gender, and whether or not a person is wearing glasses. As a case study, automated approaches are applied to detect common facial attributes in a large set of geo-tagged human faces, leading to several analysis results that illuminate the relationship between raw facial appearance, facial attributes, and geographic location. We show how the distribution of these attributes differs in ten major urban areas. Our analysis also shows a similar expected distribution of ethnicity within large urban areas in comparison to manually collected U.S. census data. In addition, by applying automated hierarchical clustering to facial attribute similarity, we find a large degree of overlap between discovered regional clusters and geographical and national boundaries.	cluster analysis;crowdsourcing;geographic coordinate system;hierarchical clustering;information source;interactive visual analysis	Connor Greenwell;Scott Spurlock;Richard Souvenir;Nathan Jacobs	2014		10.1145/2676440.2676443	computer vision;geography;data mining;communication	Vision	-20.29978434290232	-35.22570090707766	10851

311cf26570efd1e05c57d5c86dc935938ae612c8	the massif platform: a modular and semantic platform for the development of flexible iot services		In the Internet of Things (IoT), data-producing entities sense their environment and transmit these observations to a data processing platform for further analysis. Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making. To show the strengths of the platform, two use cases are detailed and thoroughly evaluated.	algorithmic efficiency;context awareness;entity;internet of things	Pieter Bonte;Femke Ongenae;Femke De Backere;Jeroen Schaballie;Dörthe Arndt;Stijn Verstichel;Erik Mannens;Rik Van de Walle;Filip De Turck	2016	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-016-0969-1	computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;database	AI	-38.535961058941616	0.7201516511967582	10866

These relationships capture both a connectivity of entities as well as similarity of entities based on a specific notion of similarity called r-isomorphism. It formalizes these notions for the RDF data model, by introducing a notion of a Property Sequence as a type. In the context of a graph model such as that for RDF, Semantic Associations amount to specific certain graph signatures. Specifically, they refer to sequences (i.e. directed paths) here called Property Sequences, between entities, networks of Property Sequences (i.e. undirected paths), or subgraphs of r-isomorphic Property Sequences.The ability to query about the existence of such relationships is fundamental to tasks in analytical domains such as national security and business intelligence, where tasks often focus on finding complex yet meaningful and obscured relationships between entities. However, support for such queries is lacking in contemporary query systems, including those for RDF.	data model;electronic signature;entity;graph (discrete mathematics);resource description framework;semantic web	Kemafor Anyanwu;Amit P.

Rapid urbanization and development of new colonies leads to high rate of land use change and natural resource degradation since last three decades which has been accumulating the fragility of the area. Consequently entire Himalaya foothill zone requires a comprehensive local level geo-environmental appraisal for effective sustainable development planning of the region. Keep in view this; the Ramnagar Himalayan Foothill area (RHFA) in district Nainital, Uttarakhand (India) has been selected for the case illustration. The main objective of the study was to develop a GIS database on Ramnagar environmental geo-informatics (REGI) to facilitate all the concern line departments to implement their socioeconomic developmental activities in the most suitable and safe places throughout the study area. REGI suggests, although landscape of the study area have few favorable conditions for the inhabitant (i.e. maximum proportion (92 %) of the study area enjoys sub-tropical to sub-temperate climatic conditions, easy approachable, thick vegetation cover, rich water resources) but the active tectonics and dynamic hydrological process and its associated reshaped geomorphology poses a stressed geo-environment which need to be consider to formulate a decision support system (DSS) for sustainable development planning.	towns	Pradeep K.

In this paper, we present an approach to the design of robotic systems, that is based on the explicit representation of knowledge about context. The goal of the approach is to improve the system performance, by dynamically tailoring the functionalities of the robot to the specific features of the situation at hand. While the idea of using contextual knowledge is not new, the proposed approach generalizes previous work and its advantages are discussed through a case study including several experiments. In particular, we identify many attempts to use contextual knowledge in several basic functionalities of a mobile robot such as: behaviors, navigation, exploration, localization, mapping and perception. We then show how re-designing our mobile platform with a common representation of contextual knowledge, leads to interesting improvements in many of the above mentioned components, thus achieving greater flexibility and robustness in the face of different situations. Moreover, a clear separation of contextual knowledge leads to a design methodology, which supports the design of small specialized system components instead of complex self-contained subsystems.	experiment;internationalization and localization;mobile operating system;mobile robot;software deployment	Daniele Calisi;Luca Iocchi;Daniele Nardi;Carlo Matteo Scalzo;Vittorio A.

Operator activity during control of a social robot is studied. Customer satisfaction is proposed as an important metric for evaluating the performance of a human-robot team for social interactions with customers. Based on the modeling, fan-out of a social robot team can be calculated, and the performance of the team is estimated by simulation.

XPERSim achieves such high quality visualization by using the Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine 3D (Ogre) engine to render the simulation whose dynamics are calculated using the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE).

The web of (linked) data has encouraged a proliferation of identifiers for the concepts captured in datasets; with each dataset using their own identifier. A key data integration challenge is linking the co-referent identifiers, i.e. identifying and linking the equivalent concept in every dataset. Exacerbating this challenge, the datasets model the data differently, so when is one representation truly the same as another? Finally, different users have their own task and domain specific notions of equivalence that are driven by their operational knowledge. Consumers of the data need to be able to choose the notion of operational equivalence to be applied for the context of their application. We highlight the challenges of automatically computing co-reference and the need for capturing the context of the equivalence. This context is then used to control the co-reference computation. Ultimately, the context will enable data consumers to decide which co-references to include in their applications.	computation;fits;identifier;identity management;linked data;observational equivalence;turing completeness;world wide web	Christian Y.

Several opinion dynamics models have been proposed to characterize how a user iteratively updates her expressed opinion based on her innate opinion and the opinion of her neighbors. The extent to how much a user is influenced by her neighboring opinions, as opposed to her own innate opinion, is governed by a measure of her 'conformity' parameter. Characterizing this degree of conformity for users of a social network is critical for several applications such as debiasing online surveys and finding social influencers. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating these conformity values for users, using only the expressed opinions and the social graph. We pose this problem in a constrained optimization framework and design efficient algorithms, which we validate on both synthetic and real-world Twitter data. Using these estimated conformity values, we then address the problem of identifying the smallest subset of users in a social graph that, when seeded initially with some non-neutral opinions, can accurately explain the current opinion values of users in the entire social graph.

Our data comes from an ethnographic study we conducted in a video design studio in Barcelona. The analysis focuses on the role of questions triggering the formation of multimodal remembering sequences (MRSs). This study suggests that questions acting as reminders foster the formation of MRSs. MRSs are supported by an on-the-fly integration and coordination of multiple contextually relevant resources. Our preliminary findings are relevant for the development of new design-rationale systems in HCI that consider such complex dynamics.	complex dynamics;design rationale;human–computer interaction;multimodal interaction	Lucas M.

The quality and potential of the chapters may distract from hard questions about their real contribution to biological science or to advances in AI. The work described here is still largely that of AI applications research. The emphasis in most chapters is on tool development for biological research in challenging areas of interpretation and rationalization of observed phenomena. These areas require the intuition and experience of domain experts, but they also offer the opportunity for expert systems and automation. Unfortunately, there is as yet little evidence of successful laboratory use of this. Hunter concedes that computation in biology has so far proceeded without AI, despite its use elsewhere. He believes that AI must now make its own new discoveries, rather than repeat results from conventional means, if it is to gain widespread and practical acceptance. This book may reinforce the view that AI techniques have contributed nothing new to biology, but demonstrate more potential than progress. This publication also undoubtedly represents the influence of a new opportunity for AI; the Human Genome Project, which may allow AI techniques to prove themselves in an area whose needs cannot otherwise be met. This global research endeavour to determine the molecular meaning of life is generating an abundance of data with a complexity which exceeds the capacity of conventional computational techniques. These data raise many problems of interpretation which cannot be easily addressed, perhaps most noticeably in the prediction of the protein structure from DNA sequence. The need for symbolic manipulation and reasoning argues strongly for the use of artificial intelligence techniques in these areas, as is clearly demonstrated by the contributors to this book. Thus a new opportunity is being provided by molecular biology for AI which only requires that the latter is sufficiently mature to begin a lively and productive relationship.	applications of artificial intelligence;computation;computational biology;endeavour (supercomputer);expert system;international standard book number;interpretation (logic);lively kernel	B.

We use this technique in the Embedded database SQLite of Fixed Assets Management System. The results of experiment show, compared to B+-tree in the same conditions, the space utilization of S-B tree is above B+-tree about 30% on the average. S-B tree also has a better performance on sequence query and random query operations.	b+ tree;b-tree;embedded database;embedded system;management system;sqlite;self-balancing binary search tree	Kai-yin Huang;Yan-shan He;Peng-fei Chen;Xiao-yun Chen;Long-jie Li	2009	2009 First International Workshop on Database Technology and Applications	10.1109/DBTA.2009.35	segment tree;database index;information science;computer science;technology management;theoretical computer science;order statistic tree;incremental decision tree;data mining;interval tree;database;fractal tree index;search tree;k-d-b-tree	DB	-28.246209073606714	2.0416437002678567	10989
24bfcb52bfdff4913d33613551b7da338c72f8e3	semantics: intuition, experiment or illusion?		Externalist theories in natural language semantics have become the orthodoxy since Kripke is widely thought to have refuted descriptive theories involving internal cognitive representation of meaning. This shift may be seen in developments in philosophy of language of the 1970s – the direct reference “revolution against Frege” (Wettstein 2004, 66). Almog (2005, 493) writes of the “uprising against Frege’s doctrines” that “spread like fire” based on the work of Kripke, Donnellan, Putnam and Kaplan. However, I consider Fodor’s (2004) heretical thought that something has gone “awfully wrong” in this philosophical consensus, perhaps confirming Chomsky’s (1992) view that the whole field of philosophical semantics is “utterly wrongheaded” and “crazy” by virtue of its non-naturalist assumptions and “methodological dualism.” I suggest that the externalist orthodoxy is a kind of cognitive illusion seen elsewhere in philosophy and cognitive science.	cognitive science;experiment;frege;kaplan–meier estimator;natural language;putnam model;theory	Peter Slezak	2013			psychology;cognitive psychology;communication;social psychology	AI	-12.74108138016483	3.2640025454065436	10997

Since only external actions are observable, a proxy must be used that represents someone’s interests. Techniques like collaborative filtering, behavioral targeting, and hashtag analysis implicitly model an individual’s interests. I argue that these models are limited to shallow, temporary interests, which do not reflect people’s deeper interests or passions. I propose an alternative model of interests that takes advantage of a user’s social graph. The basic principle is that people only follow those that interest them, so the social graph is an effective and robust proxy for	collaboration graph;collaborative filtering;hashtag;observable;proxy server;social graph;social network	Brian Lee Yung Rowe	2014	CoRR		data mining;social psychology	Security	-20.664511944101392	-43.22512645273423	11018

Among them, one of the active topics is constraint-based trip recommendation for meeting user's personal requirements. Although a number of studies on this topic have been proposed in literatures, most of them only regard the user-specific constraints as some filtering conditions for planning the trip. In fact, immersing the constraints into travel recommendation systems to provide a personalized trip is desired for users. Furthermore, time complexity of trip planning from a set of attractions is sensitive to the scalability of travel regions. Hence, how to reduce the computational cost by parallel cloud computing techniques is also a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Personalized Trip Recommendation (PTR) to efficiently recommend the personalized trips meeting multiple constraints of users by mining user's check-in behaviors. In PTR, a mining-based module is first proposed to estimate the scores of attractions by considering both of user-based preferences and temporal-based properties. Then, a trip planning algorithm named Parallel Trip-Mine+ is proposed to efficiently plan the trip that satisfies multiple user-specific constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on travel recommendation that considers the issues of multiple constraints, social relationship, temporal property and parallel computing simultaneously. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations on a real check-in dataset obtained from Gowalla, PTR is shown to deliver excellent performance.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;automated planning and scheduling;cloud computing;experiment;parallel computing;pay to surf;personalization;recommender system;requirement;scalability;time complexity	Eric Hsueh-Chan Lu;Ching-Yu Chen;Vincent S.

In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to mining closed frequent itemsets over data streams. It is an online algorithm which update frequent closed itemsets incrementally, and can output the current closed frequent itemsets in real time based on users specified thresholds.

To develop effective interfaces for MDEs, designers must employ methods that allow them to rapidly generate and test alternative designs early in the design process. Paper prototyping offers one promising method, but needs to be adapted to effectively simulate the use of multiple displays and allow testing with groups of users. In this paper, we share experiences from two projects in which paper prototyping was utilized to explore interfaces for MDEs. We identify problems encountered when applying the traditional method, describe how these problems were overcome, and distill our experiences into recommendations that others can draw upon. By following our recommendations, designers need only make minor modifications to the existing method to better realize benefits of paper prototyping for MDEs.	grapple;imperative programming;model-driven engineering;multi-user;paper prototyping;pervasive informatics;simulation;user interface;workspace	Brian P.

In real applications using these robots, when the membership of robots is changed according to situation or some robots become defective or inoperative, it is necessary for those robots that remain to reform their organization in order to continue to complete given tasks. Through intensive simulations on the same truss construction task, the following experimental results were obtained: (1) Our model enables robots to continue to complete given tasks by reforming their organization, when a membership of robots is changed or some faulty robots are removed, and (2) The number of steps before operation does not increase very much as compared with the steps after operation.	fault tolerance;robot	Hitomi Kasahara;Keiki Takadama;Shinichi Nakasuka;Katsunori Shimohara	1998		10.1109/ICSMC.1998.724992	fault tolerance;organizational learning;simulation;ant robotics;computer science;artificial intelligence;self-reconfiguring modular robot;distributed computing;aisoy1	Robotics	-16.510551004840973	-8.536462114711261	11211
eac7685a4d788ae21534fe76da28fdff6d6ad8ed	an enhanced fuzzy evidential dematel method with its application to identify critical success factors		Due to the frequent occurrence of accidental and destructive disasters, it is essential to improve the performance of emergency systems. Facing the fact that the performance of emergency system depends on various factors and it is not feasible to optimize all these factors simultaneously due to the limitation of resources. A feasible solution is to select and improve some important factors. In this paper, a novel enhanced fuzzy evidential decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to identifying critical success factors (CSFs) is proposed. In the proposed method, we combine Dempster–Shafer evidence theory and DEMATEL method. Firstly, direct relations between factors are evaluated by multiple domain experts with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). Then, IFNs are transformed to basic probability assignments (BPAs) and can be combined by Dempster combination rule. In addition, the uncertainty and fuzziness of BPAs due to the lack of knowledge are taken into consideration to make final decision. Finally, implementing DEMATEL method, we can figure out cause–effect categories of factors with the DEMATEL method. The cause factors are identified as CSFs. The proposed method can well tackle subjectivity and fuzziness of experts evaluations. Based on the proposed method, the optimization of emergency management can be significantly simplified into optimizing CSFs. Through optimizing these CSFs, the performance of the whole systems can be significantly improved.

The 90-9-1 rule states that 90% of users are """"lurkers"""" who do not contribute, 9% are those who contribute from time to time, and only 1% of participants are highly active in the community and make most contributions. The question is: how can we motivate the inactive users to contribute? Previous research has shown that altruism is one of the most influential reasons for active contributors to participate [3, 10]. We present a new approach to promote altruism by capitalizing on reciprocity and gratitude in a Question & Answer (Q&A) system, in order to mitigate the participation inequality problem.

As NoSQL databases are growing in popularity, integration of different NoSQL systems and interoperability of NoSQL systems with SQL databases become an increasingly important issue. In this paper, we propose a novel data integration methodology to query data individually from different relational and NoSQL database systems. The suggested solution does not support joins and aggregates across data sources; it only collects data from different separated database management systems according to the filtering options and migrates them. The proposed method is based on a metamodel approach and it covers the structural, semantic and syntactic heterogeneities of source systems. To introduce the applicability of the proposed methodology, we developed a web-based application, which convincingly confirms the usefulness of the novel method.	algorithm;concatenation;data visualization;heterogeneous database system;interoperability;json;linkage (software);metamodeling;mongodb;mysql;need to know;nosql;pathfinding;sql;semantic heterogeneity;uniform data access;web application	Ágnes Vathy-Fogarassy;Tamás Hugyák	2017	Inf.

Our work presented here has tried to make our contribution toward such machine automation. We report work on adding affect-detection to an existing e-drama program, a text-based software system for dramatic improvisation in simple virtual scenarios, for use primarily in learning contexts. The system allows a human director to monitor improvisations and make interventions, for instance in reaction to excessive, insufficient or inappropriate emotions in the characters’ speeches. Within an endeavour to partially automate directors’ functions, and to allow for automated affective bit-part characters, we have developed an affect-detection module. It is aimed at detecting affective aspects (concerning emotions, moods, value judgments, etc.) of human-controlled characters’ textual “speeches” . The work also accompanies basic research into how affect is conveyed linguistically. A distinctive feature of the project is a focus on the metaphorical ways in which affect is conveyed. Moreover, we have also introduced how the detected affective states activate the animation engine to produce gestures for humancontrolled characters. The description of our approach in this paper is taken in part from our previous publications [1, 2] with new contributions mainly on metaphorical language processing (practically and theoretically), 3D emotional animation generation and user testing evaluation. Finally, Our work on affect detection in open-ended improvisational text contributes to the development of automatic understanding of human language and emotion. The generation of emotional believable animations based on detected affective states and the production of appropriate responses for the automated affective bit-part character based on the detection of affect contribute greatly to the ease and innovative user interface in e-drama, which leads to high-level user engagement and enjoyment.	embedded system;endeavour (supercomputer);experience;high- and low-level;natural language;nonlinear gameplay;prototype;sensor;software system;text-based (computing);user research;user interface	Li Zhang;Marco Gillies;John A.

To demonstrate that team training software can be made more flexible, this paper presents an approach to incorporating software agents into the distributed command-and-control (C2) simulation software DDD, which supports only human players. Based on the multi-agent architecture CAST, the software agents are designed as a team to perform C2 tasks in the DDD. By associating the agents with the same basic capabilities as the DDD provides its human users, we illustrate how to specify the teamwork knowledge for the agent team, and how to make agents efficiently reason about the dynamic, partially observable environment. Different methods of communication and coordination among agents are also briefly described.	agent architecture;cast tool;mallet;multi-agent system;partially observable system;simulation software;software agent;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Dianxiang Xu;Michael S.

1d58bea96a8493d5469a341c9d30f766178f5186	linguistic summarization based on the inherent semantics of linguistic words		Linguistic summarization provides an explicit, concise and easily understandable description expressed in natural language of huge amount of data for human. The result of extracting linguistic summaries is natural language sentences using given sets of words for each numeric attribute. In general, the word-set is always assumed to be of only (7 pm 2) words represented by fuzzy sets. The interpretability of linguistic summarization depends mainly on this fuzzy set representation of the words. In this paper, we consider the given word-set for each attribute as a linguistic frame of cognition LFoC of this attribute whose size depends only on application requirement. We propose a linguistic summary method based on multi-granularity representations of this LFoCs that can preserve order-based semantics relation and generality-specificity relation of words. Theoretically, the number of words in LFoC are not limited. A simulation study using dataset Iris shows that the proposed method can extract sentences using words of length 3 characterizing dataset Iris that other existing ones cannot do.

While there is a rich literature on modeling static or temporally invariant networks, much less has been done toward modeling the dynamic processes underlying rewiring networks, and on recovering such networks when they are not observable. We present a class of hidden temporal exponential random graph models (htERGMs) to study the yet unexplored topic of modeling and recovering temporally rewiring networks from time series of node attributes such as activities of social actors or expression levels of genes. We show that one can reliably infer the latent time-specific topologies of the evolving networks from the observation. We report empirical results on both synthetic data and a Drosophila lifecycle gene expression data set, in comparison with a static counterpart of htERGM.	dynamical system;entity;evolving networks;exponential random graph models;observable;queueing theory;synthetic data;time complexity;time series	Fan Guo;Steve Hanneke;Wenjie Fu;Eric P.

But the existed systems can only present n (n≤6 currently) images, limited by its ratio to the refresh rate of display set, for users on a shared display set. To support more users, we propose two methods to cluster the users into k (k≤n) groups, so that users can perceive different stereoscopic images in different regions and the same image in the same region. The first method subdivides the virtual space into k=n fixed regions by Centroidal Voronoi Diagram (CVD) in the preprocessing step, where the centroid positions of CVD regions are used as viewpoints to render corresponding images. It runs fast because it only need to trace the positions of users and compute in which CVD regions they are locating in the running time, and the viewpoints can stay stabilized at some time. But it may lead to different views for users who are located in different regions while close to each other. The other method is designed to dynamically divide the virtual space into k≤n regions by k-means method in the running time, where the centroid positions of cluster blocks are used as viewpoints to render corresponding images. It can compute more effective viewpoints and more realistic images. As viewpoints are real-time computed according to the variable spatial-temporal information of users, the number of rendering images can be dynamic during the process, i.e., It is possible to be equal to or less than the maximum number of views the system can display, depending on the distribution of positions of moving users.	centroidal voronoi tessellation;k-means clustering;multi-user;preprocessor;real-time locating system;refresh rate;stereoscopy;time complexity;virtual reality;voronoi diagram	Wei Gai;Lin Lu;Chenglei Yang;Shuo Feng;Tingting Cui;Xiangxu Meng	2014	2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.80	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;k-means clustering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-28.88962698255906	-37.11299820358937	11358

In the present model, the average time to isolation (i.e. hospitalization) of infectious population is the main time-dependent parameter that defines the spread of infection. All the preventive measures aim to decrease the average time to isolation under given constraints. The model suggested allows one to generate a “small” number of possible future scenarios and to determine corresponding trajectories of infected population in different regions.

The hyper‐lib philosophy is based on reproducing the spatial environment of a physical library, in order to exploit users' knowledge of the physical domain in using the electronic system. In the library environment, rooms, shelves, books and services are reproduced by simulating a three‐dimensional environment, where the user can interact with a collection of documents as if he or she were in a physical library. In addition to the physical library features, the hyper‐lib introduces a number of new properties, which result from its non‐physical nature and allow some of the limitations of traditional libraries, such as availability of books and delivery time, to be overcome. The hyper‐lib books are available in electronic form, following the hyper‐book model, which is based on the book metaphor. A formal definition of the hyper‐lib model as a dynamic system is given. The hyper‐lib model is defined in terms of structural and functional compone...

Characterizing design conventions between users and data domains is an important step in developing hypotheses, tools, and design guidelines for information visualization. In this paper, disciplines are compared at a coarse scale between four groups of fields: social, natural, and formal sciences; and the humanities. Two commonplace presentation types were analyzed: electronic slideshows and whiteboard “chalk talks”. We found design differences in slideshows using two methods - coding and comparing manually-selected features, like charts and diagrams, and an image-based analysis using PCA called eigenslides. In whiteboard talks with controlled topics, we observed design behaviors, including using representations and formalisms from a participant's own discipline, that suggest authors might benefit from novel assistive tools for designing presentations. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for visualization ethnography and human-centered authoring tools for visual information.	assistive technology;behavior;cerebrovascular accident;chart;conferences;diagram;ethnography;human-centered computing;imagery;information visualization;methamphetamine;principal component analysis;science	Steven R.

5af9eee2072214fbbd3601deeea2a5d11b62b1f6	designing for self-tracking of emotion and experience with tangible modality		Self-tracking technologies have been developed to understand the self. Emotions are critical to understanding one's daily life; however, tracking the emotion is challenging due to the implicit form of data. In this paper, we introduce MindTracker, an approach for tracking emotion through a tangible interaction with plasticine clay. We explored the benefits and challenges of MindTracker via a two-week data collection study with 16 college students as well as via interviews with three clinical mental health experts. MindTracker is designed for users to craft a form that represents emotion using clay and to describe the experience that evokes the emotion using a diary. We found that the tangible modality of MindTracker motivated the participants to express various aspects of emotions. In addition, MindTracker's data collection and reflection process could have therapeutic properties, such as expressive therapy, self-soothing, and emotional self-regulation. We conclude this paper by discussing the design features of emotion-tracking tools and opportunities to use MindTracker to promote mental health.	modality (human–computer interaction);tangible user interface	Kwangyoung Lee;Hwajung Hong	2017		10.1145/3064663.3064697	engineering;self;cognitive psychology;data collection;plasticine;human–computer interaction;affective science;mental health;craft;expressive therapy	HCI	-57.18970182219721	-50.56617643160858	11409

The necessary coordination is often realized by message exchange. While this might work perfectly in simulated environments, the implementation of such systems in a field application usually reveals some challenging properties: arbitrary communication networks, message delays due to specific communication technologies, or differing processing speeds of the agents. In this contribution we interpret these properties as sources of variation, and analyze four different multi-agent heuristics with respect to these aspects. In this regard, we distinguish synchronous from asynchronous approaches, and draw conclusions for either type. Our work is motivated by the use case of scheduling distributed energy resources within self-organized virtual power plants.	asynchronous circuit;combinatorial optimization;heuristic (computer science);multi-agent system;optimization problem;program optimization;scheduling (computing);self-organization;tagged union;telecommunications network	Christian Hinrichs;Michael Sonnenschein	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11584-9_12	self-organization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;heuristics;distributed computing	ML	-16.508373379121743	-9.73302535242476	11413

The era of Web Semantic allows machines the sharing and exploitation of knowledge, in a scalable and extensible way, where information is given a well-defined meaning. The structuring of information and the abstraction of intrinsic concepts constitute the formal knowledge, commonly known as ontology. Ontologies, or specifically, Web ontologies contribute to provide an adequate solution in knowledge representation. They enable the sharing of uniform structures for classifying knowledge regardless of the implementation language or the syntax used to represent it. However, as Web rapidly expands in size, the exigency of semantic organization beyond a fair arrangement of documents and text reveals the difficulty to glean knowledge from the Web, even though the state of art of natural language processing techniques or indexing processing is relevant. The distributed nature and the unknown reliability of knowledge on the Web need a clear conceptualization as well as an objective structuring for discovering unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are machine understandable and useful to the data owner. This special issue introduces some novel approaches aimed at ontology-based knowledge discovery. Two papers address recommendation systems, proposing different perspectives of application domain and use. The paper by Morales-del-Castillo, Peis, Ruiz, and Herrera-Viedma presents a multiagent filtering and recommender system, which combines Semantic Web technologies and fuzzy linguistic modeling techniques to provide users valuable information about resources that fit their interests. The approach is designed to be used in the biomedical environments and provides an integrated solution to minimize the problem of access relevant information in vast document repositories. Pudota, Dattolo, Baruzzo, Ferrara, and Tasso introduce a novel unsupervised approach for recommending content-based tags by applying a combined set of techniques and tools that exploit tags, domain ontologies, and key phrase extraction methods. The approach achieves an ontology navigation, which enables the identification of meaningful ancestors for relevant extracted key phrases, to recommend significant metadata as new possible tags.	agent-based model;application domain;conceptualization (information science);interoperability;knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language processing;object language;ontology (information science);recommender system;scalability;semantic web;unsupervised learning;web development;web search engine;world wide web	Vincenzo Loia	2010	Int.

827c1c8263435e5b1c85b4c465b1cc998cc70546	pdbcircleplot: a novel visualization method for protein structures		Interactive molecular graphics applications facilitate analysis of three dimensional protein structures. Naturally, non-interactive 2-D snapshots of the protein structures do not convey the same level of geometric detail. Several 2-D visualization methods have been in use to summarize structural information, including contact maps and 2-D cartoon views. We present a new approach for 2-D visualization of protein structures where amino acid residues are displayed on a circle and spatially close residues are depicted by links. Furthermore, residue-specific properties, such as conservation, accessibility, temperature factor, can be displayed as plots on the same circular view.

Due to the popularity of the web, there is an increasing trend for scholarly articles to reference web resources (e.g. software, data). However, due to the dynamic nature of the web, the referenced links may become inaccessible ('rotten') sometime after publication, returning a """"404 Not Found"""" HTTP error. In this paper we first present some preliminary findings of a study of the persistence and availability of web resources referenced from papers in a large-scale scholarly repository. We reaffirm previous research that link rot is a serious problem in the scholarly world and that current web archives do not always preserve all rotten links. Therefore, a more pro-active archival solution needs to be developed to further preserve web content referenced in scholarly articles. To this end, we propose to apply machine learning techniques to train a link rot predictor for use by an archival framework to prioritise pro-active archiving of links that are more likely to be rotten. We demonstrate that we can obtain a fairly high link rot prediction AUC (0.72) with only a small set of features. By simulation, we also show that our prediction framework is more effective than current web archives for preserving links that are likely to be rotten. This work has a potential impact for the scholarly world where publishers can utilise this framework to prioritise the archiving of links for digital preservation, especially when there is a large quantity of links to be archived."""	archive;http 404;kerrison predictor;link rot;machine learning;persistence (computer science);rotten tomatoes;simulation;web content;web resource	Ke Zhou;Claire Grover;Martin Klein;Richard Tobin	2015		10.1145/2756406.2756940	computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-27.826856518796173	-46.92280582575121	11474

A key problem related to this is the notion of goodness/interestingness -- when is a role good/interesting? In this paper, we define the role mining problem (RMP) as the problem of discovering an optimal set of roles from existing user permissions. The main contribution of this paper is to formally define RMP, and analyze its theoretical bounds. In addition to the above basic RMP, we introduce two different variations of the RMP, called the δ-approx RMP and the Minimal Noise RMP that have pragmatic implications. We reduce the known """"set basis problem"""" to RMP to show that RMP is an NP-complete problem. An important contribution of this paper is also to show the relation of the role mining problem to several problems already identified in the data mining and data analysis literature. By showing that the RMP is in essence reducible to these known problems, we can directly borrow the existing implementation solutions and guide further research in this direction."""	bipartite dimension;data mining;np-completeness;risk management plan;role-based access control	Jaideep Vaidya;Vijayalakshmi Atluri;Qi Guo	2007		10.1145/1266840.1266870	computer science;artificial intelligence;role-based access control;data mining;computer security;algorithm	ML	-6.521803596043907	-31.299798620291416	11481

These scripts contain variables that influence how individuals expect to access and use materials in different settings. Prototype theory, in turn, addresses user expectations of what items/variables should look like in a given context, thus creating a guide for how one should design/depict items when developing materials for that context. When combined, these two theoretical approaches create a mechanism UXD professionals can use to both research communication and design expectations/variables in different health and medical communication contexts and design materials that meet user expectations associated with such settings.	feedback;medical privacy;prototype;script theory;usability;user experience design;variable (computer science)	Kirk St. Amant	2017		10.1145/3121113.3121225	user expectations;computer science;human–computer interaction;multimedia;prototype theory;user experience design;usability;script theory;scripting language	HCI	-58.71599259809242	-42.9086652064694	11485

For Berthollide compounds it cannot be defined as unambiguously as for Daltonide compounds. The mathematical description of this concept is suggested for reacting Berthollide compounds in terms of Dirichlet domains. The way in which the loss of certainty is represented provides insight into the interplay between chemical and mathematical concepts.	kinetics internet protocol	Alexander I.

The need for computational efficiency is well-recognized by the data mining community, which sprung from the database community concern for efficient manipulation of large datasets. The motivation for cognitive efficiency is more elusive but at least as important. In as much as cognitive efficiency can be informally construed as ease of understanding, then what is important is any tool or technique that presents cognitively manageable abstractions of large datasets. We present our initial development of a framework for gathering, analyzing, and redeploying web data. Not dissimilar to conventional data mining, the general idea is that good use of web data first requires the careful selection of data (both usage and content data), the deployment of appropriate learning methods, and the evaluation of the results of applying the results of learning in a web application. Our framework includes tools for building, using, and visualizing web abstractions. We present an example of the deployment of our framework to navigation improvement. The abstractions we develop are called Navigation Compression Models (NCMs), and we show a method for creating them, using them, and visualizing them to aid in their understanding.	aggregate data;association rule learning;blog;data mining;experiment;robotics;software deployment;tree traversal;www;web application;web mining;web navigation	Tong Zheng;Yonghe Niu;Randy Goebel	2002		10.1007/3-540-47887-6_26	data compression;computer vision;web mining;web modeling;visualization;data processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;value of information;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;information extraction;data collection	ML	-32.89461099425858	-15.833598032681804	11491

However, in order to design professional video browsing tools that allow for better search performance but still provide ease of use, we need to know how users search with common video players. Therefore, we analyze logging data from a user study with 17 participants that performed Known Item Search tasks with an HTML5 video player. We classify search behavior by type of interaction and speed of interactive search and discuss what we can learn for the design and development of professional video search tools.	html5 video;need to know;usability testing	Klaus Schöffmann;Claudiu Cobârzan	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops (ICMEW)	10.1109/ICMEW.2013.6618282	navigation;simulation;network switch;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-34.018982284391605	-51.24086415826369	11535

There are many interesting use cases for allowing an application running on one mobile system to access I/O devices on another system, for three fundamental reasons. (i) Mobile systems can be in different physical locations or orientations. For example, one can control a smartphone's high-resolution camera from a tablet to more easily capture a self-portrait. (ii) Mobile systems can serve different users; for example, one can play music for another user if one's smartphone can access the other system's speaker. (iii) Certain mobile systems have unique I/O devices due to their distinct form factors and targeted use cases. For example, a user can make a phone call from her tablet using the modem and SIM card in her smartphone.	computer form factor;image resolution;input/output;microphone;modem;sensor;smartglasses;smartphone;smartwatch;subscriber identity module;tablet computer;winsock	Ardalan Amiri Sani;Kevin Boos;Min Hong Yun;Lin Zhong	2015	GetMobile	10.1145/2786984.2786987	embedded system;mobile search;simulation;mobile web;engineering;multimedia;mobile station;mobile computing	Mobile	-45.11440295923616	-41.32543706507539	11549

Collaborative filtering approaches fail when the preference history of users is not available. A promising direction that has been explored recently [12] is to utilize the information in the social networks of users to improve the quality of cold-start recommendations. That is, given that users are part of a social network, a new user shows up in the network with no preference history and limited social links, the recommender system tries to learn the user's tastes as fast as possible.  In this work, we model the learning of preferences of cold-start users using multi-armed bandits [5] embedded in a social network. We propose two novel strategies leveraging neighborhood estimates to improve the learning rate of bandits for cold-start users. Our first strategy, MixPair, combines estimates from pairs of neighboring bandits. It extends the well-known UCB1 algorithm [5] and inherits its asymptotically optimal guarantees. Although our second strategy, MixNeigh, is a heuristic based on consensus in the neighborhood of a user, it performed the best among the evaluated strategies. Our experiments on a dataset from Last.fm show that our strategies yield significant improvements, learning 2 to 5 times faster than our baseline, UCB1."""	asymptotically optimal algorithm;baseline (configuration management);cold start;collaborative filtering;embedded system;experiment;heuristic;last.fm;multi-armed bandit;recommender system;social network;whole earth 'lectronic link	Stéphane Caron;Smriti Bhagat	2013		10.1145/2501025.2501029	simulation;computer science;machine learning;data mining	Web+IR	-18.65045926338492	-48.947406853479116	11562

We assume that a user can play multiple social roles, and each social role serves to fulfil different duties and is associated with a role-driven distribution over latent topics. In particular, we focus on social roles corresponding to the most common social activities on social networks. Our model is instantiated on microblogs, i.e., Twitter and community question-answering (cQA), i.e., Yahoo!Answers, where social roles on Twitter include “originators” and “propagators”, and roles on cQA are “askers” and “answerers”. Both explicit and implicit interactions between users are taken into account and modeled as regularization factors. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two Twitter datasets and two cQA datasets. Furthermore, we also consider multi-role modeling for scientific papers where an author's research expertise area is considered as a social role. A novel application of detecting users' research interests through topical keyword labeling based on the results of our multi-role model has been presented. The evaluation results have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of our model.	division algorithm;experiment;interaction;question answering;scientific literature;sensor;social media;social network;topic model	Wayne Xin Zhao;Jinpeng Wang;Yulan He;Jian-Yun Nie;Ji-Rong Wen;Xiaoming Li	2015	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2014.2359672	database index;media;social media;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;mathematical model;data mining;database;role theory;context model;topic model;world wide web	DB	-20.192759160465098	-45.94581597241498	11596

The approach we propose forms part of a foundational basis for a generative approach to social science (Epstein 2007). We highlight the feasibility of the adversarial scheduling approach by using it to study the Prisoners's Dilemma Game with Pavlov update, a dynamics that has already been investigated under random update in Kittock (1994), Dyer et al. (2002), Mossel and Roch (2006) and Dyer and Velumailum (2011). The model is specified by letting players at the nodes of an underlying graph G repeatedly play the Prisoner's Dilemma against their neighbours. The players adapt their strategies based on the past behaviour of their opponents by applying the so-called win-stay lose-shift strategy. With random scheduling, starting from any initial configuration, the system reaches the fixed point in which all players cooperate with high probability. On the other hand, under adversarial scheduling the following results hold: #R##N#A scheduler that can select both game participants can preclude the system from reaching the unique fixed point on most graph topologies.#R##N#A non-adaptive scheduler that is only allowed to choose one of the participants is no more powerful than a random scheduler. With this restriction, even an adaptive scheduler is not significantly more powerful than the random scheduler, provided it is 'reasonably fair'.	scheduling (computing);social dynamics	Gabriel Istrate;Madhav V.

ae0687f61067f97cf987bf4d62ebad7b191326d7	fscnmf: fusing structure and content via non-negative matrix factorization for embedding information networks		Analysis and visualization of an information network can be facilitated better using an appropriate embedding of the network. Network embedding learns a compact low-dimensional vector representation for each node of the network, and uses this lower dimensional representation for different network analysis tasks. Only the structure of the network is considered by a majority of the current embedding algorithms. However, some content is associated with each node, in most of the practical applications, which can help to understand the underlying semantics of the network. It is not straightforward to integrate the content of each node in the current state-of-the-art network embedding methods. In this paper, we propose a nonnegative matrix factorization based optimization framework, namely FSCNMF which considers both the network structure and the content of the nodes while learning a lower dimensional representation of each node in the network. Our approach systematically regularizes structure based on content and vice versa to exploit the consistency between the structure and content to the best possible extent. We further extend the basic FSCNMF to an advanced method, namely FSCNMF++ to capture the higher order proximities in the network. We conduct experiments on real world information networks for different types of machine learning applications such as node clustering, visualization, and multi-class classification. The results show that our method can represent the network significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms and improve the performance across all the applications that we consider.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer data storage;experiment;image noise;input/output;machine learning;mathematical optimization;multiclass classification;network theory;non-negative matrix factorization;real life;spectral clustering	Sambaran Bandyopadhyay;Harsh Kara;Aswin Kannan;M.

1e4218872949dcf5cf241107df7f78df1656436b	a web-based gis tool for exploring the world's biodiversity: the global biodiversity information facility mapping and analysis portal application (gbif-mapa)	distributed database;geographic information system;global biodiversity information facility;survey gap analysis;web service;biodiversity mapping;web based gis;gap analysis;online geographic information systems;natural history;species richness;open standard	Legacy biodiversity data from natural history and survey collections are rapidly becoming available in a common format over the Internet. Over 110 million records are already being served from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However, our ability to use this information effectively for ecological research, management and conservation lags behind. A solution is a web-based Geographic Information System for enabling visualization and analysis of this rapidly expanding data resource. In this paper we detail a case study system, GBIF Mapping and Analysis Portal Application (MAPA), developed for deployment at distributed database portals. Building such a system requires overcoming a series of technical and research challenges. These challenges include: assuring fast speed of access to the vast amounts of data available through these distributed biodiversity databases; developing open standards based access to suitable environmental data layers for analyzing biodiversity distribution; building suitably flexible and intuitive map interfaces for refining the scope and criteria of an analysis; and building appropriate web-services based analysis tools that are of primary importance to the ecological community and make manifest the value of online biodiversity GBIF data. After discussing how we overcome these challenges, we provide case studies showing two examples of the use of GBIF-MAPA analysis tools.	biodiversity informatics;geographic information system;web application	Paul Flemons;Robert P.

e3c54cd973a4d5882b041aa7d3b6f414ef572eec	stability analysis of climate system using fuzzy cognitive maps		In the present work we developed a soft computing model for the qualitative analysis of the Earth’s climate system dynamics throughout the implementation of fuzzy cognitive maps. For this purpose, we identified the subsystems in terms of which the dynamics of the whole system can be described. Then, with these concepts we built a cognitive map via the study of the documented relations among these concepts. Once the map was built, we used the technique of state vector and the adjacent matrix to found the hidden pattens, i.e the feedback processes among system’s nodes. Later on, we explored the sensibility of the model to changes in the weights of the edges, and also to changes in the input data values. Finally, we used fuzzy edges to analyze the causality flux among concepts and to explore possible solutions applied in specific edges.	fuzzy cognitive map	Carlos Gay-Garcia;Iván Paz Ortiz	2012		10.1007/978-3-319-03581-9_15	fuzzy cognitive map;geography;hydrology;soil science	Robotics	-9.09159778587073	-22.795943232503763	11616
835aa53955644568c3144644106c9e462ccf3a8e	processing moving knn queries using influential neighbor sets		The moving k nearest neighbor query, which computes one’s k nearest neighbor set and maintains it while at move, is gaining importance due to the prevalent use of smart mobile devices such as smart phones. Safe region is a popular technique in processing the moving k nearest neighbor query. It is a region where the movement of the query object does not cause the current k nearest neighbor set to change. Processing a moving k nearest neighbor query is a continuing process of checking the validity of the safe region and recomputing it if invalidated. The size of the safe region largely decides the frequency of safe region recomputation and hence query processing efficiency. Existing moving k nearest neighbor algorithms lack efficiency due to either computing small safe regions and have to recompute frequently or computing large safe regions (i.e., an order-k Voronoi cell) with a high cost. In this paper, we take a third approach. Instead of safe regions, we use a small set of safe guarding objects. We prove that, as long as the the current k nearest neighbors are closer to the query object than the safe guarding objects, the current k nearest neighbors stay valid and no recomputation is required. This way, we avoid the high cost of safe region recomputation. We also prove that, the region defined by the safe guarding objects is the largest possible safe region. This means that the recomputation frequency of our method is also minimized. We conduct extensive experiments comparing our method with the state-of-the-art method on both real and synthetic data sets. The results confirm the superiority of our method.	cell (microprocessor);computation;database;experiment;input/output;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mobile device;nearest neighbor search;smart device;smartphone;synthetic data;voronoi diagram	Chuanwen Li;Yu Gu;Jianzhong Qi;Ge Yu;Rui Zhang;Wang Yi	2014	PVLDB	10.14778/2735471.2735473	computer science;data mining;database;nearest neighbor search;world wide web	DB	-15.967714655937261	-35.26297054882639	11619

For one such exploration, we show a quick double crossing in-air gesture for mobile devices, called AirFlip. In this gesture, users move their thumb into the hover zone from the side, and then move it out of the hover zone. Since this gesture does not conflict with any touch gestures that can be performed on mobile devices, it will serve as another gesture on mobile devices with touchscreens where only a limited input vocabulary is available. We implemented two applications based on AirFlip. In this paper, we show the results of a comparative user study that we conducted to identify the performance of AirFlip. We also discuss the characteristics of AirFlip on the basis of the results.	haptic technology;interaction;mobile device;touchscreen;usability testing;vocabulary	Hiroyuki Hakoda;Takuro Kuribara;Keigo Shima;Buntarou Shizuki;Jiro Tanaka	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20916-6_5	computer vision;simulation;gesture recognition	HCI	-46.099769516313835	-43.92524012575497	11623

87212544f4814b6b81bbd7abeac73aacdee72b6e	evaluating novice and expert users on handheld video retrieval systems		"""Content-based video retrieval systems have been widely as- sociated with desktop environments that are largely complex in nature, targeting expert users and often require complex queries. Due to this complexity, interaction with these systems can be a challenge for reg- ular """"novice"""" users. In recent years, a shift can be observed from this traditional desktop environment to that of handheld devices, which re- quires a different approach to interacting with the user. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a handheld content-based video retrieval system on both expert and novice users. We show that with this type of device, a simple and intuitive interface, which incorporates the prin- ciples of content-based systems, though hidden from the user, attains the same accuracy for both novice and desktop users when faced with complex information retrieval tasks. We describe an experiment which utilises the Apple iPad as our handheld medium in which both a group of experts and novice users run the interactive experiments from the 2010 TRECVid Known-Item Search task.

We introduce a new push-back tangible technology, a pin-board that physically ejects paper documents. This is realized by extending the Pin&Play technology to support ‘pouts’, addressable pin-like devices that can remove themselves from a board using muscle wire actuators. We describe how this technology has been developed through two iterations of prototyping, application and formative study. An initial study revealed how potential mismatches between the physical and digital characteristics of pouts caused difficulties with users predicting pop-out events and reasoning about the state of pouts. This led us to extend pouts to reveal more of their internal state, an approach verified through a second study. It also raises more general issues for the design of pushback tangible technologies and ubiquitous interfaces.	digital data;iteration;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;user interface	Kher Hui Ng;Boriana Koleva;Steve Benford	2006	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-006-0065-8	simulation;human–computer interaction;prototype;multimedia	HCI	-45.238803439234495	-39.38174028837214	11658

At the moment an increasingly significant fraction of our interactions take place in technology mediated settings, it is important to investigate how such a wiring - mainly corresponding to neural processes - reacts and adapts to them. This talk focuses in particular on how nonverbal communication - one of the main channels through which people convey socially and psychologically relevant information - plays a role in settings where natural nonverbal cues (facial expressions, vocalizations, gestures, etc.) are no longer available. Such an issue is important not only from a technological point of view (it can help to design interaction and communication technologies that better address human needs), but also from a societal one (it can help to understand major phenomena such as cyberbullyism and virality).	humans;interaction;point of view (computer hardware company);wiring	Alessandro Vinciarelli	2017		10.1145/3133944.3133954	homo sapiens;body language;social relation;nonverbal communication;communication;gesture;facial expression;cognition;psychology	HCI	-51.729798074607594	-48.88281352495911	11681

Mobile devices have the capabilities to detect the user context and to provide pieces of information suitable to help visitors discover and follow the logical and emotional connections that develop during the visit. In this scenario, location based services (LBS) currently represent an asset, and the choice of the technology to determine users' position, combined with the definition of methods that can effectively convey information, become key issues in the design process. In this work, we present Museum Assistant (MusA), a general framework for the development of multimedia interactive guides for mobile devices. Its main feature is a vision-based indoor positioning system that allows the provision of several LBS, from way-finding to the contextualized communication of cultural contents, aimed at providing a meaningful exploration of exhibits according to visitors' personal interest and curiosity. Starting from the thorough description of the system architecture, the article presents the implementation of two mobile guides, developed to respectively address adults and children, and discusses the evaluation of the user experience and the visitors' appreciation of these applications.	conflict (psychology);content management system;digital distribution;educational entertainment;exhibits as topic;experiment;gps navigation device;gamification;global positioning system;graphical user interface;indoor positioning system;interface device component;location-based service;mobile app;mobile device;mobile game;multimedia;navigation function;rapid prototyping;systems architecture;usability;user experience;anatomical layer;contents - htmllinktype	Irene Rubino;Jetmir Xhembulla;Andrea Martina;Andrea Bottino;Giovanni Malnati	2013		10.3390/s131217445	embedded system;text mining;medical research;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-50.68530543903424	-38.73154254363385	11700

812de24ea377e181ac9eb3981b4583826272a4df	intra-view and inter-view attention for multi-view network embedding		Network Embedding, which represents nodes in networks with efficient low-dimensional vectors, has been proved useful in a variety of applications. However, most existing approaches study single-view networks but not the multi-view networks with multiple types of relationships between nodes. Meanwhile, they ignore the rich features associated with the nodes, which is common in real world. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method, Intra-view and Inter-view attention for Multi-view Network Embedding (I2MNE), which leverages both the multi-view network structure and the node features to efficiently generate node representations. Specially, we introduce the intra-view attention when aggregating node features from neighbors for each single view and the inter-view attention when integrating representations across different views. Experiments on two real-world networks show that our approach outperforms other counterpart network embedding methods.

48857835f3bf9e941561b325e1e1e91604106a62	multi-hop assortativities for networks classification		Several social, medical, engineering and biological challenges rely on discovering the functionality of networks from their structure and node metadata, when it is available. For example, in chemoinformatics one might want to detect whether a molecule is toxic based on structure and atomic types, or discover the research field of a scientific collaboration network. Existing techniques rely on counting or measuring structural patterns that are known to show large variations from network to network, such as the number of triangles, or the assortativity of node metadata. We introduce the concept of multi-hop assortativity, that captures the similarity of the nodes situated at the extremities of a randomly selected path of a given length. We show that multi-hop assortativity unifies various existing concepts and offers a versatile family of 'fingerprints' to characterize networks.

On the one hand, they serve as suggestions that digital devices might embody values apart from those traditionally associated with functionality and usefulness. On the other, they are examples of research through design, balancing concreteness with openness to spur the imagination, and using multiplicity to allow the emergence of a new design space. Here we describe them both in terms of content and process, discussing first the values they address and then how they were crafted to encourage a broad discussion with our partners that could inform future stages of design.	emergence;information appliance;openness	William W.

9731848ba7868f97b85d6e0f2963a8933d848872	evaluation of e-commerce websites: an integrated approach under a single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic environment		E-commerce website evaluation is recognized as a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem involving vast amounts of imprecise and inconsistent evaluation data. Single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTNNs), which are elements in single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic sets (SVTNSs), have a strong capacity to model such complex evaluation information. However, only few studies simultaneously consider the imprecise and inconsistent information inherent in the evaluation data. Moreover, much literature overlooks the different priority levels and interrelationships among criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper outlines a novel integrated decision system consisting of the following three modules: (1) information acquisition; (2) the single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (SVTN-DEMATEL) module; and (3) the integration module. In this study, we used the information acquisition module to gather the SVTNN information provided by experts, applied the SVTN-DEMATEL module to analyze the causal relationships among criteria, and proposed the integration module for information fusion with consideration of interdependencies and different priority levels of criteria. Furthermore, we conducted a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposal along with the sensitivity and comparison analyses to verify its stability and superiority. Finally, conclusions and future research directions were drawn. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It is time that we provided foundations of engineering human-computer interaction (HCI) as explicit and well-founded as those for hardware and software engineering. Through the influences of other disciplines and their contribution to software engineering, a rich environment for HCI studies, theory and applications now exists. Many principles underlying HCI have systemic foundations independent of the nature of the systems taking part and these may be analysed control-theoretically and information-theoretically. The fundamental principles at different levels may be used in the practical design of dialog shells for engineering effective HCI. This paper surveys the development of styles of dialog through generations of computers, the principles involved, and the move towards integrated systems. It then systematically explores the foundations of HCI by analysing the various analogies to HCI possible when the parties are taken to be general systems, equipment, computers or people.	computer;dialog system;history of computing hardware;human–computer interaction;information theory;software engineering	Brian R.

In recent years, we have implemented a framework which allows to: (i) extract the actual process model from the available process execution traces, through process mining techniques; and (ii) compare (mined) process models, by relying on a novel distance measure. Our distance measure is knowledge-intensive, in the sense that it explicitly makes use of domain knowledge, and can be properly adapted on the basis of the available knowledge representation formalism. We also exploit all the available mined information (e.g., temporal information about delays between activities). Interestingly, our metric explicitly takes into account complex control flow information too, which is often neglected in the literature. The framework has been successfully tested in stroke management.	conformance testing;control flow;formal system;knowledge representation and reasoning;mined;model selection;process modeling;tracing (software)	Marcos Da Silveira;Cédric Pruski;Annette ten Teije;Frank van Harmelen	2011		10.1007/978-3-319-13281-5	knowledge base;computer science;knowledge management;data science;open knowledge base connectivity;data mining;knowledge extraction;personal knowledge management;commonsense knowledge;domain knowledge	Web+IR	-32.61991321425291	-4.4225269503330225	11788
7992fa776a02268c930743a38370178bc2de1fea	knowledge extraction and summarization for an application of textual case-based interpretation	knowledge extraction;empirical evaluation	This paper presents KES (Knowledge Extraction and Summarization), a new knowledge-enhanced approach that builds a case memory out of episodic textual narratives. These narratives are considered as generated probabilistically by the structure of the task they describe. The task elements are then used to construct the structure of the case memory. The KES approach is illustrated with examples and an empirical evaluation of a real-world scenario of textual case-based interpretation for a technical domain. 1 An Application of Textual Case-Based Interpretation Janet Kolodner has described interpretive Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) as “a process of evaluating situations or solutions in the context of previous experience” [11, p. 86]. She argues that this evaluation can be performed by means of comparing and contrasting a new situation to old experiences. A defining aspect of interpretive CBR is the fact that a reasoner cannot be content with the recall of only one previous situation, as it is often sufficient in some CBR applications. Rather, for the reasoner it is important to have at disposal a few cases for both comparison and contrasting, so that the argumentation has a more solid foundation. A classical example of a CBR system that uses the compare-and-contrast strategy for case-based interpretation is Kevin Ashley’s system HYPO [1]. HYPO, aside from its elaborated reasoning strategies, displays another characteristic which is not very common to more recent CBR systems: The features used to represent the cases are not part of the original case representation. Indeed, the original cases are documents written in natural language describing a legal dispute; while the internal cases are a set of some very abstract domain concepts (known as issues and factors). These domain concepts have been created by highly knowledgeable professionals in the domain of trade secret law. Thus, discovering these concepts in the original documents is not easy, particularly when some of them need to be inferred from text, as the example in Figure 1 shows, where, while factor (f2) can be directly found in text, factor (f4) needs to be inferred.

The goal is to equip the robot with the capacity to interact with a human. Motivated by the research on biological systems, our basic assumption is that the behavior to perform determines the external and internal structure of the behaving system. We describe the anthropomorphic design of our robot and present a distributed control system that generates human-like navigation and manipulation behavior. As the mathematical framework for this purpose we have developed a control system which is entirely based on dynamical systems in the form of instantiated dynamics and neural fields. We also present a dynamic scheme for the behavioral organization based on competitive dynamics.	biological system;distributed control system;dynamical system;mathematics;navigation;robot	Thomas Bergener;Carsten Bruckhoff;Percy Dahm;Herbert Janssen;Frank Joublin;Rainer Menzner;Axel Steinhage;Werner von Seelen	1999	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/S0893-6080(99)00045-3	robot;interpersonal relationship;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;dynamical system	Robotics	-23.574095882518634	-16.90904483633795	11833

The system consists of a set of companies which cooperate and compete with one another by offering and buying products and negotiating their conditions of transactions. Throughout the presented work we focused on the realisation of the parts of the strategic planner module. Producers tend to maximise profits, among other ways, by modifying the margin of offered products. The main aim of the applied decision algorithm is to have a feature of adapting to a given situation: to select the best model of the simulation world and to choose the most adequate actions in the given situations. The first aspect is addressed by the use of an adaptive algorithm which chooses the best demand prediction algorithm in a given situation. The second aspect is addressed by the clustering technique which identifies the similar situations on the market as one possible state and assigns with it the most profitable action.	adaptive algorithm;cluster analysis;computer science;emso simulator;simulation	Pawel Kolarz;Jan Marszalek;Jaroslaw Kozlak;Malgorzata Zabinska	2012		10.1016/j.procs.2012.04.168	simulation;artificial intelligence;data mining;operations research	AI	-8.970247573178325	-10.546416354733637	11846
1b4092a7149daf7680d9df8308a2b1026321c98a	feature - taken for granted: the infusion of the mobile phone in society	mobile phone	[1] The inspiration for this article arose out of a discussion with my colleague Jonathan Donner as well as the insightful comments of James Katz. If we fast-forward 100 or 130 years, we see the difference. There are parking lots, paved roads, service stations, and all the standard automobile-related features of life. While there are often downtown areas in the towns and cities, the automobile has also spawned strip malls and shopping centers. It is often easier to drive a few hundred yards from one strip mall to another (and belch out the consequent pollution), since walking involves detouring around multilane streets that are more car than pedestrian friendly. In addition, there is a whole sector of society that is oriented toward servicing the automobile and the passengers within. There are not just “filling” stations but service areas where the nutritional needs of both the car and the passengers can be attended to and where we can also buy music, kitschy art, and reading material. Unlike the early motorists, our lives are in many ways defined by access to the automobile. We need it to get to work, to deliver the children to after-school activities, or to go shopping. Serious courting takes place in the car. Our vacation habits are often tied to driving, automobilefriendly hotels, and automobileaccessible sights and locations. The cars we drive are, for some more than others, a reflection of It is sometimes interesting to look at the parallels between the development of the mobile phone and the automobile. In the century since the late 1800s the automobile moved from being a odd contraption on the edge of society to being a taken-for-granted factor in everyday life. In the late 1800s none of the major elements of today’s automobile culture were in place. Cars were rickety contrivances. There were rarely cabs for the passengers, cars needed constant prodding and maintenance, and they were more often seen as the hobby of determined tinkerers or eccentric millionaires than as an item of daily necessity. As if to ensure cars’ marginalization, the roads were poor, and there were few gas stations and even fewer automobile-repair shops. If you were an early user, it was almost in spite of their usefulness. Society was clearly oriented toward other forms of transportation. This had consequences for the way that people organized their lives. Work, shopping, and schooling were often within walking distance. Daily activities did not require the individual to move about to the degree that we often see today. Neither the automobile nor the culture of the automobile had gained the purchase that they have today [1]. who we are and what we want to be. If we do not need it directly, then the wares that we purchase in the shop were delivered using the automobile/truck-based system. Perhaps the most telling indication is that it is difficult to think of carrying on our daily life in the absence of the automobile. All of this has resulted in an over reliance on the automobile. In effect, we have a system of reasoning that assumes access to and use of the automobile. It has moved from being a somewhat risky curiosity to being a central part of everyday life. It can be said that, with our willing acceptance, the automobile has restructured society in its own image. Bringing this back to the mobile phone, we can ask if we are in the process of developing a similar logic on that front.	elsevier biobase;fast forward;mobile phone;parallels desktop for mac;towns	Rich Ling	2008	Interactions	10.1145/1409040.1409054	gsm services;computer science;multimedia;advertising;internet privacy	HCI	-59.12827154687339	-27.56622205340853	11849
24c2cabaf73bf88bca104dd59854560fef10934d	learning by demonstration for a collaborative planning environment	human computer interaction	promise to empower nonprogrammers to customize and extend software. Recent technical advances have enabled its use for automating increasingly complex tasks (Allen et al. 2007; Blythe et al. 2008; Burstein et al. 2008; Leshed et al. 2008; Cypher et al. 2010). However, fielded applications of the technology have been limited to macro recording capabilities, which can only reproduce the exact behavior demonstrated by the user. This article describes the successful deployment of learning by demonstration technology that goes well beyond macro recording by enabling end users to create parameterized procedures that automate general classes of repetitive or time-consuming tasks. This task-learning technology originated as a research system within DARPA’s Personalized Assistant That Learns (PAL) program, where it was focused on automating tasks within a desktop environment (Gervasio, Lee, and Eker 2008; Eker, Lee, and Gervasio 2009; Gervasio and Murdock 2009). From those research roots, PAL task learning has evolved into a fielded capability within the Command Post of the Future (CPOF) — a military command and control (C2) system used extensively by the U.S. Army. The CPOF software is part of the Army’s Battle Command System, and as such is standard equipment for virtually every Army unit. Since its inception in 2004, thousands of CPOF systems have been deployed. Articles	battle command;desktop computer;pal;software deployment;word lists by frequency	Karen L.

Our robot, named Haile, is designed to listen to live players, analyze their drumming in real-time, and use the product of this analysis to play back in an improvisational manner. It is designed to combine the benefits of computational power and algorithmic music with the richness, visual interactivity, and expression of acoustic playing. We believe that when collaborating with live players, Haile can facilitate a musical experience that is not possible by any other means, inspiring players to interact with it in novel expressive manners. In Jam’aa, Haile listens to and interacts with two humans playing Darbukas – Middle Eastern goblet shaped hand drums. Haile listens to audio input from each drum, and detects musical aspects such as note onset, pitch, amplitude, beat, rhythmic stability and rhythmic density. Based on these detected features, Haile utilizes six interaction modes that are designed to address the unique improvisatory aesthetics of the Middle Eastern percussion ensemble. Haile responds physically by operating its mechanical arms, adjusting the sound of its hits in two manners: pitch and timbre variety are achieved by striking the drumhead in different locations while volume variety is achieved by hitting harder or softer. After a short introduction and a discussion of related work, we present an overview of the Middle Eastern percussion tradition. This leads to a presentation of Haile’s mechanical, perceptual and interaction modules and their implementation in the composition Jam’aa. We conclude with information about Jam’aas premiere and future work we plan to conduct.

0df3430d8cecfb7ee0b0f5dae403793a2fb9dc54	special issue on advanced control of aerospace vehicles		The control of aerospace vehicles, such as manned/ unmanned airplanes, hypersonic vehicles, satellites, and missiles, has attracted a great amount of interest in recent years owing to the rapid development of potential application areas. Modern aerospace vehicles often employ large, complex, and lightweight structures, which result in these space structures being extremely flexible and having low-frequency fundamental vibration modes. These bring challenges to traditional control and optimization methodologies. There is an urgent need to develop new optimization, control, modelling, decision, and fault diagnosis methods. The last few decades have witnessed tremendous advances in control techniques such as robust H2/HN control, adaptive control, and sliding mode control, which have contributed greatly to the successful handling of certain control problems for complex aerospace systems that until recently were thought too difficult to analyse. However, their capability to handle bounded uncertainties/disturbances and unmodelled dynamics in contemporary flight control systems needs to be strengthened. Meanwhile, newly developed mathematical tools and technologies have also opened up various possibilities for the practical implementation of advanced control algorithms in aerospace vehicles. The purpose of this special issue is to bring together the latest/innovative achievements on the research of control of aerospace vehicles.

04483b57b911b52314897016c1f00f48ee345470	simulating effects of signage, groups, and crowds on emergent evacuation patterns	crowd simulation;building egress;collective behavior;social behavior;simulated perception;egress simulation;social agents	Studies of past emergency events have revealed that occupants’ behaviors, egress signage system, local geometry, and environmental constraints affect crowd movement and govern the building evacuation. In addition to complying with code and standards, building designers need to consider the occupants’ social characteristics and the unique layout of the buildings to design occupant-centric egress systems. This paper describes an agent-based egress simulation tool, SAFEgress, which incorporates important human and social behaviors observed by researchers in safety and disaster management. Agents in SAFEgress are capable of perceiving building emergency features in the virtual environment and deciding their behaviors and navigation. In particular, we describe four agent behavioral models, namely following familiar exits, following cues from building features, navigating with social groups, and following crowds. We use SAFEgress to study how agents (mimicking building occupants) react to different signage arrangements in a modeled environment. We explore agents’ reactions to cues as an emergent phenomenon, shaped by the interactions among groups and crowds. Simulation results from the prototype reveal that different designs of building emergency features and levels of group interactions can trigger different crowd flow patterns and affect overall egress performance. By considering the occupants’ perception about the emergency features using the SAFEgress prototype, engineers, designers, and facility managers can study the human factors that may influence an egress situation and, thereby, improve the design of SAFEgress systems and procedures.	agent-based model;digital signage;egress filtering;emergence;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;prototype;simulation;virtual reality	Mei Ling Chu;Paolo Parigi;Jean-Claude Latombe;Kincho H.

On introducing such mobilities in community, sharing is more prospective than owing. In this paper, we aim at considering expected change of human behavior, including modal shift, by introducing such mobilities in society. In the hope of large scale demand prediction and optimal planning of both location and capacity of the personal mobility sharing stations, we have developed a prototype multi-agent simulator. Parameters of simulation are determined by sharing experiments in Mobility Robot Experimental Zone in Tsukuba using Toyota Winglet long type and conjoint analysis based on questionnaires. We obtained preliminary results for a realistic situation.	computer architecture simulator	Kohji Tomita;Naohisa Hashimoto;Osamu Matsumoto	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-19743-2_25	conjoint analysis;computer science;simulation;mobilities;personal mobility	Robotics	-19.827898908967267	-23.9802651934625	11907

However, if not well designed, these services have a potential to dangerously distract drivers from their main driving task and therefore increase the risk of road accidents. Hence, we studied the effects of an in-car e-mail client on drivers' distraction. A low fidelity driving simulator was used to test 32 participants on their degree of distraction while driving. In this paper we present the findings of this evaluation. Our results show that when designing complex automotive services like an e-mail client one of the crucial factors besides the user interface is to keep the provided content simple and well structured thus reducing the amount of driver's distraction considerably.	device driver;driving simulator;email;simulation;user interface	Sergej Truschin;Tobias Schlachtbauer;Andreas Zauner;Michael Schermann;Helmut Krcmar	2011		10.1145/2381416.2381420	embedded system;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	HCI	-47.93084921709334	-46.78457256758866	11953

NoTs arise in several contexts such as large software projects, sensors cooperating for target tracking, and terrorist cell networks. Modeling a NoT as a simplicial complex, we consider the problem of quantifying the strength of a NoT using metrics based purely on its structure. While the design of a metric clearly depends on the context in question, most applications require the metric to be monotonic. We define three kinds of monotonicity - weak, team, and structural - depending upon whether we add/remove nodes, entire teams, or facets, respectively We propose seven metrics and analyze their monotonicity, both mathematically and experimentally. Specifically, we prove that some metrics or monotonic, and show that some or not by providing counter examples. For nonmonotonic metrics, we generate random simplicial complexes using a number of models, and estimate the fraction of cases for which a metric is not monotonic.	experiment;sensor;simplicial complex	Ali Assarpour;Saman Farhat;Ou Liu;Alexey Nikolaev;Amotz Bar-Noy;Prithwish Basu;Saad Mneimneh;Ram Ramanathan	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179420	face;simulation;computer science;sensor;machine learning;data mining;measurement;collaboration	Vision	-12.312222755484543	-14.688231493337057	11959

Consequently, there exists an interest in researching how to better enable support analysts to handle such escalations. In order to do so, we need to develop tools to reliably predict if, and when, a support ticket becomes a candidate for escalation. This paper explores the use of sentiment analysis tools on customer-support analyst conversations to find indicators of when a particular support ticket may be escalated. The results of this research indicate a considerable difference in the sentiment between escalated support tickets and non-escalated support tickets. Thus, this preliminary research provides us with the necessary information to further investigate how we can reliably predict support ticket escalations, and subsequently to provide insight to support analysts to better enable them to handle support tickets that may be escalated.	issue tracking system;natural language toolkit;natural language understanding;privilege escalation;sentiment analysis;thomas j. watson research center;ticket granting ticket	Benjamin Garnier;P.

Indirect manipulation operations are those initiated by command menus and buttons, to perform a transformation on a graphical object or set of graphical objects. The particular improvement is an operation’s ability to show both what would happen if the operation is committed and what would happen if it were cancelled, while an operation is being considered. The experiment required subjects to watch a simple alignment operation for a set of graphical objects. They were then asked to record the original placement of those graphical objects. Each task used one of four visual cues: modified telltale, wiggle, colour, or no visual cue. We found the modified telltale, wiggle, and colour visual effects significantly more effective than no visual feedback for cuing the user as to original position of the graphical objects. The modified telltale and colour effects were significantly more effective than the wiggle effect.	canned response;encode;graphical user interface;tell-tale;visual effects;wiggle stereoscopy	Bruce H.

Especially, supporting the analysis of datasets with a temporal dimension remains a significant challenge. Many techniques for the exploration of spatio-temporal data have been developed, but they prove to be only of limited use when applied to temporal origin-destination datasets. We present Flowstrates, a new interactive visualization approach in which the origins and the destinations of the flows are displayed in two separate maps, and the changes over time of the flow magnitudes are represented in a separate heatmap view in the middle. This allows the users to perform spatial visual queries, focusing on different regions of interest for the origins and destinations, and to analyze the changes over time provided with the means of flow ordering, filtering and aggregation in the heatmap. In this paper, we discuss the challenges associated with the visualization of temporal origin-destination data, introduce our solution, and present several usage scenarios showing how the tool we have developed supports them.	heat map;interactive visualization;money;network traffic control;region of interest	Ilya Boyandin;Enrico Bertini;Peter Bak;Denis Lalanne	2011	Comput.

97988bdcc6e9ae8d65528c1af4604511af65a077	reducing visual dependency with surface haptic touchscreens		Interactions with current touchscreens are highly dependent on a pattern of visual feedback. Recently, researchers have developed surface haptic technology that provides haptic feedback on flat touchscreens. This presents an opportunity to add tactile responses to touchscreen interactions. This paper demonstrates that surface haptic feedback can improve the task completion time and accuracy of manipulating non-visual bullseye menus giving users greater confidence while performing selection tasks. Results suggest that haptic technology could be incorporated into applications on touchscreen devices to improve accuracy where the user’s visual sensory channel is not available or is already occupied by another task.	haptic technology;touchscreen	Yu-Jen Lin;M.

They do not adequately cater for different approaches to constructing a program. After studying solutions to automatically assessed programming exercises, we found out that many different solutions are composed of a relatively small set of mutually similar code lines. Thus, they can be constructed by using the drag-and-drop approach if only it was possible to edit some small parts of the predefined fragments. Based on this, we have designed and implemented a new exercise type for mobile devices that builds on Parsons problems and falls somewhere between their strict scaffolding and full-blown coding exercises. In these exercises, we can gradually fade the scaffolding and allow programs to be constructed more freely so as not to restrict thinking and limit creativity too much while still making sure we are able to deploy them to small-screen mobile devices. In addition to the new concept and the related implementation, we discuss other possibilities of how programming could be practiced on mobile devices.	drag and drop;mobile device;python	Petri Ihantola;Juha Helminen;Ville Karavirta	2013		10.1145/2526968.2526974	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-48.19542473770202	-40.57985245340341	12052

I will show that the scale-free topology of these complex webs have important consequences on their robustness against failures and attacks, with implications on drug design, the Internet's ability to survive attacks and failures, and the ability of ideas and innovations to spread on the network.	complexity;emergence;internet;organizing (structure);self-organization;world wide web	Albert-László Barabási	2005		10.1145/1081870.1081873	cellular network;self-organization;simulation;evolving networks;metric;computer science;bioinformatics;scale-free network;web engineering;world wide web;complex network;drug design	ML	-18.364356869143148	-40.04459894055235	12058

The currently available technology-assisted solutions are of limited help because of two main issues: (i) the use of accelerometer or gyro-based wearable sensors for prediction of FOG are noise prone and (ii) deliver external cues without any individualization. In our present research, we have designed a low-cost system that can be attached as an add-on module on ordinary walking stick that can (i) predict freezing of gait (ii) deliver visual, auditory and/or vibratory cues in an individualized manner. We conducted a preliminary study with one PD participant. The preliminary results show potential of our system to reduce freezing counts, increase average step length and walk speed of the participant.	add-ons for firefox;gyro;sensor;wearable computer	Megh Patel;Gottumukala Sai Rama Krishna;Abhijit Das;Uttama Lahiri	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67687-6_26	human–computer interaction;computer vision;frost (temperature);computer science;wearable computer;gait;gait analysis;artificial intelligence;accelerometer	HCI	-48.404302927034614	-48.77194268928757	12089

The live component of the piece was realised on November 11, 1997, in the context of the exhibition “Arte Suporte Computador”, at the cultural centre Casa da Rosas, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “Time Capsule” was carried live on the evening newscast of the TV station Canal 21 and on tape by two other TV stations (TV Manchete and TV Cultura). The webscast was transmitted by Casa das Rosas. The object that gives the piece its title is a microchip that contains a programmed identification number and that is integrated with a coil and a capacitor, all hermetically sealed in biocompatible glass. The temporal scale of the work is stretched between the ephemeral and the permanent; i.e., between the few minutes necessary for the completion of the basic procedure, the microchip implantation, and the permanent character of the implant. As with other underground time capsules, it is under the skin that this digital time capsule projects itself into the future.	identifier;integrated circuit;ion implantation;remote database access;simulcast;under the skin;world wide web	Eduardo Kac	2000	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/BF01205454	capsule;anatomy;materials science	AI	-52.79262106160788	-28.250962136520215	12103

In this year’s iTrack we aimed at exploring the value of element retrieval for two different task types, fact-finding and research tasks. Two research groups collected data from 29 test persons, each performing two tasks. We describe the methods used for data collection and the tasks performed by the participants. A general result indicates that test persons were more satisfied when completing research task compared to fact-finding task. In our experiment, test persons regarded the research task easier, were more satisfied with the search results and found more relevant information for the research tasks.	design of experiments;nonlinear gameplay;relevance;turing test;wikipedia	Nils Pharo;Ragnar Nordlie;Khairun Nisa Fachry	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03761-0_31	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing	HCI	-34.32895109176735	-51.49903256830627	12105
ec5b3a7a6daf2f68f67903b939adf36bbf2a045a	a survey on big data and collective intelligence		The creation and accumulation of Big Data is a fact for a plethora of scenarios nowadays. Sources such as the ever-increasing diversity sensors as well as the content created by humans have contributed to the Big Data’s enormous size and unique characteristics. Making sense of these data has primarily rested upon Big Data analysis algorithms. Still, in one too many cases the effectiveness of these algorithms is hampered by the very nature of Big Data: analogue, noisy, implicit, and ambiguous. Enter Collective Intelligence: the capability of interconnected intelligences achieving ameliorated results in activities than each of the single intelligences creating the collective solely would. Accordingly, this work presents existing research on Big Data and Collective Intelligence. The work is concluded with the presentation of the challenges and perspectives of the common ground between the directions of Big Data and Collective Intelligence.	algorithm;ambiguous grammar;big data;collective intelligence;sensor;tree accumulation	Ioannis Karydis;Spyros Sioutas;Markos Avlonitis;Phivos Mylonas;Andreas Kanavos	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-57045-7_11	intelligence cycle;data science;data mining	ML	-36.74066590534747	-8.385199018133964	12113
85825bd0e9fd6e28a82efe3abb693e91ba1d7ca6	an acoustic-based encounter profiling system		This paper presents DopEnc, an acoustic-based encounter profiling system on commercial off-the-shelf smartphones. DopEnc automatically identifies the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones, and accelerometers integrated on mainstream smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9 percent false positive and 9.7 percent false negative in real usage.	acoustic cryptanalysis;automatic identification and data capture;doppler effect;experiment;frequency band;interaction;microphone;sensor;smartphone;usability testing	Huanle Zhang;Wan Du;Pengfei Zhou;Mo Li;Prasant Mohapatra	2018	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2017.2776915	conversation;distributed computing;profiling (computer programming);frequency band;doppler effect;accelerometer;mobile computing;computer science	Mobile	-24.863875957032807	-38.862774049063034	12154

Typically, each sequence is associated with an ordered list of elements. For example, in a movie rental application, a customer's movie rental record containing an ordered list of movies is a sequence example. Most studies about sequence analysis focus on subsequence matching which finds all sequences stored in the database such that a given query sequence is a subsequence of each of these sequences. In many applications, elements are associated with properties or attributes. For example, each movie is associated with some attributes like """"Director"""" and """"Actors"""". Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, all existing studies about sequence analysis do not consider the attributes of elements. In this paper, we propose two problems. The first problem is: given a query sequence and a set of sequences, considering the attributes of elements, we want to find all sequences which are matched by this query sequence. This problem is called attribute-based subsequence matching (ASM). All existing applications for the traditional subsequence matching problem can also be applied to our new problem provided that we are given the attributes of elements. We propose an efficient algorithm for problem ASM. The key idea to the efficiency of this algorithm is to compress each whole sequence with potentially many associated attributes into just a triplet of numbers. By dealing with these very compressed representations, we greatly speed up the attribute-based subsequence matching. The second problem is to find all frequent attribute-based subsequence. We also adapt an existing efficient algorithm for this second problem to show we can use the algorithm developed for the first problem. Empirical studies show that our algorithms are scalable in large datasets. In particular, our algorithms run at least an order of magnitude faster than a straightforward method in most cases. This work can stimulate a number of existing data mining problems which are fundamentally based on subsequence matching such as sequence classification, frequent sequence mining, motif detection and sequence matching in bioinformatics."""	actor model;algorithm;bioinformatics;data compression;data mining;experiment;ibm notes;internet information services;matching (graph theory);motif;regular expression;scalability;sequence analysis;sequential pattern mining;the old reader;triplet state	Yu Peng;Raymond Chi-Wing Wong;Liangliang Ye;Philip S.

Very often, it necessitates expensive high-tech resources, such as a CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), for setting-up an immersive environment in which all project stakeholders, especially users, would feel confortable enough for unleashing their valuable contribution. Our previous empirical study on low-cost immersive environments has unveiled the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion that fulfils the realism principle of a Living Lab facilitating users' contribution to alternative solutions and usage scenarios. However, this previous work had a limit of addressing individuals through their capacity of behaving naturally within different types of immersive platforms. As a step further, this paper presents the outcomes of an investigation to identifying and disentangling factors characterising a group immersion in the context of co-creation instead of an individual's immersion.	cave automatic virtual environment;immersion (virtual reality);living lab;real life	Marc Pallot;Olivier Christmann;Simon Richir;Laurent Dupont;Vincent Boly;Laure Morel	2017		10.1145/3110292.3110316	living lab;user experience design;immersion (virtual reality);experience design;human–computer interaction;mixed reality;engineering;augmented reality;virtual reality;cave automatic virtual environment	HCI	-58.497840014056194	-37.27106737256651	12172

Hiding behind this fairly bland definition is a complex set of technological challenges that cover areas ranging from NLP to context management, dialogue structure, feedback loops, and personalisation. In this talk Jennifer will first introduce several key NL projects from IBM Research to give an overview of the lab’s work and will then delve into the Life of Watson, what ’he’ could be when he ’grows up’, and the many deep research questions that need to be addressed along the way.

8e1f3d6cc22e56472d75f5ed80d0c1506b5fe271	supporting the process: adapting search systems to search stages		Search engines have become indispensable tools for the information related tasks performed by a wide variety of searchers across the globe, and the information literacy of these search engine users varies widely. The more complex tasks performed using search engines, involving learning and construction, may consist of multiple stages, potentially affecting searchers’ feelings, thoughts and actions. However, despite recent advances in personalization and contextualization, current search engines do not necessarily support these stages. This conceptual paper discusses the potential impact of search stages on the desired functionality of search systems. First, it looks at process models in the context of information literacy, followed by the support of current search engines for the stages described in these models. Finally, the paper reconciles the information literacy and system perspec‐ tives by discussing novel stage-aware search systems.	context-aware pervasive systems;experiment;information behavior;information literacy;information seeking;learning to rank;personalization;requirement;synergy;web search engine	Hugo C.

This significantly impacts the quality of global, low-dimensional space embedding procedures such as the popular multidimensional scaling (MDS) where one can often observe nonintuitive layouts. We were inspired by the perceptual processes evoked in the method of parallel coordinates which enables users to visually aggregate the data by the patterns the polylines exhibit across the dimension axes. We call the path of such a polyline its structure and suggest a metric that captures this structure directly in high-dimensional space. This allows us to better gauge the distances of spatially distant data constellations and so achieve data aggregations in MDS plots that are more cognizant of existing high-dimensional structure similarities. Our biscale framework distinguishes far-distances from near-distances. The coarser scale uses the structural similarity metric to separate data aggregates obtained by prior classification or clustering, while the finer scale employs the appropriate euclidean distance.	aggregate data;cluster analysis;embedding;euclidean distance measurement;inspiration function;parallel coordinates;structural similarity;multidimensional scaling;statistical cluster	Jenny Hyunjung Lee;Kevin T.

Consequentialism is a choice attitude towards outcomes and opportunities for choice and prioritizes outcomes rather than opportunities for choice. We first propose a sufficient condition for a restricted domain on which Arrow’s impossibility theorem holds. A domain such that there exists a similarity of choice attitudes within consequentialism satisfies the proposed domain condition. We observe that a diversity of choice attitudes within consequentialism is crucial to resolve an Arrovian impossibility, but this resolution is restricted in plausibility.

Both areas deal with the representation and support of data in a multi-dimensional space. Much of the OLAP literature does not refer to the Statistical Database literature, perhaps because the connection between analyzing business data and socioeconomic data is not obvious. Furthermore, there are papers published in one area or the other whose results can be applied in both application areas. In this paper, we compare the work done in these two areas. We discuss concepts used in the conceptual modeling of the data and operations over them, efficient physical organization and access methods, as well as privacy issues. We point out the terminology used and the correspondence between terms. We identify which research aspects are emphasized in each of these areas and the reasons for that We conclude by arguing for the support of a Statistical Object data type as one of the fundamental structures that object-oriented data models and systems should support 1 liItroduclion Both OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) and Statistical Databases (SDBs) deal with multidimensional datasets, and both am concerned with statistical summarizations over the dimensions of the data sets. Much of the work on SDBs took place in the 1980's but continues till today, while OLAP database work started mostly in the 1990's. Yet, despite the similarities in concepts the two communities do not, by and large, refer to each other's work We explore in this paper, the reasons for this state of affairs. Some can be traced to the applications that motivate each. Some can he explained by the different aspects emphasized in each. For example, much of the work in SDBs concentrated on conceptual modeling, while most of the work in OLAP concentrated on access performance. We start, in section 2, with a couple of illustrative example of SDBs and OLAP databases, and expose the conceptual similarity between them.

In this study, we analyze these issues and challenges in regards to its applications in bioinformatics, particularly genomic analysis and medical image analytics, and give the corresponding approaches and solutions. Although these solutions are mostly rule of thumb, they can effectively handle the issues connected to training learning machines. As such, we explore the tendency of deep learning technology by examining several directions, such as automation, scalability, individuality, mobility, integration, and intelligence warehousing.	deep learning	Ning Yu;Zeng Yu;Feng Gu;Tianrui Li;Xinmin Tian;Yi Pan	2017	JIPS	10.3745/JIPS.04.0029	scalability;data science;automation;architecture;deep learning;data mining;computer science;rule of thumb;artificial intelligence;analytics	ML	-36.77361300602036	-7.832194700448837	12225

ca8a0548a26ef48f4f83152adc1a727f5549b222	rddsacc: a reliable data distribution solution assisted by cloud computing		The reliable data distribution service has become an important component of current Internet information system, which performs the basic functions of various information systems including document transportation, data sharing, remote medical consultation and online education. However, the cloud computing technologies have been rapidly risking in recent years due to its ready expansion, high reliability, low cost and other advantages. Therefore, in combination with the advantages of cloud computing in terms of technology and cost, the research on cloud-computing-assisted reliable data distribution technologies is a practical and challengeable topic. In this paper, the in-depth analysis on the characteristics of reliable data distribution and cloud computing and their relations, the innovative proposing of a model of forwarding structure of cloud-computing-assisted reliable data distribution, the research on the cloud-computing-assisted data recovery and error control theory on the basis of aforementioned model together led to the introduction of a set of readily deployable, cloud-computer-assisted, and reliable data distribution service system. The research results are expected to be extended to the cloud computing services and meanwhile provide new ideas and technological supports for the reliable data distribution, which shall have important theoretical and practical values.	cloud computing;control theory;data distribution service;data recovery;error detection and correction;information system	Wei Zhang;Xinchang Zhang;Huiling Shi;Longquan Zhou	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications and 2017 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications (ISPA/IUCC)	10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00194	data mining;human–computer interaction;data distribution service;information system;the internet;reliability theory;cloud computing;computer science;data sharing;data modeling;data recovery	HPC	-46.10290521059255	-0.3369911489171777	12283

Due to the importance and popularity of OSNs and P2P swarming, the research community shows increasing interest in leveraging OSNs to improve data swarming performance. We present in this paper our findings on a few fundamental research issues in this emerging area, which are largely missing from existing work. Specifically, we conduct a measurement study of Douban, a popular online social network that hosts a large amount of user reviews on movies, and our analysis of this OSN provides strong empirical evidence of the association between users’ content interests and their online social friend relationship. Then we introduce a social scheme that lets peers simultaneously join multiple swarms of identical data content with the help from their online social friends. We demonstrate that this social scheme can result in significant performance improvement in both P2P streaming and file sharing systems. Furthermore, we explore the impact of various social graphs on the performance improvement of P2P streaming brought about by the social scheme. Our findings indicate that the scheme consistently achieves greater performance improvement on Erdos–Renyi’s random graphs than on other graphs such as Barabasi-Albert’s scale-free graphs and two social graphs empirically sampled from Facebook and Douban OSNs. Our results point to several important research directions of leveraging OSNs in data swarming system design. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As for many other online social networks, predicting potential friendships in the LiveJournal network is a problem of great practical interest. Previous work has shown that graph features extracted from the graph associated with the network are good predictors for friendship links. However, contrary to the intuition, user data (e.g., interests shared by two users) does not always improve the predictions obtained with graph features alone. This could be due to the fact that features constructed from a large number of user declared interests cannot capture the implicit semantic of the interests. To test this hypothesis, we use a clustering approach to build an interest ontology, and explore the ability of the ontology to improve the performance of learning algorithms at predicting friendship links, when interest-based features are used alone or in combination with graph-based features. The results show that ontology-based features can help improve the performance of several machine learning classifiers (in particular, random forest classifiers) at the task of predicting links in the LiveJournal social network.	algorithm;cluster analysis;cosine similarity;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);hierarchical clustering;interaction;latent semantic analysis;machine learning;numerical analysis;ontology (information science);ontology engineering;random forest;social network;wikipedia	Doina Caragea;Vikas Bahirwani;Waleed Aljandal;William H.

547aa9afc35e41a19109012759d3789698c53589	an investigative search engine for the human trafficking domain		Enabling intelligent search systems that can navigate and facet on entities, classes and relationships, rather than plain text, to answer questions in complex domains is a longstanding aspect of the Semantic Web vision. This paper presents an investigative search engine that meets some of these challenges, at scale, for a variety of complex queries in the human trafficking domain. The engine provides a real-world case study of synergy between technology derived from research communities as diverse as Semantic Web (investigative ontologies, SPARQL-inspired querying, Linked Data), Natural Language Processing (knowledge graph construction, word embeddings) and Information Retrieval (fast, userdriven relevance querying). The search engine has been rigorously prototyped as part of the DARPA MEMEX program and has been integrated into the latest version of the Domain-specific Insight Graph (DIG) architecture, currently used by hundreds of US law enforcement agencies for investigating human trafficking. Over a hundred millions ads have been indexed. The engine is also being extended to other challenging illicit domains, such as securities and penny stock fraud, illegal firearm sales, and patent trolling, with promising results.	entity;information retrieval;internet troll;knowledge graph;linked data;memex;natural language processing;ontology (information science);peer-to-patent;relevance;sparql;semantic web;synergy;web search engine;word embedding	Mayank Kejriwal;Pedro Szekely	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_25	search engine;memex;computer science;linked data;dig;data mining;architecture;semantic web;ontology (information science);patent troll	AI	-39.06486993591028	2.996711571493025	12318

The volume and variety of our data is extremely large, but understanding and capturing the semantics of the data is even more of a challenge. Finding the needle in the proverbial haystack has been attempted from many different angles. In this talk we will have a look at what approaches have been explored, what has worked, and what has not. We will see that there is still a large amount of work to be done and data mining is going to play a central role. We'll try to motivate that in order to successfully find bad guys, we will have to embrace a solution that not only leverages clever data mining, but employs the right mix between human computer interfaces, data mining, and scalable data platforms. Traditionally, cyber security has been having its challenges with data mining. We are different. We will explore how to adopt data mining algorithms to the security domain. Some approaches like predictive analytics are extremely hard, if not impossible. How would you predict the next cyber attack? Others need to be tailored to the security domain to make them work.  Visualization and visual analytics seem to be extremely promising to solve cyber security issues. Situational awareness, large-scale data exploration, knowledge capture, and forensic investigations are four top use-cases we will discuss. Visualization alone, however, does not solve security problems. We need algorithms that support the visualizations. For example to reduce the amount of data so an analyst can deal with it, in both volume and semantics.	algorithm;big data;computer security;data mining;human computer;knowledge management;sim lock;scalability;visual analytics;web analytics	Raffael Marty	2013		10.1145/2487575.2491132	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-36.75723840911581	-6.414471769215103	12358

In PSM, one major research issue is to produce top subspaces efficiently given a predefined subspace ranking measure. A common approach is to achieve an exact solution, which searches through the entire subspace search space and evaluate the target object's rank in every subspace, assisted with possible pruning strategies. In this paper, we propose EProbe, an Efficient Subspace Probing framework. This novel framework strives to initialize the idea of """"early stop"""" of the top subspace search process. The essential goal is to provide a scalable, cost-effective, and flexible solution where its accuracy can be traded with the efficiency using adjustable parameters. This framework is especially useful when the computation resources are insufficient and only a limited number of candidate subspaces can be evaluated. As a first attempt to seek solutions under EProbe framework, we propose two novel algorithms SRatio and SlidingCluster. In our experiments, we illustrate that these two algorithms could produce a more effective subspace traversal order. Being effective, the top-k subspaces included in the final results are shown to be evaluated in the early stage of the subspace traversal process."""	algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;experiment;machine learning;scalability;statistical model;tree traversal	Yan Zhang;Yiyu Jia;Wei Jin	2011		10.1145/2063576.2063922	random subspace method;mathematical optimization;cost-effectiveness analysis;machine learning;data mining	ML	-6.514074206697855	-38.247882778415445	12361

However, in real-life cases, people’s interactions tend to form a certain communication structure due to some external forces or personal factors. In this paper, we aim at discovering the potential communication structure, in which nodes are typed labels (e.g. job-titles) and edges stand for tight interactions between typed labels in an organizational social network. To tackle this problem, we propose to exploit the concept of information asymmetry to model the core-periphery property in the communication structure. The proximity asymmetry is defined to realize the information asymmetry. We also devise two random-walk methods to calculate the proximity asymmetry between typed labels. The experiments conducted on the Enron email dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms some heuristic ones.	email;experiment;greedy algorithm;heuristic;interaction;real life;social network	Cheng-Te Li;Shou-de Lin	2010	2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.171	information asymmetry;stochastic process;directed graph;computer science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;random walk;community structure;statistics;social network	SE	-16.660793199591055	-43.04267001005746	12362

We named this psychophysical influence caused by the difference between dynamics of the real object (R) and the virtual object (V) movement, the “R-V Dynamics Illusion.” There are many combinations of experiments that can be conducted. Previously, we conducted experiments of the case where the real object is rigid and the virtual object is dynamically changeable. In this paper, we conducted experiments of the case where the real object is liquid and both the real and the virtual objects are dynamically changeable. The results of the experiments showed that the subjects sensed weight differently when virtual object with a movable portion is superimposed onto a real liquid object.	cg (programming language);emoticon;eurographics;experiment;mixed reality;model–view–controller;pneumatic artificial muscles;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yuta Kataoka;Satoshi Hashiguchi;Fumihisa Shibata;Asako Kimura	2015		10.2312/egve.20151320	computer vision;simulation;object model;computer science;communication	Networks	-45.06274245319771	-49.367418244912585	12393

There were a number of endeavors in PL-Grid community taken to streamline ope- rations in past two years. All of them gave us valuable experience and better understanding of our specifics. Especially, the federated nature of the infrastructure appeared challenging. From the organizational point of view, the PL-Grid Infrastructure consists of 5 largest Polish computing centres, which collaboratively pro- vide resources to Polish researchers. On a technical level, this requires a number of processes running e.g. user registration, management of com- pute allocations (aka. computational grants), service availability moni- toring, service reporting, incident handling, etc. Running these processes in a way spending minimum energy and reaching their goal to a maxi- mum extent require good organization of activities.

529e06ac577e46161708bae06877a8a346fdfbdd	ruleselector: selecting conditional action rules from user behavior patterns		Modern smartphones and ubiquitous computing systems collect a wealth of context data from users. Conditional action rules, as popularized by the IFTTT (If-This-Then-That) platform, are a popular way for users to automate frequently repeated tasks or receive smart reminders, due to the intelligibility and control that rules provide to users. A key drawback of IFTTT systems is that they place the burden of manually specifying action rules on the user. While multiple rule mining algorithms have been proposed in existing work to automatically discover action rules, they generate hundreds of action rules, and the problem of how to present a small subset of rules to smartphone users and allow them to interactively select action rules remains unsolved. In this work, we take the first step towards solving this problem by designing and implementing RuleSelector, the first interactive rule selection tool to allow smartphone users to browse, modify, and select action rules from a small set of summarized rules presented to the user. We propose novel rule selection metrics to address the needs of smartphone users, and analyze the performance of RuleSelector using data from 200 users. We also perform a qualitative user study in order to evaluate how users use the RuleSelector tool and perceive the selected rules, and present the insights gained and design recommendations for future rule selection systems. Our users rated the selected rules from useful to very useful, and an important finding of our study is that users prefer an interactive rule selection system such as RuleSelector that automatically suggests rules, but allows users to select and modify the suggested rules. Finally, we examine the promise of RuleSelector in other ubiquitous computing systems such as smart homes and smart TVs by applying our tool to public context datasets from these domains.	algorithm;browsing;ifttt;intelligibility (philosophy);interactivity;smart tv;smartphone;ubiquitous computing;usability testing	Vijay Srinivasan;Christian Koehler;Hongxia Jin	2018	IMWUT	10.1145/3191767	data mining;ubiquitous computing;small set;intelligibility (communication);computer science;digital health	HCI	-36.51076405056592	-47.07475986597117	12475

878d274262f7424fb4a8940a8c6045567606ef14	spatio-temporal databases		ing from the temporal effects, a snapshot of the world can be described by the formula which Goodchild called “geographic reality” [102]. f(x, y, z) = a (2.5) The processes occurring in this physical reality have spatial and temporal extensions: some are purely local and happen very fast; others are very slow and affect very large regions. The processes of objects moving on the tabletop are fast (m/sec) and the spatial extent is small (m); movement of persons in cities is again fast (m/sec) and the movements of the buildings very slow (mm/annum); geological processes are very slow (mm/annum) and affect large areas (1000 km). One can thus associate different processes with different frequencies in space and time [95]. Each science is concerned with processes in a specific spectrum of space and time, which interact strongly; other processes, not included in this science, appear then to be either so slow or so fast that they can be considered constant. Space and time together form a four-dimensional space in which other properties are organized. Giving space and time a special treatment results in simpler formulations of the physical laws that are of particular interest to humans. For example, the mechanics of solid bodies, e.g., the movement of objects on a tabletop, is explainable by Newtonian mechanical laws, which relate phenomena which are easily observable for humans in a simple form (s = vt, etc.). Other sciences, e.g., astrophysics, prefer other coordinate systems in which mass is included. However, the assumption that the formula a = f(x, y, z, t) describes a regular function which yields only a single value, is equivalent to the assumption that there is only one single space-time world and excludes “parallel universes” as parts of reality. 2.5.2 Observation of Physical Reality Agents can – with their senses or with technical instruments – observe the physical reality at the current time, the “now”. Results of observations are measurement values on some measurement scale [189], which may be quantitative or qualitative. Such observations are assumed in later chapters of this book to describe, for example, the movement of airplanes. Observation with a technical measurement system comes very close to an objective, humanindependent observation of reality. A subset of the phenomena in reality is objectively observed. Many technical systems allow the synchronous observations of an extent of space at the same time, for example, remote sensing of geographic space from satellite (Figure 2.8). Typically a regular grid is used and the properties observed are energy reflected in some bands of wavelength (the visible spectrum plus some part of infrared). The same kind of observation as sampling in a regular grid can be used in any other situation, the blocks world on my table as well as the city, including moving objects. They can be sampled and described as a raster. Such observations are mainly used for robots, where TV cameras which sample the field in a regular	blocks world;database;integrated circuit layout design protection;observable;raster graphics;regular grid;robot;sampling (signal processing);snapshot (computer storage);system of measurement	Jan van Leeuwen	2003		10.1007/b83622	data mining;software;data model;spatial analysis;temporal database;spatial database;computer science	Graphics	-32.141862586026996	-27.502662963997714	12501

They are popular in helping users find movies, books and products in general. In this work, we design a restaurant recommender system based on a novel model that captures correlations between hidden aspects in reviews and numeric ratings. It is motivated by the observation that a user’s preference against an item is affected by different aspects discussed in reviews. Our method first explores topic modeling to discover hidden aspects from review text. Profiles are then created for users and restaurants separately based on aspects discovered in their reviews. Finally, we utilize regression models to detect the user-restaurant relationship.

In robosoccer, agents take actions based on the feedback they receive from the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel concept to select high level actions in a multi-agent environment. We conduce the whole problem to that of a defense strategy of goalie as it has got more scope for behavior recognition and action selection. We first characterize the various behaviors and actions so as to suit the HMM model. We then describe how these twin HMMs (Behavior Hidden Markov Model and Action Hidden Markov Model) are used in two different phases to recognize behaviors and select actions. Finally we present an algorithm that would implement the complete defense strategy of a goalie in key game situations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;action selection;algorithm;baum–welch algorithm;hidden markov model;high-level programming language;lempel–ziv–welch;markov chain;multi-agent system;robot;speech recognition;welch's method	Thanukrishnan Srinivasan;Srikanth P.

bd109ded3c17e18a8c317dfbff8db05d7d18dc16	employing spectral domain features for efficient collaborative filtering		Collaborative filtering (CF) is a powerful recommender system that generates a list of recommended items for an active user based on the ratings of similar users. This paper presents a novel approach to CF by first finding the set of users similar to the active user by adopting self-organizing maps (SOM), followed by k-means clustering. Then, the ratings for each item in the cluster closest to the active user are mapped to the frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The power spectra of the mapped ratings are generated, and a new similarity measure based on the coherence of these power spectra is calculated. The proposed similarity measure is more time efficient than current state-of-the-art measures. Moreover, it can capture the global similarity between users’ profiles. Experimental results show that the proposed approach overcomes the major problems in existing CF algorithms as follows: First, it mitigates the scalability problem by creating clusters of similar users and applying the time-efficient similarity measure. Second, its frequency-based similarity measure is less sensitive to sparsity problems because the DFT performs efficiently even with sparse data. Third, it outperforms standard similarity measures in terms of accuracy.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;coherence (physics);collaborative filtering;design rationale;digital signal processing;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;k-means clustering;organizing (structure);portable c compiler;recommender system;scalability;self-organization;self-organizing map;similarity measure;sparse matrix;spectral density	Doaa M.

515789cfeb7e8b0c8c2786d7659afe41ada9bc75	guest editorial to the special issue on models 2010		Welcome to this special issue of Software and Systems Modeling devoted to selected papers of MODELS 2010. The MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for exchange of innovative ideas and practical experience focusing on a very important new technical discipline: modeldriven software and systems engineering. The expansion of this discipline is a direct consequence of the increasing significance and success of model-based methods in practice. Numerous efforts resulted in the invention of concepts, languages and tools for the definition, analysis, transformation, and verification of domain-specific modeling languages and general-purpose modeling language standards, as well as their use for software and systems engineering. MODELS 2010, the 13th edition of the conference series took place in Oslo, Norway, October 3–8, 2010, along with numerous satellite workshops, symposia and tutorials. The conference was fortunate to have three prominent keynote speakers: Ole Lehrmann Madsen from Aarhus University, Denmark, Edward A. Lee from U.C. Berkeley, USA and Pamela Zave from AT&T Laboratories, USA. To provide a broader forum for reporting on scientific progress, as well as on experience stemming from practical applications of model-based methods, the 2010 conference accepted submissions in two distinct tracks: Foundations and Applications. The primary objective of the first track was to present new research results dedicated to advancing the state-of-the-art of the discipline, whereas the second aimed to provide a realistic and verifiable picture of the current state-of-the-practice of model-based engineering, so that the	domain-specific modeling;formal verification;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;modeling language;pamela zave;software and systems modeling;stemming;systems engineering;venue (sound system)	Dorina C.

89a3093ba9babdcd8ae90ffafe11905648b754dd	site selection of retail shops based on spatial accessibility and hybrid bp neural network		The increase of consumer income has resulted in the rapid development of the retail industry in China, which provides high market potential for retail companies worldwide. However, site selection for retail shops has been a confusing business issue in practical business decisions. In this study, a two-step hybrid model in site selection for small retail shops was proposed. The two steps were spatial accessibility evaluation and market potential estimation. The spatial accessibility of target regions was evaluated based on the improved gravity model to determine regions that lack retail shops. Then, a PCA (principal component analysis)–BP (backpropagation network) model was established to estimate the market potential in the target regions. The two-step model could determine sites with the most market potential and low competition. We conducted the experiment in Guiyang, China and considered 18 socioeconomic factors to make the site selection convincing. Through the experiment, 42 locations were determined with high business value; the locations were recommended to the new retail shops. The accuracy of the PCA–BP model was then proven satisfactory by comparing it with other regression methods. The proposed model could guide retail chains in enhancing business location planning and formulating regional development policies.	accessibility;apache poi;artificial neural network;backpropagation;experiment;gravity model of trade;principal component analysis;purchasing;social media	Luyao Wang;Hong Fan;Yankun Wang	2018	ISPRS Int.

2ce17f17ab4d9ce280265a5147e0e6f62bebc8a7	an unexpected unity among methods for interpreting model predictions		Understanding why a model made a certain prediction is crucial in many data science fields. Interpretable predictions engender appropriate trust and provide insight into how the model may be improved. However, with large modern datasets the best accuracy is often achieved by complex models even experts struggle to interpret, which creates a tension between accuracy and interpretability. Recently, several methods have been proposed for interpreting predictions from complex models by estimating the importance of input features. Here, we present how a model-agnostic additive representation of the importance of input features unifies current methods. This representation is optimal, in the sense that it is the only set of additive values that satisfies important properties. We show how we can leverage these properties to create novel visual explanations of model predictions. The thread of unity that this representation weaves through the literature indicates that there are common principles to be learned about the interpretation of model predictions that apply in many scenarios.	data science;utility functions on indivisible goods	Scott Lundberg;Su-In Lee	2016	CoRR		computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;statistics	ML	-25.536743481124073	-36.25343245960038	12615

Roberts [10] showed that it is sufficient for all social choice functions whose domain is unrestricted. Lavi, Mu'alem and Nisan [6] proved the sufficiency of weak monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] proved sufficiency for order-based domains with range constraints and for domains defined by other special types of linear inequality constraints. Here we show the more general result, conjectured by Lavi, Mu'alem and Nisan [6], that weak monotonicity is sufficient for functions defined on any convex domain.	convex set;graphical user interface;linear inequality;social inequality	Michael E.

DataSphere expedites data importing using a NoSQL data management system and dynamically renders its user interface for concept-based querying tasks. DataSphere provides an interactive query-building interface together with query translation and optimization strategies, which enable users to build and execute queries effectively and efficiently. We successfully loaded a dataset of one million patients for University of Kentucky (UK) Healthcare into DataSphere with more than 300 million clinical data records. We evaluated DataSphere by comparing it with an instance of i2b2 deployed at UK Healthcare, demonstrating that DataSphere provides enhanced user experience for both query building and execution.

One of the mathematical models of the similarity – the metric space – has drawn attention of many researchers resulting in several sophisticated metric-indexing techniques. An important part of a research in this area is typically a prototype implementation and subsequent experimental evaluation of the proposed data structure. This paper describes an implementation framework called MESSIF that eases the task of building such prototypes. It provides a number of modules from basic storage management to automatic collecting of performance statistics. Due to its open and modular design it is also easy to implement additional modules if necessary. The MESSIF also offers several ready-to-use generic clients that allow to control and test the index structures and also measure its performance.	data structure;mathematical model;modular design;prototype;similarity search	Michal Batko;David Novak;Pavel Zezula	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77088-6_1	computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database	DB	-31.06624705687922	2.489155591431834	12737

On-line results clustering is useful for providing users with overviews of the results and thus allowing them to restrict their focus to the desired parts. On the other hand, the various metadata that are available to a WSE (Web Search Engine), e.g. domain/language/date/filetype, are commonly exploited only through the advanced (form-based) search facilities that some WSEs offer (and users rarely use). We propose an approach that combines both kinds of metadata by adopting the interaction paradigm of dynamic taxonomies and faceted exploration. This combination results to an effective, flexible and efficient exploration experience.	advanced transportation controller;analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;chi;categorization;cluster analysis;data mining;dynamic problem (algorithms);emoticon;entity–relationship model;exploratory testing;faceted classification;human factors and ergonomics;image retrieval;information retrieval;lecture notes in computer science;mined;palo;programming paradigm;springer (tank);suffix tree;taxonomy (general);tree structure;usability testing;web services distributed management;web services enhancements;web search engine;yang	Panagiotis Papadakos;Stella Kopidaki;Nikos Armenatzoglou;Yannis Tzitzikas	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04346-8_12	web search engine;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	AI	-29.430350925985987	-38.271087266657986	12738

This paper investigates how lay people of different age, gender and educational background perceive the use of infographics for information visualization in daily tasks. We chose three topics of general interest: weather, study and work and three infographics, one for each topic. We administered a questionnaire to people randomly split in two groups: the first group interacted with a static version of each infographic, i.e., a snapshot of it; the second group interacted with the fully configurable infographics. We aimed to assess information quality on different dimensions, to take into account both formal and substantial aspects; interaction quality along dimensions like usability and ease of use; and design quality on the dimensions of the Visualization Wheel by Cairo, to assess the trade-off between information complexity and aesthetics of infographics. The goal was to measure whether the quality of infographics affects the perception of information and the users' interaction. The overall results suggest that, although interactive infographics are perceived as more complex, the experience with them is better. From our observations, we derived a model to assess the overall quality of static and interactive infographics, based on information, interaction and design quality dimensions.	infographic;usability testing	Angela Locoro;Federico Cabitza;Rossana Actis-Grosso;Carlo Batini	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.032	psychology;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;social psychology;infographic;world wide web;statistics	HCI	-59.44182506393668	-46.57548266466001	12739

5e774e15410fad1bd053800d6f35c59347c0803d	defeasible decisions: what the proposal is and isn't		"""In two recent papers, I have proposed a description of decision analysis that differs from the Bayesian picture painted by Savage, Jeffrey and other classic authors. Response to this view has been either overly enthusi­ astic or unduly pessimistic. In this paper I try to place the idea in its proper place, which must be somewhere in between. Looking at decision analysis as defeasible reasoning produces a framework in which planning and decision theory can be integrated, but work on the details has barely begun. It also produces a framework in which the meta-decision regress can be stopped in a reason­ able way, but it does not allow us to ignore meta-level decisions. The heuristics for producing arguments that I have presented are only supposed to be suggestive; but they are not open to the egregious errors about which some have worried. And though the idea is fa­ miliar to those who have studied heuristic search, it is somewhat richer because the control of dialectic is more interesting than the deepening of search. 1 What the Proposal Is. """"Defeasible Specification of Utilities"""" [Loui89a] and """"Two Heuristic Functions for Decision"""" [Loui89b] pro­ posed that decision analysis could profitably be con­ ceived as defeasible reasoning. Analyzing a decision in one decision tree or model is an argument for doing a particular act. The result of analysis with a different tree of model is another argument. That there can be multiple arguments suggests that there can be better arguments and lesser arguments. Thus, arguments for decisions must be defeasible. Response to this idea has been mixed, but often im­ moderate. This paper attempts to temper the reaction by saying what the proposal is and isn't. 1.1 Like Qualitative, Defeasible, Practical Reasoning. The proposed defeasible reasoning about decisions is the natural extension of philosophers' defeasible prac­ tical reasoning about action. The difference is that our arguments for actions are quantitative, often invoking expected utility calculations. In practical reasoning, reasoning about action is qual­ itative. If an act achieves a goal, that's a reason for performing that act. If an act achieves a goal but also 245 invokes a penalty, and that penalty is more undesir­ able than the goal is desirable, that may be reason not to perform the act. Eveyone assumes that practical reasoning is defeasible in this way: that is, an argu­ ment for an action can be defeated by taking more into account in its deliberation. But this had never been formalized as defeasible reasoning, to my knowl­ edge, because formalisms for defeasible reasoning are relatively new. Now that we have such formalisms, we can write the general schemata for practical reasoning quite simply: (a)(d). fa ACHIEVES d A d IS-DESl >-foo al, (a)(d). fa ACHIEVES d A d IS-UNDESl >-f-,(ooa)l, where """" >-"""" is a relation between sentences that corresponds roughly to our intuitive relation """"is a reason for""""; ( z) is a meta-language quantifier. Ax­ ioms that govern such a relation are described in [Loui87,88b] and [Simari89a]. They are similar to ax­ ioms given by other authors ([Geffner88,89], [Nute89J, [Delgrande87]). Reasons can be composed to form arguments. So prior to considering interference among contemplated ac­ tions, we might produce the argument: """"a1 ACHIEVES d1 A d1 IS-DES11 >-""""oo a1"""" """"a2 ACHU!)VES d2 A d2 IS-DES11 >""""oo a2"""" """"oo a1 A oo a2"""" >""""oo a1 & a2''. But there may be other arguments that disagree with this argument, such as """"a1 & a2 ACHIEVES d3 A d3 IS-UNDES11 >""""...,(oo a1 & a2)"""". In fact, we should be able to write our reasons in such a way that preference among arguments can be achieved with the specificity defeaters in defeasible inference, i.e., those rules that tell us to prefer one argument over another if it uses more information. Suppose I am reasoning about whether to rent an Alfa, though it incurs a. big expense. An argument for rent­ ing an Alfa is based on the following reason: """"rent-the-Alfa ACHIEVES drove-Alja /\ drove­ Alia IS-DEs"""" >""""oo rent-the-Alfa"""". A different argument which comes into conflict is based on the reason: """"rent-the-Alfa ACHIEVPlS incurred-big-ezpense A incurred-big-ezpense IS-UNDEs"""" >""""...,(oo rent-the-Alja)"""". There is no reason to choose among these arguments, so they interfere and neither justifies its conclusion. Suppose further that taking into account the desir­ ability of driving the Alfa and the undesirability of incurring big expense, I judge the combination to be undesirable. """"drove-Alf a IS·DI!Is A incurredbig-expen6e Is.uNnas >-""""(drove-Alfa & incurred-big-expense) IsUND&s. Then there is a third argument, based on the combined reasons: """"drove-Alfa IS-Das A incurredbig-expense rs-uNnas >-""""(drove-Alfa & incurred-big-expense) Is-uNnBs """"rent-the-Alfa ACHII!IV!Is (drove-Alfa & incurred­ big-e:cpen6e) 1\ (drove-Alfa & incurred-big­ e:cpense) rS-UNDss >-""""...,(no rent-theAlfa)"""". This argument disagrees with the first argument, which was in favor of renting the Alfa. But it takes into account all of the information that the first argument takes into account, and it does so in a way that can­ not be counter-argued. So it is a superior argument; it defeats the first argument. All of this reasoning about action is defeasible. There may be other arguments, based on what else we notice that renting the Alfa achieves, and what we may know about their desirability in various contexts. As more consequences of action are inferred, more arguments can be presented. Eventually, defeat relations among those arguments are proved. At any time, based on the pattern of defeat relations among presented argu­ ments, there is either an undefeated justification for taking a particular action, or there are interfering ar­ guments whose conflict has not been resolved. In the latter case, we might fall back on our un-tutored in­ clination (e.g., to rent the Alfa). Sometimes we act for reasons; sometimes we act for very good reasons; sometimes we do not have the luxury of having unan­ imous reasons, or any reasons at all. Of course, this qualitative practical reasoning is a very weak way of analyzing tradeoff's. It does not take into account known risks of actions, that is, known proba­ bilities of acts achieving various effects. 1.2 But Quantitative and Risk-Sensitive. What I have proposed is a quantitative version of this defeasible reasoning about decisions. An act achieves an effect with known probability, and we have inde­ pendent reasons for the utilities of each of the result­ ing states. By weighing these independent utilities by their respective probabilities, we produce an argument for the utility of the act. With different independent reasons for the utilities of resulting states, we get dif­ ferent arguments. With different accounting of the possible results of an act, again, we produce different arguments. If we are clever, reasons can be written in an existing formalism for defeasible reasoning in such 246 a way that those arguments that justify their conclu­ sions are exactly those arguments that we would con­ sider compelling among the multitude of potentially conflicting arguments. Suppose I consider the possibility that my department will reimburse me for renting the Alfa, and calculate its probability to be 0.4. Based on expense and access to the Alfa, I assess the utilities of the various resulting states and calculate an expected utility for renting the Alfa. If it is greater than the utility of renting the econo-car, it represents an argument for renting the Alfa. u( dept-pays; rent-the-Al fa BASED-ON expense; whether-drove-Alfa) = 10 utils u( -,dept-pays; rent-the-Alf a BASI!ID-oN expense; whether-drove-Alfa) = -1 utils Expected u(rent-the-Alfa BASED·ON expense; whether-drove-Al fa; whether-dept-pays) 3.4 utils u( rent-econo-car) = 2 utils therefore, defeasibly, rent-the-Alf a. But if instead I consider expense, access to the Alfa, and the dissatisfaction of my department chairman, in the assessment of utilities, then I produce a different argument. u(dept-pays; rent-the-Alfa BASED-ON expense; whether-drove-All a; how-chairman-reacts) = 8 utils u( -,dept-pay6; rent-the-Alfa BASED· ON expen6e; whether-drove-Al fa; how-chairman-reacts) = -4 utils Expected u(rent-the-Alfa BASED-ON expense; whether-drove-A/fa; how-chairman-reacts; whether-dept-pays) = 0.8 utils u(rent-econo-car) = 2 utils therefore, defeasibly, rent-econo-car. As before, there may be other arguments, based on other contingencies to be analyzed ( e.g., whether I can fool the accounting secretary, whether it rains, etc. ) and other factors that affect the independent reasons for valuing various states of the world (e.g., how my colleagues react, how my friends react, etc. ) . Nor­ mally, in decision analy sis we require all such reasons to be taken into account in advance. For computa­ tional and foundational reasons, this is not so here. One way this reasoning can be formalized is with the following axiom schemata, which presume as default that there is a linear-additive structure to utility when exceptions are not known. Properties, such as P and Q, make basic contribu­ tions to the utility of a state in which they are known to hold. If the contribution of P is x and the contri­ bution of Q is y, that provides a reason for taking the contribution of the conjunction to be the sum of x and y. Ax.l. (:c)(y)(P)(Q). rcontr(P) = :c & contr(Q) = yl >-rcontr(P & Q) = :c + yl. . ' This is defeated if we know independently the contri­ bution of P & Q to be something other than the sum of the individual contributions. """"contr"""" maps properties to utility contributions. Any information about this mapping, together with the knowledge that property P holds in state 6, provides a reason for taking the utility of s to be the contribution of P. If P & Q is known to hold in 6, then taking u(s) to be the contribution of P & Q will result in a better argument for what is the utility of&. Ax.2. (P)(8).

With these, accidents between bicycles and pedestrians have increased accordingly. Generally, these accidents will occur at blind corners where pedestrians have difficulty to see them. In the cities, more effective and smart way for decreasing the accident is expected. We proposed a system that warns with the calls of smartphone for both the pedestrian and people who ride on the bicycle on the corner if they approach and expect danger of collision. The system we proposed and have implemented uses two-way communication method that is provided by the GPS location information commonly installed within the smartphones. In this paper, we will describe the purpose, design and implementation, and show the experimental results and discussion of the future vision.	collision detection;experiment;radio wave;sensor;smartphone;window blind	Hiroyuki Yoshida;Atsushi Hoshina;Miyuki Nakano;Midori Sugaya	2015		10.1145/2800835.2801638	embedded system;simulation;global positioning system;computer science;operating system;bluetooth;computer security	Mobile	-20.01688955793916	-28.67759173473384	12770

Two studies examined whether such processes also apply to interactions with robots. In both studies, participants had one-at-a-time sessions, in which they disclosed a personal event to a non-humanoid robot that responded either responsively or unresponsively across two modalities (gestures, text). Study 1 showed that a robot’s responsiveness increased perceptions of its appealing traits, approach behaviors towards the robot, and the willingness to use it as a companion in stressful situations. Study 2 found that in addition to producing similar reactions in a different context, interacting with a responsive robot improved self-perceptions during a subsequent stress-generating task. These findings suggest that humans not only utilize responsiveness cues to ascribe social intentions to robots, but can actually use them as a source of consolation and security.	responsiveness;robot	Gurit E.

Flooding is a major problem for the river, and therefore over the last 50 years a large number of interventions have been made in its reaches and tributaries, in order to control the flooding events in the lowland area, downstream of the Huayuankou hydrological station. The development of new technologies and approaches to decision support has raised possibilities for creating new ways of managing the river and reducing loss of life, in the case of flooding, for the people living within the embankment area of the river. Given the importance of the river for the development of economic activity in China, it is essential to increase the understanding of the general flooding processes triggered by several reservoir operation scenarios, and then, after applying them to a flooding model of a specific area, to test the findings. The main goal of the research presented here is to investigate and develop the statistical inference between the operation of reservoirs on the Yellow River and a set of variables related to the downstream flooding, such as the total flooding volume and the peak discharge. The research shows that it is possible to use such inference models as decision support tools, by reducing the number of explanatory variables to be included in the simulations carried out to determine the appropriate reservoir operation.

0d96330537bcff3ef9dd2d60264eca5243d815f0	sailing the information ocean with awareness of currents: discovery and application of source dependence		The Web has enabled the availability of a huge amount of useful information, but has also eased the ability to spread false information and rumors across multiple sources, making it hard to distinguish between what is true and what is not. Recent examples include the premature Steve Jobs obituary, the second bankruptcy of United airlines, the creation of Black Holes by the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, etc. Since it is important to permit the expression of dissenting and conflicting opinions, it would be a fallacy to try to ensure that the Web provides only consistent information. However, to help in separating the wheat from the chaff, it is essential to be able to determine dependence between sources. Given the huge number of data sources and the vast volume of conflicting data available on the Web, doing so in a scalable manner is extremely challenging and has not been addressed by existing work yet. In this paper, we present a set of research problems and propose some preliminary solutions on the issues involved in discovering dependence between sources. We also discuss how this knowledge can benefit a variety of technologies, such as data integration and Web 2.0, that help users manage and access the totality of the available information from various sources.	database schema;large hadron collider;linkage (software);plasma cleaning;recommender system;scalability;web 2.0;world wide web	Laure Berti-Équille;Anish Das Sarma;Xin Dong;Amélie Marian;Divesh Srivastava	2009	CoRR		simulation;computer science;data science;data mining;database	DB	-36.77752569263671	-9.869745977484772	12887

We compare a baseline method treating users and jobs as documents, where suitability is measured using cosine similarity, with a model that incorporates job transitions trained on the career progressions of a set of users. We show that the job transition model outperforms cosine similarity. Furthermore, a cascaded system combining career transitions with cosine similarity generates more recommendations of a similar quality. The analysis is conducted by examining data from 2,400 LinkedIn users, and evaluated by determining how well the methods predict users’ current positions from their profiles and previous position history.	baseline (configuration management);color gradient;cosine similarity;jaishankar menon;java advanced imaging;job stream;recommender system	Bradford Heap;Alfred Krzywicki;Wayne Wobcke;Mike Bain;Paul Compton	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13560-1_32	computer science;knowledge management;data mining	Web+IR	-28.42311468204733	-48.972037300206395	12893

Unfortunately, this presents challenges to the web search community, as a web page's representation in the browser (i.e., what users see) can diverge dramatically from its raw HTML content (i.e., what search engines index and retrieve). For example, interactive pages may contain content in regions that are not visible before a user action, such as focusing a tab, but which are nonetheless still contained within the raw HTML. We study this divergence by comparing raw HTML to its fully rendered form across a number of metrics spanning presentation, geometry, and content, using a large, representative sample of popular web pages. We find that a large divergence currently exists, and we show via a historical analysis that this divergence has grown more pronounced over the last decade. The general finding of our study is that continuing to index the web via simple HTML parsing will diminish the effectiveness of retrieval on the modern web, and that the IR community should work toward more sophisticated web page processing in indexing technology.	file spanning;html;interactivity;javascript;markup language;parsing;pixel;raw image format;spatial variability;vergence;web content;web page;web search engine	Karl Gyllstrom;Carsten Eickhoff;Arjen P. de Vries;Marie-Francine Moens	2012		10.1145/2396761.2398558	html scripting;ajax;search engine indexing;web development;site map;framing;content security policy;span and div;html;web design;rendering;html5;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;artificial intelligence;web page;data mining;database;multimedia;client-side scripting;progressive enhancement;web 2.0;world wide web;website parse template;information retrieval	Web+IR	-35.33552146738311	-48.49198938470705	12905

An important domain for collaborative armed robots is interacting with humans and objects on a table, for example, picking, placing, or handing over a variety of objects. Such tasks combine object representation and movement planning in the geometric domain with abstract reasoning about symbolic spatial representations. This paper presents an initial study in which a human partner teaches the robot words for spatial relationships by providing exemplars and indicating where words may be used over the surface. This study demonstrates how robots can be taught the words required for these tasks in a quick and simple manner that allows the concepts to be generalizable over different surfaces, objects, and object placements.	humans;intelligent agent;interaction;lexicon;robot	Ruth Schulz	2017		10.1145/3125739.3132579	symbol grounding;computer science;robot;machine learning;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-33.53698110062725	-41.10467490441033	12910

When data is maintained overrn geographically remote sites the computational power of distributedrn and parallel systems can be exploited for knowledge discovery inrn scientific data. In this scenario the Grid can provide an effectivern computational support for distributed knowledge discovery on largern datasets. In particular, Grid services for data integration andrn analysis can represent a primary component for e-sciencern applications involving distributed massive and complex data sets.rn This paper describes some research activities in data-intensive Gridrn computing. In particular we discuss the use of data mining modelsrn and services on Grid systems for the analysis of large datarn repositories.

For complex system such as multiagent ones, usability evaluation is still an issue, and requires new test techniques to assess autonomous and interactive behaviors. This paper deals with investigation about the evaluation of the Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) in Complex Systems: A review on evaluation methods and introduce domain-specific requirements is presented; A mechanism for the evaluation of HMI is proposed. Also, an implementation of an automatic tool dedicated to the assessment of complex interactive systems based on fuzzy logic approaches is explained; A solution to automate the evaluation of the HMI that reduces the need for expert assessment and fully integrates end-users into the HMI evaluation loop is suggested. These are assessed in the urban transit control room in the city of Valenciennes, France. The comparative study deals with acceptance, motivation and perceived happiness.	complex systems;human–computer interaction;usability	Ilhem Kallel;Mohamed Jouili;Houcine Ezzedine	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-76348-4_61	machine learning;complex system;complex system;fuzzy logic;systems engineering;software;artificial intelligence;usability;computer science	HCI	-61.504383322012025	-45.53264665576167	12929

Hereby, the focus lies on evaluating the performance of embedded pressure sensors as reliable detectors for social cues, such as postural states. We have designed chair covers and trousers that were evaluated in two studies. The results show that these relatively simple sensors can distinguish postures as well as different behavioural cues.	embedded system;modality (human–computer interaction);sensor	Sophie Skach	2018		10.1145/3242969.3264968	computer vision;human–computer interaction;social cue;artificial intelligence;social relation;e-textiles;nonverbal communication;conversation analysis;computer science	HCI	-50.066538706304506	-48.93590099358963	12951

1266266cdf22de548ead7beb374a6ea6e118f994	editorial: state of the journal		AS IEEE’s Transactions on Affective Computing (TAC) reaches its fifth anniversary I have many positive developments to note. First, and most significant for our readers, TAC’s first official impact factors were released and we came in at a whopping 3.47. This is extraordinary for a new journal and makes us the second highest rated journal in IEEE’s Computer Society. For those interested in artificial intelligence research, this places us well above the top-ranked Artificial Intelligence (2.71). It even places us above the top journal for emotion research, Emotion (3.37). Clearly the field of affective computing has grown up. I am also happy to announce that the Sixth International Conference on Affective Computing in in the historic city Xi’an, China (home of the Terra Cotta Warriors) on September 21-24, 2015. TAC will be coordinating several events with this premier venue for affective computing. At the conference, we plan to recognize the most influential paper published in TAC and TAC will publish a special issue of the best papers presented at the conference. The conference proceedings will also be available through IEEE. We’ve made several changes to our editorial board as long-running members have come up for retirement.

In social interactions, it is important to be able to express recognizable emotions. Studies show that the iCat robot, with its humanoid facial features, has this capability. In this paper we look if a Nao robot, without humanoid facial features, but with a body and colored eyes is also able to express recognizable emotions. We compare the recognition rates of the emotions between the Nao and the iCat. First a set of bodily expressions of the Nao for five basic emotions (angry, fear, happy, sad, surprise) was created and evaluated. With a signal detection task, the best recognizable bodily expression for each emotion was chosen for the final set. Then, fourteen children between 8 and 9 years old interacted both with the Nao and iCat to recognize the emotions within context, in a story-telling session, and without context. These interactions were repeated one week later to study the learning effect. For both robots, recognition rates for the expressions were relatively high (between 68 and 99 % accuracy). Only for the emotional state of sadness, the recognition was significantly higher for the iCat (95 %) than for the Nao (68 %). The emotions shown within context had higher recognition rates than those without context and during the second interaction the emotion recognition was also significantly higher I. Cohen (B)· R.

To conclude: we succeeded to design a set of well-recognized dynamic emotional expressions for a robot platform, the Nao, without facial features. These expressions were better recognized when placed in a context, and when shown a week later. This set provides useful ingredients of social robot dialogs with children.	detection theory;email;emotion recognition;interaction;nao (robot);sadness;social robot	Iris Cohen;Rosemarijn Looije;Mark A.

baea2e200c30078cbc3ed51bd8f46334b5eb222b	iscram 2013 conference proceedings - book of papers		"""celebrating its 10 th anniversary. We cordially thank all members of the ISCRAM board, the program and scientific committee as well as the organization team including the student volunteers for their immense effort and time spent to make this conference a success. Innovations in crisis response and management, by its very nature, require an interdisciplinary and holistic approach, crossing and overcoming the boundary between the scientific and the practitioners' community. The present proceedings reflect the practical needs against the variety of scientific methods and architectural approaches, also encompassing the chances and challenges offered by the rapid evolution of the Internet towards the integration of Things (Sensor Web), Services and People (social media). We wish you a pleasant and inspiring lecture and look forward to future joint projects, co-operations and discussions with you on holistic crisis management! Sincerely, It is my pleasure to welcome you on behalf of the ISCRAM Association Board to this 10 th edition of our ISCRAM conference in Baden-Baden. At the time I am writing this, less than a month to go before the start of the Conference, at last the many pieces of the complex puzzle that a Conference program is are falling into place. The program has been published, registrations have reached the magic number of 200 since a few days now, and final details are being arranged for the social event and the conference dinner. Now is the proverbial 'silence before the storm' – that almost unreal time when the organizers take a last deep breath before all of us start arriving in the days before the Conference kicks-off on Sunday with the PhD Colloquium and the famously traditional """" Belgian Beer """" evening. Needless to say, this is the end point of a long and intense journey. A journey that officially started at the conference dinner in May last year, in Vancouver, when conference chair Professor Beyerer informed us of the venue of the conference, and provided us with a glimpse of what we could expect. Since that day in May, the conference chairs, the program chair and her co-chairs, the track chairs, the PhD Colloquium chair, the workshop chairs, the ISCRAM Events Committee chair, the ISCRAM Academic Publications and Standards Committee chair and numerous others have worked relentlessly to build the program, step by step, month by month.

In the new version, each evolutionary operator acts locally and visually to part of the population of swarms on a screen, without causing entire generation changes that were used in earlier versions. This new architecture is intended to represent cognitive actions in human thinking and decision making processes more naturally. We tested the effectiveness of the new architecture through an in-class experiment with college students participating as designers as well as evaluators of swarms. We also measured the effects of mixing and mutation operators to the performance improvement of the design processes. The students' responses showed that the designs produced using the new version received significantly higher ratings from students than those produced using the old one, and also that each of the mixing and mutation operators contributed nearly independently to the improvement of the design quality. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new architecture of interactive evolutionary design, as well as the importance of having diverse options of action (i.e., multiple evolutionary operators in this context) in iterative design and decision making processes. This work also presents one of the few examples of human-involved experiments on the statistical evaluation of artificial lifeforms, whose quality (such as “livingness“) would be hard to assess without using human cognition at this point.	cognition;continuous design;experiment;iterative and incremental development;iterative design;self-propelled particles;swarm robotics	Hiroki Sayama;Shelley D.

In this paper, we propose an efficient development method of adequate UML documents which can be used by inexperienced designers. This method consists of three countermeasures: (1) develop requirement specifications that contain all information necessary for development of UML documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP), (2) share all information about developed UML documents and reuse it when developing other UML documents and (3) decide on a UML document development process for inexperienced designers. To evaluate proposed method, we conducted experiments and used questionnaires. The results show a correct answer rate became 120[%] for the proposed method in comparison with the conventional method, development time became 80[%] and usability was improved.	class diagram;countermeasure (computer);emoticon;experience;experiment;natural language processing;unified modeling language;usability	Masakazu Takahashi;Satoru Takahashi;Yoshikatsu Fujita	2008	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2008.021939	natural language processing;unified modeling language;uml tool;computer science;applications of uml;node;engineering drawing;algorithm;statistics	SE	-37.79715843944737	-27.619261275250604	12998
edfbd1917141a54abca0334ba09a58693e47a8d4	editor's message to special issue on extensions and advances in music information processing		There has been the great progress and expansion both in depth and width in music information processing research. Recent sophistication of acoustic signal processing and machine learning techniques, realization of large-scale application systems, such as Apple Music and Google Play Music, which leverage information on the Internet have contributed to the progress of such research developments. On the other hand, research in music creation has also become popular, due to the spread of new musical instruments/systems with physical interfaces developed as a part of the current digital fabrication movement, and also from new ideas generated by utilizing ideas in other fields of research. This special issue of music information processing is the first for the IPSJ journal which includes audio/video data. The audio/video data have been handled as a part of the submitted papers, i.e., were subject to peer-reviewing along with the papers, and are archived with the accepted papers of this edition. Considering the characteristics of music, it is very important to archive and convey not just the paper, but also specific contents of the research results accurately and clearly, which was impossible with only conventional paper media. This special issue was planned to increase the value of academic reference materials with this aim. While this objective may not be applicable to all research in the computer science area, we feel that this trial is essential for IPSJ to provide academic information services in the multimedia era. Out of 29 submissions, seven papers were accepted (i.e. acceptance rate 24%) by the editorial committee of this special issue that was organized from the committee of the Special Interest Group of Music Information Processing. Two papers were submitted with media data and both were accepted for publication in this issue. We would like to thank all the authors for their contributions, and reviewers for short-term peer-reviewing. We also would like to thank to the editorial committee and secretaries of IPSJ.	acoustic cryptanalysis;archive;computer science;digital modeling and fabrication;information processing;machine learning;peer-to-peer;play store;signal processing	Shigeyuki Hirai	2016	JIP	10.2197/ipsjjip.24.469	computer science;theoretical computer science;multimedia	ML	-58.05395993179449	-19.42709745918584	12999
49431a1e9adc5bcc14aa73723d19ae70156fda20	an intelligent possibilistic approach to reduce the effect of the imperfection propagation on land cover change prediction		The interpretation of satellite images in a spatiotemporal context is a challenging subject for remote sensing community. It helps predicting to make knowledge driven decisions. However, the process of land cover change (LCC) prediction is generally marred by imperfections which affect the reliability of decision about these changes. Propagation of imperfection helps improve the change prediction process and decrease the associated imperfections. In this paper, an imperfection propagation methodology of input parameters for LCC prediction model is presented based on possibility theory. The possibility theory has the ability to han- dle both aleatory and epistemic imperfection. The proposed approach is divided into three main steps: 1) an imperfection propagation step based on possibility theory is used to propagate the parameters imperfection, 2) a knowledge base based on machine learning algorithm is build to identify the reduction factors of all imperfection sources, and 3) a global sensitivity analysis step based on Sobol's method is then used to find the most important imperfection sources of parameters. Compared with probability theory, the possibility theory for imperfection propagation is advantageous in reducing the error of LCC prediction of the regions of the Reunion Island. The results show that the proposed approach is an efficient method due to its adequate degree of accuracy.	software propagation	Ahlem Ferchichi;Wadii Boulila;Imed Riadh Farah	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24306-1_51	simulation;artificial intelligence;operations research	ML	-9.920163876983143	-23.767438498430746	13001

This article presents a way of building a VRS system with Software Packages to support Electrical Engineering Virtual Laboratories to be used in a near future in the teaching of the curriculum unit of Circuit Theory. The steps required for the construction of a project are presented in this paper. The simulation is still under construction and intends to use a three-dimensional virtual environment laboratory electric measurement, which will allow users/students to experiment and test the modeled equipment. Therefore, there are still no links available for further examination. The result may demonstrate the future potential of applications of Virtual Reality Systems as an efficient and cost-effective learning system.	adobe flash;autocad;autodesk 3ds max;cinema 4d;electrical engineering;email;java;network analysis (electrical circuits);simulation;virtual reference station;virtual reality;wirefusion	Manuel Travassos Valdez;Carlos Machado Ferreira;Fernando Pires Maciel Barbosa	2012	iJOE		embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;instructional simulation;operating system;computer engineering	Visualization	-35.50572031421332	-21.886851822443045	13019

Collisions of proton beams at   5  +  5    TeV   were expected within one to two months of the initial tests, with data taking at design energy (  7  +  7    TeV  ) foreseen for 2009.  In order to process the data from this world machine, we have put our “Higgs in one basket” – that of Grid computing [The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), in: Proceedings of the Conference on Computational Physics 2006 (CCP 2006), vol. 177, 2007, pp. 219–223]. After many years of preparation, 2008 saw a final “Common Computing Readiness Challenge” (CCRC'08) – aimed at demonstrating full readiness for 2008 data taking, processing and analysis. By definition, this relied on a world-wide production Grid infrastructure.  But change – as always – is on the horizon. The current funding model for Grids – which in Europe has been through 3 generations of EGEE projects, together with related projects in other parts of the world, including South America – is evolving towards a long-term, sustainable e-infrastructure, like the European Grid Initiative (EGI) [The European Grid Initiative Design Study, website at  http://web.eu-egi.eu/ ]. At the same time, potentially new paradigms, such as that of “Cloud Computing” are emerging.  This paper summarizes the results of CCRC'08 and discusses the potential impact of future Grid funding on both regional and international application communities. It contrasts Grid and Cloud computing models from both technical and sociological points of view. Finally, it discusses the requirements from production application communities, in terms of stability and continuity in the medium to long term.

1041ef450bccf03bc72616f8910b14b6d04c436c	a graph-based concept discovery method for n-ary relations		Concept discovery is a multi-relational data mining task for inducing definitions of a specific relation in terms of other relations in the data set. Such learning tasks usually have to deal with large search spaces and hence have efficiency and scalability issues. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach that combines association rule mining meth- ods and graph-based approaches to cope with these issues. The proposed method inputs the data in relational format, converts it into a graph representation, and traverses the graph to find the concept descriptors. Graph traversal and pruning are guided based on association rule mining techniques. The proposed method distinguishes from the state-of-the art methods as it can work on n-ary relations, it uses path finding queries to extract concepts and can handle numeric values. Experimental results show that the method is superior to the state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy and the coverage of the induced concept descriptors and the running time.

35b287d59b792254dd09f3565247e077a5faa1f7	between page and screen by amaranth borsuk and brad bouse. translating an ar poetry book		Our poster is devoted to the English-Polish translation of the augmented reality book Between Page and Screen by Amaranth Borsuk and Brad Bouse. The prominent digital media scholar K. N. Hayles wrote about the relationship between the analogue and the digital: “In the contemporary era, both print and electronic texts are deeply interpenetrated by code. Digital technologies are now so thoroughly integrated with commercial printing processes that print is more properly considered a particular output form of electronic text than an entirely separate medium.” Between Page and Screen is an illustration of these processes on one of the possible reading levels. The authors tell the tale of the relationship between the analogue book and digital screen in the form of an epistolary concrete poetry dialogue between two protagonists, P. and S. The nature of the relationship is underlined by the fact that the work comprises of a traditional book with QR codes (sold in bookstores) and an online application for reading it. The two platforms are inextricably joined in the reading process (which cannot take place if one of the links is missing). The translation of the book and application involves innovations and challenges unheard of in the case of conventional books. Our poster is a visual guide through the process of translation and publication of the AR book in Poland.	augmented reality;book;digital media;my life as a teenage robot;printing;qr code;visual guide;web application	Piotr Marecki;Aleksandra Malecka	2017			poetry;amaranth;art;performance art	HCI	-60.762069141596776	-19.72893300273834	13064

For this task, the existing spherical embedding method, as well as the other standard graph embedding methods, can be used. However, these existing methods either produce poor visualization results or require extremely large computation time to obtain the final results. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new spherical embedding method based on a power iteration, which additionally performs two operations on the position vectors: double-centering and normalizing operations. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the proposed method always converges. In our experiments using bipartite graphs constructed from the Japanese sites of Yahoo!Movies and Yahoo!Answers, we show that the proposed method works much faster than these existing methods and still the visualization results are comparable to the best available so far.

Starting with Call Detail Records (CDRs) from a cellular telephone network that have gone through a straightforward anonymization procedure, the prior WHERE modeling approach produces synthetic CDRs for a synthetic population. The accuracy of WHERE has been validated against billions of location samples for hundreds of thousands of cell phones in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. In this paper, we introduce DP-WHERE, which modifies WHERE by adding controlled noise to achieve differential privacy, a strict definition of privacy that makes no assumptions about the power or background knowledge of a potential adversary. We also present experiments showing that the accuracy of DP-WHERE remains close to that of WHERE and of real CDRs. With this work, we aim to enable the creation and possible release of synthetic models that capture the mobility patterns of real metropolitan populations while preserving privacy.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;big data;cloud computing;differential privacy;ecology;experiment;graham scan;j.w. graham medal;mobile phone;population;sim lock;sampling (signal processing);synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Darakhshan J.

Especially, in this network, detecting accurately clusters is an important technique to realize a service of group action. Therefore, we propose a discovery technique of overlapping cluster in self-organizing network. Proposed method performs hierarchical clustering to detect and identify groups. To achieve this, we make a hierarchy structure by comparing similarity between two edges sharing one node. All of edges in network are represented with tree; these are grouped by specific modularity which is a boundary to cut groups.

This paper presents a dynamic task allocation approach for such situations. The proposed approach consists of an information collection mechanism, a group task allocation mechanism and a group coordination mechanism. Initially, the information collection mechanism is applied to help agents in communication networks to reduce their communication connections and select one agent in each network as the network leader in a decentralised manner so as to facilitate the collection of information for task allocation under communication constraints. Then, the group task allocation mechanism is employed by each network leader to allocate tasks and agents in its network to groups with suitable space ranges by considering time, space and communication constraints as well as the differing capabilities of agents. During task execution, due to the dynamics of disaster environments, the original allocation (by the group task allocation mechanism) of tasks and agents in groups may be unsuitable. In order to achieve continuous coordination of the heterogeneous agents among groups under communication constraints, the group coordination mechanism is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can have better performance than many existing approaches in terms of information collection and dynamic task allocation in disaster environments under time, space and communication constraints.	scheduling (computing);software agent;telecommunications network;the computer journal	Xing Su;Minjie Zhang;Quan Bai	2015	Comput.

eb2e896e2e3348fd8f6b7a38902d13460bbdad26	review of tomorrow's human robots flesh and machines: how robots will change us. by rodney a. brooks. pantheon 2002	human robot;rodney a	With this book, Rod Brooks has again branched out into something new. Having got us used to the idea of embodied, situated robots, he has now produced the most situated book I have ever read. Flesh and Machines sets non-industrial robotics into its historical context, describes current technology, and then moves forward. Sensibly, the prediction phase of the book is limited to the near future, to the effect of production versions of machines that already exist in prototype. This book describes the current state-of-the-art in several areas of robotics and biotechnology. This gives the book its situatedness—it is so integrated into the “now” that it will probably be out of date next Christmas, and a collector’s item by Christmas 2004. And this despite the fact that it contains virtually no technical detail, being a chatty but fast-moving historical and philosophical story of the way robotics has developed and the way it might well go. This is a book for non-specialist technophiles and all who are interested in the ways that people and technology interact. If you want scientific, robotic, technical detail, read the original papers or Brooks’ Cambrian Intelligence instead. Obviously, any historical account of the development of Brooksian robotics will contain a large amount of material on Brooks himself, on his robots, and on work done by people in Brooks’ lab. Partly for this reason, the book contains chunks of autobiography. If you want to know more about the man himself, this book gives some fascinating insights. This can lead to imbalance in places (e.g., Brooks’ incursion into the toy industry is given too much space in my opinion) but allows anecdotes giving background to some of my favorite experiments—the type of anecdote that never makes its way into more formal papers. Brooks manages to avoid narcissism by a healthy margin due to a friendly, factual style that invites readers to think things through for themselves. One of the things that really struck me about the book is the way that potentially explosive issues such as whether humans are “special,” and the existence of almost production-level technological enhancements for army personnel are discussed in such a calm and calming manner. Some of these issues need discussion by an informed and politically aware populace, covering the sort of research that governments normally want to implement or destroy before too many people know about it. How this book got past the censors might be an interesting tale in itself. The initial chapters of the book are a wellresearched and thought-out discussion of how previous technical revolutions have shaped and changed human life. Chapter 1 covers technological revolutions. After a brief historical tour from the stone age to the information revolution, today’s robotic and biotechnical revolutions are presented along with some predicted consequences. With particular relevance to the book’s title, Brooks predicts that the biotechnical revolution will result in both people with robotic parts and robots with biological parts, making the division between the two increasingly blurred. This theme recurs later in the book, showing why	experiment;industrial robot;information revolution;outline of robotics;prototype;relevance;situated	Bridget Hallam	2001	Adaptive Behaviour	10.1177/10597123010093008	artificial intelligence	HCI	-59.22302842428274	-23.550775263531946	13224

I’ve guest edited multiple special issues for CiSE (including this one) over that span, and I’ve served as an associate editor in chief for about 10 years. It’s a great privilege and honor to carry on the editorial work and continue serving the community as EIC for the next few years. In looking over the numerous publications still available today, I firmly believe that CiSE remains a unique forum for scientists and engineers to exchange their ideas. CiSE provides a platform for disseminating new technologies and fostering new interdisciplinary findings. My plan for the magazine is simple: find the best topics and encourage the best scientists and engineers to write for us. The EIC role is a point of contact, a conduit for making this happen. The major challenge for CiSE ’s continued success is to find important topics that will have historic significance as well as attract the attention of scientists and engineers in diverse fields. CiSE will continue to build on its impressive track history if we continue to build on its themes, quality, diversity, and creativity, both in terms of articles and departments. With our copublishers, the American Institute of Physics and the IEEE Computer Society, behind us, I believe our efforts will bring significant value. Together with our strong editorial board, I’ll be working hard to bring you special issues that will hold your interest in our magazine’s related fields. That said, I also know this is a work in progress, and I’m eager to hear your own views about improving our content in general and our publication in particular.

254f7866d650dd6a3c4309d9efd83503d794958b	"""editors's introduction to the special issue on """"100 years of alan turing and 20 years of slais"""""""		"""Alan Mathison Turing (1912 1954) was an English mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of """"algorithm"""" and """"computation"""" by way of the Turing machine. His work played a pivotal role in the creation of the modern computer science. Turing is widely considered to be the father of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. SLAIS (Slovenian Artificial Intelligence Society) is an association of researchers and practitioners in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Slovenia. Most of them come from universities and research institutes, but there are members from industrial and commercial organizations as well. The society promotes theoretical and applied research as well as the transfer of AI technology to industrial and commercial environments. SLAIS was founded in 1992 and is a member society of ECCAI (European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence). This special issue is centered on the Alan Turing centenary or the Alan Turing Year and the 20th anniversary of the Slovenian Artificial Intelligence Society. The first theme of the special issue is related to Turing’s unique impact on Mathematics, Computing, Computer Science, Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, Philosophy and computational aspects of Physics, Biology, Linguistics, Economics and the wider scientific world. In our call for papers relating to Turing, contributions were encouraged either concerning his life or his achievements. In addition, we also called for papers relating to Donald Michie (1923–2007), Turing's contemporary and active member of Slovenian national institutions (associate member of J. Stefan Institute, and corresponding member of Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts). The second theme of the special issue is related to the 20th anniversary of SLAIS, the Slovenian AI society. We called for papers about important achievements of Slovenian AI that importantly contributed to the field of AI in the national and international context, both in theory and practice. We encouraged authors to present achievements from an historical perspective, their contributions to the field of AI, their impacts to an information society and possible impacts on the advancement of AI. We are delighted to present the nine papers comprising this special issue. Two papers focus on Alan Turing. The Child Machine vs. the World Brain discusses Alan Turing's Child Machine idea of learning as an incremental process based on a mixture of instruction and trial-and-error learning. Alan Turing, Turing Machines and Stronger discusses contributions of Alan Turing to Computer Science, comparing Turing's importance to that of Einstein within Physics. Seven papers focus on different aspects of Artificial Intelligence. Two of them provide a summary of research issues, results and systems in the field of Mining Big Data in Real Time and in the field Data Stream Mining For Ubiquitous Environments. The remaining five papers review research contributions of SLAIS members over substantial periods of time: Automatic Text Analysis by Artificial Intelligence, Advances in Data Mining for Biomedical Research, Explanation and Reliability of Individual predictions in machine learning, DEX Methodology: Thirty three years of qualitative multiattribute modeling, and ORANGE: Data Mining Fruitful and Fun. The latter two papers describe development issues in two publicly available systems that have over decades attracted large user communities world wide."""	aty;academy;algorithm;big data;computation;computer science;computer scientist;cryptanalysis;data mining;data stream mining;european coordinating committee for artificial intelligence;informatics;machine learning;object process methodology;turing machine	Dunja Mladenic;Stephen Muggleton;Ivan Bratko	2013	Informatica (Slovenia)		computer science	AI	-57.907625493269904	-19.73474248423463	13235

As a network of social relationships evolves by the addition of new nodes and edges, fast algorithms are desirable for the recomputation of key network measures such as actor centrality. The distributed computing paradigm offers a scalable approach to addressing the recomputation challenge. This paper develops a Map-Reduce implementation of an incremental All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) algorithm. The incremental nature of the approach allows for performing minimal work in updating centrality measures, while the Map-Reduce implementation makes it scalable to large data. The key idea of the incremental APSP algorithm [1] is based on the efficient use of past information about the shortest paths between any node and the neighbors of the newly added node. A presented parallelized version of the algorithm relies on a three-step iterative execution of the """"map"""" and """"reduce"""" jobs. Experiences with its implementation are reported in application to a real-world dataset containing 7115 nodes.

Taxis may be observed, e.g. in single-celled organisms, paramecia and Escherichia coli. Control in these organisms is implemented by chemical means. Shortly after multi-celled organisms appeared, their cells began to specialize. Early mobile multi-celled organisms also demonstrate taxis. For example, the pillbug seeks light. In medusa (jellyfish) of Phylum cnidaria the control task is accomplished by neuronal methods. The author is aware of no reports of jellyfish with associative memories. Thus, there exist multi-celled organisms that can control the motion of their bodies, yet possess no memory capacities. We speculate that the first task of neuronal circuitry was that of control rather than that of memory. In this paper we discuss the properties of neurons that make them natural controllers.

However, avatar control may be tedious. Motion capture systems based on 3D sensors have recently reached the consumer market, but webcams and camera-phones are more widespread and cheaper. The proposed demonstration aims at animating a user’s avatar from real time 3D motion capture by monoscopic computer vision, thus allowing virtual telepresence to anyone using a personal computer with a webcam or a camera-phone. This kind of immersion allows new gesture-based communication channels to be opened in a virtual inhabited 3D space.	camera phone;computer vision;immersion (virtual reality);internet;motion capture;personal computer;real-time transcription;sensor;virtual reality;webcam	David Antonio Gómez Jáuregui;Patrick Horain	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33885-4_77	computer vision;particle filter;computer science;monocular vision;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-41.376416451524	-38.07791760109901	13275

On the other hand, the main objective of the search system is to maximize expected user satisfaction over a rather long period, what requires showing more relevant documents on average. The state-of-the-art approaches to solving this exploration-exploitation dilemma rely on strongly simplified settings making these approaches infeasible in practice. We improve the most flexible and pragmatic of them to handle some actual practical issues. The first one is utilizing prior information about queries and documents, the second is combining bandit-based learning approaches with a default production ranking algorithm. We show experimentally that our framework enables to significantly improve the ranking of a leading commercial search engine.	algorithm;computer user satisfaction;experiment;web search engine	Aleksandr Vorobev;Damien Lefortier;Gleb Gusev;Pavel Serdyukov	2015		10.1145/2736277.2741104	ranking;multi-armed bandit;isotonic regression;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;reinforcement learning	Web+IR	-32.51372936049742	-51.97502815533246	13306

49841e2e569f540b1b37238558406f3aed85db60	effects of viewing condition on user experience of panoramic video		Panoramic video arises at the convergence of TV and virtual reality, and it is necessary to understand how these technologies interact to affect user experience in order to produce useful content. TV and film makers have developed a sophisticated language and set of techniques to achieve directed linear story telling on fixed screens, whereas virtual worlds more often emphasise user led exploration of possibly non-linear narrative and aspects such as presence and immersion in navigable 3D environments. This study focused on the user experience of panoramic video as viewed over two conditions, on a VR headset and using a handheld phone, and compared this to watching on a static screen thus emphasising the differences between traditional and panoramic TV. A qualitative approach to analysis was taken where users participated in semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis was performed which produced thematic maps describing user experience for each condition. A detailed and nuanced account of emerging themes is given. Subsequently, key themes were identified and graphed to produce user response profiles to the three viewing conditions that highlight differences in user experience in terms of presence, attention, engagement, concentration on story, certainty, comfort and social ease.	handheld game console;headset (audio);immersion (virtual reality);mobile phone;nonlinear system;pc game;semiconductor industry;thematic map;user experience;virtual reality;virtual reality headset;virtual world	Peter J.

This paper presents an intelligent vehicles virtual reality (IVVR) platform, which is an interdisciplinary software application of VR & AHS. It aims at the control algorithm design and verification for intelligent vehicles. Firstly, the design of IVVR platform is implemented by several UML functional diagrams; then, software technology as well as its realization methods are presented; finally, some intelligent vehicles behaviors simulations like maintenance of a secure inter-vehicular distance or lane-change are experimented in IVVR platform and real-time animation could be obtained with good performance besides the figures and data.	algorithm design;computer animation;diagram;experiment;interaction;platoon (automobile);real-time transcription;simulation;unified modeling language;virtual reality	Minzhi Luo;Abdelkader El Kamel;Guanghong Gong	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083652	unified modeling language;embedded system;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;virtual reality	Robotics	-21.887606476746186	-24.311299278723517	13348

They are required in many applications, including entity resolution, spell checking, similarity joins, and biological sequence comparison. Most existing techniques for approximate string matching used in entity resolution only consider the two strings that are compared. They neglect contextual information such as the frequency of how often strings occur in a database, the likelihood of the character edits between strings, or how many other similar strings there are in a database. In this paper we investigate if incorporating such contextual information into edit distance based approximate string matching can improve matching quality for real-time entity resolution. In this application, query records have to be matched in sub-second time to records in a large database that refer to the same entity. We evaluate our approach on two large real data sets and compare it to several baseline approaches. Our results show that considering edit frequency and the neighborhood size of a string can improve matching results, while taking string frequencies into account can actually make results worse.	approximate string matching;baseline (configuration management);computer data storage;data structure;database;edit distance;mathematical optimization;query optimization;real-time clock;real-time locating system;spell checker;string (computer science);string searching algorithm;tf–idf	Peter Christen;Ross W.

The proposed platform adopts user involvement in the content collection level through the implementation of a mobile application easily downloadable to the user’s smartphone and the use of a web portal application. Complementary web portal permits the management of the collected content in a trustworthy manner adopting an extended role-based access control model for authorization purposes. Users can formulate private groups to contribute and share content. Platform guarantees the soundness of contributed content through an auditing procedure requested by the contributors and conducted by experts selected randomly. In order to stress the applicability of our platform to various cultural environments, we present a number of usage scenarios targeting various stakeholders from specialists and museum curators to students, teachers and simple enthusiasts aiming in the devel‐ opment of coherent narrations.	authorization;case preservation;coherence (physics);critical point (network science);documentation;mobile app;randomness;role-based access control;smartphone	Marinos Ioannides;Eleanor E.

903e01be32ece2465091162f0c4db55ffa45b50e	essentials of an integrated crowd management support system based on collective artificial intelligence		The simulation of the dynamical behavior of pedestrians and crowds in spatial structures is a consolidated research and application context that still presents challenges for researchers in different fields and disciplines. Despite currently available commercial systems for this kind of simulation are growingly employed by designers and planners for the evaluation of alternative solutions, this class of systems is generally not integrated with existing monitoring and control infrastructures, usually employed by crowd managers and field operators for security reasons. This paper introduces the essentials and the related computational framework of an Integrated Crowd Management Support System based on a Collective Artificial Intelligence approach encompassing (i) interfaces from and to monitored and controlled environments (respectively, sensors and actuators), (ii) a set of software tools supporting the analysis of pedestrians and crowd phenomena taking place in the environment to feed a (iii) faster than real-time simulation of the plausible evolution of the current situation in order to support forms of inference providing decision support to crowd managers, potentially directly controlling elements of the environment (e.g. blocking turnstiles, escalators), communicating orders to operators on the field or trying to influence the pedestrians by means of dynamic signage or audible messages.	as-interface;artificial intelligence;blocking (computing);canonical quantization;context (computing);decision support system;real-time transcription;simulation;turnstile	Giuseppe Vizzari;Stefania Bandini	2016	CoRR		simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-24.1800412976898	-20.345529034209143	13384

While playing the game, the players are continuously given to choose their preference between two snacks until the final winner is decided. During the gameplay, various nutrition facts and information on the snacks are provided to the players to facilitate their choices.  We conducted a study with 38 participants and interviewed them about the gameplay. The study results show that 36 percents of the participants are willing to change their eating habits for better health and 55 percents of the respondents mentioned that their interest and attention in the food information increased. The interview results from the participants suggests that the game can effectively help the players (or customers) choose snack foods in the market through the information provided by the gameplay.	mobile game	Joongsin Park;Bon-Chang Koo;Jun-Dong Cho;Byung-Chull Bae	2015		10.1145/2793107.2810331	psychology;multimedia;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-58.31688027562755	-45.447731950582074	13417

The phrase ‘archaeological community’ is one widely used but rarely defined, and there is always a tendency towards the division of archaeology into a variety of distinct specialisms: yet one of the major aspects of academic life is in the construction of communities of shared interests. Here I draw upon my own experiences of encouraging others to become involved in efforts to develop those areas of enquiry that interest me. This includes the construction of formal networks but also more ‘covert’ activities by inserting contributions into conferences and sometimes publications where they may not have been initially welcomed. It was awkward and slightly dangerous work, especially early in my career, and I am not sure it always achieved what I intended.		John R.

0f4d35469d936f36da3883892ae8b5ff77770514	a paradigm shift in the distribution of multimedia	paradigm shift	M ultimedia blends two or more media together, such as text, graphics, sound, or movies. The Internet, home to multimedia for quite some time, has been stymied by the transmission requirements of multimedia partnerships. Indeed, audio and video often require several megabytes to work in tandem, thus taking a great deal of time to transmit. For this reason, their availability has been sharply limited for most users. Multimedia works best as an interactive endeavor, but for the most part, Internet multimedia is not interactive; it’s click and wait. The intertwining of multimedia and the Internet makes sense. People prefer multimedia on their desktops. It’s engaging, entertaining, and makes otherwise complex systems a little easier to use and understand. Traditionally, much of the information sent over the Internet has a specific destination, such as an email message sent to a specific colleague. A request for a Web page is transmitted to a single host, and the host sends back the requested information to the single recipient. Although computers can handle a substantial number of these requests every second, the information is basically one-to-one: One computer sending the information and only one receiving it. This arrangement seems fine until we wish to send information simultaneously to more than one person. IP multicast supports this type of transmission efficiently by enabling sources to send a single copy of a message to multiple recipients who explicitly want to receive the information [7]. This is far more efficient than requiring the source to send an individual copy of a message to each requester (point-to-point unicast), in which case the number of receivers is limited by the bandwidth available to the sender. It is also more efficient than broadcasting one copy of the message to all nodes (broadcast) on the network, since many nodes may not want the message, and because broadcasts are limited to a single subnet. IP multicast is an extension to the standard IP network-level protocol. IP multicasting is the transmission of an IP datagram to a host group, a Gerard Parr and Kevin Curran	complex systems;computer;datagram;email;graphics;internet protocol suite;megabyte;multicast;one-to-one (data model);point-to-point protocol;requirement;subnetwork;unicast;web page	Gerard P.

However, tracking becomes more complex when dealing with multiple small objects of similar form. We propose to use tangible mediators for integrating such objects to tabletops. This paper reports on our initial explorations of mediated tabletop interaction consisting of a mediator prototype and a design space definition. We built a mediator, the Rabbit, a device that translates thevalue of an RFID tag into a visual 2D code. The Rabbit rests on the interactive surface, holds the object, reads its passive RFID tag, and converts the read value into a 2D code that can be read by the DIT's built-in camera. When handling multiple objects, the Rabbit iterates through the generated 2D codes.

Although these academic fields are very important, we believe that other subjects such as language, music, arts, literature, history, etc., are also essential for future generations. For this reason, the goal of this research is to explore the potential use of robots as educational tools for non-technology related fields such as history. We discuss an alternative approach for designing robots inspired in traits and characteristics of historical figures that play an important role in the topic to be studied. We provide several examples of conceptual designs of robots inspired in ancient gods or historical characters of Mesoamerican and South American cultures. We discuss how some of the traits of ancient gods and characters could serve as inspiration for the appearance design of commercial robots, and how these robots could be used in educational environments to attract the attention of students to learn about this history topic.	robot	Christian I.

63f626bc73fa89f23567be27f1961d5de3534e05	an implicit feedback integrated lda-based topic model for iptv program recommendation	decision support systems	Internet protocol television (IPTV), the television services through the Internet, has become more and more popular in recent years. Many recommendation systems have been made for delivering personalized IPTV services, of which understanding users' preference is the most critical. The traditional recommendation system only considers the users' playing behavior, but other implicit feedback behaviors of users, such as browsing, collecting also reflect the users' preference. We propose a novel latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based model, which considers users' playing behavior as well as the implicit feedback of browsing and collecting, to capture the inherent viewing preference of individual users. The implicit feedback integrated LDA model employs three LDA models (the playing, browsing, and collecting behavior topic model), which are integrated via TV program characteristic. Based on this, we further calculate the ratio of each behavior to the recommended results by logistic regression algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed topic model yields an average 32.5% precision for recommending 10 videos and 200 topics in IPTV recommendation, and its performance is an average of 19.5% higher than that of LDA using playing behavior only.	algorithm;feedback;iptv;latent dirichlet allocation;logistic regression;personalization;topic model	Jie Zhang;Yujun Li;Mo Chen;Lina You	2016	2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751624	computer science;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	Metrics	-23.406203435650934	-47.99954321603156	13517

New technologies such as wireless ad hoc networks have the potential to re-connect listeners who are now separated by headphones. We report on a field study of Push!Music, a novel mobile music sharing system. Push!Music allows both manual and automatic sharing of music between users through ad hoc wireless networking, and also provides a social awareness of other users nearby. The system was used by 13 subjects for three weeks. In post-study interviews, we identified four categories of results: social awareness, sharing music with friends, sharing music with strangers, and sharing automatically. Based on this, we present implications for design that can be applied not only to mobile music sharing systems, but to mobile media sharing in general: Allow division into active and passive use; enhance the awareness of who, where and when; support reciprocity; and finally, support identity and impression management.	field research;file sharing;headphones;hoc (programming language);mobile media	Maria Håkansson;Mattias Rost;Lars Erik Holmquist	2007				HCI	-58.94554520945752	-40.56854726890149	13526

While this distance has shown high retrieval quality, its high computational complexity underscores the need for efficient search methods. Recent research has shown that a huge improvement in search efficiency is achieved when using metric indexing. In this paper, we analyze the applicability of Ptolemaic indexing to the signature quadratic form distance. We show that it is a Ptolemaic metric and present an application of Ptolemaic pivot tables to image databases, resolving queries nearly four times as fast as the state-of-the-art metric solution, and up to 300 times as fast as sequential scan.	computational complexity theory;database;full table scan;pivot table;similarity measure	Jakub Lokoc;Magnus Lie Hetland;Tomás Skopal;Christian Beecks	2011		10.1145/1995412.1995417	quadratic form;biological classification;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;brand;database;mathematics;cluster analysis;computational complexity theory;world wide web;information retrieval;algorithm	DB	-6.286159324043095	-41.450433665925594	13541
2fe46966c4eb6efcd04153288b097e207951022d	pads: a reliable pothole detection system using machine learning		In recent years, with the popularity of private cars, a increasing number of people prefer autos as their way to travel. However, poor road conditions may cause damages to vehicles and have drawn great concern of governments all over the world. The extreme weather conditions, heavy traffics and low road quality are worsen the situation, making it is a challenging task to keep roads in good conditions. Therefore, frequent repairs are required to avoid damages to vehicles. In this paper, we propose a reliable pothole detection system using machine learning (PADS) to facilitate the road pothole detection and road conditions maintenance. The proposed system provides low latency in potholes detecting, thereby shortening the time for road maintainers to identify poor conditions roads. To make our system easy to deploy, we reduce monetary cots and simplify system architecture. To improve accuracy in potholes detection, we use (K_MEANS) algorithm based on basic threshold algorithm. Our results display a plot of z-axis accelerations on one road and a pothole-marked map. At last, we show the pothole detection accuracy comparison between our algorithm and basic threshold algorithm.	machine learning	Jinting Ren;Duo Liu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52015-5_33	latency (engineering);real-time computing;systems architecture;machine learning;artificial intelligence;internet of things;computer science	ML	-20.121715687439824	-29.76041909771976	13546

These ultra-high-bandwidth data streams typically contain little useful information and most of the data can be safely discarded. Periodically, however, an event of interest is observed and a large segment of the data must be preserved, including data preceding detection of the event. Doing so requires guaranteed data capture at source rates, line speed filtering to detect events and data points of interest, and TiVo-like ability to save past data once an event has been detected. We present Valmar, a system for guaranteed capture, indexing, and storage of ultra-high-bandwidth data streams. Our results show that Valmar performs at nearly full disk bandwidth, up to several orders of magnitude faster than flat file and database systems, works well with both small and large data elements, and allows concurrent read and search access without compromising data capture guarantees.	data element;data point;distributed computing;flat file database;general-purpose markup language;interrupt;parallel random-access machine;point of interest;problem domain;prototype;quality of service;real-time clock;streaming media;tivo	David O.

These methods have several drawbacks, i.e., they use invasive external devices, thus increasing entry costs and reducing user acceptance, or they use some of privacy-related information. This paper presents an approach for stress assessment that leverages data extracted from smartphone sensors, and that is not invasive concerning privacy. Two different approaches are presented. One, based on smartphone gestures analysis, e.g., ‘tap’, ‘scroll’, ‘swipe’ and ‘text writing’, and evaluated in laboratory settings with 13 participants (F-measure 79-85 percent within-subject model, 70-80 percent global model); the second one based on smartphone usage analysis and tested in-the-wild with 25 participants (F-measure 77-88 percent within-subject model, 63-83 percent global model). Results show how these two methods enable an accurate stress assessment without being too intrusive, thus increasing ecological validity of the data and user acceptance.	privacy;sensor;smartphone;usage analysis;wearable technology	Matteo Ciman;Katarzyna Wac	2018	IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing	10.1109/TAFFC.2016.2592504	embedded system;simulation;computer science;computer security	HCI	-59.960763189085256	-51.037633566868585	13558

Beyond the available advanced driving assistance functions, we expect that highly automated driving will soon be available in production vehicles. While many technological aspects have been investigated, it is not yet clear (a) which activities the drivers want to perform once they do not have to steer or monitor their car any more and (b) which of those will be feasible. In contrast to prior (survey-based) research, we investigate the driver's needs for such activities by employing a combination of a web survey, in-situ observations, and an in-situ survey. Also, we have a look at the specific requirements of the European / German market in contrast to prior research conducted mostly for English-speaking countries.  The findings indicate that besides traditional activities (talking to passengers, listening to music), daydreaming, writing text messages, eating and drinking, browsing the Internet, and calling are most wanted for highly automated driving. This shows the potential for mobile and ubiquitous multimedia applications in the car.	autonomous car;emoticon;internet;requirement	Bastian Pfleging;Maurice Rang;Nora Broy	2016		10.1145/3012709.3012735	embedded system;simulation;multimedia	HCI	-53.03659113531386	-40.4490094985203	13568

We are developing a prototype mobile valet application that presents location-specific services organised around the tasks associated with a location.

One is tempted to go on at length with reflections prompted by Hald’s excellent work. It should have a very wide sale, since in addition to the appeal to anyone seriously concerned to learn about the early history of a most important concept, it could serve extremely well as a textbook for quite elementary classes in probability theory, giving as it does details ofthe essentially elementary arguments used by these 18th century mathematicians, and providing problems to serve as textbook exercises. One annoying defect is the absence of an index of notations. For example, the reader of his chapter on the Insurance Mathematics ofde Moivre and Simpson could easily fail to follow up Hald’s """"see 9.3,"""" and he would then wonder where he might find out what lx, Lx and so on stand for.

In conventional remote control robots, the operator controls the system while receiving feedback from cameras mounted on the robot [Gundersen et al. 1996]. However, this operating method cannot capture the full environment around the system, even if we use wide FOV cameras, such as omnidirectional cameras. This leaves the operator with incomplete feedback. In order to utilize the telepresence system safely, it is necessary to solve the problem of the blind spot of the user. Further, human operators are limited by their attention span. The reaction time of the computer is greater than that of humans.	omnidirectional camera;outline of object recognition;remote control;robot	Ippei Suzuki;Satoshi Hashizume;Kazuki Takazawa;Ryuichiro Sasaki;Yoshikuni Hashimoto;Yoichi Ochiai	2017		10.1145/3102163.3102238	blind spot;computer graphics (images);robot;computer vision;operator (computer programming);computer science;artificial intelligence;human–machine system;omnidirectional antenna;wheelchair;remote control;virtual reality	AI	-42.27302147037235	-44.54987777441392	13581
af6ec711b53936ed7af66c7a2d906b72960e4b8e	identifier usage and maintenance in the unt libraries' digital collections		At the University of North Texas (UNT) Libraries we work with a large number of identifiers in relation to our Digital Collections (The Portal to Texas History, the UNT Digital Library, and the Gateway to Oklahoma History). Since our Digital Collections comprise items from other library and campus departments, as well as a large number of cultural heritage institutions across Texas and Oklahoma, many of the materials have assigned identifiers that are important to the group that owns the physical materials. We document any relevant identifiers in each item’s metadata record, whether they belong to an international or established standard (e.g., ISSNs or call numbers) or have a specific context (e.g., agency-assigned report numbers). Most discrete collections have partner-assigned identifiers that range from established accession numbers to sequentially-assigned numbers; these identifiers allow for a connection between a digital item in the public interface, copies of the associated digital files, and the physical object. To ensure that identifiers are unique within the Digital Collections, we routinely add codes that identify the partner institution at the front of each identifier, separated with an underscore (e.g., GEPFP_62-1). This makes it relatively easy to distinguish the original identifier from the code that we have added, but also prevents the inclusion of several hundred items identified as “0005” if a user wants to use an identifier to search for a particular object. Internally, our digital infrastructure uses ARK (Archival Resource Key) identifiers to track and connect archival copies of files stored in our Coda repository with web-derivative copies in our Aubrey access system. We also currently use PURLs (Permanent Uniform Resource Locators) to identify and manage controlled vocabulary terms. For name authority, we create local authority records that act similarly to item records in terms of identifiers: each record has a system-unique identifier that generates a stable URL, but contains a field to include alternate established identifiers (e.g., ISNIs, VIAF record numbers, ORCIDs, etc.) that also refer to the entity, when applicable. This presentation will discuss some of the complexities inherent in managing both locallycreated and externally-assigned identifiers, why we use different types of identifiers throughout our infrastructure, and the implementation of various identifiers in our Digital Collections.

In the first stage, the robot is initialized with a basic reach-and- enclose-on-contact movement capability, and discovers a set of behavior primitives by exploring its movement parameter space. In the next stage, the robot exercises the discovered behaviors on different objects, and learns the caused effects; effectively building a library of affordances and associated predictors. Finally, in the third stage, the learned structures and predictors are used to bootstrap complex imitation and action learning with the help of a cooperative tutor. The main contribution of this paper is the realization of an integrated developmental system where the structures emerging from the sensorimotor experience of an interacting real robot are used as the sole building blocks of the subsequent stages that generate increasingly more complex cognitive capabilities. The proposed framework includes a number of common features with infant sensorimotor development. Furthermore, the findings obtained from the self-exploration and motionese guided human-robot interaction experiments allow us to reason about the underlying mechanisms of simple-to-complex sensorimotor skill progression in human infants.	automated planning and scheduling;cognition;color gradient;converge;developmental robotics;encode;embodied agent;emulator;experiment;high- and low-level;human–robot interaction;language primitive;organizing (structure);piaget's theory of cognitive development;robot;self-organization;timeline	Emre Ugur;Yukie Nagai;Erol Sahin;Erhan Öztop	2015	IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development	10.1109/TAMD.2015.2426192	psychology;mobile robot;robot learning;computer vision;simulation;social robot;robot control;communication	Robotics	-32.37101997999084	-39.835425221345915	13594

Each person affects everybody else. You cannot decide what to do without some knowledge or belief about what others will do; and this must be based on an estimate of their knowledge and beliefs, about substantive matters as well as about what they think about each others' beliefs and about your beliefs. A coherent framework for analyzing these interactions is thus of the essence for these disciplines.	coherence (physics);game theory;interaction	Robert J.

Recently implicit models combined with constructive solid geometry (CSG) have been used to build engineering models with automatic blending. This work is built on a structured implicit modeling system which includes CSG, warping, 2D texture mapping and operations based on the BlobTree, and its application to the generation of a complex and visually accurate biological model of the sea shell Murex cabritii. Since the model is purely procedurally defined and does not rely on polygon mesh operations, it is resolution independent and can be rendered directly using ray tracing. An interface has been built to the BlobTree using an interpreted programming language (Python). The language interface readily allows a user to procedurally describe the shell based on numeric data taken from the actual object.	implicit surface	Callum Galbraith;Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz;Brian Wyvill	2000		10.1109/CGI.2000.852320	image warping;image texture;layout;texture mapping;ray tracing;computer vision;bin packing problem;image resolution;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;solid modeling;programming language;user interface;constructive solid geometry;interpreted language;computer graphics (images)	NLP	-40.42116406711398	-34.20986149446514	13654

The challenge is to integrate the granularities into a detailed compound view on the data, like the compound eye of insects integrates many images into one view.

In the case of at least three players the ratio between the solution payoffs of any two players is a power of the ratio between their ideal payoffs. As special cases this class contains the Egalitarian and the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solutions. For 2-player problems we characterize a larger class of solutions. None of these results assumes a Pareto axiom. In the 2-player case, adding strong Pareto efficiency to a subset of our axioms pins down the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution.	dominating set;elasticity (data store);generalization (psychology);large;nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;population parameter;realms of the haunting;solutions;subgroup;utility	Dominik Karos;Shiran Rachmilevitch	2018	Int.

To develop intelligent decision support systems. We require the deep reasoning involved in qualitative data modelling. Unfortunately, most work in the area of qualitative data modelling has concerned itself with physical phenomenn or objects. Non-physical systems are difficult to handle because the parameters are non-deterministic and the results are unpredictable. To do this, we need to consider two important tasks - to establishing an expert domain based on a comprehensive organizational theory; and developing qualitative reasoning to interface with the database.	decision support system	H.

Our system frees users to create 2D sketches from arbitrary angles using their preferred tool, which may include pencil and paper. A 3D model is created by placing primitives and annotations on the 2D image. Our primitives are based on commonly used sketching conventions and allow users to maintain a single view of the model. This eliminates the frequent view changes inherent to existing 3D modeling tools, both traditional and sketch-based, and enables users to match input to the 2D guide image. Our annotations---same-lengths and angles, alignment, mirror symmetry, and connection curves---allow the user to communicate higher-level semantic information; through them our system builds a consistent model even in cases where the original image is inconsistent.

However, little work has investigated what exactly those feedback mechanisms should be. Most past work is based on an in-home display unit, possibly complemented by lower tariffs and delayed use of non-essential home appliances such as washing machines. In this paper we focus on four methods for real time feedback on domestic energy use, developed to gauge the impact on energy consumption in homes. Their feasibility had been tested using an experimental setup of 24 households collecting minute-by-minute electricity consumption data readings over a period of 18 months. Initial results are mixed, and point to the difficulties of sustaining a reduction in energy consumption, i.e. persuading consumers to change their behaviour. Some of the methods we used exploit small group social dynamics whereby people want to conform to social norms within groups they identify with. It may be that a variety of feedback mechanisms and interventions are needed in order to sustain user interest.	feedback;norm (social);real-time computing;social dynamics;washing machine	Alan F.

Guests select morsels in turn until all are consumed. Each guest has a ranking of the morsels according to how much he would enjoy eating them; these rankings are commonly known. A gallant knight always prefers one food division over another if it provides strictly more enjoyable collections of food to one or more other players (without giving a less enjoyable collection to any other player) even if it makes his own collection less enjoyable. A boorish lout always selects the morsel that gives him the most enjoyment on the current turn, regardless of future consumption by himself and others. We show the way the food is divided when all guests are gallant knights is the same as when all guests are boorish louts but turn order is reversed. This implies and generalizes a classical result of Kohler and Chandrasekaran (1971) about two players strategically maximizing their own enjoyments. We also treat the case that the table contains a mixture of boorish louts and gallant knights. Our main result can also be formulated in terms of games in which selections are made by groups. In this formulation, the surprising fact is that a group can always find a selection that is simultaneously optimal for each member of the group. Suppose that k guests are seated at a table containing n discrete morsels of food (sushi rolls, say). Each player i has a strict ranking <i of the n morsels according to how enjoyable they are to eat. Players take turns selecting and consuming a morsel from the table, according to a fixed turn order P1, P2, . . . , Pm, where m ≤ n, and Pt ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} is the player who selects a morsel on the t th turn. Our dinner guests do not simply play to maximize their own enjoyment. Instead, each guest conforms to one of two stereotypes: he is either a gallant knight or a boorish lout, as explained below. A plate is a subset of the morsels. Each player’s ranking of the morsels determines a corresponding partial ordering on plates of a fixed size according to pairwise comparison: Given two plates A and A′ of the same size, write A ≤i A′ if there is a bijection f : A→ A′ such that a ≤i f(a) for all a ∈ A. Given a sequence a = (a1, . . . , am) of morsel selections representing the play of a game, let Ai(a) = {at | Pt = i} be the plate eaten by player i.

We constructed a prototype for proof-of-concept using a digital SLR (single lens reflex camera). In this prototype, we utilize open-source OCR engine “tesseract” trained by handwritten character images and adding a preprocessing of projective transforms in order to cope with free angle capture by the camera.

Up until the twentieth century, the Chinese used a lunisolar calendar with the title of an Emperor and a reign period to express temporal information. When describing a historical event in Chinese history, it is inadequate to use existing time ontologies as presented in the traditional Chinese way of thinking to capture and encode time. To date, no attention in the field has been given to modelling ancient Chinese time. In this paper, we identify the problems encountered when modelling Chinese time resulting from the distinctive nature of a non-western time scale. We design a new model of temporal information with combined approaches, which are more appropriate for Chinese dynasties, emperors, and reign periods, and apply the OWL-Time ontology onto the ancient Chinese lunisolar calendar. This approach can also be applied to other ancient time-keeping methods in non-western time scales.		Qing Zou;Eun G. Park	2011	J.

Scientific challenges in the field of Industry 4.0 and intra-logistics are identified due to the new form of interaction between humans and machines. This kind of collaboration provides new possibilities of materials handling that can be developed with the support of real-time motion data tracking and virtual reality systems. These services will be provided by a new research centre for flexible human-machine cooperation networks in Dortmund. By the use of various reference and experiment systems various real-time scenarios can be emulated including digital twin simulation concepts. Big data emerges as an important paradigm in this research project where all systems are made flexible in terms of networking for all the systems to consume the data produced and also to combine all the data to arrive at new insights using concepts from machine learning and deep learning networks. This leads to the challenge of finding a common syntax for inter-operating systems. This paper describes the design and deployment strategies of research centre with the possibilities and the design insights for a futuristic Industry 4.0 material handling facility.	big data;deep learning;emulator;industry 4.0;logistics;machine learning;material handling;operating system;programming paradigm;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;simulation;software deployment;synergy;virtual reality	Aswin Karthik Ramachandran Venkatapathy;Haci Bayhan;Felix Zeidler;Michael ten Hompel	2017	2017 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)	10.15439/2017F253	data mining;systems engineering;computer science;deep learning;simulation;software deployment;big data;software;tracking system;human–machine system;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-33.969885404597285	-38.40355192574448	13739
8710736f2524e04d2af1eeeb26c5683d0bb107dc	warehousing complex archaeological objects		Data organization is a difficult and essential component in cultural heritage applications. Over the years, a great amount of archaeological ceramic data have been created and processed by various methods and devices. Such ceramic data are stored in databases that concur to increase the amount of available information rapidly. However, such databases typically focus on one type of ceramic descriptors, e.g., qualitative textual descriptions, petrographic or chemical analysis results, and do not interoperate. Thus, research involving archaeological ceramics cannot easily take advantage of combining all these types of information. In this application paper, we introduce an evolution of the Ceramom database that includes text descriptors of archaeological features, chemical analysis results, and various images, including petrographic and fabric images. To illustrate what new analyses are permitted by such a database, we source it to a data warehouse and present a sample online analysis processing (OLAP) scenario to gain deep understanding of ceramic context.	database;interoperability;online analytical processing	Aybüke Öztürk;Louis Eyango;Sylvie Yona Waksman;Stéphane Lallich;Jérôme Darmont	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25591-0_17	data science;data mining;world wide web	DB	-43.69405198211394	0.3248030456997442	13757

We present a data-driven algorithm to model and predict the socio-emotional impact of groups on observers. Psychological research finds that highly entitative i.e. cohesive and uniform groups induce threat and unease in observers. Our algorithm models realistic trajectory-level behaviors to classify and map the motion-based entitativity of crowds. This mapping is based on a statistical scheme that dynamically learns pedestrian behavior and computes the resultant entitativity induced emotion through group motion characteristics. We also present a novel interactive multi-agent simulation algorithm to model entitative groups and conduct a VR user study to validate the socio-emotional predictive power of our algorithm. We further show that model-generated high-entitativity groups do induce more negative emotions than low-entitative groups.

All existing techniques, however, assume a static environment, limiting their utility in emerging applications (e.g., Location-based Services) where objects move. In this paper, for the first time, we propose two exact methods that can continuously answer skNN queries in a highly dynamic environment which allows for arbitrary movements of data objects. The first method, inspired by the existing techniques in monitoring kNN in road networks [7] maintains an analogous counterpart of the Dijkstra Expansion Tree on land surface, called Surface Expansion Tree (SE-Tree). However, we show the concept of expansion tree for land surface does not work as SEtree suffers from intrinsic defects: it is fat and short, and hence does not improve the query efficiency. Therefore, we propose a superior approach that partitions SE-Tree into hierarchical chunks of pre-computed surface distances, called Angular Surface Index Tree (ASI-Tree). Unlike SE-tree, ASI-Tree is a well balanced thin and tall tree. With ASI-Tree, we can continuously monitor skNN queries efficiently with low CPU and I/O overheads by both speeding up the surface shortest path computations and localizing the searches. We experimentally verify the applicability and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods with both real world and synthetic data sets. ASI-Tree consistently and significantly outperforms SE-Tree in all cases.	abstract syntax tree;central processing unit;computation;dijkstra's algorithm;experiment;geographic information system;global illumination;input/output;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;location-based service;precomputation;shortest path problem;synthetic data	Songhua Xing;Cyrus Shahabi;Bei Pan	2009	PVLDB	10.14778/1687627.1687753	r-tree;ball tree;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;mathematics;geographic information system;k-nearest neighbors algorithm	DB	-13.262480294180564	-37.439917893439215	13808
17fd0f0f43d83510f75766701440d4e8bf63f875	fuzzy linguistic summarization with genetic algorithm: an application with operational and financial healthcare data		It is now well recognized that knowledge extracted from rich healthcare data play a vital role for delivery, management and planning of healthcare services. So far, however, there is not much study done on the domain of operational and financial healthcare data since, up to now, a great deal of works are dedicated to clinical/medical healthcare data for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In this paper, an attempt is made, by applying fuzzy linguistic summarization, for the first time to discover knowledge from operational and financial healthcare data. Fuzzy linguistic summarization, in its simplest term, provides natural language based summaries from a dataset in a human consistent way along with a degree of truth attached to each summary. While basically valuable, its benefit can be increased by only generating summaries with a degree of truth above than an indicated threshold value. A genetic algorithm is developed within this context in order to eliminate less promising and useless linguistic summaries. We assess the proposed approach experimentally on a real data and evaluate the generated summaries to gain actionable insights from them.	automatic summarization;degree of truth;enterprise resource planning;experiment;genetic algorithm;natural language	Tunahan Altintop;Ronald R.

In addition to creating interactions between multiple operators and multiple robots, researchers have also proposed that the autonomy of robotic entities be increased, such that the unmanned systems can be considered as true teammates. Given the inherent challenges that are associated with this task, the following paper provides a review of research in the domain. This is intended to: (a) provide a list of lessons learned from prior research and (b) provide a set of design guidelines. This is not only intended to support design, but it is also intended to support managing personnel that would be directing the use of these systems.	robot	Florian Jentsch;Thomas Fincannon	2012		10.2514/6.2012-2459	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management	Robotics	-25.146930665022797	-23.262615714830243	13823

Our goal is to look for innovative patterns using techniques derivedfrom Artificial Life. We will play 2 variations, based on imitation, on asociety of anonymous and homogeneous artificial micro-painters (the Colombines).In the Colombines model the virtual canvas, besides being a computationalspace for depositing paint, is also a pheromone medium, mirroring thepainting patterns and influencing the painters' behaviour. More, the micropaintersdo not exchange information directly with each other, they are simplyattracted towards non-painting areas of the canvas--the non-painted """"tableaux""""patches diffuse an """"environmental produced"""" chemical and the painters preferto follow the chemical gradient. Thus, this form of stigmergic communicationsimply influences the artistic agents movements. We will expand the Colombinesbasic model adding direct communication between the micro-artists: theywill imitate the colour of others.

It allows architects to revise office room shapes, materials, lighting sources, thermal control devices, window locations and sizes. Building engineers can select the same specifically for a given design, in view of thermal comfort requirements (daily temperature variation ranges), energy consumption requirements, and building regulations (see also [1] [2]). Needless to say, the above involves extensive knowledge acquisition by tapping off architects for architectural selection rules, and engineers for compliance constraints, both represented as attributed conceptual graphs. The approach below was found extremely useful by allowing for elicitation from examples (cases of special office designs) but also from design principles.	computer-aided design;conceptual graph;database;expert system;inference engine;knowledge acquisition;prolog;requirement;requirements elicitation;selection rule;visual language	L.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based user interface called Flow Web to enable more systematic explorations of 3D flow data. The Flow Web is a node-link graph that is constructed to highlight the essential flow structures where a node represents a region in the field and a link connects two nodes if there exist particles traveling between the regions. The direction of an edge implies the flow path, and the weight of an edge indicates the number of particles traveling through the connected nodes. Hierarchical flow webs are created by splitting or merging nodes and edges to allow for easy understanding of the underlying flow structures. To draw the Flow Web, we adopt force based graph drawing algorithms to minimize edge crossings, and use a hierarchical layout to facilitate the study of flow patterns step by step. The Flow Web also supports user queries to the properties of nodes and links. Examples of the queries for node properties include the degrees, complexity, and some associated physical attributes such as velocity magnitude. Queries for edges include weights, flow path lengths, existence of circles and so on. It is also possible to combine multiple queries using operators such as and , or, not. The Flow Web supports several types of user interactions. For instance, the user can select nodes from the subgraph returned by a query and inspect the nodes with more details at different levels of detail. There are multiple advantages of using the graph-based user interface. One is that the user can identify regions of interest much more easily since, unlike inspecting 3D regions, there is very little occlusion. It is also much more convenient for the user to query statistical information about the nodes and links at different levels of detail. With the Flow Web, it becomes easier for the user to log and track the progress of data exploration which is crucial for exploring large data sets. We demonstrate how to construct and draw the Flow Web effectively, and how to query the Flow Web to retrieve useful information from the data. Case studies are provided to demonstrate the exploration process.	algorithm;bigraph;complexity;degree (graph theory);existential quantification;graph drawing;graph theory;hidden surface determination;interaction;interactivity;level of detail;minimum cut;region of interest;user interface;velocity (software development)	Lijie Xu;Han-Wei Shen	2010		10.1117/12.838659	particle;visualization;flow visualization;computer science;theoretical computer science;level of detail;interface;data mining;graph drawing;data analysis;user interface;world wide web;region of interest	Graphics	-29.006241041304452	-34.89900113517157	13847
28345e9c99e97bfe4570123fe6be5ac88a5e5725	the rvi interactive video experience	interactive video	The newly developed Rutt Video Interactive Retail Presentation Technology designed by RVI/Rutt Video Interactive, New York, incorporates the latest advances in digital imaging with a unique capability to display full motion, full frame, better than broadcast quality video. This interactive video system was launched last August at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in Olathe, Kansas. The twentyeight lively and e y e c a t c h i n g interactive video installations in the more than one million square foot mall assist shoppers in finding store locations as well as exploring shopping options and facility amenities. After making their choices on a touch screen menu on a kiosk, shoppers’ selections are displayed on a large screen nearby. The main product categories from which choices can be made on the opening touch screen include: Fashion, Sports and Adventure, Te c h t a i n m e n t , Home and Hobby, Food, Guest Services and Services. The kiosks also offer the approximately 150 tenants of the megamall a highly visible site for promotional opportunities as well as a location for the display of their web sites which shoppers are able to call up and explore. Rutt’s interactive system is also capable of dispensing promotional coupons for store merchandise as well as other merchandising tie-ins with the stores. Brightly colored, imaginatively designed kaleidoscopic images attract shoppers to the kiosks. The astute observer will be able to identify representative items in the fast-paced attract loop for each category: for example, tennis balls in Sports and A d v e n t u r e ; brightly colored cosmetic pencils in Fashion and a cascade of clock faces in Home and Hobby. The s o m e w h a t e n i g m a t i c imagery is memorable and mesmerizing. The RVI System is extremely versatile and can be installed as a single kiosk, a network throughout a large store or mall or interfaced to an entertaining video wall. The film quality video on the RVI Kiosk is ideal for the display of runway shows, selections from a seasonal store catalogue, a look into next season’s line, a link to special promotions, and other features. Updating is simple and inexpensive, so that sales information and offerings can be updated as often as needed. In addition to its retail possibilities, the RVI System has numerous applications for theme parks, museums and other amusement destinations. An entertainment attraction on its own, RVI’s technology generates enthusiasm and interest in upcoming events which can easily be changed as often as required to keep data current. With multiple display format options ranging from a single screen to a large video wall, the system can function like a preshow for featured entertainment events as well as preview movie trailers.

The fundamental insight was that humans are very good at recognizing patterns, and this can help us make sense out of complex information. Much of the research in information visualization during the last ten years has leveraged human visual perception. But if we take a broader look at natural human capabilities, there are other cognitive and perceptual capabilities that we are not leveraging as well. For example, when we perceive patterns in the real world, we use our other senses, particularly hearing and haptics, in addition to vision. Perhaps we should rename this field “information perceptualization,” and focus on using multiple channels of human information processing to facilitate pattern recognition.		George G.

The current strategies used to distribute problems among participants are currently limited to (i) delivering the full problem to every single user and ask them to explore the complete search space (e.g. Foldit), or (ii) decomposing the initial problem into smaller sub-problems and aggregate the solutions returned by gamers (e.g. Phylo). The second approach could be used to explore larger search spaces while harnessing collective intelligence, but popular crowdsourcing systems making use of the Amazon Mechanical Turk deliberately forbid communication between participants to avoid group-think phenomena. In this paper, we design a novel multi-player game-with-a-purpose, and analyze the impact of multiple game mechanisms on the performance of the system. We present a highly collaborative human-computing game that uses a market, skills and a challenge system to help the players collectively solve a graph problem. The results obtained during 12 game sessions of 10 players show that the market helps players to build larger solutions. We also show that a skill system and, to a lesser extent, a challenge system can be used to influence and guide the players towards producing better solutions. Our collaborative game-with-a-purpose is open-source, and aims to serve as a universal platform for further independent studies.	aggregate data;amazon mechanical turk;collective intelligence;computational problem;crowdsourcing;foldit;graph theory;groupthink;human-based computation game;mike lesser;open-source software;phylo;the turk	Olivier Tremblay Savard;Alexander Butyaev;Jérôme Waldispühl	2016		10.1145/2967934.2968104	non-cooperative game;game design;simulation;computer science;game developer;management science;multimedia;screening game;game design document;sequential game;complete information	HCI	-14.671935598748474	-10.414282791922425	13890

The results question common intuitions about the capabilities of reactive controllers and highlight the significance of the agent’s recent history of interactions with its environment in generating behaviour. This work reinforces the idea that embodied behaviour exhibits properties that cannot be deduced directly from those of the controller by itself.	game controller;interaction	Eduardo Izquierdo-Torres;Ezequiel A.

Special attention is paid to concept formulation and image substantiation in the early design stage. A data management strategy and its implementation method are shown to effectively share and visualize a series of shape-forming and modeling operations performed by experts on a network. A 3D object representation technique is devised to manage frequently updated geometrical information by exchanging only a small amount of data among participating systems. Additionally, we contrive a method for offloading some expensive functions usually performed on a server such as multi-resolution data management and adaptive data transmission control. Client systems are delegated to execute these functions and achieve “interactivity vs. image quality” tradeoffs based on available resources and operations in a flexible and parallel fashion.	3d modeling;image quality;interactivity;server (computing);virtual reality	Hiroaki Nishino;Kouichi Utsumiya;Kazuyoshi Korida;Atsunori Sakamoto;Kazuyuki Yoshida	1999		10.1145/323663.323682	image quality;computer vision;real-time computing;simulation;object model;data management;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;data mining;database;computer graphics;data transmission	Visualization	-35.35592218920346	-33.479969463938446	13899
2a1c06ea40469064f2419df481a6e6aab7b09cdf	driving hotzenplotz: a hybrid interface for vehicle control aiming to maximize pleasure in highway driving		A prerequisite to foster proliferation of automated driving is common system acceptance. However, different users groups (novice, enthusiasts) decline automation, which could be, in turn, problematic for a successful market launch. We see a feasible solution in the combination of the advantages of manual (autonomy) and automated (increased safety) driving. Hence, we've developed the Hotzenplotz interface, combining possibility-driven design with psychological user needs. A simulator study (N=30) was carried-out to assess user experience with subjective criteria (Need Scale, PANAS/-X, HEMA, AttrakDiff) and quantitative measures (driving behavior, HR/HRV) in different conditions. Our results confirm that pure AD is significantly less able to satisfy user needs compared to manual driving and make people feeling bored/out of control. In contrast, the Hotzenplotz interface has proven to reduce the negative effects of AD. Our implication is that drivers should be provided with different control options to secure acceptance and avoid deskilling.	autonomous car;autonomy;heart rate variability;home automation;integrated development environment;user experience	Anna-Katharina Frison;Philipp Wintersberger;Andreas Riener;Clemens Schartmüller	2017		10.1145/3122986.3123016	simulation;engineering;pleasure;automation;human–computer interaction;user experience design;feeling;deskilling	HCI	-47.062500442841085	-52.021830246209255	13903

The study shows that Bus may serve as preliminary selection mechanism in content analysis. The goal of such mechanism is to quickly pre-select documents that may be similar to the one being checked. This selection should be accompanied by more detailed comparison to cope with false positive results produced by BFs. Specialized form of the filter called Matrix BF has been found particularly helpful for the content analysis task as it provides search localization and allows the filter to grow along with the document database and maintain liner search time. The paper outlined theoretical threshold for false positives for comparison of two rows in the Matrix BF. The threshold was confirmed by experiments. The experiments also indicated acceptable performance in terms of computational performance and level of false positives.

b737e95b60e065c8abbea9a50f2d73e3af5e01dd	personalized resource recommendation based on regular tag and user operation		In conventional tag-based recommendation system, the sparsity and impurity of social tag data significantly increase the complexity of data processing and affect the accuracy of recommendation. To address these problems, we consider from the perspective of resource provider and propose a resource recommendation framework based on regular tags and user operation feedbacks. Based on these concepts, we design the user feature representation integrating the information of regular tags, user operations and time factor, so as to precisely discover the user preference on different tags. The personalized recommendation algorithm is designed based on collaborative filtering mechanism by analyzing the general preference modeling of different users. We conduct the experimental evaluation on a real recommendation system with extensive user and tag data. Compared with traditional user-based collaborative filtering and the social-tag-based collaborative filtering, our approach can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem of tag data and user rating data, and our proposed user feature is more accurate to improve the performance of the recommendation system.

We ask whether the impulse to punish is unresponsive to the cost to the punisher, or whether, like other preferences, it interacts with prices to generate a conventional demand curve. We test the price responsiveness of the demand for punishment by randomly varying the cost of reducing the earnings of other group members following laboratory voluntary contribution decisions. In our design, new groups are formed after each interaction and no subject faces any other more than once, so there is no strategic reason to punish. We nonetheless find significant levels of punishment, and we learn that both price and the extent to which the recipient's contribution is below the group mean are significant determinants of the quantity of punishment demanded. Moreover, punishment is mainly directed at free riders even when it costs nothing to the punisher. However, the propensity to punish egregious freeriding varies considerably within our subject pool, from non-punishers to aggressive punishers.

e96fdea59ffcdacbccec070ab618b9fd415b6ce0	a watershed delineation algorithm for 2d flow direction grids		In this paper we propose an algorithm and associated data model for creating a watershed boundary using a 2D Flow Direction Grid. Flow Direction Grids (FDGs) are common abstractions for hydrodynamic models and are utilized for delineating physical systems (e.g. watersheds, fluvial, and non-fluvial flow paths). The proposed algorithm and associated data model provides geometric speed increases in watershed boundary retrieval while keeping storage constraints linear in comparison to existing techniques. The algorithm called Haag Shokoufandehs’ March (HSM) relies on an existing data structure, the modified nested set model, originally described by Celko and applied to hydrodynamic models by Haag and Shokoufandeh in 2017. The proposed algorithm creates watershed boundaries by marching around the edges of its’ corresponding region, never entering the internal area. In contrast to existing algorithms that scales in proportional to the area of the underlying region, the complexity of the HSM algorithm is proportional to the boundary length. Results for a group of tested watersheds (n = 14,718) in the ≈ 36,000 km Delaware River Watershed show a reduction of between 0 and 99% in computational complexity using a 30 m DEM vs. existing techniques. Larger watersheds have a consistent reduction in the number of (read) operation complexity, with the largest watershed resulting in ≈ 35 million reads using traditional techniques compared to ≈ 45 thousand using the HSM algorithm, respectively. Modelled estimates of the complexity for the ≈ 6.1 million km Amazon River basin show a reduction from 6.7 billion to 1.4 million reads.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;data model;data structure;surround sound;watershed (image processing)	Scott Haag;Ali Shokoufandeh	2017	CoRR		nested set model;grid;mathematics;computational complexity theory;data model;watershed;algorithm;mathematical optimization;data structure;drainage basin	HPC	-10.434935312823907	-35.995082230291175	13967

According to Metcalfe’s law, the value of a network is proportional to n where n is number of users of the network, whereas Odlyzko et al propose on heuristic grounds that the value is proportional to n log n, which is the Zipf’s law. In this paper we have examined scale free, small world and random social networks to determine their value. We have found that the Zipf’s law describes the value for scale free and small world networks although for small world networks the proportionality constant is a function of the probability of rewiring. We have estimated the function associated with different values of rewiring to be described well by a quadratic equation. We have also shown experimentally that the value of random networks lies between Zipf’s law and Metcalfe’s law.	experiment;flow network;heuristic;metcalfe's law;quadratic equation;quadratic function;simulation;social network;time complexity;watts humphrey;zipf's law	Sandeep Chalasani	2008	CoRR		simulation;evolving networks;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;scale-free network;small-world network;social network	ECom	-16.309629675668084	-39.6880092250236	13990
d01ae82398bb187f354536523312040893c852c8	cooperative learning of bdi elevator agents	cooperative learning	We propose a framework of cooperative learning of BDI agents. Our framework uses some kinds of agents, including a task management agent (TMA) and rational agents. TMA is designed as a learning agent. It manages assignment of tasks to rational agents. When a task is created, TMA evaluates the most useful strategy on the basis of reinforcement learning. Rational agents also evaluate the value that the task is assigned to them according to the strategy, and they give the value as their intention to TMA. Then, TMA optimally assigns the task to a rational agent by using both the value and the rough strategies, and the rational agent processes the task. In this article, we apply the proposed method to an elevator group control problem. Experiment results show that the proposed method finds better task assignment than the methods without cooperative learning.	discretization;management agent;rational agent;reinforcement learning;rough set;tower mounted amplifier	Yuya Takata;Yuki Mikura;Hiroaki Ueda;Kenichi Takahashi	2010			computer science	AI	-18.39509973120224	-10.942345672063073	13997

In the underlying thought experiment each player faces the possibility that, after all players decided on their action, his chosen action turns out to be blocked. Therefore, each player has to decide beforehand on a back-up action, which he plays in case he is unable to play his primary action. In this paper we introduce the concept of fall back equilibrium and show that the set of fall back equilibria is a non-empty and closed subset of the set of Nash equilibria. We discuss the relations with other equilibrium concepts, and among other results it is shown that each robust equilibrium is fall back and for bimatrix games also each proper equilibrium is a fall back equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that for bimatrix games the set of fall back equilibria is the union of finitely many polytopes, and that the notions of fall back equilibrium and strictly fall back equilibrium coincide. Finally, we allow multiple actions to be blocked, resulting in the notion of complete fall back equilibrium. We show that the set of complete fall back equilibria is a non-empty and closed subset of the set of proper equilibria.	backup;nash equilibrium;refinement (computing)	John Kleppe;Peter Borm;Ruud Hendrickx	2012	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2012.04.014	epsilon-equilibrium;simulation;artificial intelligence;repeated game;strategy;correlated equilibrium;mathematical economics;nash equilibrium;symmetric equilibrium	ECom	-6.1561779372573495	-2.0960498503680767	14002

The initial design and research is aimed at producing a system with two cameras and two microphones on a system capable of operating with the same degrees of freedom and reflex times as its biological counterpart. Whilst the primary goal of the project is develop an anthropomorphic system with the sensory reflex capabilities of a human head, the system will also contain some non-anthropomorphic components. The most obvious of the non-anthropomorphic components is a spatially and temporally programmable light source. Some preliminary results are presented. use this information to direct autonomous behaviour (Brooks, 1989) but these reflexes have not been coupled with vision systems for integrated tracking or gaze control.	autonomy;digital single-lens reflex camera;experiment;microphone;temporal logic;while	Peter Mowforth;J.

The problem is particularly pertinent since the transport, storage and production of this type of product often occur close to inhabited areas and, in case of accidents, it is important to correctly estimate the lines of action and risk areas. This model can also be used to evaluate the environmental risk related to specific hazardous installations and therefore can be used to improve industrial planning.	fallout;relevance;simulation	Agostino G.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid system that combines a stereoscopic optical see-through head-mounted display (HMD) and a large projection display for an application in a multi-user ship painting training scenario. The proposed hybrid system's projection display provides a large FOV and a physical metaphor to the ship surface with natural depth perception, while the HMD provides personal and unoccluded display of the motion training guides. To quantify its effectiveness, we conducted a human subject experiment, comparing the subject's motion following task performance among three different display systems: large projection display, head-mounted display, and hybrid. The preliminary results obtained from the experiment has shown that given the same FOV, the hybrid system performed, despite problems with registration between the real and virtual worlds, up to par with the head-mounted display, and better than the projection display. Thus, it is expected that the hybrid display will result in higher task performance with the larger FOV factor available.

cae0bbef935956ccbd0694b4db20ead80651de94	multi-criteria decision model for bot project selection	ahpbotdecision supportevaluationmulti-criteria decision makingutility	  Due to many disadvantages resulting from limited government budget and time, the increasing infrastructure projects via build-operate-transfer  (BOT) model has been a significant factor affecting the economic developments in many countries. However, as BOT projects  are usually risky businesses which induce huge capital investments, the project feasibility should be comprehensively evaluated  and an appropriate project selection model is needed to reduce the risk of project failure. By incorporating Analytical Hierarchy  Process and Utility Theory, this paper proposes a multi-criteria decision model for supporting the selection of BOT projects.  The proposed model enables decision makers to evaluate BOT projects and handle the project risk systematically. A case study  of the national sewerage system plan in Taiwan is provided to demonstrate that the implementation of the proposed model can  effectively help decision-making teams participate in economical evaluations so that the feasibility of as-planed BOT projects  can be systematically determined and project priority can be set efficiently.

973a50945df5904fe4513b88969ec8ff32f5fb47	vr music		Virtual reality headsets and sound alongside other elements enables it to achieve its ultimate goal which is to simulate useru0027s physical presence in a virtual environment. Useru0027s input to alter and interact with the virtual world is another important factor that has been the subject of extensive researches many of which in the field of art. But even useru0027s ability to look around and move toward a sound source can also be considered as useru0027s input. Therefore, useru0027s input can be regarded as one the main elements of the virtual reality. Useru0027s input is a relatively new concept in arts but it has been the basic elements of video games from the beginning and therefore there is no surprise that gaming was the starting point of the virtual reality. As virtual reality is becoming more widespread, it is expected that this technology will be adapted to other fields. But it is also realistic to think that due to useru0027s ability to make different decisions, gamifications will also be adapted alongside this technology. The focus of this project is user-centered art where useru0027s input is the fundamental element of the artwork.	covox speech thing;simulation;user-centered design;virtual reality headset;virtual world	Ali Rastegar	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	10.1109/VR.2018.8446157	headphones;surprise;multimedia;the arts;virtual reality;virtual machine;computer science	Visualization	-54.95413966120592	-36.85760335243049	14088

58ff74af61b77f272dcd62f1aee704ddbe8b469b	using semantic web technologies for data quality management		In the past decade, the World Wide Web has started to evolve from a Web that provides human-interpretable information to a Semantic Web that provides data that can also be processed by machines. With this evolution, several useful technologies for knowledge capturing, representation, and processing have been developed which can be used in large-scale environments. Semantic Web technologies may be able to shift current data quality management technology to the next level. In this chapter, we discuss how Semantic Web technologies can be employed to improve information quality. In particular, we outline their application for (1) data requirements and metadata management, (2) data quality monitoring, (3) data quality assessment, (4) validation of data entries, (5) as reference data, and (6) in the area of content integration.	data quality;semantic web	Christian Fürber;Martin Hepp	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-36257-6_7	semantic data model;semantic computing;web development;web modeling;data web;semantic grid;data management;web standards;semantic web;social semantic web;linked data;semantic web stack;database;web intelligence;semantic technology;world wide web;information retrieval;semantic analytics;data mapping	AI	-37.97988760831229	1.3144031277658557	14106

f6670d3af7d093b43ee2e1abe3cc33a663da82e0	organizational data classification based on the importance concept of complex networks		Data classification is a common task, which can be performed by both computers and human beings. However, a fundamental difference between them can be observed: computer-based classification considers only physical features (e.g., similarity, distance, or distribution) of input data; by contrast, brain-based classification takes into account not only physical features, but also the organizational structure of data. In this paper, we figure out the data organizational structure for classification using complex networks constructed from training data. Specifically, an unlabeled instance is classified by the importance concept characterized by Google’s PageRank measure of the underlying data networks. Before a test data instance is classified, a network is constructed from vector-based data set and the test instance is inserted into the network in a proper manner. To this end, we also propose a measure, called spatio-structural differential efficiency, to combine the physical and topological features of the input data. Such a method allows for the classification technique to capture a variety of data patterns using the unique importance measure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique has promising predictive performance on the detection of heart abnormalities.	anatomic node;class;classification;clinical act of insertion;complex network;computer;computer simulation;computers;congenital abnormality;congenital heart defects;experiment;exploit (computer security);pagerank;radio frequency;supervised learning;support vector machine;test data;web search engine	Murillo Guimar&#x00E3;es Carneiro;Liang Zhao	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2726082	machine learning;supervised learning;artificial intelligence;data classification;computer science;complex network;heart abnormality;pagerank;data mining;organizational structure;test data;training set	ML	-11.483032103237328	-47.15944915544177	14124

An efficient algorithm IMCFI is proposed for Incremental Mining of Closed Frequent Itemsets from a transactional data stream. The proposed algorithm IMCFI uses a data structure called INdexed Tree(INT) similar to NewCET used in NewMoment[5]. INT contains an index table ItemSet Reference List (ISRList) which contains information about the locations of closed frequent itemsets stored in the summary data structure. ISRList helps in quick searching of closed frequent itemset already generated which in turn reduces the overall time required to mine new closed frequent itemsets from a sliding window. Experiments show that IMCFI is time and space efficient when compared to NewMoment.	algorithm;association rule learning;bibliographic index;data structure;dynamic data;indexed grammar	Shankar B.

Here, we are interested in exploiting this data to learn aspects of behaviors and the road network associated with individual drivers. Our dataset is collected on a standard vehicle used to commute to work and for personal trips. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on the GPS position and orientation data is utilized to compress the large amount of position information into a small amount of road segment states. Each state has a set of observations, i.e. car signals, associated with it that are quantized and modeled as draws from a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). The inference for the topic distributions is carried out using an online variational inference algorithm. The topic distributions over joint quantized car signals characterize the driving situation in the respective road state. In a novel manner, we demonstrate how the sparsity of the personal road network of a driver in conjunction with a hierarchical topic model allows data driven predictions about destinations as well as likely road conditions.	algorithm;global positioning system;hidden markov model;markov chain;quantization (signal processing);sensor;sparse matrix;topic model;variational principle	Julian Straub;Sue Zheng;John W.

Decision makers are facing strong challenges when assessing the feasibility of the adoption of Cloud Computing for their organizations. Cloud adoption is a multi-level decision which is influenced by a number of intertwined factors and concerns thus characterizing it as a complex and difficult to model real-world problem. In this paper we propose two decision support modeling approaches based on Influence Diagrams (ID) aiming to model the answer to the question “Adopt Cloud Services or Not?” Two models are developed and tested, the first is a generic ID with nodes interacting in a probabilistic manner, while the second is a more flexible version that utilizes Fuzzy Logic. Both models combine several factors that influence the decision to be taken, which were identified through literature review and input received from field experts. The proposed approaches are validated using five experimental scenarios, two synthetic and three real-world cases, and their performance suggests that they are highly capable of supporting the right decision.	influence diagram	Andreas Christoforou;Andreas S.

a4981cf88b87f41f09c9cca24169be3bb66757e0	cpdscorer: modeling and evaluating developer programming ability across software communities		Since developer ability is recognized as a determinant of better software project performance, it is a critical step to model and evaluate the programming ability of developers. However, most existing approaches require manual assessment, like 360 degree performance evaluation. With the emergence of social networking sites such as StackOverflow and Github, a vast amount of developer information is created on a daily basis. Such personal and social context data has huge potential to support automatic and effective developer ability evaluation. In this paper, we propose CPDScorer, a novel approach to modeling and scoring the programming ability of developer through mining heterogeneous information from both Community Question Answering (CQA) sites and Open-Source Software (OSS) communities. CPDScorer analyzes the answers posted in CQA sites and evaluates the projects submitted in OSS communities to assign expertise scores to developers, considering both the quantitative and qualitative factors. When modeling the programming ability of developer, a programming ability term extraction algorithm is also designed based on set covering. We have conducted experiments on StackOverflow and Github to measure the effectiveness of CPDScorer. The results show that our approach is feasible and practical in user programming ability modeling. In particular, the precision of our approach reaches 80%.	emergence;experiment;genetic algorithm;open sound system;open-source software;performance evaluation;question answering;software project management;software quality;stack overflow;terminology extraction	Weizhi Huang;Wenkai Mo;Beijun Shen;Yu Kyung Yang;Ning Li	2016		10.18293/SEKE2016-012	computer architecture;software development;programming language;computer engineering	SE	-34.56667096353484	-18.557101794648638	14195

Three focus groups iteratively designed and evaluated tactile interaction concepts for user-generated use-case scenarios. Results showed productive design insights from the groups regarding approaches to tactile coding schemes addressing the scenario conditions, as well as method-innovations to participatory design techniques for interaction development in unfamiliar sensory modalities such as touch. The study has culminated in the development of a library of tactile icons relating to spatial concepts, which will be tested as part of future work.	focus group;user-generated content;wearable computer	Flynn Wolf;Ravi Kuber	2014		10.1145/2628363.2634230	situation awareness;computer vision;simulation	HCI	-55.13701672673872	-38.48239045736356	14207

Most existing approaches to plan recognition and other abductive tasks employ either purely logical methods that do not handle uncertainty, or purely probabilistic methods that do not handle structured representations. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an approach to abductive reasoning using a first-order probabilistic logic, specifically Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). It introduces several novel techniques for making MLNs efficient and effective for abduction. Experiments on three plan recognition datasets show the benefit of our approach over existing methods.	abductive reasoning;experiment;first-order predicate;markov chain;markov logic network	Parag Singla;Raymond J.

eaecc22f65395f374cfe9de8f415b76760de79f8	spar-ftr: an efficient algorithm for mining sequential patterns-based rules		In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for mining Sequential Patterns-based Rules, called SPaR-FTR. This algorithm introduces a new efficient strategy to generate the set of sequential rules based on the interesting rules of size three. The experimental results show that the SPaR-FTR algorithm has better performance than the main algorithms reported to discover frequent sequences, all they adapted to mine this kind of sequential rules.	algorithm	José Kadir Febrer-Hernández;Raudel Hernández-León;José Hernández Palancar;Claudia Feregrino Uribe	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25751-8_77	fsa-red algorithm	ML	-5.286727804217387	-37.49618833603778	14242

The topic of evaluating the importance of the nodes offers many different approaches. We present simple and straightforward approach for the evaluation of the nodes in undirected unweighted networks. The approach is based on x-representativeness measure which is originally intended for weighted networks. The x-representativeness takes into account the degree of the node and its nearest neighbors. Experiments with different real-world unweighted networks are presented. To apply the presented method it is necessary to transform undirected unweighted network into weighted network. Weights in our experiments are measured by dependency between adjacent nodes. The aim of these experiments is to show that the x-representativeness can be used to deterministically reduce the unweighted network to differently sized samples of representatives, while maintaining topological properties of the original network.	deterministic algorithm;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);vii;weighted network	Milos Kudelka;Sarka Zehnalova;Jan Platos	2014	2014 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCoS.2014.68	sampling;computer science;machine learning;statistics	Robotics	-14.193948171224699	-40.87027182694456	14247

We use Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning to train both agents simultaneously as they negotiate with each other in the training environment. We also model selfish and prosocial behavior to varying degrees in these agents. Empirical evidence is provided showing consistency in agent behaviors. We further train a meta agent with a mixture of behaviors by learning an ensemble of different models using reinforcement learning. Finally, to ascertain the deployability of the negotiating agents, we conducted experiments pitting the trained agents against human players. Results demonstrate that the agents are able to hold their own against human players, often emerging as winners in the negotiation. Our experiments demonstrate that the meta agent is able to reasonably emulate human behavior.	communications protocol;deep learning;experiment;reinforcement learning;smart contract	Vishal Sunder;Lovekesh Vig;Arnab Chatterjee;Gautam Shroff	2018	CoRR		machine learning;reinforcement learning;prosocial behavior;communications protocol;deep learning;negotiation;empirical evidence;mathematics;contract agreement;artificial intelligence	AI	-14.99228733475085	-11.73517420300807	14284
