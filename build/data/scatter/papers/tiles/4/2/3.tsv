Although there have been extensive studies on applying cooperative networking in multi-hop ad hoc networks, most works are limited to the basic three-node relay scheme and single-antenna systems. These two limitations are interconnected and both are due to a limited theoretical understanding of the optimal power allocation structure in MIMO cooperative networks (MIMO-CN). In this paper, we study the structural properties of the optimal power allocation in MIMO-CN with per-node power constraints. More specifically, we show that the optimal power allocations at the source and each relay follow a matching structure in MIMO-CN. This result generalizes the power allocation result under the basic three-node setting to the multi-relay setting, for which the optimal power allocation structure has been heretofore unknown. We further quantify the performance gain due to cooperative relay and establish a connection between cooperative relay and pure relay. Finally, based on these structural insights, we reduce the MIMO-CN rate maximization problem to an equivalent scalar formulation. We then propose a global optimization method to solve this simplified and equivalent problem.	algorithm;cooperative mimo;entropy maximization;global optimization;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;relay	Jia Liu;Ness B.

dce913f829fd7b50e5549a399bffe756f7fc2ef7	performance analysis and comparison of three multiple-access dcsk cooperative communication systems over multipath fading channels		Differential-chaos-shift-keying (DCSK) modulation has drawn much attention in the past two decades due to its simple realization and excellent anti-multipath ability. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on the N-user DCSK cooperative communication (CC) systems over multipath Nakagami fading channels, where three multiple-access (MA) schemes, i.e., variant-delay MA (VDMA), code-division MA (CDMA), and Walsh-coded MA (WCMA), are considered. To be specific, we firstly introduce the frameworks of the aforementioned three MA-DCSK-CC systems, then analyze and compare the error performance of these MA-DCSK-CC systems. Analytical and simulated results illustrate that the WCMA-DCSK-CC system enables more desirable error performance with respect to the VDMA and CDMA ones. Consequently, the WC-based scheme stands out as a very good candidate for the low-power and low-complexity chaos-based cooperative networks.1	cc system;cooperative multitasking;curve fitting;hadamard transform;ibm notes;key (cryptography);low-power broadcasting;modulation;multipath propagation;profiling (computer programming);write combining;writing commons	Yi Fang;Guofa Cai;Guojun Han;Lin Wang;Pingping Chen	2017	2017 17th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2017.8261161	fading;code division multiple access;communications system;multipath propagation;computer network;modulation;transceiver;computer science;nakagami distribution;communication channel	Arch	44.3726695737471	80.92339313108805	5166

We will derive closed-form expressions for the signal degradation and the interference, which is introduced by the blanking nonlinearity. The theoretical results will be validated by simulations, which illustrate the detrimental blanking influence in a descriptive way. In addition it will be shown how the results affect an OFDM receiver and how the receiver can be adapted to the blanking nonlinearity. Simulation results confirm a gain of 3dB at BER=1*10^-3 for a 16QAM transmission, when adapting the receiver accordingly.	elegant degradation;interference (communication);nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Ulrich Epple;Kamel Shibli;Michael Schnell	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962893	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	42.798444133093	77.61539566773627	5168

39e0ab4f868308fc304c07ce9276904dfad92504	wideband lfm interference suppression based on fractional fourier transform and projection techniques		A novel wideband LFM interference suppression method is proposed based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and projection techniques. By using the concentration property of LFM interferences in fractional Fourier domain, the initial frequency, frequency modulation rate and direction-of-arrival (DOA) of LFM interferences are first estimated. Afterwards, the space–time interferences subspace is constructed. In order to suppress wideband LFM interferences, the received signal is projected onto the subspace orthogonal to the interferences subspace when the signals are uncorrelated. Furthermore, considering the scenario when the signals are coherent, according to the properties of oblique projection, LFM interferences are suppressed by projecting the received signal onto the joint signal–noise subspace. Then, the desired signal is extracted by beamforming. Unlike the existing algorithms, the proposed method not only can exactly estimate parameters and directly solve the DOA of LFM interferences but also can construct the interferences subspace with the time-variant steering vector of interferences. Moreover, our method can effectively suppress LFM interferences without reducing the freedom, and significantly improve the performance, even at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or small number of snapshots. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	fractional fourier transform;interference (communication);zero suppression	Yue Cui;Junfeng Wang	2014	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-013-9642-z	electronic engineering;mathematics;statistics	Vision	51.728546740728184	80.27175998854463	5183

A classical way of implementing a SISO decoder for a linear block code is to use a trellis-based decoding algorithm, such as MAP, Max-Log-MAP or SOVA [S. Lin et al. (1998)]. Recently, the idea of sectionalizing the trellis diagram representing a code has been proposed as a means to decrease the decoding complexity associated with the SISO decoders [S. Lin et al. (1998), Y. Liu et al. (2000)].This paper investigates the application of a nonbinary SOVA decoding algorithm L. Cong et al. (1999) to the sectionalized trellis of a binary linear block code and generalizes the nonbinary SOVA to a code with time-varying symbol set. Based on the above study to derive a new simplified algorithm, called the nonbinary SOVA with bit-level reliabilities (NSOVA with BLR) that we also investigate in terms of complexity for a serial and a parallel implementation. Based on the computational complexity figures for both algorithms and shows that optimal sectionalizations can be found, that minimize the computational complexity entailed when using these algorithms for decoding.	bit-level parallelism;block code;character encoding;computation;computational complexity theory;convolutional code;decoding methods;diagram;local interconnect network;loss function;map;requirement;soft output viterbi algorithm;soft-in soft-out decoder;trellis quantization	Fabrice Labeau	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

Instead of trying to achieve raw data metrics (such as total transmitted data) the protocol aims to optimize the value of information (VoI) maintained by the customer. To achieve this, the nodes will need to perform inferences about the behavior of other nodes and the customer, such that the nodes do not need to send information which the customer already received from other sources or information which it can guess based on previous data. A simulation study compares the performance of the IVE protocol with the current state of the art of on-demand periodic reporting.	chunk (information);customer knowledge;download;simulation	Damla Turgut;Ladislau Bölöni	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655627	communications protocol;estimation;wireless sensor network;computer science;sensor;data mining;accuracy and precision;computer security;statistics;computer network;data collection	Robotics	15.39940632333542	78.24050220550487	5220

Localization, being inevitable for a range of applications, is also a basis for many network operations such as data packet forwarding i.e. routing and sensing coverage in wireless sensor networks. With a range of application scenario, it is a challenging task to design a localization module for a wireless sensor network consisting of sensor nodes with limited capacity in terms of power, processing and storage etc. This paper presents a simple model of a range based localization system that employs distributed computing in a collaborative and cooperative manner. The aim of this work is to modify a range based localization algorithm to utilize scarce resources optimally along with improved performance by changing the inherent methodologies of position estimation. In this research work basically the role of a media access control scheme (MAC) in the localization module is investigated. A MAC is basically used to save the energy by reducing collisions and retransmission of range packets. Further, energy is conserved by restricting the coverage to a smaller part containing the neighbours up to certain hops and that is formed by dividing the whole network area into clusters. To analyse the performance spectrum, we have simulated the localization method under a variety of application scenarios and lead to the conclusion that this approach increases the efficiency of localization in wireless sensor networks. In the simulation process, every minute aspect of sensor network localization model including the topology, range, mobility, channel, propagation schemes etc. were considered and the performance was finally analyzed. & Suman Pandey sumanuptu@gmail.com Shirshu Varma shirshu@iiita.ac.in 1 KNIT, Sultanpur, India 2 IIIT, Allahabad, India 123 Wireless Pers Commun DOI 10.1007/s11277-015-2948-3	access control;algorithm;communications protocol;distributed computing;internationalization and localization;network packet;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);routing;sensor web;simulation;software deployment;software propagation	Suman Pandey;Shirshu Varma	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2948-3	wireless ad hoc network;internationalization and localization;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	7.4616989099122115	80.61847283434108	5224

A new framework exploiting the network coding technology, referred to as adaptive network coded cooperation (ANCC), is proposed to combat the lossy nature of wireless links and to adapt to the changing network topology. The central idea is to match network-on-graph, i.e. instantaneous network topologies described in graphs, with the well-known class of code-on-graph, i.e. low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and LDPC-like codes. Both achievable rates and outage probabilities are evaluated for ANCC, and closed-form expressions are derived for the asymptotic case where the network size increases without bound. Compared with the existing schemes, ANCC significantly outperforms repetition-based schemes and performs on par with space-time coded cooperation (STCC), but obviates the need for stringent inter-user synchronization at the bit/baud level.	cobham's thesis;coding gain;coding theory;computer simulation;downtime;ensemble kalman filter;error floor;frequency divider;linear network coding;lossless compression;lossy compression;low-density parity-check code;multi-user;network topology;numerical analysis;numerical method;overhead (computing);relay;routing;spectral efficiency;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690	Xingkai Bao;Tiffany Jing Li	2008	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2008.060439	synchronization;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.55478188146969	75.56604429111226	5239

A two dimensional (2D) general memory polynomial (GMP) has been used to characterize the behavioural model of HPA. The inband and cross modulation distortion, caused by nonlinear HPA on the carrier aggregated MIMO-OFDM system can be modelled in terms of complex phase shift and Gaussian nonlinear noise that distorted the received data symbol. The mathematical expressions for the complex phase shift and variance of Gaussian nonlinear noise have been formulated. Furthermore, this analysis is also augmented to evaluate the overall performance of aggregated MIMO-OFDM system in terms of probability of symbol error for Mary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) in presence of multi-path Rayleigh fading channel.

Our analysis reveals that depending on the channel spatial correlation, some of the sub-carriers have substantially lower average capacity than others and may, therefore, deteriorate the system performance. In such cases, the proposed scheme enables those sub-carriers to recover from correlation effects and reinstates all the sub-carriers with the same upper bound of the average capacity as offered by the uncorrelated channel. Our analysis of pairwise error probability (PEP) demonstrates the effects of spatial correlation on the squared Euclidean distance between any two codewords and shows how the proposed scheme mitigates those effects without the knowledge of the channel spatial correlation. We observe in simulation that depending on the channel spatial correlation, our proposed scheme can yield a dramatic performance improvement.	cdd;code word;euclidean distance;mimo;mimo-ofdm;pairwise error probability;performance;simulation;transmitter	Ahmed Sadeque;Mohammad Saquib	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134400	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;computer performance;statistics	Vision	40.67902660842285	73.86440382830084	5252

Specifically, instead of maximizing its individual utility or the overall network utility, each user aims to maximize its social group utility that hinges heavily on its social tie structure with other users. We show that this framework provides rich modeling flexibility and spans the continuum between non-cooperative game and network utility maximization NUM—two traditionally disjoint paradigms for network optimization. Based on this framework, we study three important applications of SGUM, in database assisted spectrum access, power control, and random access control, respectively. For the case of database assisted spectrum access, we show that the SGUM game is a potential game and always admits a socially-aware Nash equilibrium SNE. We also develop a distributed spectrum access algorithm that can converge to the SNE and also quantify the trade-off between the performance and convergence time of the algorithm. For the cases of power control and random access control, we show that there exists a unique SNE and the network performance improves as the strength of social ties increase. Numerical results corroborate that the SGUM solutions can achieve superior performance using real social data trace. Furthermore, we show that the SGUM framework can be generalized to take into account both positive and negative social ties among users, which can be a useful tool for studying network security problems.	access control;converge;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;flow network;interaction;malware;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;network performance;network security;network utility;numerical method;random access;systems design;triune continuum paradigm	Xu Chen;Xiaowen Gong;Lei Yang;Junshan Zhang	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2016.2530070	games;game theory;simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;interference;coupling;mobile computing;wireless;computer network	Metrics	30.8943825341568	94.70332960021518	5262

The channel state information (CSI) between the secondary user (SU) transmitter (SU-Tx) and SU receiver (SU-Rx) is perfectly known at the SU-Tx. However, due to the less cooperation between the SU and the PU, only partial CSI between the SU-Tx and PU is obtained by the SU-Tx. Our objective is, given the transmit power constraint, to determine the optimal transmit signal covariance to maximize the rate of the SU while keeping the interference to the PU less than a threshold with high probability. This problem is termed as a robust cognitive beamforming design problem, and can be formulated as a semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem. An efficient algorithm is then proposed to transform this SIP problem into a finite constraint problem, and it is shown that the algorithm obtains the globally optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;cognitive radio;constraint logic programming;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);maxima and minima;point-to-point (telecommunications);semi-infinite programming;semiconductor industry;simulation;superuser;system analysis;transmitter;with high probability	Lan Zhang;Ying-Chang Liang;Yan Xin;H.

7300fd2f6b0a56bb09f3ac0729d6043a02c9a30e	constant overhead quantum fault-tolerance with quantum expander codes		We prove that quantum expander codes can be combined with quantum fault-tolerance techniques to achieve constant overhead: the ratio between the total number of physical qubits required for a quantum computation with faulty hardware and the number of logical qubits involved in the ideal computation is asymptotically constant, and can even be taken arbitrarily close to 1 in the limit o small physical error rate. This improves on the polylogarithmic overhead promised by the standard threshold theorem. To achieve this, we exploit a framework introduced by Gottesman together with a family of constant rate quantum codes, quantum expander codes. Our main technical contribution is to analyze an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes and prove that it remains robust in the presence of noisy syndrome measurements, a property which is crucial for fault-tolerant circuits. We also establish two additional features of the decoding algorithm that make it attractive for quantum computation: it can be parallelized to run in logarithmic depth, and is single-shot, meaning that it only requires a single round of noisy syndrome measurement.

Linear beamformers (BFers) for relay stations of different cells are jointly designed to maintain, in a CoMP amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying manner, the target signal to interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) at the cellular boundaries of this type of networks. Considering the feasibility in realizations and deployments, BFer designs are only allowed to use the channel state information (CSI) feedbacks of the wireless links inside a network. This kind of designs turns out to be a challenging optimization problem when attempting to maintain the SINR under the estimation and quantization errors in CSI. A conservative criterion and solution method is proposed for this robust design problem. Despite the conservativeness, the proposed method appears to provide an effective BFer design for CoMP AF relaying, either from the perspective of power consumption or from the viewpoints of BFers' complexity and feasibility in syntheses. Simulations also show that when applying the proposed CoMP AF relaying method in Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ), data throughput can be efficiently increased for users close to the joint cellular boundaries inside a multi-cell network.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;brainfuck;broadcast relay station;channel state information;computer simulation;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimal design;optimization problem;quadratically constrained quadratic program;retransmission (data networks);semiconductor industry;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link;the mouse gene expression database;throughput;tsung	Chun-I Kuo;Sau-Hsuan Wu;Chun-Kai Tseng	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.072512.111764	telecommunications;computer science;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.65170124445661	89.59315877489615	5292

However, the model estimation must use as many pilots as possible to reduce the effect of noises with the penalty of increasing the storage size for received OFDM symbols. We observed that the model parameters between neighboring local regions are correlated. Hence, some recursive methods are proposed to adaptively estimate model parameters such that the required number of pilots can be reduced, and thus, the required storage size is reduced for interpolating the symbols used in the regression model. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that a better performance is obtained as well by using the proposed parameter estimation methods.	algorithm;channel (communications);channel state information;computer simulation;doppler effect;estimation theory;interpolation;iterative method;kalman filter;least squares;recursion (computer science);subject matter expert turing test;x.690;xfig	Wei-Cheng Pao;Hsien-Cheng Chiu;Dah-Chung Chang;Yung-Fang Chen	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917937	econometrics;computer science;least squares;statistics	Robotics	49.674702378097855	77.47389197865272	5297

However, for burst traffic, most of them suffer from significant performance degradation due to randomly waking up to communicate with each other. In this paper, we propose a new asynchronous duty-cycle receiver-initiated MAC protocol called HKMAC. In proposed HKMAC, by adaptively adjusting beacon time of the receiver and scheduling the sender's listening time during scheduled period, it can achieve low end-to-end packet delivery latency and high energy efficiency under burst traffic. We have evaluated the performance of HKMAC through detailed ns-2 simulation. The simulation results show that HKMAC can always reduce end-to-end packet delivery latency and energy consumption under various data rates in different topologies compared with RI-MAC - a state-of-the-art MAC protocol in WSNs.	access control;duty cycle;elegant degradation;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;network packet;rs-232;randomness;scheduling (computing);simulation	Hongwei Tang;Caixia Sun;Yongpeng Liu;Baohua Fan	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583594	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;access control;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.17583792029621	84.53753624954842	5299

A partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme is one of the typical PAPR reduction methods. A cyclic shifted sequences (CSSs) scheme is evolved from the PTS scheme to improve the PAPR reduction performance, where OFDM signal subsequences are cyclically shifted and combined to generate alternative OFDM signal sequences. The shift value (SV) sets in the CSS scheme should be carefully selected because those are closely related to the PAPR reduction performance of the CSS scheme. In this letter, we propose some criteria to select the good SV sets and verify its validness through simulations.	acf;audio power amplifier;cascading style sheets;distortion;frequency divider;multiplexing;nonlinear system;polynomial-time approximation scheme;power architecture platform reference;simulation;systemverilog	Kee-Hoon Kim	2016	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2016.2529292	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;cascading style sheets;correlation;frequency domain	HPC	47.08559366086628	81.25195935518296	5305

Due to movement of sensor nodes, running out of energy or crashes in the network, the topology of sensor networks changes very frequently. In the proposed method, synchronization error is decreased by creating a hierarchical tree with lower depth and reliability is improved by maintaining and updating the information of candidate parent nodes. The RTSP reduces recovery time and cost compared to the TPSN (Timing–sync Protocol for Sensor Networks) when there are changes in topology. Simulation results show that RTSP has about 10% better performance than TPSN in synchronization accuracy. The number of messages in RTSP is 10%∼30% lower than that in TPSN when there are topology changes.	crash (computing);network topology;overhead (computing);simulation;synchronization (computer science);tree network	Soyoung Hwang;Yunju Baek	2005		10.1007/11603771_12	embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	-1.754027735814976	76.05032628678137	5324

It is shown that polar codes are capacity achieving codes and have a low complexity in encoding and decoding. It has been proven that polar codes reach to secrecy capacity in the binary-input wiretap channels in symmetric settings for which the wiretapper's channel is degraded with respect to the main channel. The first task of this paper is to propose a coding scheme to achieve secrecy capacity in asymmetric nonbinary-input channels while keeping reliability and security conditions satisfied. Our assumption is that the wiretap channel is stochastically degraded with respect to the main channel and message distribution is unspecified. The main idea is to send information set over good channels for Bob and bad channels for Eve and send random symbols for channels that are good for both. In this scheme the frozen vector is defined over all possible choices using polar codes ensemble concept. We proved that there exists a frozen vector for which the coding scheme satisfies reliability and security conditions. It is further shown that uniform distribution of the message is the necessary condition for achieving secrecy capacity.	eve;information theory;information-theoretic security;marginal model;noisy-channel coding theorem;polar code (coding theory);polarization (waves);pseudorandomness;ueli maurer (cryptographer)	Amirsina Torfi;Sobhan Soleymani;Seyed Mehdi Iranmanesh;Hadi Kazemi;Rouzbeh A.

The intention of the new serial-based RapidIO interconnect, is to address the needs of embedded applications. This relatively new interconnect technology is poised to lead in this applications space. Embedded systems consist of multiple processing elements, which provide data processing and/or control functions. Some systems may have several thousands of devices that need to intercommunicate. This communication must be reliable, peer-to-peer, low latency, and bandwidth scalable. It must support a wide range of system topologies. Additionally, interconnect must be efficient in the areas of transaction, silicon, and software overhead. RapidIO had the benefit of being designed from the ground up. With this flexibility in mind, the specification targets embedded applications, with primary goals being reliability, efficiency, and protocol flexibility. RapidIO chose a three layered approach based in hardware. The lowest layer is the physical layer, which specifies electrical signaling and link level handshaking mechanisms. The transport layer sits above the physical layer and dictates how packets are routed in the switched environment.

The proposed scheme prescribes different bit-lengths to be mapped onto the indices of the transmit antennas and then uses padding technique to avoid error propagation. Numerical results and comparisons, on both the capacity and the bit error rate performances, are provided and show the advantage of the proposed scheme. The BP-IGCH scheme not only offers lower complexity to realize the design flexibility, but also achieves better performance.	bit error rate;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;mimo;numerical analysis;numerical method;performance;power of two;propagation of uncertainty;quality of service;relevance;software propagation;transmitter;uncompressed video	Yuli Yang;Sonia Aïssa	2011	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2011.010311.102020	bit error rate;telecommunications;mathematics;slot antenna;channel capacity;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	34.92994574074354	76.28156469001195	5352

The average throughput of the scheme is obtained using the Markov Analysis technique, and we show that reservation help improve the system performance by reducing the number of collision in transmission.

The integrated traffic engineering paradigm provides mechanisms for dynamic addition of physical capacity to optical networks. In the absence of such mechanisms, the rejection of incoming requests will be higher. The objective of the proposed policy is to minimize the costs involving bandwidth, switching and signaling. The policy is derived by utilizing the Markov decision process theory. The new policy is split into two levels: the MPLS network level and the optical network level. In addition to the optimal policy, a sub-optimal policy and a threshold-based policy are also proposed which are less computationally intensive but have comparable performance to the optimal policy.

This paper describes a novel mechanism using measured RSS (Received Signal Strength) to calculate optimal transmission power. This technique works in multipath environments and with nodes with differing transmission capability. Our technique achieves automatic configuration employing modifications to RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-power and lossy networks) router discovery without requiring extra steps or messages. Consequently, each node can send packets with ideal transmission power, which will usually be lower than maximum power and will help to prolong its lifetime. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, using performance metrics such as energy consumption and packet loss, on an WSN testbed. Several factors that impact the RSS, such as antenna, multipath environment, output power and the node's capabilities are also investigated. Moreover, two RSS estimation techniques are evaluated and compared to the average measured RSS. The experimental results show that energy consumption is reduced by using the proposed technique.	lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;multipath propagation;network packet;rss;router (computing);routing;testbed	Wilawan Rukpakavong;Iain C.

We develop a simple algorithm to schedule a subset of M active users for data transmission. We first identify a set of L candidate users that should provide channel information feedback. We then select M active users among the L candidates based on joint consideration of their effective channel gains and directions. We derive an asymptotic upper bound for the sum rate gap between the maximum sum rate of the M selected active users, achieved by dirty paper coding, and the full sum capacity of the original MIMO broadcast channel. Utilizing the upper bound, we show that the sum rate gap can be reduced to meet user requirement by suitably choosing a large but still finite L. Furthermore, we also investigate the performance of the low complexity zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for the M active users.	algorithm;beamforming;mimo;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;user requirements document	Zhihua Shi;Wei Xu;Shi Jin;Chunming Zhao;Zhi Jun Ding	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2048501	telecommunications;computer science;user requirements document;mathematics;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.12732183433471	87.74134285875954	5410

To provide a meaningful service such as disaster and emergency surveillance, meeting real-time-and-energy constraints and the stability of transmit queues are the basic requirements of communication protocols in such networks. In settings with sparse distribution of actuator nodes, multi-hop routing is traditionally used to relay information to a remote sink. A problem with this approach is that the loss of connectivity of actuator nodes may lead to partitioning of the network. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing power consumption at each actuator node and minimizing assignment overhead at each sensor node while ensuring network connectivity. We propose that each actuator is enabled with two wireless interfaces: one to communicate with its assigned sensor network, and the other to communicate with the network of neighboring actuators. At any instant of time, an actuator can adjust its transmit power level to ensure connectivity and pro-actively inform its attached sensor network in case of mobility. These strategies have an associated cost. We show in this paper that at any instant of time, the strategy chosen by an actuator to adjust power and control-overhead due to mobility are optimal subject to constraints. The proposal is validated by means of analysis and simulations.	as-interface;algorithm;computation;embedded system;heuristic (computer science);overhead (computing);real-time transcription;relay;requirement;routing;sensor node;simulation;sparse matrix;throughput	Muhammad Farukh Munir;Fethi Filali	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.54	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	10.988684983212186	81.47955022129355	5413

In this paper a conference traffic model is formulated and link level and conference level congestion measures are derived. Motivated by the advantages of sharing transmission resources in TASI related voice communication systems, an analogous transmission policy for conference videos is proposed. The quantification of conference traffic also enables us to set an admission policy so that the network can accommodate as many conferences as possible without violating conference quality constraints. I . INTRODUCTION A multimedia teleconference is an information exchange system for people to conduct meetings effectively without leaving their offices. Sitting in front of their workstations, conferees can see each other via real-time motion videos on their multimedia workstation displays, talk and listen to all the conversation via real-time audio, and watch presentations via an on-line Electronic Blackboard. The effectiveness of a multimedia teleconference should be evaluated based on how much it can emulate a faceto-face meeting. Audio in an multimedia teleconference should be unconstrained so that everybody can talk to and be heard by everybody else. This is possible because audio is a bandwidth efficient medium for people to exchange information and most conferees exercise constraints as to when to speak and when not to. Video, on the other hand, is quite different because of its large transmission bandwidth requirement. Depending upon variables such as dimension, format, and compression, transmission of a good quality compressed video requires at least 1.5 Mbits/sec. The bit rate would be one to two orders of magnitude larger if video is not compressed. In packet switching environment, good video quality means small video packet loss and delay. This calls for careful bandwidth allocation to prevent the network from overload. Two separate but relevant issues need to be addressed in video bandwidth allocation: one is the admission p o l i c y , which decides whether or not to admit a new conference, and the other is the transmission pol icy , which controls the video transmissions of existing conferences.

The base station employs single-carrier space-time bit-interleaved coded modulations with linear precoding for each user. From an information-theoretic point of view, this scheme is potentially capacity achieving but puts high stakes on the receiver complexity. Channel estimation is made particularly difficult by the superimposition of pilot symbols and data. Indeed, the classical channel estimation method based on matched filtering and accumulation clearly fails to give satisfactory performance in a spatial multiplexing and overloading context. Thus, we propose a sophisticated iterative receiver which includes channel estimation, MMSE-based chip-equalization and MMSE-based multiuser detection together with decoding of the turbo-code. Simultaneous downlink transmission to several users is investigated in this paper which brings out the overloading flexibility in terms of Space-Time Modulation and Coding Scheme (ST-MCS) design and radio resource allocation.	channel state information;elegant degradation;function overloading;information theory;interference (communication);iteration;mimo;modulation;multi-user;simulation;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;texture filtering;tree accumulation;turbo code	Raphaël Visoz;Antoine O.

However, due to the long channel impulse response and the existence of reflectors, PD-based UWAL suffers from significant degradation when PD measurements of nonline-of-sight (NLOS) communication links are falsely identified as line-of-sight (LOS). In this paper, we utilize expected variation of PD measurements due to mobility of nodes and present an algorithm to classify the former into LOS and NLOS links. First, by comparing signal strength-based and PD-based range measurements, we identify object-related NLOS (ONLOS) links, where signals are reflected from objects with high reflection loss, for example, ships hull, docks, rocks and so on. In the second step, excluding PD measurements related to ONLOS links, we use a constrained expectation-maximization algorithm to classify PD measurements into two classes: LOS and sea-related NLOS (SNLOS), and to estimate the statistical parameters of each class. Since our classifier relies on models for the underwater acoustic channel, which are often simplified, alongside simulation results, we validate the performance of our classifier based on measurements from three sea trials. Both our simulation and sea trial results demonstrate a high detection rate of ONLOS links, and accurate classification of PD measurements into LOS and SNLOS.	acoustic cryptanalysis;elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic;line-of-sight (missile);numerical analysis;propagation delay;reflection (computer graphics);simulation;software propagation;statistical classification	Roee Diamant;Hwee Pink Tan;Lutz H.-J.

Therefore, conducting extra research work aiming at improving the performance of RED is still a topic of high interest. In this paper, we present an analytical study aiming at the fine tuning of the RED parameters. Utilizing a statistical analysis approach, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at addressing the loss and delay tradeoff of the RED queuing discipline. We provide a two-phase iterative solution to the problem in order to identify the settings of the RED parameters. We discuss the convergence characteristics of our solution and investigate its low complexity characteristics. Through extensive NS2 experiments, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed optimization approach by comparing its results to those of adaptive RED as well as standard RED with recommended parameter settings.	active queue management;binary-coded decimal;brute-force search;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);converge;experiment;fixed point (mathematics);iteration;iterative method;line search;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;network congestion;network scheduler;nonlinear system;optimization problem;quasiconvex function;search algorithm;semiconductor industry;sequential quadratic programming;simulation;stationary process;steady state;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Homayoun Yousefi'zadeh;Amir Habibi;Xiaolong Li;Hamid Jafarkhani;Claus Bauer	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.050812.100733	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;mathematics;iterative method;markov process;queueing theory;transport layer;statistics	Vision	2.7457238866701443	99.88475140428926	5506

The situation gets worse if high-speed wireless links are part of the networks, due to the frequent random losses over the wireless links. This is because the standard TCP increments its congestion window too slowly in the absence of packet losses and decrements it too drastically in response to packet losses. A natural solution is to make TCP more aggressive. This approach has been exercised in the recent TCP development such as HSTCP and MulTCP which have the capability of using a single logical connection to emulate the behaviour of a set of multiple standard TCP connections. In the meantime, TCP Parallelisation uses a set of parallel TCP connections to transfer data for an application process. Then, a question arises – can the single-connection based approach achieve the similar performance as TCP Parallelisation in the environments where random packet losses prevail. Our analysis shows that TCP Parallelisation has the better performance and is more efficient for performance improvement.	bandwidth-delay product;network congestion;network packet;parallel computing;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;timeout (computing)	Qiang Fu	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199079	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;throughput;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;markov process;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;packet loss;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;bandwidth;computer network;bandwidth-delay product	HPC	-2.5616425469058126	92.56056006366089	5509
5413a28b3b507f102f9ab9192d618f1f753f3897	achievable secrecy rate of artificial fast-fading techniques and secret-key assisted design for mimo wiretap channels with multiantenna passive eavesdropper		Artificial noise (AN) is an efficient way to enhance physical layer security of multiantenna wiretap channels with a passive eavesdropper (ED) whose channel state information is unavailable. However, the AN is known to be vulnerable to the eavesdropping attack with a large antenna array. To tackle the problem, the artificial fast fading (AFF) scheme has been developed to deliberately randomize the ED's effective channel so as to disrupt its channel estimation. Some recent progress has been made for the secrecy-rate performance of the AFF scheme in the multi-input single-output wiretap channels. However, it turns out that the performance is over-estimated. In this correspondence, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the secrecy-rate of the AFF scheme in general multi-input multi-output wiretap channels. Unfortunately, our analysis reveals a negative result that the conventional AFF is no better than the AN methods, without some pre-shared information among the legitimate parties. This is in fact in stark contrast to the previous observations. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a novel cross layer design by combining the AFF in the physical layer with the secret-keys in the upper layer crypto systems. Then, we mathematically prove that our method asymptotically nullifies the information leakage to the ED in the physical layer for any number of ED antennas even without the aid of the wiretap codes, while further enhancing the upper layer security, and thus provides an enhanced security over the layers. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis and the efficiency of the proposed scheme.	automated flight following;channel state information;code;forward secrecy;information leakage;mimo;numerical analysis;spectral leakage	Changick Song	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2856764	channel state information;electronic engineering;mimo;fading;physical layer;information leakage;computer science;eavesdropping;artificial noise;communication channel	Security	35.9360960715265	83.0920370522624	5514

However, the real interferences generally differ much from those calculated by theoretical or empirical models, because these models cannot capture the dynamic impacts of the environments. This paper presents EIM, an efficient method for sensors to online measure their interference vectors, where the interference vector of a sensor indicates the real interferences from other sensors to it when other sensors are transmitting packets. EIM conducts interference vector measurement passively during the natural working process of the sensor network. Because a sensor may be interfered by quite a few neighbors and the environments may change over time, the efficiency i.e. latency for real-time interference vector estimation is a very challenging issue. EIM exploits three facts to improve the efficiency of interference vector calculation. First, by exploiting the additivity property of the received signal strenth, a linear interference vector reconstruction model is developed. Secondly, EIM exploits not only the received and overheard packets from other sensors, but also the collided packets to construct the observation matrix of the linear model. Third, compressive sensing technologies are developed to recover the interference vector even when the observation matrix is partly determined. These methods help sensors much reduce the latency for calculating real-time interference vectors. Extensive simulations were carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.	communications protocol;compressed sensing;enterprise information management;experiment;interference (communication);linear equation;linear model;online and offline;rss;real-time clock;scalability;sensor;simulation;testbed;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Xiao Qi;Yongcai Wang;Yuexuan Wang;Liwen Xu;Changjian Hu	2013	2013 11th International Symposium and Workshops on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)		communications protocol;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;compressed sensing	Embedded	24.369386083781635	72.70709880962295	5533

A signal-to-leakage-plus-noise (SLNR) precoding scheme is one approach for linear precoding in the multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel that sends multiple data streams to different users in the same cell. Unfortunately, SLNR-based scheme neglects other-cell interference, which limits the performance of users at the edge of the cell. MGET addresses the shortcomings of previous SLNR-based beamformers by presenting an interference-aware enhancement to SLNR precoding scheme that uses a whitening filter for interference suppression at the receiver and a novel precoder using the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix for each user at the transmitter. Numerical results show that the proposed MGET technique outperforms the traditional block diagonalization (BD) linear technique in reasonable SINR regime.	blu-ray;decorrelation;gaussian elimination;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;normal mode;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral leakage;telecommunications link;transmitter;whitening transformation;zero suppression	Shengjie Zhao;Yan Zhao;Huan Sun;Jin Liu;Lu Zhang;Luoning Gui	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594074	covariance matrix;electronic engineering;linear predictive coding;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;mimo	Mobile	48.74944078115867	81.45343144944869	5546

447ca88602a3e3317c65137f0f8d4195c1b8ec92	carcc: connectivity autorecovering via cooperative communication		Wireless ad hoc networks are often considered an alternative for providing communicationmeans to support urgent and temporary tasks. In such settings, network connectivity is a primary condition to allow nodes to exchange information. In this work we explore the use of cooperative communication (CC) techniques for improving network connectivity.The proposed solution, named Connectivity Autorecovering with Cooperative Communication (CARCC), monitors potential network disruption points and proactively creates cooperative links (CC-links).These links are used to regain network connectivitywhennecessary. CARCCallows the selection of suitable CC-links in O(Δ(G) × Λ) time, whereas a centralized approach takes O(V2 × Λ) time, where Δ(G) is the degree of the underline network graph G(V, E) and Λ is the computational cost of selecting helper nodes. Although CARCC relies on localized information, it is able to provide comparable results of other noteworthy alternatives that require global topological information. The CC-links provided by CARCC reestablished network connectivity in over 91% in the evaluated settings.	algorithmic efficiency;biconnected component;biconnected graph;centralized computing;denial-of-service attack;graph (discrete mathematics);hoc (programming language);identifier;interference (communication);simulation;steam rupture	Ulisses Rodrigues Afonseca;Camila F.

Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have been attracting significant attention due to their promising technology. The WMN technology is becoming a major avenue for the fourth generation of wireless mobility. Communication in large-scale wireless networks can create bottlenecks for scalable implementations of computationally intensive applications. A class of crucially important communication patterns that have already received considerable attention in this regard are group communication operations, since these inevitably place a high demand on network bandwidth and have a consequent impact on algorithm execution times. Multicast communication has been among the most primitive group capabilities of any message passing in networks. It is central to many important distributed applications in science and engineering and fundamental to the implementation of higher-level communication operations such as gossip, gather, and barrier synchronisation. Existing solutions offered for providing multicast communications in WMN have severe restriction in terms of almost all performance characteristics. Consequently, there is a need for the design and analysis of new efficient multicast communication schemes for this promising network technology. Hence, the aim of this study is to tackle the challenges posed by the continuously growing need for delivering efficient multicast communication over WMN. In particular, this study presents a new load balancing aware multicast algorithm with the aim of enhancing the QoS in the multicast communication over WMNs. Our simulations experiments show that our proposed multicast algorithm exhibits superior performance in terms of delay, jitter and throughput, compared to the most well known multicast algorithms. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The Euclidean distance between two space-time codeword can be written as the combination of independent chi-square random variables, and the probability density function of the Euclidean distance is calculated by Laplace transform, thus the closed-form expression for the pairwise error probability is derived.

Performance analysis of CPS has so far been based on simulations or on complex Markov chains under restricting assumptions on input traffic statistics. In contrast, we propose a fully analytical approach to CPS, based on a worst case analysis of system dynamics, and applicable to a large family of traffic characterizations. We derive sufficient conditions for stability for traffic characterized stochastically as well as for traffic constrained by arrival curves, and we show how to compute bounds on backlog and delay. We illustrate our approach and assess our results by means of an example of coupling of wireless transmissions.	best, worst and average case;central processing unit;markov chain;profiling (computer programming);simulation;system dynamics;web traffic	Christian Vitale;Gianluca Rizzo;Balaji Rengarajan;Vincenzo Mancuso	2015	2015 27th International Teletraffic Congress	10.1109/ITC.2015.18	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	0.9691902192085641	97.98685944477045	5634

However, with underlay structure considered, it is still possible to further improve traffic efficiency. In this paper, we discuss the problem of localizing the traffic traversal across peer groups, which are partitioned according to underlay characteristics. We first provide three concrete examples to demonstrate this common challenge, which we theoretically formulate afterwards. Finally, we propose a ring overlay approach, which performs excellently to solve the problem, while tolerating peer dynamics and supporting peer heterogeneity.	internationalization and localization;peer-to-peer;simulation;tree traversal	Zhijie Shen;Roger Zimmermann	2012		10.1145/2393347.2396373	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;wireless;computer network	Metrics	-0.5823885046081838	80.0129151511443	5647

In this paper, an optimization scheme for adjusting the read (quantized) and write (verify) voltage levels to adapt to the nonstationary flash channel is presented. Using a model-based approach to represent the flash channel, incorporating the programming noise, random telegraph noise (RTN), data retention noise and cell-to-cell interference as major signal degradation components, the write-voltage levels are optimized by minimizing the channel error probability. Moreover, for selecting the quantization levels for the read-voltage to facilitate soft LDPC decoding, an entropy-based function is introduced by which the voltage erasure regions (error dominating regions) are controlled to produce the lowest bit/frame error probability. The proposed write and read voltage optimization schemes not only minimize the error probability throughout the operational lifetime of flash memory, but also improve the decoding convergence speed. Finally, to minimize the number of read-voltage quantization levels while ensuring LDPC decoder convergence, the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis is performed over the MLC flash channel.

Pricing strategies play an important role in the network performance since they explicitly influence the user demand. Demand uncertainty would cause providers to face lower profits. In this paper, we analyze the price-demand relationship and based on that, we study a competitive pricing game and address an open wireless access market (with different market shares) where service providers' objective is to maximize their profits. The resources are allocated among the users through a proportionally fair divisible auction mechanism. Simulation results show that a resource allocation model, which attracts users to actively participate in the auction, assures fair access while maintaining service providers' profit by adapting the pricing policy with a change in the user demand. Our analysis reveals that the service providers can establish a competitive price of the resources, while capturing a reasonable portion of market share. Under this setting, service providers could learn and predict which pricing policy is beneficial in a competitive environment.	entropy maximization;interference (communication);network performance;network service provider;population;proportionally fair;responsiveness;simulation;throughput	Pamela Gonzalez-Sanchez;Saltanat M.

To provide network survivability, each user should be protected against failures, either node or link failures. For each request, a primary path is set up for normal transmission, and an alternate path (protection path) should also be provided to protect the request in case of network failure. In this paper, we study how to provide survivability using multi-path scheme for dynamic network traffic, where users’ requests have random arrival times. Compared with previous work, our scheme considers interference and reusability factors when providing multiple paths for each request. By applying our scheme, the numerical results show that we can accommodate about 17% more requests than previous schemes. Meanwhile, the results show that our scheme not only accommodates more requests, but also takes less running time to find a solution for each request. F. Kandah · W. Zhang (B) · J.

In certain scenarios ongoing transmissions within the network need to be concealed so that no information is leaked beyond a vulnerable area. Such a concealment effort necessitates transmit ranges of radios to be limited. However, limiting transmit ranges results in sub-optimal routing patterns within the network, which results in lower network lifetime. In this paper, through a Linear Programming (LP) framework, we analyze lifetime limits of WSNs improving contextual privacy by transmit range control.	expectation–maximization algorithm;linear programming;loss function;noise margin;optimization problem;privacy;routing	Bülent Tavli;M.

The paper presents a power allocation over the transmitting beams, where a minimum rate per user restriction is required for each scheduled user, standing as a potential Quality of Service (QoS) indicator for the system behaviour. However, in practical wireless scenarios the CSIT is imperfect due to non-accurate estimation, so that robust schemes are required to meet the system demands. Based on the allowed system outage in the QoS achievement, different robust power allocation schemes are proposed, which are efficiently solved through convex optimization tools. The presented strategies are later compared via simulations for the different scenarios and the system specifications.	best, worst and average case;channel state information;convex optimization;downtime;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;procedural generation;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;system administrator;transmitter;worst-case scenario	Nizar Zorba;Ana I.

Usually, CRSN deploys numerous sensor nodes around the monitoring area. But the energy and storage of those nodes are both limited. Compared with the centralized CRSN, we focus more on a decentralized situation without the control center or cluster in this paper, especially on a circumstance with few information exchanges among sensor nodes. In the case of that, our goal is to help each sensor node to find an optimal strategy of channel selection in the decentralized CRSN quickly, and then, we apply a Multi-Agent Best-Response Q-Learning algorithm based on Timesharing-Tracking Framework to sequential channel selection for the first time. The algorithm not only has a low storage cost, but also can overcome the poor convergence of strategy caused by Multi-Agent simultaneous learning. For comparison, the optimal channel assignment in centralized network, the Multi-Agent Independent Q-Learning and the Win-or-Learn-Fast Policy Hill Climbing these three algorithms are taken into account, and experimental data validates that our proposed algorithm is feasible in decentralized network.	algorithm;algorithmic learning theory;centralized computing;cognitive radio;enhanced entity–relationship model;hill climbing;interference (communication);q-learning;sensor node;throughput;time-sharing	Fanzi Zeng;Hanshan Liu;Jisheng Xu	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603252	algorithm design;throughput;cognitive radio;wireless sensor network;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	15.793394172049899	82.5379434719973	5806

To date, in all but the most demanding applications, implementing parity and ECC for caches and other large, regular SRAM structures have been sufficient to stem the growing soft error tide. This will not be the case for long and questions remain as to the best way to detect and recover from soft errors in the remainder of the processor - in particular, the less structured execution core. In this work, we propose the ReStore architecture, which leverages existing performance enhancing checkpointing hardware to recover from soft error events in a low cost fashion. Error detection in the ReStore architecture is novel: symptoms that hint at the presence of soft errors trigger restoration of a previous checkpoint. Example symptoms include exceptions, control flow misspeculations, and cache or translation look-aside buffer misses. Compared to conventional soft error detection via full replication, the ReStore framework incurs little overhead, but sacrifices some amount of error coverage. These attributes make it an ideal means to provide very cost effective error coverage for processor applications that can tolerate a nonzero, but small, soft error failure rate. Our evaluation of an example ReStore implementation exhibits a 2times increase in MTBF (mean time between failures) over a standard pipeline with minimal hardware and performance overheads. The MTBF increases by 20times if ReStore is coupled with protection for certain particularly vulnerable pipeline structures	application checkpointing;cpu cache;circuit restoration;control flow;ecc memory;error detection and correction;exception handling;failure rate;image scaling;integrated circuit;mean time between failures;microprocessor;overhead (computing);soft error;static random-access memory;transaction processing system;translation lookaside buffer	Nicholas J.

Specifically, our MAC design is supported by the precoding vectors obtained by Zeroforcing technique which are used to address the Hidden Terminals. An efficient channel sounding process is used by our MAC protocol to obtain the Channel State Information (CSI) from the desired and undesired clients which are used to calculate the precoding vectors at the transmitters (Access Points). Our MAC design then uses these precoding vectors in order to null interferences among the undesired clients to avoid collision of signals and to maintain the concurrent transmissions among the desired clients. The the parameters such as network capacity, signaling overheads and fairness are considered in the design. Our MAC layer design shows a slightly higher signaling overhead compared to RTS/CTS scheme. However, due to the concurrent transmissions after the handshaking process, the cost of singling overheads are compensated. The simulation study of our MAC layer design shows a remarkable constant network capacity gain of 4-5 times in comparison to traditional RTS/CTS. Moreover, the gain is irrespective to the available air-time.	access control;automatic sounding;care-of address;carpal tunnel syndrome;channel state information;fairness measure;handshaking;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;overhead (computing);phy (chip);prototype;rs-232;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Sanjeeb Shrestha;Gengfa Fang;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Xiaojing Huang	2015	2015 22nd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2015.7124697	transmitter;throughput;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;antenna;channel state information;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;physical layer;hidden node problem;statistics;computer network	Mobile	30.76649161467093	81.92504649749642	5866

The THCL includes one source node (SN) and one destination node (DN). The SN sends information to the DN via a cluster of RNs. At the RNs, signals received from the SN are processed based on one of the three relay processing schemes. The three relay processing schemes considered include the distributed relay processing, maximal-ratio combining (MRC)-assisted relay processing and the majority vote and equal-gain combining (MV-EGC) aided relay processing. For the MRC-assisted and MV-EGC aided relay processing schemes, information exchange among the RNs is supported by a local information exchange network, within which communicates are based on the principles of direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA). In this contribution, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the THCLs is investigated and compared, when assuming that the first and second hops of the THCLs experience flat Rayleigh fading and that the communications within the local information exchange network conflict only Gaussian noise. We address the impact of the energy consumed for RNs' cooperation on the achievable BER performance of the THCLs. Our studies demonstrate that, when the energy spent for cooperation is taken into account, cooperation among the RNs may impose a big trade-off on the achievable BER performance of the THCLs.	bandwidth (signal processing);bit error rate;hop;information exchange;mv-algebra;maximal set;rayleigh fading;relay;x.690	Jia Shi;Lie-Liang Yang	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240164	gaussian noise;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;spread spectrum	DB	34.86427630463118	77.24641193739923	5871

We propose two new algorithms that enable a tradeoff for an improved balance between completion time and decoding delay of broadcasting a block of packets. We first formulate the IDNC packet selection problem that improves the balance between completion time and decoding delay as a statistical shortest path (SSP) problem. However, since finding such packet selection policy using the SSP technique is computationally complex, we employ its geometric structure to find some guidelines and use them to propose two efficient heuristic packet selection algorithms for broadcast erasure channels with a wide range of memory conditions. It is shown that each one of the two proposed algorithms is superior for a specific range of memory conditions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithms achieve an improved fairness in terms of the decoding delay across all receivers.	binary erasure channel;channel memory;fairness measure;heuristic;holism;linear network coding;network packet;selection algorithm;shortest path problem;simulation;throughput	Neda Aboutorab;Parastoo Sadeghi;Sameh Sorour	2014	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021614.130172	algorithm design;throughput;real-time computing;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;encoding	Metrics	14.252680774155932	93.62821388102184	5885
48b5cbbee20926d605d2c5f4fde103848913d500	power control for d2d underlay in multi-cell massive mimo networks		This paper proposes a new power control and pilot allocation scheme for device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying a multi-cell massive MIMO system. In this scheme, the cellular users in each cell get orthogonal pilots which are reused with reuse factor one across cells, while the D2D pairs share another set of orthogonal pilots. We derive a closed-form capacity lower bound for the cellular users with different receive processing schemes. In addition, we derive a capacity lower bound for the D2D receivers and a closed-form approximation of it. Then we provide a power control algorithm that maximizes the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of the users in the network. Finally, we provide a numerical evaluation where we compare our proposed power control algorithm with the maximum transmit power case and the case of conventional multi-cell massive MIMO without D2D communication. Based on the provided results, we conclude that our proposed scheme increases the sum spectral efficiency of multi-cell massive MIMO networks.	algorithm;approximation;elegant degradation;fairness measure;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;spectral efficiency;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Amin Ghazanfari;Emil Björnson;Erik G.

In our analysis, we assume fixed-gain relays with single antennas, whereas the source and destination terminals are equipped with multiple antennas. Novel expressions for the generalized moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the cumulative density function (CDF), probability density function (PDF), and moment generating function (MGF) are derived. These analytical expressions are then used to derive new expressions for Rayleigh fading channels as a special case. The new derived expressions, for Rayleigh fading channels, for the PDF and MGF of the end-to-end SNR are simpler and more tractable than those reported in the literature. Simulation results show the tightness and accuracy of the newly derived expressions.	beamforming;cobham's thesis;end-to-end principle;portable document format;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Osamah S.

Currently popular RF urban propagation models do not specifically consider the impact of actual urban environments and do not address mobile-to-mobile propagation scenarios. To address this, we implemented Urban Propagation Model (UPM) to predict path loss taking into account actual building geometry for each path with minimal time and computational complexity. In this paper we report the result of UPM validation that compared measurement taken in a representative urban environment with UPM path loss predictions. The results show that for this set of measurement, the UPM calculations are within a 5 dB standard deviation and 8 dB root mean square error.	access control;computation;computational complexity theory;mean squared error;prototype;radio frequency;software propagation;time complexity;verification and validation	Jeffrey Boksiner;Yuriy Posherstnik;Michael P Murphy;Chrysanthos Chrysanthou;Thierry Marsault;Jean-Philippe Millet	2016	MILCOM 2016 - 2016 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795413	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	25.829168771742125	78.47223049659495	5917

One important feature of LTE BS physical layer is the timing advance (TA) procedure, which is responsible for aligning the signal received from multiple User Equipment (UEs) at different cell distances. The BS informs the UE of the correct time to send the uplink frame in order to synchronize all UE frames and mitigate the interference between the terminals. Some vendors provide test platforms to emulate multiple UEs combined in a single box test system. These platforms are very sophisticated and allow the emulation of more than 500 UEs connected simultaneously, with different channels and at different distance conditions, handover, etc. Related costs can easily reach some hundreds of thousands of dollars, which are usually outside the project's budget. Besides, some features, including timing advance procedures cannot be obtained separately. Therefore, in order to test the LTE timing advance procedure with an affordable investment of less than five thousand dollars, a creative test environment was built with fiber optics and electrical/optical transceivers to emulate geographic distances inserting a delay on the RF uplink signal. This work describes the low-cost test environment and presents some lab results compared with field tests.	built-in test equipment;compaq lte;deployment environment;emulator;geographical distance;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interference (communication);optical fiber;radio frequency;telecommunications link;timing closure;transceiver;vii	D.

efec5b06b233433eaf867aabb63dcab2ae52d9f8	decentralized detection of hybrid faults in mobile sensor nodes		Abstract The widespread use of sensor nodes that are operating under the Internet of Things paradigm motivates researcher to step forward and build reliable systems capable of detecting their faulty nodes. These nodes lead to decrease in the accuracy and functionality of the networks, which finally result in quality degradation of network services. From the temporal point of view, the faults can be either permanent or intermittent. The detection of the latter one is more challenging since the nodes show contradictory behaviors at different times. from the topological point of view, the mobility of the sensor nodes is an intrinsic characteristic in many IoT-based applications, where numerous mobile nodes are managed by static overlay nodes. The dynamics of these network introduces the second challenge in identifying faulty nodes. Several works have been conducted to address the problem, but there is a research gap in identifying hybrid soft sensor faults in the aforementioned networks. The focus of attention in this paper is the detection of soft faults in the sensing unit of the nodes. We devised a new method, called Hybrid Fault Detection in Mobile Sensors , to detect nodes with mixed permanent and intermittent faults. A software debugging approach inspired the main idea. We also applied data mining techniques such as DBSCAN and K-means to validate sensed data, and differentiate the classes of faults, respectively. We evaluated the devised method using the NS2 simulator in various situations. One of the outcomes of the method is that the mobility of the nodes does not reduce the accuracy, in contrast to most of the traditional methods. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates promising results for the networks with more than 50% faulty nodes. The results also show perfect performance in detecting permanent and intermittent faults in the networks with various percentage of faulty nodes.

This work presents how to maximize data survivability in unattended WSNs (UWSNs) where sensed data cannot be off-loaded to a sink in real time. The characteristics of this network are the presence of intermittent sink and operation in possibly hostile settings. The major goal in this study is to improve the availability of the data in case of failure or compromise of sensor nodes resulting in the unavailability of or the loss of data. This work proposes an on-demand data replication method that can dynamically change the degree of replication to improve data survivability. Analytical results show improved data survivability with less storage consumptions than existing solutions in literature.	confidentiality;overhead (computing);replication (computing);sensor node;unavailability	Maytham M.

By utilizing channel dynamics together with the delay deadline and loss history, one can determine whether to transmit or not during each time slot, based on the prediction of future channel variations. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we model each sub-band as a discrete time Markov Chain using a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) and derive the criteria required for transmission decision.

47fb51082a6804a1e1e12f223c7c4fb9eb628ac8	on cycle based schedulers with time alternating priorities		The paper discusses new scheduling algorithms that are modifications of classical cycle based scheme, named the cycle based algorithm with time alternating priorities and time guard. The classical cycle based algorithm assumes that a given packet stream can be served only in predefined periods while it is not entitled to receive service in the periods dedicated to serve other packet streams. This property leads to non-work conserving behavior of the system and, as a consequence, rather poor packet transfer characteristics (expressed by packet delay and packet loss ratio in the case of system with a finite buffer). On the other hand, the important advantage of this algorithm is that it guarantees performance isolation among different packet streams. The proposed modification assumes that in the periods dedicated for service of a given packet stream the scheduler can also serve the packets belonging to other streams but with assigned lower priorities. In this way we transform the behavior of the cycle based algorithm to the form of nearly work conserving. In the paper we provide exemplary simulation results showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of packet delay characteristics and guarantees about performance isolation. Finally, we show the application of the studied scheme to the IIP System with virtualized network infrastructure requiring isolation among virtual links sharing a given link capacity.	algorithm;network packet;scheduling (computing);simulation	Wojtek Burakowski;Maciek Sosnowski	2017	2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215377	guard (information security);temporal isolation among virtual machines;time division multiple access;packet loss;computer network;rather poor;scheduling (computing);network packet;computer science;server	Metrics	2.3524931208553976	94.82118908028646	6033

However, some undesirable side effects of this mechanism, if not managed appropriately, can easily diminish its effectiveness in providing seamless inter-cell transitions during a handoff. We first examine these side effects and show how inappropriate buffer management by a mobility agent could affect the TCP performance. The throughput of TCP is then studied with special emphasis on the effects of a handoff. We enhance the conventional buffering-and-forwarding by proposing the last-come-first-drop (LCFD) buffer management policy (to be employed by mobility agents) and post-handoff acknowledgement suppression (to be used by mobile nodes). Our enhancements are backward compatible and suitable for the gradual/incremental deployment. By deriving an analytical model and conducting numerical analysis, we show that our scheme can improve the TCP throughput up to 30%. Finally, we conduct the ns-2 based simulation to confirm these numerical results, and demonstrate the applicability of the analytic model for predicting TCP throughput in other handoff schemes	backward compatibility;buffer overflow;data buffer;glossary of computer graphics;multicast;network congestion;network packet;norm (social);numerical analysis;retransmission (data networks);seamless3d;side effect (computer science);simulation;software deployment;tcp congestion control;throughput;timeout (computing);z-buffering;zero suppression	Chun-Ting Chou;Kang G.

By approximating the posterior distribution by a tree-structure factorization, the TEP has been proven to improve belief propagation (BP) decoding over the binary erasure channel (BEC). We show for the AWGN channel how the TEP decoder is also able to capture additional information disregarded by the BP solution, which leads to a noticeable reduction of the error rate for finite-length codes. We show that for the range of codes of interest, the TEP gain is obtained with a slight increase in complexity over that of the BP algorithm. An efficient way of constructing the tree-like structure is also described.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;backpropagation;battery eliminator circuit;belief propagation;binary erasure channel;code word;converge;error floor;expectation propagation;low-density parity-check code;software propagation;tree (data structure);tree structure;utility functions on indivisible goods;vii;waterfall model	Luis Salamanca;Juan José Murillo-Fuentes;Pablo M.

814a2ce387eadf58c85cb71c1cb2dc6c5d30bbeb	qos modeling and analysis in 5g backhaul networks		Huge efforts are being spent by industry and research institutes for the standardization and preparation of introducing 5G mobile networks that are required to serve user needs. Consequently, a new architecture for different applications is needed for solving the issues related to high data rate, capacity, reliability, and ensuring QoS. In addition, the 5G infrastructures shall provide tailored network solutions specialized to support vertical markets. For such applications, the QoS provided by the network can be critical, thus its analysis is inevitable. This paper presents a model to be applied in QoS analysis and to consider options for the flexibility which shall come with 5G. The model is developed to study the migration of backhaul architecture to 5G, and its effects on the fulfillment of QoS requirements. We performed a case study based on priority-aware queueing analysis, that shows some advantages and issues of this migration.

The incremental relaying exploits the feedback from the destination to inform the relay about the necessity to send the source signal, only when the direct path is not usable the destination will combine the two received signals by maximal ratio combiner (MRC) to enhance the reception of the signal. In this paper, the performance analysis in terms of the outage probability (OP) of the incremental relaying over mixed fading channels is provided for the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol and incorporates the effects of the multiple L interferers near the destination which in turn will degrade the overall performance of the system. Numerical results are provided to validate our derivations.	downtime;interference (communication);multipath propagation;relay	Mamoun F. Al-Mistarihi;Amer M.

This paper proposes a novel IGSO Constellation called OP-IGSO(Orthogonal orbit Plane IGSO) constellation to realize global communication satellite system. And then, the coverage and transmission performances of OP-IGSO global communication satellite constellation are simulated. The simulation results show that: the OP-IGSO constellation can reach higher multi-satellite coverage and higher communication elevation, the Doppler shift and Doppler shift rate of this constellation have little impact on the system. As global communication satellite constellation, the OP-IGSO is feasible.	communications satellite;doppler effect;eurion constellation;electronic counter-countermeasure;msat;operational amplifier;performance;radio jamming;shift jis;simulation	Yong Jiang;Gengxin Zhang;Zhiqiang Li;Zhidong Xie;Sen Yang	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM)	10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158313	meteorology;geography;geodesy;remote sensing	HPC	26.0927591861683	81.3960935665348	6169

Specifically, we propose and analyze two source-channel coding architectures, in which secrecy is achieved by multiplexing public and confidential messages. In both cases, our main contribution is to show that secrecy can be achieved without compromising communication rate and by requiring only randomness of asymptotically vanishing rate. Our first source-channel coding architecture relies on a modified wiretap channel code, in which randomization is performed using the output of a source code. In contrast, our second architecture relies on a standard wiretap code combined with a modified source code termed uniform compression code, in which a small shared secret seed is used to enhance the uniformity of the source code output. We carry out a detailed analysis of uniform compression codes and characterize the optimal size of the shared seed.	channel capacity;circuit complexity;code;confidentiality;forward error correction;multiplexing;randomness;shared secret;strong secrecy	Remi A.

We study the impact of different CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) between the local oscillator at the receiver and the local oscillator at each transmitter. We also propose receiver structures that are able to reduce the performance degradation caused by different CFO at different transmitters. Our receivers can be regarded as modified turbo equalizer, implemented in the frequency-domain, which jointly compensates for the frequency offset and equalizes the received signal. Our performance results show that we can have excellent performance even for strong values of CFO.	adobe framemaker;carrier frequency offset;elegant degradation;equalization (communications);local oscillator;multicast;single-frequency network;transmitter;turbo equalizer	Fábio Silva;Rui Dinis;Paulo Montezuma	2011	2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127731	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	HPC	46.93009010758716	80.23481271534573	6216

One of the most effective approaches to enhance the capacity of wireless networks is to use systems with multiple channels and multiple radio interfaces. However, most of the past works focus on vertex coloring of a general contention graph, which is NP-Complete, and use the greedy algorithm to achieve a suboptimal result. In this paper, we combine unicast and multicast with a transmission set, and propose a framework named Chordal Graph Based Channel Assignment (CGCA) that performs channel assignment for multicast and unicast traffic in multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks. The proposed framework based on chordal graph coloring minimizes the interference of the network and prevents unicast traffic from starvation. Simulation results show that our framework provides high throughput and low end-to-end delay for both multicast and unicast traffic. Furthermore, our framework significantly outperforms other well-known schemes that have a similar objective in various scenarios.	mesh networking;multicast;unicast;wireless mesh network	Junfeng Jin;Yusheng Ji;Baohua Zhao;Hao Zhou	2010	IEICE Transactions		wireless mesh network;multicast;telecommunications;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;chordal graph;xcast;computer network;unicast	Mobile	-3.5648477072653	83.30588185551362	6225

Today, modern networks like ATM and SDH/SONET do not only have to fulfill the demand of higher transmission rates but also have to provide and to guarantee data security and especially data confidentiality. Therefore, new or modified cryptographic modes of operation are required. These modes provoke an error propagation which has an impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of the network. The influences on an ATM network are examined for the CBC, Statistical Counter Mode, a new mode of operation and the ATM Counter Mode, which needs additional bandwidth for synchronization purposes.For SDH/SONET networks we suggest another mode of operation, called the Statistical Self-Synchronization, combining the advantages of the CFB and OFB mode. In synchronous networks it is the only mode that does not require additional bandwidth and is self-synchronizing with acceptable augmentation of error rates. The impact on the error performance is discussed and guidelines for adjusting selected cryptographic parameters are presented.	block cipher mode of operation;encryption	Oliver Jung;Sven Kuhn;Christoph Ruland;Kai Wollenweber	2001		10.1007/3-540-47719-5_28	synchronization;confidentiality;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Crypto	0.6048930418015167	103.28353935729749	6229

Typical routing protocols for DTNs depend on data replications over multiple paths for reliable data delivery. Since they invoke a lot of replicated packets, we propose three efficient Vector Routing protocols based on the vector of node movements in order to reduce the number of such replications: Flooding-based, History-based and Location-aware Vector Routing protocols. Using ns-2 simulation with two different mobility models, we verify that Vector Routing protocols show better performance than other existing protocols in terms of less amount of traffic incurred without loss of packet delivery ratio.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;dspace;end-to-end principle;global network;network packet;network partition;routing;simulation;waypoint	Hyunwoo Kang;Dongkyun Kim	2010	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2010.033824	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;path vector protocol;computer security;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	-2.364597350809354	76.48923703258548	6234

We change the scenario environment parameters, such as link delay, speed of User Equipment (UE) and interference traffic rate, to show how diverse services are affected. The results with respect to bandwidth, end-to-end delay, handoff latency, packet loss and delay jitter are presented to provide thorough investigation of UMTS under various services. Additionally, we discuss the impact of co-channel interference and compare the performance in the situation with and without interference. Based on the results from simulations, we have drawn conclusions that (i) end-to-end delay and handoff latency are proportional to link delay so that they are not severely influenced by different services for a high value of link delay, (ii) the number of packet loss is not directly related to link delays or UE's speed, (iii) UE's speed does not affect the performance obviously, (iv) co-channel interference exists in UMTS, and so on.	performance evaluation	Ling Luo;Jianjun Yang;Kangsheng Chen	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2005.09.005	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;network interface;end-to-end delay;interference;co-channel interference;transmission delay;packet loss;mobile computing;umts frequency bands;computer network	Metrics	1.9756235277298528	102.61051932582562	6262

Directional antennas, which are capable of forming multiple beams, can provide improved spacial reuse on one hand. On the other hand, through analyzing the contention scenarios listed for multi-hop wireless networks in previous works, we find that the contention method of single transmission could be scheduled to improve the performance on all-to-all broadcast. As it is possible to receive the broadcast for all the receivers in the beam footprint of transmission antennas array, the proposed method activates the nulled beams of some receivers or silent nodes which are covered by the radiation beam to receive more data packets. In this paper, based on a unified algorithm for time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) channel assignment that is referred as the UxDMA algorithm [1], a protocol for all-to-all broadcast is designed to make full use of that contention scheduling method. And to exploit the multi-beam forming capability, multi-beam antenna array (MBAA) is employed by all nodes. Simulations show that the proposed protocol outperforms the original UxDMA algorithm on all-to-all broadcast with not only decreasing the delay and the number of data packet transmissions but also making a better use of the multi-beam antenna.	algorithm;beamforming;broadcast radiation;computer simulation;frequency divider;network packet;scheduling (computing);transmitter	Peng Duan;Laixian Peng;Renhui Xu;Wendong Zhao;Chang Tian	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341333	broadcast radiation;electronic engineering;atomic broadcast;telecommunications;computer science;multi-frequency time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	32.56862431687304	76.66163592401547	6287
713b29f08d3bd7991780941f051c8853a43ebb83	a multi-criteria bs switching-off algorithm for 5g heterogeneous cellular networks with hybrid energy sources		In this paper, we study Base Station (BS) switching-off and offloading for next generation 5G heterogeneous (macro/femto) networks supplied with hybrid energy sources. This type of network will form the basis of the high-data rate energyefficient cellular networks in the years to come. A novel generalized multimetric algorithm is presented. Our proposal is conceived to operate in highly heterogeneous Radio Access Network (RAN) environments, as expected for 5G, where BSs with different characteristics of coverage, radio resources and power consumption coexist. The approach uses a set of metrics with a modifiable priority hierarchy in order to filter, sort and select the BS neighbors, which receive traffic during redistribution and offloading of the BSs to be put into sleep mode. In our analysis, we study the impact of BS power model trends for active, idle and sleep modes on the BS switching-off. We highlight how the continuous evolution of BS components and the introduction of renewable energy technologies play a significant role to be considered in the decision making. The multimetric approach proposed makes it possible to define and accomplish defined network performance goals by adding specific emphasis on aspects like QoS, energy savings or green equipment utilization.

For this, an exact probability density function of sum of squared magnitude of log-normal random variables and squared sum of log-normal random variables are used to derive analytical expressions for outage probability and average bit error rate (BER) of multiband OFDM UWB signal at the combiner output. For log-normal fading channel with constant power delay profile, our analysis exactly follows the numerical (Monte Carlo simulation) results. On the other hand, increasing the outage threshold severely effects the outage probability and thus leads to deterioration of system performance. It is observed that among the combining techniques usually used in the receiver, particularly, equal gain combining (EGC) technique gives better BER performance (1.2dB at target BER of 10-6) compared to maximal ratio combining (MRC).	bit error rate;diplexer;downtime;eb-eye;eb/n0;frequency divider;mrc (file format);maximal set;monte carlo method;multiplexing;numerical analysis;power dividers and directional couplers;quantum fluctuation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;ultra-wideband;x.690	Sai Krishna Kondoju;V.

However, examination of each link separately in a manner that incorporates interaction with the rest of the network permits us to take advantage of the wireless nature of the network and obtain a three-flow characterization of each link, which also satisfies a product-form solution and is hence termed a “miniproduct-form” solution. By matching the values of these flows, which are natural to the wireless network, to the average values obtained from the product-form solution of the entire network, we obtain a three-dimensional Markov chain characterization of the voice occupancy state on the link, which permits a simpler evaluation of data-packet delay. A further reduction is possible by converting the three-dimensional chain to a single-dimensional one.	3d modeling;approximation algorithm;markov chain;mathematical model;network packet	Jeffrey E.

This penalty is studied from different perspectives. In particular, it is shown that the average penalty of asymmetric fix-free codes is less than 0.21 bit per symbol. Moreover, it is proved that when the source alphabet size is sufficiently large, for almost all sources, the penalty is less than or equal to 0.182 bit per symbol. Regarding symmetric fix-free codes, it is shown that the average penalty tends to infinity as the source alphabet size increases.	prefix code	Sayed Jalal Zahabi;Mohammadali Khosravifard	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2417173	database index;entropy;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;redundancy;upper and lower bounds;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Theory	37.65627916504433	61.3843029150486	6365

In practice, however, stations typically use different transmission rates. This is done to match to the changing channel conditions. Stations with poor channel conditions typically employ lower transmit rates in comparison to stations with better channel conditions. Under such scenarios, the throughput of each station becomes independent of its own transmit rate; rather it gets bounded by the slowest transmitting peer. This has been popularly classified as the performance anomaly problem. This paper provides a simple yet accurate analytical framework to study the link delay characteristics of such multi-rate networks	anomaly detection;design rule for camera file system;performance evaluation;throughput;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter	Tarun Joshi;Anindo Mukherjee;Dharma P.

7d84ee3a66b8139b1b4254dffa522cff6eeeb22a	a new distributed localization algorithm using social learning based particle swarm optimization for internet of things		Emerging applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) will depend on the accurate location of thousands of deployed sensors. However, accurate localization of deployed sensors nodes is a classical optimization problem which falls under NP-hard class of problems. Therefore in this work, we propose a new distributed localization algorithm using social learning based particle swarm optimization (SL-PSO) for IoT. With SL-PSO algorithm, we aim to do precise localization of deployed sensor nodes and reduce the computational complexity which will further enhance the lifetime of these resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes. Extensive simulations are carried out to show the effective performance of the SL-PSO algorithm in accurate localization. Experimental results depict that SL-PSO algorithm can not only increase convergence rate but also significantly reduce average localization error compared to traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) and its other variants.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;converge;global optimization;internet of things;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;rate of convergence;sl (complexity);sensor	Ashish Rauniyar;Paal E.

The results obtained in those experiments evidence that lots of factors influence wireless communications: small obstacles like trees, small moving obstacles like cars, or large obstructions like buildings. All of them affect the transmission range, reducing the communication possibilities. Based on the insight provided by these results, in this work we propose a propagation model that attempts to replicate all these effects in simulation in order to increase the accuracy of experiments. Our solution combines (i) an attenuation model that replicates transmission range and fading behavior of real 802.11p devices, both in line-of-sight conditions and when obstructed by small obstacles, and (ii) a visibility model to deal with large architectonic obstacles, such as buildings. Our model was evaluated using the OMNeT++ platform, and results show that having the exact building positions and shapes is a critical parameter, introducing performance differences of up to 50% compared to simpler models.	experiment;line-of-sight (missile);self-replicating machine;simulation;software propagation;testbed	Miguel Baguena;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano;Pietro Manzoni	2012	2012 IFIP Wireless Days	10.1109/WD.2012.6402805	vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;geography;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	24.549007677443242	78.45326150639622	6422

As a consequence, signal’s energy is additionally consumed to overcome the influence incurred by the shadow fading. This situation leads to the unpredictable communication environment in practical application. However, most topology control algorithms ignore the additional energy consumption in the process of appraising links’ communication quality. The topologies based on the ideal signal attenuation model are too ideal to meet the requirements of practical application. In order to obtain a more practical description of the real environment, we structure a new model named path–obstacle–remove model. This model aims at erasing the influence of shadow fading. Thus, it transforms the additional attenuation energy into logic distance between nodes. Besides, considering that the excessive energy consumption of lower-energy nodes restricts the network lifetime, a distributed, energy-aware topology control algorithm based on path–obstacle–remove model (EAPOR) is proposed in this paper. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the topology constructed by EAPOR is connected and bi-directional. Besides, EAPOR can easily construct the topology with a low message complexity of O(n). The simulation result shows that EAPOR has good performance on robustness and sparseness. Moreover, EAPOR reduces the end-to-end delay and prolongs the network lifetime significantly.	algorithm;angular defect;bi-directional text;end-to-end principle;neural coding;requirement;simulation;software propagation;topology control	Xiao-Chen Hao;Min-Jie Xin;Xiao-Yue Ru	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-2034-2	real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network;logical topology	Networks	8.664894284909291	83.21415513651219	6439
b126991002f6e1f241f39052383ba58a2c27d108	tars: a traffic-adaptive receiver-synchronized mac protocol for underwater sensor networks		Efficient medium access control (MAC) is desirable for underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). However, designing an efficient underwater MAC protocol is challenging due to the long propagation delay of the underwater acoustic channel and spatial-temporal uncertainty. In this article, we propose a novel Traffic-Adaptive Receiver-Synchronized underwater MAC protocol, TARS, for throughput maximization. We divide time into equal-sized slots, each the size of one packet transmission time plus a guard time to cope with network dynamics. We adjust the packet transmission phase in a slot, determined by the sender-receiver distance, to align packet receptions for collision reduction. Both the sound propagation speed variation and the node mobility are considered in setting the transmission phase and slot size. We employ a queue-aware utility-optimization framework to determine the optimal transmission strategies dynamically, taking into account both the interference and data queue status. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the existing representative protocols, TARS achieves better performance with higher network throughput and lower packet delay (e.g., about 13%−146% higher in throughput and 13%−21% lower in delay than others in a mobile ad hoc network), as well as robustness under network mobility. Thus, TARS is highly suitable for mobile and traffic-varying UWSNs.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;align (company);expectation–maximization algorithm;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network packet;propagation delay;proxy mobile ipv6;queue (abstract data type);random access;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Yu Han;Yunsi Fei	2015	2015 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	10.1145/3105149	propagation delay;synchronization;throughput;real-time computing;uncertainty;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.113426739234047	90.6284486940835	6440

However due to the wide variation of sensor network applications and the constraints on hardware/software, existing protocols may only serve a specific sensor network application well or may be difficult to implement on real sensor nodes. In this paper, self-organized TDMA protocol (SOTP) for wireless sensor networks is presented. SOTP applies a cross layer protocol design approach to serve the application-specific and data-centric nature of wireless sensor networks. A TDMA based MAC scheme is used together with combining routing information during time slot allocation. This cross layer combination also helps to simplify node design and achieve energy efficiency. Several techniques are used in order to achieve collision-free slot allocation in a multi-hop network environment. Firstly, in the network set-up phase, a """"carrier sensing"""" slot is introduced for channel contention, which prevents collision in data transmission slots. Secondly, although in SOTP sensor nodes are organized in an ad-hoc manner, the time slot allocation is determined centrally so that the collision-free state is adaptive to network topology changes. During the self-organization period, reverse scheduling is applied in slot allocation to reduce transmission delay. Simulation results show that SOTP can outperform the LEACH protocol with energy savings of up to 70%"""	communications protocol;hoc (programming language);network topology;routing;scheduling (computing);self-organization;simulation	Yu Wang;Ian D.

However, when it comes to PU's secrecy capacity, the transmitting power may be either harmful or beneficial. On one hand, the attendance of SUs in the CR network can be threatened to PU's main channel and decreases PU's secrecy capacity. On the other hand, the signals transmitted by SUs can also decrease the wire-tap channel capacity, and therefore improves PU's secrecy capacity. In order to find the tradeoff, by modeling this scenario as a coalition formation game, we apply the “merge” and “split” algorithm to select the appropriate SUs which are beneficial to PU's secrecy capacity. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios.	algorithm;beamforming;channel capacity;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);one-class classification;phy (chip);simulation;transmitter	Hang Zhang;Tianyu Wang;Lingyang Song;Zhu Han	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677285	telecommunications;engineering;communication;computer security	Mobile	35.08246465140891	84.12638636298054	6458

Previous network coding schemes proposed for unicast transmissions focus on scheduling where paths are already established, and assume a fixed rate for all links, neglecting link rate heterogeneity. In this paper we study a network coding based pseudo bidirectional relay scheme for wireless LAN, taking link quality into account. We first show when network coding based relay improves channel efficiency and how to select such a relay in a distributed way. Then we enhance network coding based transmissions from three aspects: (i) Coordinated rate adaptation is adopted to reduce the probability with which a priori packet is missing in times of network decoding. (ii) The retransmission scheduling completely solves the lack-of-a-priori problem. (iii) Piggybacking receiving status in ACK/NAK further enables opportunistic reception and avoids unnecessary transmissions. Simulation results confirm that compared with direct transmissions, the proposed relay scheme can reduce per-packet transmission time by up to 39% in Rayleigh fading environment.	acknowledgement (data networks);effective method;linear network coding;network packet;piggybacking (internet access);rayleigh fading;relay;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;unicast	Suhua Tang;Hiroyuki Yomo;Mehdad N.

The equalization systems are designed by jointly optimizing the forward and backward filters based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. The equivalence of block iterative TD and FD equalization with decision feedback is established by analytically showing that the same mean square error (MSE) is achieved by the two systems. Asymptotic performance of the studied block iterative FD equalization scheme is analyzed, and the rate-diversity tradeoffs of space time / frequency coded MIMO SC-FDE and MIMO OFDM are compared.	adobe framemaker;coefficient;iteration;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;time series;turing completeness	Gökhan Muzaffer Güvensen;Ali Özgür Yilmaz	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6139742	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics	Embedded	47.930392383436164	78.28509387993729	6473

Therefore, an incentive mechanism must be in place. We adopt the """"pay for service"""" model of cooperation, and propose an auction-based incentive scheme (called iPass) to enable cooperative packet forwarding behavior in MANET. Each flow pays the market price of packet forwarding service to the intermediate routers. The resource allocation mechanism in our scheme is based on the generalized Vickrey auction with reserve pricing. We prove that in our scheme, user's truthful bidding of utility remains a dominant strategy, users and routers have incentive to participate in the scheme, and packet forwarding always leads to higher social welfare for the whole network. We design a signaling protocol to implement the scheme, and show that it can serve as an explicit rate-based flow control mechanism for the network. Therefore, iPass is a joint solution of incentive engineering and flow control in a noncooperative MANET. Simulation results show that iPass is able to determine the auction outcome quickly, and at the same time achieve the goals of flow control."""	auction algorithm;fairness measure;flow control (data);hoc (programming language);network packet;real-time bidding;router (computing);secure mobile payment service;signaling protocol;simulation	Kai Chen;Klara Nahrstedt	2004	24th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, 2004.

Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes an interesting, yet challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibres (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution as compared to OF, it supports lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution that may combine both a high data rate and a relatively low cost is the free-space optics (FSO). FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions (e.g., rain, fog, line-ofsight, etc.). A more reliable alternative is, therefore, to combine RF and FSO solutions through a hybrid structure called hybrid RF/FSO. Consider a backhaul network, where the base-stations (BS) can be connected to each other either via OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links. The paper addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of backhaul planning under connectivity and data rates constraints, so as to choose the appropriate costeffective backhaul type between BSs (i.e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO). The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by introducing the corresponding planning graph. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance, especially for practical prices of the hybrid RF/FSO.	approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);clique (graph theory);clique problem;cost efficiency;distance fog;graph theory;network planning and design;optical fiber;rf modulator;radio frequency;requirement;simulation;software deployment;transceiver;uncompressed video	Ahmed Douik;Hayssam Dahrouj;Tareq Y.

In this paper, we study the optimization of the mapping of the coded bits to the modulation bits for a polarization-multiplexed fiber-optical system without optical inline dispersion compensation. Our focus is on protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which allow for an efficient hardware implementation, suitable for high-speed optical communications. The optimization is applied to the ARJ4A protograph family, and further extended to protograph-based spatially coupled LDPC codes assuming a windowed decoder. Full field simulations via the split-step Fourier method are used to verify the analysis. The results show performance gains of up to 0.25 dB, which translate into a possible extension of the transmission reach by roughly up to 8%, without significantly increasing the system complexity.	forward error correction	Christian Häger;Alexandre Graell i Amat;Fredrik Brannstrom;Alex Alvarado;Erik Agrell	2014	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	NLP	44.09524515322278	63.69680678595519	6541

Even though the jammer has been located inside a car and the highly directional antenna was pointing towards the sky at a high elevation angle, the measured path loss of the jamming signal as received by the ground station antenna was much lower than expected by common models. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of satellite downlinks with respect to even portable or hidden jammers located at far distance from the earth station under attack.		Christian A.

Fault tolerance is built by linking a LAN to two bridge ports located on two different processing elements, respectively. Two load-partitioning schemes are developed to prevent multiple copies of an arriving frame. A static partitioning scheme requires little hardware or software augmentation. However, the load may not be balanced due to non-uniform traffic patterns. On the other hand, a dynamic partitioning scheme can offer dynamic load balancing, although it requires mechanisms to monitor the traffic and to synchronize inter-processor communication. The bridge performance in terms of frame response time is evaluated through simulation. In the simulation, the impact of the two partitioning schemes on bridge performance are compared. Finally interprocessor synchronization cost is analyzed. >	bridging (networking);fault tolerance;load balancing (computing)	Tsang-Ling Sheu	1991		10.1109/LCN.1991.208061	local area network;embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;index term;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	HPC	-3.2526589998366324	68.72509605099035	6571

Since sensor readings in WSNs are highly correlated and are suitable to be transformed in DCT domain, in each cluster in the network the sensory data is transformed and only a small number of large DCT coefficients are sent from the cluster-head (CH) to the base-station (BS) directly or in multi-hop routing. All data from the network can be recovered based on the transformed large coefficients at the BS. Based on stochastic problems, we analyze and formulate the communication cost as the power consumption for transmitting data in such networks. Some common clustering algorithms are applied and compared to analysis results. Both noise and noiseless environments for this method are considered.	algorithm;cluster analysis;coefficient;coupled cluster;data compression;discrete cosine transform;image noise;routing;signal reconstruction;simulation;transmitter	Minh Tuan Nguyen;Keith A.

1b48316e30c3582ac60ff52ca40a5c81188fec80	on the performance of 5g flexible tdd systems with coordinated beamforming		5G systems are expected to utilize flexible time division duplex (TDD) to cater for instantaneous user traffic demands. 5G systems are also expected to benefit from user-specific beamforming using massive MIMO deployment. In this paper we study the performance of flexible TDD system with massive MIMO deployment and inter-cell coordination. We propose a centralized scheduling approach, where joint user scheduling and beamforming is performed taking into account interference cancellation receivers. Simulations results are shown in a multi-site scenario with multiple panels at each site. Results show that flexible TDD with per site standalone scheduling provides a significant 175% median uplink throughput gain over a fixed UL/DL TDD split. Advanced inter-site coordination based on IC receivers is seen to further improve uplink and downlink median throughput by around 85% and 65% respectively as compared to intra-site standalone scheduling.

The performance of the autocorrelation based method is quite poor, while the channel knowledge based method is too complex for hardware real-time implementation. To provide improved tradeoffs between the performance and complexity, we propose a new hybrid algorithm that filters away unlikely integer CFO candidates with the autocorrelation method and determines the most likely estimate with channel knowledge. The analytical performance of the proposed hybrid method agrees with the simulation results and both demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the method even in challenging wireless channel conditions.	autocorrelation;carrier frequency offset;floor and ceiling functions;hybrid algorithm;multiplexing;real-time transcription;simulation;subcarrier;the australian	Ming Ruan;Mark C.

In the proposed scheme the process of grouping sensors into clusters reference nodes is based on a K-means clustering algorithm to divide the initial population and select the best position in the neighbourhood to exchange information between clusters. In cases when sensor nodes receive multiple synchronization messages from more than one reference node a weighted average method is used. In this paper we limit our research on a number of benchmark functions which are used to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other important meta-heuristic algorithms to show its superiority.

The idea of the scheme comes from the investigation of the internal and external root causes of the clock drift between two nodes--we have identified the causes and proposed a means for its estimation. Based on the prediction of the drift between any pair of nodes, we are able to determine the instant at which a node needs to wake up after desynchronization, thus reducing its energy consumption and the rejoin latency. We compare the proposed scheme with other state-of-the-art proposals through experiments on different hardware platforms. The experimental results show that desynchronized nodes rejoin up to 34 times faster and consume less energy by a factor of 1000 compared to the other proposals.	clock drift;experiment;timer	Timothy Claeys;Franck Rousseau;Bernard Tourancheau;Andrzej Duda	2017	2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038401	latency (engineering);computer science;energy consumption;synchronization;distributed computing;clock drift;real-time computing;instant;schedule	Vision	10.206956391361999	84.33780358588596	6716

Rician flat fading is assumed for the satellite channel (no multipath). Because it is asynchronous between the transmission and receiver in wireless ATM networks, it is most important to focus on the demodulator design. The parameters for the Bayesian demodulator are determined using an unsupervised (blind) clustering method - fuzzy c-means (FCM). Our simulation results show that our demodulator performs better than the block phase estimation demodulator in terms of uncoded bit error rate (BER) with a gain of 0.2 to 0.3 dB.	atm turbo	Qilian Liang	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1204004	telecommunications;rician fading;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;demodulation;time division multiple access;communications satellite;computer network	Mobile	45.15802228658518	75.51930286162911	6731

In this paper, we examine the problem of scheduling routing table updates in link state routing protocols. Commercial routers typically use a hold time based scheme to limit the number of routing table updates as new LSAs arrive at the router. The hold time schemes limit the number of routing table updates at the expense of increased delay in convergence to the new topology, which is clearly not acceptable any more. We analyze the performance of different hold time schemes and propose a new approach to schedule routing table updates, called LSA Correlation. Rather than using individual LSAs as triggers for routing table updates, LSA Correlation scheme correlates the information in the LSAs to identify the topology change that led to their generation. A routing table update is performed when a topology change has been identified. The analysis and simulation results presented in this paper suggest that the LSA Correlation scheme performs much better than the hold time based schemes for both isolated and large scale topology change scenarios.	flip-flop (electronics);link-state routing protocol;overhead (computing);router (computing);routing table;scheduling (computing);simulation	Mukul Goyal;Weigao Xie;Mohd Soperi;Seyed Hossein Hosseini;K.

It is hard to underestimate the potential of this technology to the future of wireless networks, including wireless telephony. MANET is an attractive concept particularly due to the robustness of the infrastructure even under disaster situations.Yet, MANETs are not mature and a plethora of problems remain open --- efficient routing is one of the problems requiring more research effort. A few solutions have been proposed but thus far there is no consensus about their usefulness in real world scenarios. This paper briefly looks at the existing routing algorithms and discusses why clustering is advantageous in a MANET setting; it discusses how clustering nodes in a MANET can potentially facilitate routing. This paper also discusses how the population social structure is used as a motivation for a clustering of node in MANETs and how the clustering may improve routing in these networks.	algorithm;cluster analysis;hoc (programming language);routing;social structure	Paresh Dhakan;Ronaldo Menezes	2005		10.1145/1167253.1167268	vehicular ad hoc network;policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;geography;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	0.6744758305393663	83.77629693694034	6734

The proposed method consists in ordering in terms of fading impact, grouping a certain number of subcarriers and performing local power adaptation in each subcarrier group. The subcarrier grouping is performed in order to equalize the average channel condition of each subcarrier group. Grouping and local power adaptation allow us to take advantage of the channel variations and to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed power distribution scheme, while avoiding the performance degradation due to the suboptimum power adaptation as much as possible. Compared to the conventional power distribution methods, the proposed scheme does not require any iterative process and the power adaptation is directly performed using an analytical formula. Simulations show a gain in terms of BER performance compared to equal power distribution and existing algorithms for power distribution. In addition, due to the subcarrier group specificity, the trade-off between the computational complexity and the performance can be controlled by adjusting the size of the subcarrier groups. Simulation results show significant improvement of BER performance compared to equal power allocation. key words: OFDM, adaptive modulation, Lagrangian method, global BER optimization	adaptive filter;algorithm;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;elegant degradation;heuristic evaluation;iterative method;mathematical optimization;modulation;sensitivity and specificity;subcarrier;x.690;xslt/muenchian grouping	Wladimir Bocquet;Kazunori Hayashi;Hideaki Sakai	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.12.3974	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	HPC	49.99964233700787	83.10382302727137	6745

This paper presents a novel technique to provision QoS guarantee in CRNs by modeling the resultant channel of multiple primary networks and finding the optimum number of primary channels to support a desired level of expected latency. In doing so, this paper introduces a cognitive radio based MAC, which can effectively co-exists with primary CSMA/CA networks by accurately estimating the start of the spectrum holes, reliably modeling channel occupation by the primary users, and using event-driven sensing to adaptively control the sensing frequency and interval. Simulation results with ns-2.33 reveal that a CR network based on the proposed MAC can achieve the targeted service delay time by appropriately selecting optimal WLAN primary channels.	cognitive radio;event-driven programming;norm (social);provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;resultant;simulation	Rashidul Hasan;M.

At the lower layer, an efficient bandwidth allocation method and a constant time cell scheduling algorithm are provided in each network node. These mechanisms have the capability of multiplexing traffics and satisfying diverse delay and loss performance requirements. At the higher layer, a three-phase connection establishment procedure is applied. It transforms the end-to-end performance requirement of a connection request into local requirements for each intermediate node of a routing path. If the requirements for each intermediate node can be satisfied, the connection is accepted; otherwise, another routing path will be examined. Without resort to any complicated rate control inside the network, in our system, time distances between successive cells while they are passing through the network are maintained by imposing an upper bound on the end-to-end queueing delay of each cell. Simulation results show that the connection establishment overhead of our system is almost independent of the traffic load of the network. Its value is very small so that the proposed framework is feasible in the future ATM networks. Besides, optimally transforming end-to-end performance requirement into those for each intermediate node to maximize the saturation load of the network has been proved to be an NP-Hard problem.

When a prompt response for data processing and offloading is necessary, i.e. in the case of event-driven networks, a mobile flying sink could be a good option for that role. In this paper, we introduce FreeFall, a distributed algorithm for the autonomous navigation of a mobile collector through a WSN for on-demand data offloading that does not rely on an absolute coordinate system. We show that, under fairly common circumstances, it is possible to set the trajectory of the mobile sink and fulfill the offloading requests without the needs of additional equipment installed on nodes.We show how our system is preferable over more classical routing solutions especially in the presence of localized generation of large amounts of information.	autonomous robot;distributed algorithm;event-driven programming;global positioning system;routing	Nicola Roberto Zema;Nathalie Mitton;Giuseppe Ruggeri	2014	2014 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2014.7020847	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;small cell;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	9.137865044502473	78.03200110659128	6806

A multimedia connection consists of several substreams (i.e., service classes), each of which presets a range of feasible QoS levels (e.g., data rates). The proposed algorithm is mainly devoted to finding the best possible QoS levels for all the connections (i.e., QoS vector) that maximize resource utilization by fairly distributing wireless resources among the connections while maximizing the statistical multiplexing gain (i.e., minimizing the blocking and dropping probabilities). In the case of congestion (overload), the algorithm uniformly degrades the QoS levels of the existing connections (but only slightly) in order to spare some resources for serving new or handoff connections, thereby naturally minimizing the blocking and dropping probabilities (it amounts to maximizing the statistical multiplexing gain). The algorithm employs a Hopfield neural network (HNN) for finding a QoS vector. The problem itself is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Hardware-based HNN exhibits high (computational) speed that permits real time running of the CAC algorithm. Simulation results show that the algorithm can maximize resource utilization and maintain fairness in resource sharing, while maximizing the statistical multiplexing gain in providing acceptable service grades. Furthermore, the results are relatively insensitive to handoff rates.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bandwidth (signal processing);blocking (computing);coefficient;common access card;fairness measure;hopfield network;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;multiplexing;network congestion;neuron;optimization problem;provisioning;quality of service;real-time transcription;simulation;social inequality	Chang Wook Ahn;Rudrapatna S.

In our system the source-relay channels are massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ones and the relay-destination channels are massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) ones. Large random matrix theory (RMT) is used to derive a deterministic equivalent of the signalto- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each user in massive MIMO amplify-forward and decode-forward (M-MIMO-ADF) relaying with regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding, as the number of transmit antennas and users M,K→∞ and M≫K. Simulation results show that the deterministic equivalent of the SINR at each user in M-MIMO-ADF relaying and the results of Theorem 1, Theorem 2 are accurate.	channel (communications);channel state information;interference (communication);mimo;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;system analysis;transmitter;virtual economy	Yang Liu;Zhiguo Ding;Jia Shi;Weiwei Yang;Ping Zhong	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417840	channel state information;mimo;electronic engineering;precoding;transmitter;computer science;interference (wave propagation);relay;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Mobile	37.277916015004024	82.07692461860144	6927
3917f40fca2e94ae14139cd709f06ca7de8a5cb6	agreement-based interference-aware dynamic channel allocation in cognitive radio network (crn)		Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) is an intelligent wireless communication network that senses its environment to adjust the transmitter parameters in order to exploit the unused portions of available spectrum. The objective here is to ensure reliable communication with minimum intereference to Primary Users (PUs) and efficient spectrum utilization. The spectrum assigned to licensed users is underutilized and the growing demand causes starvation to the unlicensed users. Thus, CRN senses the available spectrum to find the most appropriate spectrum for allocation. Further, to maximize the efficient use of available spectrum, agreement (consensus) may be used wherein all users agree on a common decision value. In the paper, we discuss various techniques of spectrum allocation in CRN. Lastly, we propose an interference-aware protocol that achieves load balancing, high throughput and less number of reallocations to maximize spectrum utilization. Also, the paper validates the proposed algorithm using the simulation results.

Specifically, we consider a common scenario for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) where the primary and secondary networks operate at the same time and space and share the spectrum. On this basis, we integrate a social relationship into the CRN where each source node selects its destination upon a rank-based model, which captures the social characteristic well. By applying a cellular time-division multiple-access scheduling scheme, we first characterize the distinct traffic pattern caused by the social relationships between nodes. Then, we derive the achievable throughput and delay for both primary and secondary networks under the new network setting. In addition, we also study the cognitive social networks with infrastructure where I = o1(n) base stations are regularly deployed within the primary network. Given a probabilistic routing strategy, throughput of the proposed network is recalculated. Particularly, due to the social relationships between nodes, we reveal that a larger I is required if we expect a significant capacity gain within the primary network compared with previous works.	cognitive radio;routing;scheduling (computing);social network;throughput	Riheng Jia;Kechen Zheng;Jinbei Zhang;Luoyi Fu;Pengyuan Du;Xinbing Wang;Jun Xu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2338294	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;cognitive radio;channel access method;cognitive network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	14.993929077145193	91.15840871796638	6933

We assume a finite population model and the saturated traffic condition where every terminal always has a packet to transmit. To show the general impacts of the EB algorithm's parameters on the system performance, we consider two MPR channels. In the first channel, all the packets transmitted cannot be successfully received, if the number of packets simultaneously transmitted exceeds a predefined threshold. In the second one, some of packets concurrently transmitted can be probabilistically received (captured). In numerical studies, we show how to adjust the parameters of EB algorithm given the MPR channel in order to achieve close-to-maximal system throughput, and discuss fair channel use.	channel use;exponential backoff;fairness measure;genetic algorithm;maximal set;minkowski portal refinement;network packet;numerical analysis;numerical method;performance;population model;throughput;time complexity	Jun-Bae Seo;Victor C.

A simulator was produced to extract conclusions about blocking and handover failure probabilities in a multi-service bursty traffic context. Simulations, were performed for different cases, from single- to multi-service situations, and from absence to presence of mobility. Besides quality of service results in the air interface, including blocking and handover failure probabilities, the simulator allows for extracting conclusions about the validation of the Bernoulli-Poisson-Pascal model for the computation of the on/off blocking probability, the ratio between the number of call rejected at the beginning of an on period and the total number of bursts generated during a session. In the single-service case, the theoretical and the experimental values of on/off blocking probability are close to each other, and there is an almost perfect concordance between theoretical and simulation values when the average sojourn time in cells is equal to the average holding time. In the multi-service case, the behaviour is not exactly the same but a coherent behaviour is achieved for an average traffic per user up to 0.10 Erl.	bernoulli polynomials;blocking (computing);coherence (physics);computation;computer simulation;concordance (publishing);ergodic theory;erlang (unit);quality of service	Jesús M.

Out-of sequence packets indicate that the connection suffers from loss, duplication or reordering. More generally, in many distributed applications information integrity requires that data exchanges between different nodes of a system be performed in a specific order. However, due to random delays over different paths in a system, the packets may arrive at the receiver in a different order than their chronological order. In such a case, a resequencing buffer at the receiver has to store disordered packets temporarily. We analyze both the waiting time of a packet in the resequencing buffer and the size of this resequencing queue. We derive the exact asymptotics for the large deviation of these quantities under heavy-tailed assumptions. In contrast with results obtained for light-tailed distributions, we show that there exists several “typical paths” that lead to the large deviation. We derive explicitly these different “typical paths” and give heuristic rules for an optimal balancing.	approximation algorithm;complex network;distributed computing;duplicate code;emoticon;expanded memory;heuristic;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);network packet;network switch;network topology;nick mckeown;routing;stationary process;throughput	Marc Lelarge	2008	Math.

Signal fluctuation makes difficult and imprecise the trilateration of the user location, so we propose the use of fuzzy techniques to deal with such imprecision. To implement the location system, deterministic wireless channel characterisation is obtained by means of in–house implemented 3D ray launching code. Several scenarios are analysed, since their size strongly impacts on algorithm convergence. The limitations and solution, based on subdivision of the scenario in sub–zones, are analysed and applied to the case of a new emergency hospital complex in Navarra. Simulation and measurement results are presented showing good agreement. The results can aid in the determination of an optimised WiFi–based location system providing efficient positioning and communication services in complex indoor scenarios.

The basic idea of the proposed preprocessing is to introduce a good choice of upper bound for the BB search tree and/or reduce the search space of the BB problem. Performance and complexity computations of these preprocessing are investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed preprocessing when applied prior to BB provides optimal or near optimal performance with a significantly reduced computational complexity.	algorithm;branch and bound;combinatorial optimization;computation;computational complexity theory;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;preprocessor;quadratic programming;search tree;simulation	Ali A.

bb6206f6b91db11e922f414ca9f94fd7253630ec	actor-oriented modeling und simulation of cut-through communication in network controllers		In many networked embedded systems, crucial factors for correct functionality are the network’s real-time capability, determinism, and reliability. Besides these requirements, a high network performance in terms of throughput and latency is desired. One of the applied techniques to improve performance is cut-through communication. It allows to forward messages as soon as the packet header is processed, decreasing latency in the controller and, hence, increasing throughput of the overall network. This technique, however, is not directly supported by state-of-the-art ESL actor-oriented modeling approaches. These and their underlying formal models typically rely on FIFO-based communication which corresponds to a storeand-forward communication paradigm. In this paper, we propose and evaluate approaches to extend actor-oriented modeling and simulation to consider cut-through communication in network controllers. Based on the Ethernet variant PROFINET from the industrial automation domain, we evaluate the proposed techniques regarding modeling effort and accuracy compared to standard store-and-forward modeling.	approximation;automation;blocking (computing);embedded system;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);high- and low-level;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;network interface controller;network packet;network performance;online and offline;programming paradigm;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;store and forward;throughput	Liyuan Zhang;Michael Glaß;Martin Streubühr;Jürgen Teich;Andreas von Schwerin;Kai Liu	2012			simulation;network traffic simulation;computer science;control engineering	Embedded	-2.4908451162038965	64.17589793483734	6970

In this paper, we study the impact of such LRD data traffic on the statistical characteristics of multi-access interference (MAI) and signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a code division multiple access (CDMA) network. Through analysis and simulation, we show that the time-scaled MAI and SINR have slow decaying tail distributions due to the LRD data traffic. As a result, the outage probability is larger for data users than that for voice users. To improve the performance of the CDMA network in the presence of LRD data traffic, we propose a variable period prediction scheme to predict MAI or the equivalent number of active users. We show that the proposed variable period prediction is not only more accurate for data users but also less memory-consuming than existing fixed period prediction. In addition, rate control based on variable period prediction can achieve lower outage probability and higher throughput for data users than that based on fixed period prediction	autocorrelation;downtime;gene prediction;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);internet;next-generation network;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Xiang Yu;Chunming Qiao;Xin Wang;Dahai Xu	2006	2006 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks(WoWMoM'06)	10.1109/WOWMOM.2006.85	cellular network;code division multiple access;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;probability;statistics;computer network	Metrics	4.172364746980769	98.94440963724924	6978

However, to take full advantages of their services, these UAVs must be able to communicate efficiently with each other using UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication and with existing networking infrastructures using UAV-to-Infrastructure (U2I) communication. In this paper, we identify the functions, services and requirements of UAV-based communication systems. We also present networking architectures, underlying frameworks, and data traffic requirements in these systems as well as outline the various protocols and technologies that can be used at different UAV communication links and networking layers. In addition, the paper discusses middleware layer services that can be provided in order to provide seamless communication and support heterogeneous network interfaces. Furthermore, we discuss a new important area of research, which involves the use of UAVs in collecting data from wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We discuss and evaluate several approaches that can be used to collect data from different types of WSNs including topologies such as linear sensor networks (LSNs), geometric and clustered WSNs. We outline the benefits of using UAVs for this function, which include significantly decreasing sensor node energy consumption, lower interference, and offers considerably increased flexibility in controlling the density of the deployed nodes since the need for the multihop approach for sensor-tosink communication is either eliminated or significantly reduced. Consequently, UAVs can provide good connectivity to WSN clusters.	aerial photography;interference (communication);middleware;on-board data handling;requirement;seamless3d;sensor node;unmanned aerial vehicle	Imad Jawhar;Nader Mohamed;Jameela Al-Jaroodi;Dharma P.

Two-layer ECC employs simple rectangular codes for each cache line to detect error, while loading extra Hamming product codes check bits in the case of error detection; thus enabling process and supply voltage variation-tolerant cache design. Our analysis and experimental results shows that compared to complex 4-way 4EC5ED, two-layer ECC can increase Mean-Error-To-Failure by more than 2×, improve reliability by two order of magnitude under process variation, and reduce residual failure rate by one order of magnitude under supply voltage variation. Compared to simple 8-way SECDED, two-layer ECC shows a 28x-133x improvement in METF, and residual failure rate are improved furthermore.	error detection and correction;failure rate;hamming code;parity bit;window function	Meilin Zhang;Paul Ampadu	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)	10.1109/DFT.2013.6653600	concatenated error correction code;turbo code;failure analysis;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;reliability;linear code;hamming code;forward error correction;very-large-scale integration;error floor;statistics	Arch	8.330070904822215	60.75023850490287	7013

In addition, the optimal inter-symbol power allocation in the proposed codes in single modulation as well as in MMSs in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels is examined. It turns out that, in some modulation schemes, equal power transmission per each symbol time slot is not only optimal from the technical point of view, but also optimal in terms of achieving the best symbol error probability. The principles examining the MMSs in order to increase the rate of space-time block codes (STBCs) and the optimal power allocation for multi-modulated STBCs mentioned here can be generalized for STBCs of other orders without any difficulty.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;code;modulation;point of view (computer hardware company)	Le Chung Tran;Tadeusz A.

This style of interaction is imperative in ad hoc mobile networks that consist of numerous mobile hosts coordinating opportunistically via transient wireless connections. In this paper, we provide a formal abstract characterization of an application's context that extends to encompass a neighborhood within the ad hoc network. We provide a context specification mechanism that allows individual applications to tailor their operating contexts to their personalized needs. We describe a context maintenance protocol that provides this context abstraction in ad hoc networks through continuous evaluation of the context. This relieves the application developer of the obligation of explicitly managing mobility and its implications on behavior. We also characterize the performance of this protocol in ad hoc networks through simulation experiments. Finally, we examine real-world application examples demonstrating its use.	context awareness;experiment;hoc (programming language);imperative programming;personalization;simulation	Christine Julien;Gruia-Catalin Roman;Qingfeng Huang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2007.70731	wireless ad hoc network;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;distributed computing;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-2.2879654358968278	75.26505693190092	7024
0fe9d9ef32f022b8dfdf1c29d8d899a650f5f1f9	securing uav communications via trajectory optimization		Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications has drawn significant interest recently due to many advantages such as low cost, high mobility, and on-demand deployment. This paper addresses the issue of physical-layer security in a UAV communication system, where a UAV sends confidential information to a legitimate receiver in the presence of a potential eavesdropper which are both on the ground. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the system by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In contrast to the existing literature on wireless security with static nodes, we exploit the mobility of the UAV in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a new trajectory design. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem efficiently, based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the UAV's transmit power and trajectory are each optimized with the other fixed in an alternating manner until convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the secrecy rate of the UAV communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes without transmit power control or trajectory optimization.	aerial photography;algorithm;benchmark (computing);confidentiality;convex optimization;coordinate descent;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical method;software deployment;trajectory optimization;unmanned aerial vehicle;wireless security	Guangchi Zhang;Qingqing Wu;Miao Cui;Rui Zhang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254971	communications system;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;power control;iterative method;computer science;coordinate descent;trajectory optimization;convex optimization;convergence (routing);wireless security	EDA	37.561109697992606	90.69072909727535	7034

After this description, the paper covers both attacks and protocols to address errors. Next, the paper covers weak PUF implementations and their use in key generation applications. It covers error-correction schemes such as pattern matching and index-based coding.

A notable example of such networks is wireless fire alarming networks (WFANs) that are strongly related to the safety of the public and to the efficiency of rescuing. WFANs based on wireless sensor networks (WSN) are gaining momentum as they considered a viable and effective solution. However, the current research on invulnerability in the WSN domain mainly focuses on the optimization of the sensor node layout in the initialized network and on routing protocols, whereas the importance of optimization of the deployed network is less explored. In this paper, we show that the invulnerability of WSNs can be improved by introducing two new elements: super wires and super nodes. Moreover, on the basis of the definition of a novel centrality measurement, we propose two layout schemes based on super wires and super nodes for enhancing network invulnerability. The simulation analysis indicates that the proposed schemes are able to enhance the invulnerability of the network with low network construction costs.	algorithm;centrality;mathematical optimization;routing;sensor node;simulation;small-world experiment;software deployment	Xiuwen Fu;Wenfeng Li;Giancarlo Fortino	2013	2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing	10.1109/CCGrid.2013.95	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.399800508737128	77.4881427417517	7120
6feeefda9a79b3eaa390fcb77a644cb8fe65adf1	a stratification-based data collection scheme in underwater acoustic sensor networks		Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) are widely used in a variety of ocean applications, such as exploring ocean resources or monitoring abnormal ocean environments. However, data collection schemes in UASNs are significantly different from those in wireless sensor networks due to high power consumption, severe propagation delay, and so on. Furthermore, previous research has overlooked practical conditions, such as characteristics of water delamination and energy constraint on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, a stratification-based data collection scheme for three-dimensional UASNs is proposed to solve these problems. In this scheme, the network is divided into two layers on the basis of the Ekman drift current model. The upper layer, called the Ekman layer, suffers large water velocity. Thus, nodes in the upper layer will follow the water flow. In this case, we employ a forward set-based multihop forwarding algorithm for data collection. The lower layer suffers small water velocity so that nodes in this layer are considered as relatively static. A neighbor density clustering-based AUV data gathering algorithm is applied in this layer for data collection. By employing different data collection algorithms in different layers, we can integrate the advantages of a multihop transmission scheme and AUV-aided data collection scheme to reduce network consumption and improve network lifetime. The simulation results also confirm the proposed method has good performance.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;autonomous robot;clock drift;cluster analysis;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;velocity (software development)	Guangjie Han;Songjie Shen;Houbing Song;Tao Yang;Wenbo Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2867021	data collection;wireless sensor network;computer network;energy consumption;cluster analysis;propagation delay;underwater;computer science;ekman layer	Mobile	9.196944089506129	78.83111001756298	7128
6e7eaef7bb5a78a12ae155c9111663bb20bdcad9	blind fractional interference alignment		Fractional Interference Alignment (FIA) is a transmission scheme which achieves any value between [0,1] for the Symbols transmitted per Antenna per Channel use (SpA C). FIA was designed in [ 1] specifically for Finite Alphabet (FA) signals, under the con straint that the Minimum Distance (MD) detector is used at all the receivers. Similar to classical i nterference alignment, the FIA precoder also needs perfect channel state information at all the transmit ters (CSIT). In this work, a novel Blind Fractional Interference Alignment (B-FIA) scheme is intro duced, where the basic assumption is that CSIT is not available. We consider two popular channel model s, namely: Broadcast channel, and Interference channel. For these two channel models, the max imum achievable value of SpAC satisfying the constraints of the MD detector is obtained, but with no CS IT, and also a precoder design is provided to obtain any value of SpAC in the achievable range. Further, the precoder structure provided has one distinct a dvantage: interference channel state information at the receiver (I-CSIR) is not needed, when all the transmitters and receivers are equipped with one antenna each. When two or more antennas are used at bo th ends, I-CSIR must be available to obtain the maximum achievable value of SpAC. The receiver de signs for both the Minimum Distance and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoders are discussed, where t he interference statistics is estimated from the received signal samples.

The high cost of semiconductor memories is a fundamental obstacle to the use of semiconductor devices instead of mechanical ones in mass storage memories. The use of faulty memories connected with an ECC VLSI circuit is proposed to overcome these problems. The authors present both a general purpose architecture which can be used as a transparent replacement of a normal hard disk and the coding-decoding circuit which uses the Reed-Solomon code for coding and an original modified error trapping technique for decoding. Using this algorithm it is possible to reach the high transfer rate necessary for high performance solid state disks (SSDs) and the requirements of fault tolerance needed to use faulty memories.

The exact closed-form expressions for OP of the optimal and suboptimal TAS schemes are derived. The power allocation problem is formulated for performance optimization. Then the OP performance under different conditions is evaluated through numerical simulations to verify the analysis. The simulation results showed that optimal TAS scheme has a better OP performance than suboptimal TAS scheme, but the performance gap between the optimal and suboptimal schemes diminishes by increasing the number of antennas at the source; the fading coefficient, the number of cascaded components, the relative geometrical gain, the number of antennas, and the power-allocation parameter have an important influence on the OP performance.	integrated architecture framework;thermal-assisted switching	Lingwei Xu;Hao Zhang;Jingjing Wang;T.

The impact of routing algorithms regarding performance can be analyzed by means of the presented simulator. In order to simulate a heterogeneous MPSoC, ARM processors and MicroBlazes can be attached to the NoC. Processor and peripheral models used within the test platforms are provided by Imperas/OVP. Moreover, traffic generators are available to analyze the system. An additional SystemC component enables the readout of simulation time from within the application. For evaluation of the simulator multiple platforms and applications were put under test and compared with a hardware implementation. The comparison shows that the simulator improves the development of MPSoCs by early estimation of system requirements.	arm architecture;algorithm;central processing unit;mpsoc;mesh networking;multiprocessing;network on a chip;operating system;peripheral;requirement;routing;simulation;system on a chip;system requirements;systemc;wormhole switching	Philipp Wehner;Jens Rettkowski;Tobias Kleinschmidt;Diana Göhringer	2015	2015 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation (SAMOS)	10.1109/SAMOS.2015.7363704	embedded system;routing;computer architecture;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer architecture simulator;computer science;network interface;network on a chip	EDA	0.6554171421622499	62.7786887437559	7199

One key design issue in MPRNet is the formulation of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. In this paper, the performance of two MAC protocols, Slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) and Spatial TDMA (S-TDMA), are investigated. In many MPRNet, the traffic load can vary considerably from link to link. We considered improving the network performance by incorporating traffic load information into the MAC protocol design. In S-ALOHA, nodes transmit at random with some specified probability q. By defining q in terms of traffic load and connectivity near optimum performance was achieved. For S-TDMA the design of transmission schedules was considered. A systematic procedure, for generating schedules, based on the connectivity is described and this procedure was enhanced considerably by utilizing traffic load information. The resulting traffic-sensitive schedules markedly improved network performance.	access control;aloha editor;communications protocol;crew scheduling;interference (communication);network congestion;network performance;routing;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Oscar Somarriba Jarquín	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965956	wireless ad hoc network;intelligent network;telecommunications;computer science;connectivity;probability;distributed computing;network performance;spread spectrum;scheduling;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	5.817750713124685	93.11358928704753	7207

In order to enable a fair sharing of resources among all users, the SIR levels should be balanced by minimizing the ∞-norm of a certain vector. To this end, Gerlach and Paulraj [1] proposed an iterative algorithm, which is based on a 1-norm cost function. It has been observed that this algorithm approximates the optimum ∞-norm solution. In this paper we characterize the case where this algorithm is optimal. The analytical results are used to develop a new algorithm, which always converges to the optimum ∞-norm solution, regardless of the chosen initialization. A proof of convergence is given.	algorithm;beamforming;frequency band;iteration;iterative method;load balancing (computing);loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-user;rain fade;sion's minimax theorem;telecommunications link	Holger Boche;Martin Schubert	2002	2002 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2002.5745266	mathematical optimization;logic gate;power control;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;iterative method	Robotics	35.98108653775802	91.33043113487278	7217

Inspired by the collective behavior of flocks and schools, we propose a Bio-inspired self-organizing Low-Complexity Clustering (B-LCC) algorithm for large-scale dense WSNs. The B-LCC algorithm does not require sensor locations, time synchronization nor any priori knowledge of the network. It is completely distributed and can achieve a well-distributed cluster heads. The processing time complexity of the B-LCC algorithm is O(1) per cluster, which outperforms most of the existing clustering algorithms as they have processing time complexity of O(n) per node in the worst case. Additionally, the B-LCC algorithm has a stable performance in topology control and the formed topology is robust to node failure.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;british informatics olympiad;cluster analysis;computer cluster;cylinder-head-sector;data aggregation;flocking (behavior);organizing (structure);overhead (computing);routing;scalability;self-organization;simulation;time complexity;topology control	Qi Zhang;Rune Hylsberg Jacobsen;Thomas Skjødeberg Toftegaard	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503188	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;hierarchical network model;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;logical topology	Mobile	8.344850826338943	79.39715749624946	7236

This combination eliminates the network I/O bottleneck for distributed systems. The TCP /IP implementation includes extensions to TCP such as support for large transport windows for higher performance. This is particularly desirable for higher-speed networks and/or large delay networks. The DEC FDDIcontroller/TURBOchannel network interface delivers full bandwidth to the system using DMA, and it supports the patented point-to-point, full-duplex FDDI mode. Measurement results show UDP performance is comparable to TCP. Unlike typical BSD-derived systems, the UDP receive throughput to user applications is also maintained at high load. We have seen significant increases in the bandwidth available for computer communication networks in the recent past. Commercially available local area networks (LANs) operate at 100 megabits per second (Mb/s), and research networks are running at greater than 1 gigabit per second (Gb /s). Processor speeds have also seen dramatic increases at the same time. The ultimate throughput delivered to the user application, however, has not increased as rapidly. This has led researchers to say that network I/O at the end system is the next bottleneck.[1] One reason that network I/O to the application has not scaled up as rapidly as communication link bandwidth or CPU processing speeds is that memory bandwidth has not scaled up as rapidly even though memory costs have fallen dramatically. Network I/O involves operations that are memory intensive due to data movement and error checking. Scaling up memory bandwidth, by making memory either wider or faster, is expensive. The result has been an increased focus on the design and implementation of higher-performance network interfaces, the re-examination of the implementation of network I/O, and the consideration of alternative network protocols to achieve higher performance.[2,3,4]. This paper describes the work we did to remove the end system network I/O bottleneck for current commercially available high-speed data links, such as the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI).[5,6] We used the conventional internet protocol suite of transmission control protocol /internet protocol (TCP/IP) and the user datagram protocol/internet protocol (UDP/IP) on Alpha AXP hardware and software platforms.[7,8,9] The specific hardware platform was the DEC 3000 AXP Model 500 workstation with the DEC	bsd;bandwidth (signal processing);central processing unit;communications protocol;dec 3000 axp;dec alpha;data rate units;datagram;direct memory access;distributed computing;duplex (telecommunications);end system;gigabit;input/output;internet protocol suite;mebibyte;megabit;memory bandwidth;microsoft windows;network interface controller;operating system;point-to-point protocol;protocol stack;turbochannel;telecommunications network;throughput;tru64 unix;workstation	Chran-Ham Chang;Richard Flower;John Forecast;Heather Gray;William R.

Finding a path between source and destination faces more challenges in Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) environment because of the node movement and frequent topology changes, besides, the dependence on the intermediate nodes to relay packets. Therefore, trust technique is utilised in such environment to secure routing and stimulate nodes to cooperate in packet forwarding process. In this paper, an investigation of the use of trust to choose the optimised path between two nodes is provided. It comes up with a proposal to select the most reliable path based on multidimensional trust evaluation technique to include number of hubs, trust opinion, confidence in providing trust, and energy level of nodes on the path. The model overcomes the limitation of considering only trustworthiness of the nodes on the path and uses a route optimisation approach to select the path between source and destination. The empirical analysis shows robustness and accuracy of the trust model in a dynamic MANET environment.	data security;energy level;hoc (programming language);information exchange;mathematical optimization;mobile device;network packet;relay;routing;selection algorithm;simulation;throughput;trust (emotion)	Antesar M.

8b3504997c8af1fcc8a9eacf0eb19ea1f80e1eae	a distortion based approach for protecting inferences		Eavesdropping attacks in inference systems aim to learn not the raw data, but the system inferences to predict and manipulate system actions. We argue that conventional information security measures can be ambiguous on the adversary's estimation abilities, and adopt instead a distortion based framework that enables to operate over a metric space. We show that requiring perfect distortion-based security is more frugal than requiring perfect information-theoretic secrecy even for block length one codes, offering in some cases unbounded gains. Within this framework, we design algorithms that enable to efficiently use shared randomness, and show that each bit of shared random key is exponentially useful in security.	adversary (cryptography);block code;distortion;eve;information security;information theory;randomness;symmetric-key algorithm	Chi-Yo Tsai;Gaurav Kumar Agarwal;Christina Fragouli;Suhas N.

However, coherent receivers require good channel estimates, a difficult task when the channel impulse response is long and/or when space diversity techniques are employed. Usually, the channel estimates are obtained with the help of pilot symbols multiplexed with data symbols, which reduces the useful bit rate, decreasing the spectral efficiency of the systems. To avoid this, we consider the use of implicit pilots instead of multiplexed pilots. Since the interference levels between data and pilots might be very high, we propose an iterative receiver with joint detection and channel estimation. Our performance results show that our technique allows the use of low-power pilots, with performances close to the ones with perfect channel estimation, even when space diversity techniques are employed.	carrier recovery;channel state information;coherence (physics);dispersive partial differential equation;interference (communication);iterative method;low-power broadcasting;multiplexing;performance;spectral efficiency	Rui Dinis;Nuno M.

0bd2e391dfba1b93446bcd2e7b0cfc1d4f0f5a28	average age of information in wireless powered sensor networks		In this letter, we deal with the age of information (AoI) for a sensor network with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities. Specifically, we study a simple network topology, where a sensor node harvests energy from radio frequency signals (transmitted by a dedicated energy source) to transmit real-time status updates. The sensor node generates an update when its capacitor/battery becomes fully charged and transmits by using all the available energy without further energy management. The average AoI performance of the considered greedy policy is derived in closed form and is a function of the capacitor’s size. The optimal value of the capacitor that maximizes the freshness of the information, corresponds to a simple optimization problem requiring a one-dimensional search. The derived theoretical results provide useful performance bounds for practical WPT networks.		Ioannis Krikidis	2018	CoRR			Mobile	14.701329094164999	82.67045863632295	7278

The proposed framework bears the potential to solve the high channel estimation overhead for conventional coherent M-MIMO systems. Employing the autocorrelation receiver (AcR) and the belief propagation (BP) message passing algorithm, the proposed soft-input soft-output (SISO) MSDD can be easily integrated with advanced channel coding. Simulation results show that the BER performance can be significantly improved within a few iterations of the proposed scheme.

Each CR user has to stochastically follow a default channel-hopping sequence in order to locate a channel and conduct its frame transmission. In this paper, theoretical analysis is conducted on the probability of channel availability and the average frame delay for primary users (PUs) by considering the impact caused by imperfect sensing of CR users and imperfect synchronization between the primary and CR networks. According to the proposed analytical model with realistic considerations, an optimal channel-hopping sequence (OCS) approach is designed for the CR users based on a dynamic programming technique. It is designed by exploiting the optimal load balance between channel availability and channel utilization within the delay constraints of PUs. By adopting the OCS approach, maximum aggregate throughput of CR users can be achieved while considering PU's quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, in addition to the paired CR networks, the logical partition problem that occurs in generalized CR networks will also be addressed. This problem can severely degrade the aggregate throughput due to the decreased probability of connectivity between CR users, especially in a CR network with heavy traffic. Therefore, both wake-up successive contention (WSC) and wake-up counter-reset successive contention (WCSC) algorithms are proposed to increase the number of negotiations by both exploring the blind spot of imperfect sensing and amending the contention mechanisms between CR users. Compared to conventional channel-hopping sequences, numerical results illustrate that the proposed approaches can effectively maximize aggregate throughput for CR users under the QoS requirements of PUs.	access control;aggregate data;algorithm;cognitive radio;dynamic programming;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;ibm systems network architecture;load balancing (computing);logical partition;numerical analysis;original chip set;partition problem;quality of service;requirement;throughput;wake-on-lan;world sudoku championship	Chi-Mao Lee;Jia-Shi Lin;Kai-Ten Feng;Chung-Ju Chang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2011.205	communications protocol;synchronization;availability;throughput;cognitive radio;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;dynamic programming;computer network	Mobile	7.652172362331728	92.37661642778492	7301

Eventually, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BF scheme as well as the validity of the theoretical results, and show the effect of various channel parameters on the system performance.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;brainfuck;communications satellite;maximal set;relay;secure transmission;simulation;terrestrial television;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Kang An;Min Lin;Tao Liang;Jian Ouyang;Can Yuan;Yinbin Li	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341014	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	36.042002998791695	82.58339820300566	7318

The application components together with its associated challenges are discussed throughout the paper. An optimization model is introduced for the network throughput maximization problem. In contrast to the previous models, the proposed optimization model considers the effective and heterogeneous duration of sensor's transmission together with the dynamic aspect of energy harvesting over different time intervals. Towards the improvement of the network throughput under a proposed condition, an online centralized algorithm with less complexity is designed. Finally, simulations on both Random and Equal-Distance deployment of sensor nodes are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the previous approaches and to observe the effect of different energy harvesting distributions on the throughput achieved by the algorithm.	algorithm;centralized computing;component-based software engineering;entropy maximization;exception handling;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;sensor;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Abbas Mehrabi;Kiseon Kim	2015	2015 IEEE 40th Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2015.7366303	embedded system;throughput;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;energy harvesting;statistics;computer network;data collection	Mobile	12.858811217208542	78.16081258892928	7319

A rate 1 full-diversity DQOSTBC for four transmit antennas is designed. The code matrix changes according to different information exchange error cases, so full diversity is maintained even if not all information exchange is correct. We also perform analysis of the pairwise error probability. The performance analysis indicates that the proposed rate 1 DQOSTBC outperforms rate 1/2 DOSTBC for four transmit antennas at the same transmission rate, which is confirmed by the simulation results.

However, even after applying the standard link independence assumption, the solution of the corresponding set of link problems may involve considerable numerical computation. In this paper, we study an approximate MDP framework on the link level, where vector-valued MDP states are mapped into a set of aggregate scalar MDP states corresponding to link occupancies. In particular, we propose a new model of the expected reward for admitting a call on the network. Compared to Krishnan’s and Hübner’s method [11], our reward model more accurately reflects the bandwidth occupancy by different call categories. The exact and approximate link MDP frameworks are compared by simulations, and the results show that the proposed link reward model significantly improves the performance of Krishnan’s and Hübner’s method.

Therefore, profound knowledge of the statistics of the carrier-to-interference ratio C=I , given by the received carrier power C and the sum I of received powers associated with various interferers, is essential. In this communication, a general approach allowing the calculation of C=I for both the upand the downlink of any interference limited mobile radio system is presented. Power control algorithms are explicitly considered. The general approach is used to provide insight into the statistics of C=I of C/TDMA systems applying multi-user detection, which are promising candidates for third generation mobile radio systems. For these C/TDMA systems applying multi-user detection, a representative selection of results is collected from the general approach and presented in this communication.

Mobility of primary users (PUs) or cognitive users (CUs) requires adjustment of multi-hop communications among CUs to avoid any interference to PUs. To provide durable and reliable data routing that ensures continuous network service, we propose mobility-aware cognitive routing (MCR) for multi-hop cognitive radio networks. MCR examines the risk level of each node against interference regions and selects the most reliable path for data delivery using a Markov predictor. Through simulation, we verify that the proposed scheme can avoid route destruction preemptively and achieve reliable data delivery.	cognitive network;cognitive radio;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);kerrison predictor;memory card reader;preemption (computing);routing;simulation	Jae-Joon Lee;Jaesung Lim	2014	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2014.000026	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;cognitive radio;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;cognitive network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.853744859112585	84.36125316692484	7416

159ab2f6418a33cdf51bc56b426f92fce39611a9	a multiple rsu collaborative scheduling scheme for data services in vehicular ad hoc networks	vanet;rsu;scheduling;collaboration;safety;deadline	As studies on vehicular ad hoc networks have been conducted actively in recent years, convenient and reliable services can be provided to vehicles through traffic information, surrounding information, and file sharing. To provide services for multiple requests, road side units (RSUs) should receive requests from vehicles and provide a scheduling scheme for data transfer according to priority. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling scheme by which multiple RSUs are connected through wired networks and data is transferred through the collaboration of RSUs. The proposed scheme transfers safety and non-safety data by employing a collaborative strategy of multiple RSUs as well as reducing the deadline miss ratio and average response time. When safety data is generated, data is transferred from the previous RSU in advance, while priority is assigned considering the deadline and reception rate. Since non-safety data is an on-demand data processed by user requests, the proposed scheme provides a method that reduces the deadline miss ratio upon loads generated in RSUs. To prove the superiority of the proposed scheme, we perform a performance evaluation in which the number and velocities of vehicles were changed. It is shown through the performance evaluation that the proposed scheme has better deadline miss ratios and faster response time than the existing schemes.	big data;calendaring software;file sharing;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);performance evaluation;response time (technology);scheduling (computing);velocity (software development)	Kyoung Soo Bok;Jongtae Lim;Seungwan Hong;Jaesoo Yoo	2017	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-017-0801-z	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.613988795798209	90.61877295261814	7454

Specifically, the wireless system is modeled as a network of parallel queues. We assume that the channel state of each queue evolves stochastically as an ON/OFF Markov chain. The scheduler, which is aware of the queue lengths but is oblivious of the channel states, has to choose one queue at a time for transmission. The scheduler has no information regarding the current channel states, but can estimate them by using the acknowledgment history. We first characterize the capacity region of the system using tools from Markov Decision Processes (MDP) theory. Specifically, we prove that the capacity region boundary is the uniform limit of a sequence of Linear Programming (LP) solutions. Next, we combine the LP solution with a queue length based scheduling mechanism that operates over long ‘frames,’ to obtain a throughput optimal policy for the system. By incorporating results from MDP theory within the Lyapunov-stability framework, we show that our frame-based policy stabilizes the system for all arrival rates that lie in the interior of the capacity region.

High accuracy and precision are key demands for these location systems. Numerous studies have attempted to improve localization accuracy and precision using either dedicated RFID infrastructures or advanced localization algorithms. But these effects mostly consider utilization of novel RFID localization solutions rather than optimization of this utilization. Practical use of these solutions in industrial applications leads to increased cost and deployment difficulty of RFID system. This paper attempts to investigate how accuracy and precision in passive RFID location systems (PRLS) are impacted by infrastructures and localization algorithms. A general experimental-based investigation strategy, PRLS-INVES, is designed for analyzing and evaluating the factors that impact the performance of a passive RFID location system. Through a case study on passive high frequency (HF) RFID location systems with this strategy, it is discovered that: 1) the RFID infrastructure is the primary factor determining the localization capability of an RFID location system and 2) localization algorithm can improve accuracy and precision, but is limited by the primary factor. A discussion on how to efficiently improve localization accuracy and precision in passive HF RFID location systems is given.	algorithm;coherence (physics);internet of things;list of zx spectrum clones;mathematical optimization;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;software deployment;tag (metadata)	Po Yang	2015	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2014.2377351	embedded system;algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;accuracy and precision;hafnium;computer security;statistics	Mobile	20.152099524603674	75.65751294860287	7460

The purpose of our analysis is to evaluate the relative efficiency of several recently proposed biased-fault attacks. We compare the relative performance of each technique in a common framework, using a common circuit and a common fault injection method. We show that, for an identical circuit and fault injection method (setup time violation through clock glitching), the number of faults per attack greatly varies according to the analysis technique. In particular, DFIA is more efficient than FSA, and FSA is more efficient than both NUEVA and NUFVA. In terms of number of fault injections until full key disclosure, for a typical case, FSA uses 8x more faults than DFIA, and NUEVA uses 33x more faults than DFIA. Hence, the postprocessing technique selected in a biased-fault attack has a significant impact on the success of the attack.	analysis of algorithms;byzantine fault tolerance;countermeasure (computer);cryptography;differential fault analysis;digital electronics;embedded system;fault injection;fault model;fault tolerance;firmware;flip-flop (electronics);glitch;glitching;key disclosure law;test case	Nahid Farhady Ghalaty;Bilgiday Yuce;Patrick Schaumont	2015	IEEE Embedded Systems Letters	10.1109/LES.2016.2524652	differential fault analysis;real-time computing;fault coverage;logic gate;fault indicator;computer science;stuck-at fault;computer security;sensitivity analysis	EDA	12.240482802285845	63.43051386735384	7511

In this study, their performance is evaluated for some typical collusion strategies using a discretized bias-based binary fingerprinting code.

An approximate expression for the demodulated signal-to-noise ratio is developed for a conventional RAKE receiver. The expression includes an orthogonality factor that quantifies the performance gain of using orthogonal spreading codes in the presence of a time-dispersive channel. A comparison with simulation results shows that the accuracy of the expression is high in various combinations of desired signal, orthogonal and non-orthogonal intra-cell interference, and AWGN. The numerical results also show that not only the strength of individual rays but also their relative phases and delays determine the value of the orthogonality factor.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;code;computer simulation;dispersive partial differential equation;interference (communication);modulation;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;rake;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Wang Hai;Niclas Wiberg	2002		10.1109/WCNC.2002.993321	additive white gaussian noise;code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;rake receiver	Mobile	41.56230301892286	77.74017259273373	7543
39fe0b4fc9a8b9d1392ea24aa008fccd7d0252df	optimal addressing-based routing for 6lowpan	routing;6lowpan;wsn;addressing	Article history: Received 19 November 2015 Received in revised form 12 December 2015 Accepted 17 December 2015 Available online 23 December 2015 The addressing-based routing solutions usually adopt a tree topology, but the routing paths along a tree are not optimal and the resources of nodes around a root are excessively consumed. Moreover, the descendants of a failed node need to rejoin a tree and reacquire addresses, and during this process they cannot perform communications. In order to overcome the above deficiencies, this paper proposes an optimal addressing-based routing scheme for 6LoWPAN. This scheme takes advantages of one-hop and two-hop neighbors to calculate optimal paths. Since a root is not involved in most of optimal paths, the excessive resource consumption is avoided. This scheme also proposes an address update algorithm and the descendants of a failed node can use this algorithm to update their addresses rather than reacquire the new addresses. During the address update process, the descendants can still use the original addresses to perform communications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One important emerging area is ultra-reliable communication with guaranteed low latencies well beyond what current wireless technologies can provide. In this paper, we explore the viability of using wireless communication for low-latency, high-reliability communication in an example scenario of factory automation, and outline important design choices for such a system. We show that it is possible to achieve very low error rates and latencies over a radio channel, also when considering fast fading signal and interference, channel estimation errors, and antenna correlation. The most important tool to ensure high reliability is diversity, and low latency is achieved by using short transmission intervals without retransmissions, which, however, introduces a natural restriction on coverage area.	access time;algorithm;automation;channel state information;fifth generation computer;high-level programming language;interference (communication);network packet;next-generation network;requirement	Niklas A.

All the sensors are organised into different groups called sensor cover in such a way that each cover can monitor all the targets for a fixed duration. By keeping one sensor cover active at a time while others in sleep mode, sensors batteries can be utilised in efficient way. This helps in prolonging the network lifetime. In this study, the authors propose a new energy-efficient heuristic to schedule the sensors in different non-disjoint sensor covers which helps to maximise network lifetime. At first, the authors’ heuristic identify all the critical targets (least covered) and the critical sensors (covering critical targets). The critical targets, covered by minimum number of sensors, will be the targets that become uncovered first. Utilising critical sensors efficiently will help to increase the network lifetime. In their method, they try to select minimum number of critical sensors in each sensor cover so that the critical targets can be covered for longer period. Simulation results shows that the proposed heuristic outperforms many existing approaches for solving target coverage problem.	heuristic;sensor;simulation;sleep mode	Manju;Satish Chand;Bijender Kumar	2016	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2015.0094	telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;forensic engineering;computer security	Mobile	11.754181330130699	78.71289697911313	7632

In this paper, we first investigate the processing gain of spreading signal and analyze its expression. Then, by increasing signal bandwidth or symbol period infinitely, we obtain that the processing gain is bounded, and the maximum processing gain is determined by the channel parameters and the energy-per-bit to noise density ratio (Eb/N0). By analysis and simulation, it is shown that the processing gain is not more than 30dB, when the spreading signal relative to BPSK, with Eb/N0 20dB, the maximum Doppler shift 100Hz, and the negative exponential factor 5E-6, is transmitted in rich scattering multipath fading channels.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);carrier recovery;coherence (physics);doppler effect;eb/n0;key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;process gain;simulation;time complexity	Wanzhi Ma;Jun Wang;Ying Shen;Youxi Tang	2011	2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1109/CMC.2011.77	telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;signal processing;bandwidth	Mobile	42.333230978833754	76.29571675305452	7656

The fairness and throughput maximization have been considered as classical techniques. These techniques fail to fit with different QoS requirements over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. These QoS requirements are presented in the form of scheduling priorities, delay budgets, etc. To handle service class requirements in LTE network, this paper suggests a new scheduling algorithm entitled Multiclass Scheduling Algorithm (MuCSA) that deals with QoS requirements, relying on the multiclass systems.

For the first time, the authors obtain optimal parameters for the FSO/code division multiple access (CDMA) system taking into account the transmission reliability, security, and efficiency simultaneously. By establishing the eavesdropping model of the FSO/CDMA binary symmetric wiretap channel (BSWC), the performance of physical-layer security and reliability are evaluated simultaneously. Intercept probability is derived for FSO/CDMA BSWC, considering atmospheric attenuation, atmospheric turbulence, shot noise, thermal noise, background noise and multiple access interference (MAI). The effects of transmission distance, code length, transmission power and a number of interfering users on the physical-layer security and reliability are discussed. It is shown that, in order to meet the legitimate useru0027s reliability and security simultaneously, the number of interfering users and code length must be in a certain interval. Furthermore, the maximum spectral efficiency can be obtained by selecting the transmission rate. These results open a new way of researching the FSO/CDMA system, where security, reliability, and spectral efficiency should be taken into account simultaneously.

Among them, a tracking method has been attractive to provide good performance by eliminating the effects of RFSE. However, it requires high computational complexity because of its compensation process including many complex multiplications. In this paper, we propose a new method which significantly reduces computational costs by adjusting the starting point of FFT window in order to compensate for the RFSE. For the performance verification, we apply the proposed method to the IEEE 802.16e mobile WiMAX system and estimate its computational power compared to the tracking method. Simulation and implementation results show that the proposed algorithm has the performance similar to the tracking method and is very efficient for low power implementation in comb-type pilot-aided OFDM systems because it consumes only 40.5% of the tracking method's power.	algorithm;channel state information;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;fast fourier transform;ieee 1471;interpolation;residual frame;simulation	Seongjoo Lee;Jaedeok Kim;Yunho Jung;Jaeseok Kim	2009	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2009.5373737	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Visualization	51.523937741693764	77.95358730906973	7679
16074e8444559aacbbb17b6864883dc072ed1b33	bandwidth-efficient network monitoring algorithms based on segment routing		Abstract We study the bandwidth-efficient network monitoring algorithms using segment routing on topologies that can be modelled as a symmetric directed graph. Aiming at directly minimizing the cycle cover length, four new two-phase algorithms, A, B, C and D, are proposed. Algorithm A is a simple extension of an existing algorithm. Algorithm B utilizes the notion of symmetric cycles. Algorithm C enhances B by adopting a new path metric. Algorithm D further improves C with a parallel and sequential cycle construction process. Since two-phase algorithms require a dedicated monitoring topology, the four two-phase algorithms are then enhanced to function without monitoring topology. Although the cycle cover length found is slightly increased, we argue that the cost saving in removing monitoring topology is far more significant.	algorithm;source routing	Xiaoqian Li;Kwan Lawrence Yeung	2018	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2018.10.010	simple extension;distributed computing;network topology;network monitoring;computer science;directed graph;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing)	ML	-3.2460942624059945	80.05412618672462	7682

Alternatively, sidelobe cancellation and signal predistortion techniques have been proposed for spectrum shaping, but schemes achieving a good balance between complexity and performance are yet to be developed. In this paper, an efficient and low-complexity technique referred to as “sidelobe suppression with orthogonal projection” (SSOP) scheme is proposed. An analysis of the SNR performance and robustness characteristics of the proposed technique are also presented. Numerical results show that significant sidelobe suppression can be readily achieved with slight receiver performance degradation.	elegant degradation;noise shaping;numerical method;out-of-band agreement;robustness (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;small outline integrated circuit;spectral efficiency;zero suppression	Antonio Cantoni;Jian Zhang;Xiaojing Huang;Yingjie Jay Guo	2012	2012 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)	10.1109/AusCTW.2012.6164903	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	EDA	48.59596228844388	81.697539092381	7689

Sub-Nyquist sampling has been considered for this task in order to cope with the sampling rate bottleneck of the wideband signals a CR usually deals with, by exploiting their multiband structure. However, communication signals suffer from fading and shadowing effects that affect a single CR's performance. In this paper, we consider collaborative spectrum sensing by a network of CRs, each sharing an observation matrix derived from sub-Nyquist samples of their respective received signal with a fusion center. Exploiting the fact that all received signals share a joint support, equal to that of the transmitted signal, the fusion center recovers it by combining the measurements of the different CRs. We present two joint reconstruction algorithms, Block Sparse Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (BSOMP) and Block Sparse Simultaneous Iterative Hard Thresholding (BSIHT), that adapt the original OMP and IHT to both block sparse and matrix (simultaneous) inputs. Simulations show that our algorithms outperform a collaborative scheme based on hard decisions, namely the union of the supports recovered by each CR individually, demonstrating that cooperation between CRs via measurement fusion improve their performance.	algorithm;centralized computing;cognitive radio;computer simulation;matching pursuit;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;openmp;real-time clock;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing)	Deborah Cohen;Alon Akiva;Barak Avraham;Yonina C.

The network utility depends on two main factors: an efficiency mapping which is a function of the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), and the power of the pre-equalization variables. Meanwhile, the sum-rate index is constructed by the summation of a logarithmic function of the SINRs of the active users. The network utility and sum-rate maximization problems are formulated here by assuming that the data estimation at the mobile units (MUs) is carried out by a simple matched filter. The optimal solutions are derived in this work for the pre-equalization factors by following a strategy that is distributed with respect to the channel state information (CSI) and data rates, but centralized with respect to the spreading sequences of all active users. The construction of these optimal solutions requires in each case a two step procedure. First, the optimal SINR is computed for the maximum utility and sum-rate solutions based on the efficiency mapping and on the bound of the transmission power, respectively. Then, exploiting the induced diversity by the multiple subcarriers, the pre-equalization algorithms cancel the multiple-access interference (MAI) and channel distortions, minimize the transmission power and achieve the optimal SINR after signal detection. A comprehensive numerical evaluation is presented at the end of the paper to validate the analytical derivations. Applications of the proposed pre-equalization schemes could be associated among others to cellular communication systems, and wireless networks of actuators.	centralized computing;channel state information;detection theory;distortion;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);matched filter;mobile phone;network utility;numerical analysis;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Daniel U.

Because of this nodes are normally battery powered. This limits the lifetime of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel method of scheduling nodes based on a user's sensing coverage requirement. Through the use of our proposed scheduling algorithm (Ncut-GA), it is shown that the duration for which the user's coverage requirement is met can be extended. When compared with a previously published algorithm (Greedy-MSC), the proposed algorithm is able to increase coverage duration by up to 80%. Furthermore it is also shown that the time until the first node dies can be improved by up to 200% through the use of Ncut-GA.		Jong Chern Lim;Chris J.

Formally, we give an efficient “stochastic” encoding E(·, ·) of messages combined with a small number of auxiliary random bits, such that for every message m and every error vector e (that could depend on m) that contains at most a fraction p of ones, w.h.p over the random bits r chosen by the encoder, m can be efficiently recovered from the corrupted codeword E(m, r) + e by a decoder without knowledge of the encoder’s randomness r. Our construction for additive errors also yields explicit deterministic codes of rate approaching 1 − H(p) for the “average error” criterion: for every error vector e of at most p fraction 1’s, most messages m can be efficiently (uniquely) decoded from the corrupted codeword C(m) + e. Note that such codes cannot be linear, as the bad error patterns for all messages are the same in a linear code. We also give a new proof of the existence of such codes based on list decoding and certain algebraic manipulation detection codes. Our proof is simpler than the previous proofs from the literature on arbitrarily varying channels. ∗Supported in part by a David and Lucile Packard fellowship, NSF CCF-0953155, and US-Israel BSF 2008293. †Supported in part by NSF awards 0729171 and 0747294.	additive model;bean scripting framework;best, worst and average case;binary code;code word;encoder;ibm notes;linear algebra;linear code;list decoding;randomness;utility functions on indivisible goods	Venkatesan Guruswami;Adam Smith	2009	CoRR		list decoding;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;information theory;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;computational complexity theory;statistics	Theory	33.610100322253686	68.0093129699767	7739

In this paper, unlike a primary/secondary model, cognitive radio is defined as wireless communication technology in which each node communicates via an optimal wireless system based on recognition of radio resource availability in heterogeneous wireless communication systems. Therefore, it is important to be able to recognize such radio resource availability accurately. However, a cognitive radio node is unable to recognize the subsequent radio resource availability at the time of selecting the optimal wireless system. The authors focus on the prediction of radio resource availability to resolve the above issue. In this paper, the authors focus on IEEE802.11 and radio channel occupation time, which is calculated from packet length and the transmission rate, is used as radio resource availability. From the results of the examination, it would seem feasible that the auto-correlation coefficient (or partial auto-correlation coefficient) could be utilized as information on the reliability of the prediction value when an auto-regression model (AR model) is used for the prediction. Furthermore, by comparing n-step-ahead prediction for a time series calculated for a 1-second interval and 1-step-ahead prediction for a time series calculated for an n-second interval, it is shown that the accuracy of the prediction in both cases is almost identical when the information volume to calculate a prediction expression is the same. Therefore, either prediction approach can be selected depending on the cognitive radio system.	acf;autocorrelation;autoregressive model;coefficient;cognitive radio;network packet;time series	Shoji Kaneko;Shinichi Nomoto;Tetsuro Ueda;Shingo Nomura;Kazunori Takeuchi	2008	2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562504	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	6.59655925427617	99.8094049046976	7741

Currently, most of the existing applications rely on the 802.11g/n standards, capable to seamlessly stream HD video contents. These standards are operating in the license-free ISM band, which, due to the rapid revolution in wireless communication in past years, is becoming overexploited and experiences serious coexistence problems. The spectrum overcrowding in the free bands puts in a new light the VHF and UHF bands that are currently seen as a promising alternative spectrum resource, especially in the perspective of the worldwide switchover from analog to digital TV and in the light of the new emerging dynamic spectrum access techniques. Within this framework, this paper presents an unlicensed cognitive radio indoor multi-vision system operating in the UHF TV band for short-range indoor transmission of high definition TV contents. The system relies on a combined exclusive approach of spectrum sensing and geo-location database and is compliant with the DVB-T2 broadcasting standard. A proof-of-concept digital terrestrial television (DTT) compliant prototype has been implemented on a test-bed based on commercial DTT receivers in combination with software defined radio hardware devices. Extended measurements performed in a real indoor environment assessed the feasibility of the proposed system in terms of coverage and protection of the incumbent users.	ada;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;authorization;best, worst and average case;coexist (image);cognitive radio;digital video broadcasting;digital rights management;etsi satellite digital radio;experience;experiment;geolocation;interference (communication);modulation;prototype;retransmission (data networks);sfiaplus;server (computing);switchover;systems architecture;tv tuner card;terrestrial television;testbed;transmitter;ultra high frequency;white spaces (radio);worst-case scenario	Mauro Fadda;Maurizio Murroni;Vlad Popescu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/ICCE.2012.6161722		Mobile	21.78094677102257	83.9845743701304	7752

This conservative transmission mechanism of DCF makes it hard to fully utilize the wireless capacity in terms of spatial reuse. Recent measurement studies demonstrate that a packet can survive the collision and can be decoded successfully by the receiver depending on the transmission order and relative signal strength. We call this physical layer Capture Effect. A new wireless PHY technology, namely, Message In Message (MIM) augments the probability of the PHY capture by adopting the enhanced preamble detection function. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic concurrent transmission protocol which exploits MIM functionality to maximize the system throughput of IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The key idea of our approach is that when an AP overhears other APs' transmission, it sends a packet to its client concurrently if the MIM capture threshold requirements are satisfied. Our ns-2 simulation results show that our scheme outperforms DCF up to 18% in most cases.	capture effect;concurrency (computer science);design rule for camera file system;hoc (programming language);mesh networking;network packet;phy (chip);real-time clock;requirement;simulation;testbed;throughput;transmitter	Young-myoung Kang;Joonsoo Lee;Chong-kwon Kim	2011	The International Conference on Information Networking 2011 (ICOIN2011)	10.1109/ICOIN.2011.5723122	signal strength;communications protocol;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;probability;interference;capture effect;signal-to-noise ratio;physical layer;wireless;detection theory;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	9.369000797184112	91.11449766073268	7762
53210149d42423cc732eaaab2a0a7aa141d80e53	wireless network optimization by perron-frobenius theory	communications and information theory;wireless communications	A basic question in wireless networking is how to optimize the wireless network resource allocation for utility maximization and interference management. In this paper, we present an overview of a Perron-Frobenius theoretic framework to overcome the notorious non-convexity barriers in wireless utility maximization problems. Through this approach, the optimal value and solution of the optimization problems can be analytically characterized by the spectral property of matrices induced by nonlinear positive mappings. It also provides a systematic way to derive distributed and fast-convergent algorithms and to evaluate the fairness of resource allocation. This approach can even solve several previously open problems in the wireless networking literature, e.g., Kandukuri and Boyd (TWC 2002), Wiesel, Eldar and Shamai (TSP 2006), Krishnan and Luss (WCNC 2011). More generally, this approach links fundamental results in nonnegative matrix theory and (linear and nonlinear) Perron-Frobenius theory with the solvability of non-convex problems. In particular, for seemingly nonconvex problems, e.g., max-min wireless fairness problems, it can solve them optimally; for truly nonconvex problems, e.g., sum rate maximization, it can even be used to identify polynomial-time solvable special cases or to enable convex relaxation for global optimization. To highlight the key aspects, we also present a short survey of our recent efforts in developing the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theoretic framework to solve wireless network optimization problems with applications in MIMO wireless cellular, heterogeneous small-cell and cognitive radio networks.

These methods are based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition of a tensor composed of channel output covariances. Such a decomposition is possible owing to a new precoding scheme developed for phase-shift keying (PSK) signals modeled as Markov chains. Some conditions on the transition probability matrices (TPM) of the Markov chains are established to introduce temporal correlation and satisfy statistical correlation constraints inducing the PARAFAC decomposition of the considered tensor. The proposed blind channel estimation algorithms are evaluated by means of computer simulations.	multi-user;nonlinear system	Carlos Alexandre R. Fernandes;Gérard Favier;João Cesar M.

2d7380787f9ebb6c7af790e34eae462b967eef41	verification of fresnel zone clearance for line-of-sight determination in 5.9 ghz vehicle-to-vehicle communications	path clearance determination;vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v);the first fresnel zone;path loss modeling;measurement-based analysis	The determination of the path clearance is one of the most important factors for channel propagation models because most of them classify their models into line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) environments. In particular, the path for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is more easily obstructed owing to its characteristics such as low antenna heights and high mobility. In this paper, we verify the first Fresnel zone clearance, which is a widely employed method for the determination of path clearance in V2V scenarios. In the analytical model of the first Fresnel zone in V2V scenarios, the ground acts as an obstacle and thus induces NLOS environments for farther than a certain distance. In contrast, our measurement results reveal no additional loss due to the ground obstruction. Therefore, we conclude that the first Fresnel zone calculation is not applicable for determining the path clearance in V2V scenarios, which has significant impact on the accuracy of channel propagation modeling.

This paper proposes a stateless position-based solution for QoS routing issues and offers an efficient end-to-end communication guarantee. The proposed Stateless QoS (SQoS) routing protocol is based on adaptive compass greedy routing to determine a qualified path which satisfies the QoS requirements and the void handling scheme overcomes the local maximum issue. In addition, the SQoS routing utilises the node overhearing capacity to obtain the link quality measurement to provide a guarantee for efficient end-to-end transmission through the identification of high-quality links for multimedia streams. The performance of the proposed SQoS routing protocol is compared with existing QoSGPSR. Finally, the performance evaluation proves that the SQoS routing protocols outperform the existing protocols.	end-to-end principle;greedy algorithm;maxima and minima;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;stateless protocol;the void (virtual reality)	V.

We experimentally show that the frame aggregation (FA) feature of 802.11n is the dominant one among 802.11n features affecting the ABE. Using an indoor 802.11n wireless testbed, we compare three ABE tools (WBest, DietTopp and pathChirp) in various cross-traffic scenarios. We find that FA significantly hurts the accuracy of all ABE tools; DietTopp and pathChirp are relatively more robust than WBest. Because faster available bandwidth estimation and less intrusiveness are desirable properties of any ABE tool and WBest satisfies them relatively better than the other two tools, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the harmful effect of FA on ABE using WBest. This in turn led us to come up with two key design principles to counter FA effects: (1) treating aggregated probes as one jumbo probe; and (2) generating a larger number of probes. We then develop an enhanced version of WBest termed WBest+ that incorporates these principles. Our evaluation shows that the new version is effective in achieving accurate ABE in the presence of FA.	bandwidth (signal processing);channel bonding;distortion;end-to-end principle;experiment;internet access;jumbo frame;statistical relational learning;testbed	Arsham Farshad;Myungjin Lee;Mahesh K.

The receivers have side information obtained by overhearing wireless channels. The relay takes control decisions by coding transmissions based on its knowledge of side information in the receivers. We consider two control mechanisms. In the ACK system, the relay has definite knowledge of side information announced via overhearing reports. In the NACK system, the relay has statistical knowledge of side information and receives feedback after every decoding failure. Our contribution is as follows. We provide the minimal evacuation times for the two systems and obtain analytical expressions of the throughput region for the ACK and the code-constrained region for the NACK system. When the transmission rates are the same (r1 = r2) or when the receiver with the highest transmission rate has perfect side information (pf=1), we show that the two regions are equal. We then provide simple joint xor coding and scheduling policies that achieve those regions and, thus, are throughput optimal. Subsequently, we evaluate the report overhead performance for both mechanisms and reflect on the involved tradeoff with throughput. Ultimately, we demonstrate by simulations that the proposed throughput optimal policies can be appropriately enhanced to have good delay properties, particularly for protocols that utilize sequenced packet delivery.	acknowledgement (data networks);control system;exclusive or;network packet;norm (social);overhead (computing);relay;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Constantinos Fragiadakis;Georgios S.

The basic idea comes from Minimum Interference Routing: select a feasible path that puts the least possible restriction on the transmission capacity offered by the network for other communicating parties. This is achieved by circumventing some critical bottleneck links. The main contribution of the paper is a method to assess the degree of link criticality facilitating efficient route precomputation even in the case, when up to date resource availability information is not immediately available.	interference (communication);precomputation;routing	Gábor Rétvári	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39404-4_19	routing;active traffic management;telecommunications;computer science;service quality;bandwidth;computer network	Arch	1.073794216603293	102.14683337856431	7860

The existing contention resolution schemes consider priority and arrival time to resolve contention. For most multimedia applications priority and delay are key parameters for QoS provisioning. In this paper, we propose a new signaling protocol for reducing contention in OBS networks and consider three parameters, namely, priority of the burst, number of hops traversed, and burst size into account to resolve contention. The source node in the proposed protocol can be informed of the contention up to halfway along the path of the burst, and thus, can reschedule the burst accordingly. The scheme is adaptable to both prioritized and delay constrained traffic. We call the scheme OBSFlex. For selecting a data channel, we propose three channel selection algorithms, namely, Least Recently Used (LRU), First Fit (FF), and Priority Set (PS). We simulate OBSFlex and compare with preemptive priority just-enough-time (PPJET) contention resolution scheme. We show that OBSFlex outperforms PPJET in terms of burst loss rates. For simulation, we have considered Poisson and bursty traffic models.	algorithm;apache flex;blocking (computing);burst transmission;channel (communications);computer simulation;erlang (unit);ingress router;optical burst switching;preemption (computing);priority queue;propagation time;provisioning;quality of service;router (computing);selection algorithm;signaling protocol;simulation;time of arrival	Ashok K.

Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the capacity. The presented method requires O(M2 N√log N/ε) to provide an estimate of the capacity to within ε, where N and M denote the input and output alphabet size; a single iteration has a complexity O(MN). We also show how to approximately compute the capacity of memoryless channels having a bounded continuous input alphabet and a countable output alphabet under some mild assumptions on the decay rate of the channel's tail. It is shown that discrete-time Poisson channels fall into this problem class. As an example, we compute sharp upper and lower bounds for the capacity of a discrete-time Poisson channel with a peak-power input constraint.	approximation;convex optimization;input/output;iteration;iterative method	Tobias Sutter;David Sutter;Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani;John Lygeros	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2401002	convex function;entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;mutual information;approximation algorithm;channel capacity;statistics	Theory	35.841241355624106	65.4366125138392	7881

We consider two optimization problems for the relay network: 1) maximizing the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 2) minimizing the total power consumption while maintaining the end-to-end SNR over a threshold value. We investigate these two problems for two relaying protocols of all-participate (AP) relaying and selective relaying and two cases of feedback to the relays, namely full and limited. We show that the SNR maximization problem is concave and that the power minimization problem is convex for all protocols and feedback cases considered. We obtain closed-form expressions for the two problems in the case of full feedback and solve the problems through convex programming for limited feedback. Numerical results show the benefit of having full feedback at the relays for both optimization problems. However, they also show that feedback overhead can be reduced by having only limited feedback to the relays with only a small degradation in performance.	anisotropic filtering;block cipher mode of operation;complete (complexity);concave function;convex function;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;emoticon;end-to-end principle;expectation–maximization algorithm;feedback;hessian;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;regular expression;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;star catalogue;wireless access point	Ammar Zafar;Redha M.

To mitigate this medium access control layer-specific interference problem, many schemes have been proposed, of which transmit power and carrier sensing threshold control schemes stand out. In this paper, we propose a scheme which not only works out on its own but also improves the performance of these two schemes: Based on a 'cell identifier' imbedded in the header portion of all radio frames, nodes drop the payload portion of frames which number do not match that of their respective cells while their drop rates are within some tolerance limit. Using a realistic IEEE 802.11b simulator as our validation platform, we show that this scheme has some merit especially in the presence of path-loss or signal power measurement uncertainties.	access control;elegant degradation;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;identifier;interference (communication);simulation;spatial multiplexing;throughput	Raymond J.

The shortest distance restriction guarantees the optimal communication delay between processors and high link/node utilization across the network. This paper uses a combinatorial approach by limiting the number of node, link and node/link failures. For each failure model, two different cases depending on the relative positions of u and I, are analyzed to compute DR. Furthermore, DR for the antipodal communication, where every node must communicate with its antipode, is investigated as a special case. For this case, lower bound on DR of those disjoint paths is also derived.	central processing unit;star network	Xiaolong Wu;Shahram Latifi;Yingtao Jiang	2007	2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370602	ring network;routing;star network;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	-0.16802625038471497	68.92299679909368	7936

However, we imposed two lim itations on the row-monomial DOSTBCs. The first one was that the associated matrices of the codes must be row-mon omial. The other was the assumption that the relays did not have any channel state information (CSI) of the chann els from the source to the relays, although this CSI could be readily obtained at the relays without any addition al pilot signals or any feedback overhead. In this paper, we first remove the row-monomial limitation; but keep the CSI limitation. In this case, we derive an upper bound of the data-rate of the DOSTBC and it is larger than that of the ro w-monomial DOSTBCs in [1]. Secondly, we abandon the CSI limitation; but keep the row-monomial limitation. S pecifically, we propose the row-monomial DOSTBCs with channel phase information (DOSTBCs-CPI) and derive an uppe r bound of the data-rate of those codes. The rowmonomial DOSTBCs-CPI have higher data-rate than the DOSTBC s and the row-monomial DOSTBCs. Furthermore, we find the actual row-monomial DOSTBCs-CPI which achieve th e upper bound of the data-rate.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;code;expanded memory;monomial;overhead (computing);relay;spectral efficiency	Zhihang Yi;Il-Min Kim	2007	CoRR		telecommunications;information theory;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Mobile	37.41582279446421	73.21876975296887	7968

In this work, experimental measurements are presented at the frequency of 433 MHz, which show a good agreement with the theoretical studies. Experiments are run to examine the received signal strength and the packet error rate for aboveground-to-underground and underground-toaboveground communication links. The results reveal that the effects of burial depth, inter-node distance and volumetric water content of the soil on the signal strength and packet error rate.

Recent study in battery technology reveals that batteries tend to discharge more power than needed and reimburse the over-discharged power if they are recovered. In this paper we first provide a mathematical battery model suitable for implementation in sensor networks. We then introduce the concept of battery-aware connected dominating set (BACDS) and show that in general the minimum BACDS (MBACDS) can achieve longer lifetime than the previous backbone structures. Then we show that finding a MBACDS is NP-hard and give a distributed approximation algorithm to construct the BACDS. The resulting BACDS constructed by our algorithm is at most (8 + Δ)opt size, where Δ is the maximum node degree and opt is the size of an optimal BACDS. Simulation results show that the BACDS can save a significant amount of energy and achieve up to 30% longer network lifetime than previous schemes.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;connected dominating set;discharger;internet backbone;np-hardness;network performance;routing;sensor node;simulation	Chi Ma;Yuanyuan Yang;Zhenghao Zhang	2007	EURASIP J.

782a0fdf4c9285dd126710f381b02f6236473849	case study analysis of dtv signal reception near large water surface		Today many different propagation models predict the coverage area of digital television (DTV) services providing various level of precision on case-by-case manner. These models tend to be very inaccurate in situations that are not nominal to the appropriate propagation model definition. The general aim of this paper is to investigate the possible problems related to the near-large-water-surface DTV reception and its prediction. The work involves a case study radio spectrum measurements and signals calculation utilizing existing propagation models. In particular, the paper provides a numerical comparison of calculated and measured TV signal levels for several points near the Dojran Lake on both sides of the Macedonian-Greek border. The values reveal significant dependence between the receiving signal strength and the antenna height, as well as its micro-location, which prove that such locations represent a big challenge for coverage area prediction and control.

When the frequency offset of the received signal is quite small phase locked loop (PLL) can be used to drive the phase error to zero, however PLLs fail to operate when the received signal has a significant frequency offset. Thus, when a significant frequency offset does exist, it must be estimated and removed prior to the PLL. Frequency locked loop (FLL) are used to accomplish this task. The maximum likelihood frequency estimator uses a frequency detector formed by a pair of band edge (BE) filters. Oddly, there is remarkably little information in the literature on the ability of the band edge filter to support the modulation timing acquisition. In this paper we show how the band edge filter can support two synchronization tasks of carrier frequency acquisition and modulation timing acquisition. We present a receiver architecture and demonstrate its ability to acquire carrier frequency and timing phase alignment without data aided observations.	align (company);carrier frequency;edge detection;embedded system;frequency offset;modulation;phase-locked loop;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing)	Fred Harris;Elettra Venosa;Xiaofei Chen;Chris Dick	2012	The 15th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications		frequency modulation;continuous phase modulation;beat frequency oscillator;superheterodyne receiver;synchronization;intermediate frequency;frequency drift;radio transmitter design;real-time computing;phase-locked loop;quadrature amplitude modulation;voltage-controlled oscillator;frequency synthesizer;telecommunications;amplitude modulation;computer science;carrier recovery;frequency deviation;frequency offset;software-defined radio;baseband;radio receiver design;maximum likelihood;direct-conversion receiver;demodulation;radio receiver;modulation	Embedded	51.838233890907695	78.74725364120823	8025

The performance metric is the received SNR (directly related to the Shannon capacity for an AWGN channel). This """"coherence metric"""" is maximized when each transmitter compensates its channel phase to the receiver, while transmitting at maximum allowable power. In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed transmit beam-forming over broadband, frequency selective channels, defining the coherence metric as the Shannon capacity, to be maximized subject to a power constraint at each transmitter. OFDM provides a natural decomposition of such channels into narrowband subchannels, hence the problem reduces to determining how each transmitter allocates its power across subchannels. A key technical result is that the optimal solution obeys a separation property that significantly simplifies computation. We show that it differs from classical water-filling due to the per-transmitter power constraints of the distributed beamforming setting. We compare it both structurally and numerically, to a centralized beamforming system with power constraint across transmitters. This is like waterfilling and upper bounds the performance of our setup."""	additive white gaussian noise;align (company);beamforming;centralized computing;channel capacity;computation;expectation–maximization algorithm;numerical analysis;shannon capacity of a graph;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Sairam Goguri;Raghuraman Mudumbai;D.

Novel classes of soft-decision multistage detectors are proposed and analyzed. Each class is specified in part by a soft-decision nonlinearity, such as a symmetric quantizer or a linear clipper. Closed-form expressions for two-user AMEs are derived for soft-decision two-stage detectors and can be used as a design criterion to optimize the soft-decision nonlinearities. For a special case of two synchronous users, the soft-decision two-stage detector using an optimized linear clipper with either conventional or decorrelated tentative decisions is shown to achieve optimum AME. Upper and lower bounds on the AME are obtained for decision-feedback detectors using either conventional or decorrelated tentative decisions. It is demonstrated that decision-directed multiuser detectors with conventional tentative decisions have low near-far resistance compared to those with decorrelated tentative decisions.	multiuser dos;sensor	Xuming Zhang;David Brady	1998	IEEE Trans.

The rate of CAMs received by each vehicle can be high, and due to limited resources in series vehicles their processing is an open challenge. Following previous work, we present an improved relevance estimation function which calculates a relevance value for each received message based on basic information like position, speed, and heading without map data. Other than before, the new function incorporates non-static movement extrapolation of vehicles. We evaluate the newly proposed function using a receiver-centric approach.	cooperative mimo;course (navigation);diagram;extrapolation;relevance;series and parallel circuits	Jakob Breu;Michael Menth	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-06644-8_5	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	5.578262720210867	86.64086031356324	8044

The network consists of a two-antenna transmitter and two single-antenna receivers, each demanding a confidential message from the transmitter. The problem is investigated with mixed channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), which is a combination of perfect delayed CSIT and inaccurate current CSIT. When the variance of the estimation error for the current CSIT scales with O(P-α), with α ∈ [0, 1], it is shown that the optimal sum SDOF of the considered BCC is 1+α. Furthermore, the optimal SDOF region of the considered MISO BCC is shown to be a polygon scaling with α. The proposed scheme is based on an artificial noise alignment that can combine the benefits of both types of delayed and current CSIT. These results can be seen as an extension of results of Yang et al. and Gou-Jafar to multiuser networks with secrecy constraints.	bricx command center;channel state information;confidentiality;image scaling;interference (communication);multi-user;radio jamming;smoothing;system analysis;transmitter;yang	Zhao Wang;Ming Xiao;Mikael Skoglund;H.

Extending the system lifetime while preserving good network performance is one of the main challenges in WSNs. In this paper, a novel MAC protocol (QL-MAC) based on Q-Learning is proposed. Thanks to a distributed learning approach, the radio sleep-wakeup schedule is able to adapt to the network traffic load. The simulation results show that QL-MAC provides significant improvements in terms of network lifetime and packet delivery ratio with respect to standard MAC protocols. Moreover, the proposed protocol has a moderate computational complexity so to be suitable for practical deployments in currently available WSNs.	q-learning	Stefano Galzarano;Antonio Liotta;Giancarlo Fortino	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-03889-6_31	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.301868972541632	86.93270965332235	8069

Decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is an efficient approach to combating the ISI. Recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with a constant forgetting factor is often used to update the tap-coefficient vector of the DFE for ISI-free transmission. However, using a constant forgetting factor may not yield the optimal performance in a nonstationary environment. In this paper, an adaptive algorithm is developed to obtain a time-varying forgetting factor. The forgetting factor is used with the RLS algorithm in a DFE for calculating the tap-coefficient vector in order to minimize the squared equalization error due to input noise and due to channel dynamics. The algorithm is derived based on the argument that, for optimal filtering, the equalization errors should be uncorrelated. The adaptive forgetting factor can be obtained based on on-line equalization error measurements. Computer simulation results demonstrate that better transmission performance can be achieved by using the RLS algorithm with the adaptive forgetting factor than that with a constant forgetting factor previously proposed for optimal steady-state performance or a variable forgetting factor for a near deterministic system.	adaptive algorithm;bit error rate;catastrophic interference;coefficient;computer simulation;equalization (communications);information sciences institute;interference (communication);multipath propagation;online and offline;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;software propagation;steady state;x.690	Weihua Zhuang	1998	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1023/A:1008856607190	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;wireless	Mobile	49.739501789862956	75.5014769900714	8077

The swarm implementation is simplified with respect to other known implementations (e.g. BitTorrent) by discarding the coordination mechanism between the peers, relying only on the linear encoding to still provide an efficient content dissemination inside the swarm. Two approaches are explored, one applies the linear coding only at the sources, while the second relies on network coding. The performances provided are assessed in several significant scenarios, by simulations in OMNET++, considering the average download time as the main metric, other metrics being also taken into consideration. The results show that the first approach is not viable, while the one based on network coding allows an efficient data dissemination inside the swarm, for various underlying network topologies. The second approach is simulated using also topologies which favor certain groups of clients due to clustering. The results show that the entire swarm network is positively influenced in such cases.	bittorrent;client (computing);cluster analysis;coding theory;digital distribution;download;entity;linear code;linear network coding;network topology;performance;simulation;swarm	Anghel Botos;Vasile Bota;Mihai Petru Stef	2011	2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing	10.1109/ICCP.2011.6047907	linear network coding;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	-2.6396131442679573	86.37102915408049	8100

Contrarily to existing approaches based on heuristic arguments, in this work we pose the problem in a more formal way. In particular, we explore the problem of how to derive routing policies which minimize the path predictability whilst observing certain QoS restrictions. We show how deriving optimal routing strategies can be couched as a nonlinear optimization problem with linear constraints. A convenient reformulation allows us to attack it very efficiently with a numerical least square error solver. Overall, the resulting scheme is an adaptive multipath routing protocol which provides the optimal balance between uninformativeness of routing patterns and end-to-end communication costs.	decorrelation;end-to-end principle;heuristic;mathematical optimization;multipath routing;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;solver;while	Juan E.

In this paper, the performance of the cell-search scheme is analyzed in Rayleigh fading channels. The system parameters for the cell-search scheme and the design parameters for the receivers are examined. Probabilities of detection, false alarm, and miss for each of the three steps are derived in closed form based on the statistics of CDMA noncoherent demodulator output. Through the analysis, the effect of threshold setting and post-detection integration for each step is investigated and the power allocation for the channels is considered. The optimal number of post-detection integrations for each step may depend on not only the power allocation for the channels related to the cell search, but also the false-alarm penalty time. Our analysis can be utilized for determining the values of the parameters. Also, the cumulative probability distribution of the average cell-search time is obtained. Finally, it is shown that the analysis could be used to obtain the distribution of the cell-search time graphically according to the distance between a mobile station and a base station by considering the propagation models for pass loss and the traffic distribution models.	profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading	Moon Kyou Song;Vijay K.

The queue has finite or infinite buffer capacity with multiple exponential servers. A Markovmodulated Poisson process is used to represent an aggregated voice or video packet arrival process in integrated services networks. By overload control, we mean to properly adapt the arrival process once the buffer contents exceed a designated level. The probability distribution of queue length as a function of time is obtained. The temporal effect of the overload control is measured in two forms. While in overload, we measure the amount of time for the queue to fall into underload. While in underload, we measure the amount of time for the queue to rise to overload. A proper design of the control will not only reduce the fall time but also increase the rise time. We also explore the transient queueing behavior as affected by time stochastic properties of the underlying Markov chain for the arrival process.	fall time;integrated services;markov chain;modulation;network packet;rise time;time complexity	Duan-Shin Lee;San-qi Li	1991		10.1109/INFCOM.1991.147639	probability distribution;markov chain;national electrical code;real-time computing;multilevel queue;bulk queue;computer science;control system;probability;distributed computing;fork–join queue;markov process;queueing theory;steady state;theory;packet switching;multiplexing;markovian arrival process;statistics;time;computer network	Metrics	-0.56370061089766	98.23903801855629	8158

Under such a routing protocol, we can derive a route to satisfy bandwidth requirement for quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In our simulations the QoS routing protocol produces higher throughput, lower delay and services more sessions than its best-effort counterpart. In addition, it is more applicable to real environment of Ad-hoc network and can support more mobility than other QoS routing protocols.	hoc (programming language);quality of service;routing	Min Liu;Zhongcheng Li;Jinglin Shi;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Raad Raad	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27767-5_21	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;mobile computing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.6839533540437912	103.25136271937748	8196

In this paper, we propose a joint space-frequency-power scheduling algorithm (JSFP) for real time service in multiuser cellular MIMO-OFDM system which jointly optimizes the subcarrier, bit and power allocation in the PHY layer along with the scheduling in the MAC layer to exploit the multiuser diversity. This algorithm considers both the user equipments (UE)' QoS requirements (such as packet delay and packet loss ratio) and the UEs' channel conditions and includes three parts: packet scheduling, subcarrier allocation and antenna selection, power allocation. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant system performance improvement compared with the conventional methods.	access control;algorithm;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;network packet;next-generation network;numerical method;phy (chip);quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;subcarrier	Feng Jiang;Jianchi Zhu;Guona Hu;Ying Wang;Guangyi Liu;Ping Zhang	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.543	spectrum;educational technology;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;radio spectrum;diversity scheme;scheduling;physical layer;wireless;computer network	Mobile	31.138048853765817	89.89348857752702	8229

Crossbar networks can be categorized into three major topological classes: full-crossbar networks, multistage interconnection networks (MINs), and networks consisting of multiple levels of full crossbar connections, called hierarchical crossbar interconnection networks (HCINs). A significant amount of previous work exists in the area of performance modeling of systems with full-crossbar networks or multistage interconnection networks. However, performance modeling of multicomputer systems with HCINs has not been widely studied. This paper presents both analytical and simulation models for performance evaluation of an HCIN based on the commercial Mercury RACEway crossbar switch. The effective data transfer rate for message passing is taken as the primary performance metric and the models predict how this metric varies with the traffic load on the system. The analytical results are compared to the simulation results for different standard configurations of Mercury RACE Multicomputer Systems.

0571ff8d8c051e66795b0d13379bd5993d76feab	sensor deployment in bayesian compressive sensing based environmental monitoring		Sensor networks play crucial roles in the environmental monitoring. So far, the large amount of resource consumption in traditional sensor networks has been a huge challenge for environmental monitoring. Compressive sensing (CS) provides us a method to significantly decrease the number of sensors needed and Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) makes it possible to deploy sensors selectively rather than randomly. By deploying sensors to the most informative places, we expect to reduce the reconstruction errors further compared with random sensor deployment. In this paper we employ multiple sensor deployment algorithms and BCS based signal recovery algorithm to build novel environmental monitoring systems, in which the environmental signals can be recovered accurately with undersampled measurements. Besides, we apply these environmental monitoring models to ozone data experiments to evaluate them and compare their performance. The results show a significant improvement in the recovery accuracy from random sensor deployment to selective sensor deployment. With 100 measurements for 16641 data points, the reconstruction error of one of the sensor deployment approaches was 40 % less than that of random sensor deployment, with 3.52 % and 6.08 % respectively.	algorithm;compressed sensing;data point;detection theory;experiment;information;randomness;sensor;software deployment	Chao Wu;Di Wu;Shulin Yan;Yike Guo	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-11569-6_4	compressed sensing;software deployment;environmental monitoring;remote sensing;environmental science	Mobile	11.99770992809552	74.00368564723142	8261
f21703e5c2674908c065ab6315f30de2060a5a91	robust bayesian learning for wireless rf energy harvesting networks		In this paper, the problem of adversarial learning is studied for a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) in which a hybrid access point (HAP) seeks to learn the transmission power consumption profile of an associated wireless transmitter. The objective of the HAP is to use the learned estimate in order to determine the transmission power of the energy signal to be supplied to its associated device. However, such a learning scheme is subject to attacks by an adversary who tries to alter the HAP's learned estimate of the transmission power distribution in order to minimize the HAP's supplied energy. To build a robust estimate against such attacks, an unsupervised Bayesian learning method is proposed allowing the HAP to perform its estimation based only on the advertised transmisson power computed in each time slot. The proposed robust learning method relies on the assumption that the device's true transmission power is greater than or equal to advertised value. Then, based on the robust estimate, the problem of power selection of the energy signal by the HAP is formulated. The HAP optimal power selection problem is shown to be a discrete convex optimization problem, and a closed-form solution of the HAP's optimal transmission power is obtained. The results show that the proposed robust Bayesian learning scheme yields significant performance gains, by reducing the percentage of dropped transmitter's packets of about 85% compared to a conventional Bayesian learning approach. The results also show that these performance gains are achieved without jeopardizing the energy consumption of the HAP.	adversary (cryptography);concave function;convex optimization;malware;man-in-the-middle attack;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;security hacker;selection algorithm;telecommunications network;transmitter;wireless access point	Nof Abuzainab;Walid Saad;Behrouz Maham	2017	2017 15th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.23919/WIOPT.2017.7959919	quality of service;computer network;computer science;energy consumption;convex optimization;adversary;transmitter;wireless ad hoc network;network packet;bayesian inference	Mobile	33.94830970367662	83.82360649286107	8282

However, it was identified that specific implementations of Add-Compare-Select unit for the Viterbi Algorithm demonstrate the decoding performance that depends on proportion of elements in the input message. It is conjectured that the modern commercial hard- and software defined communication equipment may also feature similar implementation and as such their decoding performance could also vary.	binary number;convolutional code;gnu radio;simulink;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Alexey Shapin;Denis Kleyko;Nikita Lyamin;Evgeny Osipov;Oleg Melentyev	2018	2018 XIV International Scientific-Technical Conference on Actual Problems of Electronics Instrument Engineering (APEIE)		soft output viterbi algorithm;parallel computing;viterbi algorithm;convolutional code;software;viterbi decoder;implementation;real-time computing;decoding methods;sequential decoding;computer science	SE	44.03333233606746	63.26134328750856	8284

Recently, a new MMSE-FDE technique that requires no GI insertion has been proposed to avoid inter-block interference (IBI) (this technique is called overlap FDE). However, the residual IBI is produced and degrades the BER performance. Furthermore, the presence of an inter-chip interference (ICI) after MMSE-FDE limits the BER performance improvement. In this paper, we propose an iterative overlap FDE for DS-CDMA downlink to suppress both IBI and ICI. In the iterative overlap FDE, joint MMSE-FDE and ICI cancellation is repeated a sufficient number of times and the middle part of M chips is picked up. The BER performance with the iterative overlap FDE is evaluated by computer simulation.	adobe framemaker;bit error rate;computer simulation;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mean squared error;rake;telecommunications link;x.690	Kazuaki Takeda;Hiromichi Tomeba;Fumiyuki Adachi	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.423	computer simulation;chip;minimum mean square error;code division multiple access;adjacent-channel interference;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;spread spectrum;computer network	EDA	47.49305969646206	78.91109715332252	8312
5df8d5cd34f4654238af99f1d36226fafbf3ad8e	nash bargaining solution based rendezvous guidance of unmanned aerial vehicles		This paper addresses a finite-time rendezvous problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in the absence of a leader or a reference trajectory. When the UAVs do not cooperate, they are assumed to use Nash equilibrium strategies (NES). However, when the UAVs can communicate among themselves, they can implement cooperative game theoretic strategies for mutual benefit. In a convex linear quadratic differential game (LQDG), a Pareto-optimal solution (POS) is obtained when the UAVs jointly minimize a team cost functional, which is constructed through a convex combination of individual cost functionals. This paper proposes an algorithm to determine the convex combination of weights corresponding to the Pareto-optimal Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), which offers each UAV a lower cost than that incurred from the NES. Conditions on the cost functions that make the proposed algorithm converge to the NBS are presented. A UAV, programmed to choose its strategies at a given time based upon cost-to-go estimates for the rest of the game duration, may switch to NES finding it to be more beneficial than continuing with a cooperative strategy it previously agreed upon with the other UAVs. For such scenarios, a renegotiation method, that makes use of the proposed algorithm to obtain the NBS corresponding to the state of the game at an intermediate time, is proposed. This renegotiation method helps to establish cooperation between UAVs and prevents non-cooperative behaviour. In this context, the conditions of time consistency of a cooperative solution have been derived in connection to LQDG. The efficacy of the guidance law derived from the proposed algorithm is illustrated through simulations.

Under general power constraints, it is shown that the non-convex design problem can be converted into a quasi-convex optimization problem composed of convex subproblems. The properties of the optimal covariance matrices are examined. Under the individual power constraint, beamforming is shown to be optimal, and the design problem is reduced to a problem with two real variables. The performances of the NF scheme and the artificial noise (AN) scheme are compared. The design of a hybrid scheme consisting of the NF and AN techniques is also addressed.	beamforming;code word;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;performance;radio jamming	Han-Ting Chiang;James S.

dcbafdaeb26aa8b1e7f6e10ef6e7b3835469640c	a cluster-based fuzzy fusion algorithm for event detection in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks	期刊论文	As limited energy is one of the tough challenges in wireless sensor networks (WSN), energy saving becomes important in increasing the lifecycle of the network. Data fusion enables combining information from several sources thus to provide a unified scenario, which can significantly save sensor energy and enhance sensing data accuracy. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based data fusion algorithm for event detection. We use -means algorithm to form the nodes into clusters, which can significantly reduce the energy consumption of intracluster communication. Distances between cluster heads and event and energy of clusters are fuzzified, thus to use a fuzzy logic to select the clusters that will participate in data uploading and fusion. Fuzzy logic method is also used by cluster heads for local decision, and then the local decision results are sent to the base station. Decision-level fusion for final decision of event is performed by base station according to the uploaded local decisions and fusion support degree of clusters calculated by fuzzy logic method. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results.	algorithm	Zi-Qi Hao;Zhen-Jiang Zhang;Han-Chieh Chao	2015	J.

The use of OFDM causes a high peak-to-average (power) ratio (PAR), which necessitates expensive and power-inefficient radio-frequency (RF) components at the base station. In this paper, we present a novel downlink transmission scheme, which exploits the massive degrees-of-freedom available in large-scale MU-MIMO-OFDM systems to achieve low PAR. Specifically, we propose to jointly perform MU precoding, OFDM modulation, and PAR reduction by solving a convex optimization problem. We develop a corresponding fast iterative truncation algorithm (FITRA) and show numerical results to demonstrate tremendous PAR-reduction capabilities. The significantly reduced linearity requirements eventually enable the use of low-cost RF components for the large-scale MU-MIMO-OFDM downlink.	algorithm;analytical engine;computational complexity theory;continuation;convex optimization;experiment;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);iterative method;kernel (linear algebra);mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;modulation;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;numerical analysis;numerical method;open research;optimization problem;out-of-band agreement;radio frequency;requirement;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;truncation	Christoph Studer;Erik G.

A side-channel analysis (SCA) attack takes advantage of implementation specific characteristics to recover the secret parameters involved in the computation. The goals of side-channel attack countermeasures are reducing the correlation between the side-channel data and the secret data. Data masking is one of the most powerful countermeasure against side channel attacks. The message and the key are masked with some random values at the beginning of computations. We have implemented the AES algorithm on an FPGA by using two different masking method: multiplicative and additive.	1-bit architecture;algorithm;clock rate;combinational logic;computation;data masking;encryption;flops;field-programmable gate array;key schedule;key stretching;multiplexing;side-channel attack;utility functions on indivisible goods;virtex (fpga)	Levent Ordu;Siddika Berna Ors Yalcin	2007	2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511263	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	EDA	11.57747404466076	63.7214667501486	8387

Recent studies have shown that antenna selection transmission (AST) is preferable to maximum ratio transmission (MRT) in a multicell DAS environment, owing to its interference reduction. However, it is obvious that users still suffer from strong interference at the cell edge when applying universal frequency reuse in DAS. We propose an efficient cooperative beamforming transmission (CBT) algorithm, whose basic idea is taking the distributed transmitting antennas within a cell and receiving antennas including desired users and adjacent cells' interfered users, as a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) channel, by which CBT mitigates the interference through joint precoding. We analyze the proposed algorithm mathematically and compare it with other existing algorithms. A Monte-Carlo simulation is also carried out to verify the derivation. Both the analysis and simulation results show that the CBT algorithm outperforms both AST and MRT especially near the cell edge.	algorithm;beamforming;cooperative mimo;core-based trees;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;monte carlo method;simulation;transmitter	Lei Zhong;Yusheng Ji;Min Gong;Fuqiang Liu	2010		10.1145/1815396.1815639	3g mimo;telecommunications;precoding;statistics;monte carlo method	Mobile	37.91822780226841	82.91872408616686	8404

The DSECCC-ID scheme is designed with the aid of binary Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts. The source node transmits SECCC symbols to both the relay and the destination nodes during the first transmission period. The relay performs SECCC-ID decoding. It then re-encodes the information bits using a Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) code during the second transmission period. The resultant symbols transmitted from the source and relay nodes can be viewed as the coded symbols of a three-component parallel-concatenated SECCC-ID encoder. At the destination node, threecomponent DSECCC-ID decoding is performed. It is shown that the performance of the DSECCC-ID exactly matches the EXIT chart analysis. The EXIT chart gives us an insight into operation of the distributed coding scheme which enables us to significantly reduce the transmit power of the system.	caller id;cognitive dimensions of notations;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;consensus dynamics;convolutional code;exit chart;encoder;id-wsf;parity bit;recursion (computer science);relay;resultant;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Muhammad Fasih Uddin Butt;Raja Ali Riaz;Soon Xin Ng;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378714	convolutional code;real-time computing;information transfer;electrical efficiency;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;trajectory;theoretical computer science;exit chart;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;statistics	Mobile	43.459510780384086	68.94563890899967	8408

2fa8b0d63261103f110767f8f7c26efdd96c13f4	debts: delay energy balanced task scheduling in homogeneous fog networks		"""Vehicular ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things, and mobile device-to-device communications can be modeled as different homogeneous fog networks, wherein similar terminals/things/devices/nodes are sharing their computation, communication, and storage resources in the neighborhood for achieving better system performance through effective collaborations. It is very desirable, but quite challenging, to simultaneously reduce service delay and energy consumption in such networks for delay-sensitive and energy-constraint applications, e.g., virtual reality and online 3-D gaming on mobile devices. In this paper, a cross-layer analytical framework is developed to formulate and study the balance between service delay and energy consumption. An effective control parameter <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${V}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is derived to characterize their tradeoff relationship during dynamic task scheduling processes in fog networks. Combining this analysis with Lyapunov optimization techniques, a novel delay energy balanced tasking scheduling (DEBTS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall energy consumption while reducing average service delay and delay jitter. It is proved that DEBTS can achieve the theoretical [<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${O(1/V), O(V)}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>] tradeoff between these two performance metrics. Further, extensive simulation results show that DEBTS can offer much better delay-energy performance in task scheduling challenges. Specifically, for a typical <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${V}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> value of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${4 \times 10^{4}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, DEBTS can save 26% and 29% more energy, and at the same time, reduce average service delay by 29% and 32%, than traditional random scheduling and least busy scheduling algorithms, respectively."""	computation;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;hoc (programming language);internet of things;like button;lyapunov optimization;many-to-many;mathematical optimization;mobile device;packet delay variation;partition matroid;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);semantic network;simulation;social inequality;submodular set function;virtual reality	Yang Yang;Shuang Zhao;Wuxiong Zhang;Yu Chen;Xiliang Luo;Jun Wang	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2018.2823000	task analysis;distributed computing;wireless sensor network;energy consumption;computer science;scheduling (computing);homogeneous;lyapunov optimization;jitter;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	17.74589341607243	93.22353636124849	8425
9884e578b83eed0d20cdebfefd1e1d380f2a132b	connectivity-aware minimum-delay geographic routing with vehicle tracking in vanets	vehicular ad hoc network (vanet);geographic routing protocol;connectivity awareness	In this paper, we propose the connectivity-aware minimum-delay geographic routing (CMGR) protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which adapts well to continuously changing network status in such networks. When the network is sparse, CMGR takes the connectivity of routes into consideration in its route selection logic to maximize the chance of packet reception. On the other hand, in situations with dense network nodes, CMGR determines the routes with adequate connectivity and selects among them the route with the minimum delay. The performance limitations of CMGR in special vehicular networking situations are studied and addressed. These situations, which include the case where the target vehicle has moved away from its expected location and the case where traffic in a road junction is so sparse that no next-hop vehicle can be found on the intended out-going road, are also problematic in most routing protocols for VANETs. Finally, the proposed protocol is compared with two plausible geographic connectivity-aware routing protocols for VANETs, A-STAR and VADD. The obtained results show that CMGR outperforms A-STAR and VADD in terms of both packet delivery ratio and ratio of dropped data packets. For example, under the specific conditions considered in the simulations, when the maximum allowable one-way transmission delay is 1min and one gateway is deployed in the network, the packet delivery ratio of CMGR is approximately 25% better than VADD and A-STAR for high vehicle densities and goes up to 900% better for low vehicle densities.	geographic routing;vehicle tracking system	Kaveh Shafiee;Victor C.

f648f6c30f1fb0bfc95b47d7ea75e1bf533925c1	multi-layer downlink precoding for cloud-ran systems using full-dimensional massive mimo		Full-dimensional (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has recently emerged as one of the physical layer enablers of 5G systems. Grounded on prior work on layered precoding, a novel framework for low-complexity multi-layer downlink precoding in multi-cluster cloud radio access network (C-RAN) systems using FD massive MIMO is introduced in this paper. The precoding matrix used at the cluster of remote radio heads (RRHs) associated to a given central control unit (CCU) of the C-RAN is decoupled as a multiplication of three precoding sub-matrices (or layers), a precoding architecture that leverages the special characteristics of the elevation component of the channel correlation matrix to manage both the C-RAN inter-cluster interference and the massive MIMO pilot contamination based on the availability of statistical channel state information. The proposed multi-layer approach is then adapted to the compress-after-precoding-based CCU-RRH functional split where the first and second precoding layers are locally applied at each of the RRHs in a cluster, whereas only the third precoding layer is implemented at the CCU. Optimal and suboptimal solutions are provided, which take into account both the per-RRH transmit power constraints and the capacity constraints of the fronthaul links between the CCU and the associated RRHs. The suboptimal approach, which is rooted on the vector normalization techniques used in massive MIMO precoding schemes with uniform power allocation, is shown to provide minor spectral efficiency losses when compared with the optimal solution. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the potential of the proposed C-RAN-based framework when benchmarked against the classical FD massive MIMO scheme.	c-ran;ccu delivery;channel state information;computational fluid dynamics;control unit;interference (communication);layer (electronics);mimo;numerical linear algebra;radio access network;remote radio head;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Guillem Femenias;Felip Riera-Palou	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876231	elevation;channel state information;mimo;architecture;precoding;physical layer;computer science;distributed computing;spectral efficiency;communication channel	Metrics	31.585990159116374	90.73671900434461	8451

A formula that tightly bounds the mean squared error of the universal coding system as afuuction of the time between codebook transmissions is experimentally verified and found to be tight, and a new and simpler derivation is given. Other research in the literature has proposed vector quantizing the transmitted codebooks; one conclusion we prove here is that under some reasonable conditions uniform scalar quantization of the transmitted codehooks performs as well as vector quantizing them.

In the first phase, the information packets are encoded with batched sparse (BATS) code, which are then broadcasted by the source node until the file can be cooperatively decoded by the user group. In the second phase, each user broadcasts the re-encoded packets to its peers based on their respective received packets from the first phase, so that the file can be decoded by each individual user. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed and the rank distribution at the moment of decoding is derived, which is used as input for designing the optimal BATS code. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the total number of retransmissions compared with the traditional single-phase broadcast with optimal erasure codes. Furthermore, since a large number of transmissions are shifted from the source node to the users, power consumptions at the source node is significantly reduced.	erasure code;simulation;sparse matrix;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Xiaoli Xu;Meenakshi Sundaram Gandhi Praveen Kumar;Yong Liang Guan	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248627	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	32.346907744117814	74.19507218718871	8463

Commonly used method to obtain initial population is to perturb the input chromosome randomly, which fails to fully exploit the effective information delivered by input chromosome. This paper proposes a kind of Hamming Sphere Solution Space based Genetic Multi-User Detector (HSSSGMUD), which constructs the initial population in a simple but effective manner. Firstly, select the input chromosome, and regard it as the center of a sphere in PK dimensions space, where P is data packet length and K is user numbers in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system. Then, the concept of Hamming sphere space is used to obtain other chromosomes of initial population. Simulation results show the proposed HSSSGMUD not only achieves lower Bit Error Ratio (BER) and better near-far resistant ability, but also converges quickly.	feasible region;multi-user;window function	Lili Lin	2006		10.1007/11893295_84	code division multiple access;hamming distance;genetic algorithm;telecommunications;hamming bound;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;hamming(7,4);artificial neural network;algorithm;sphere	Robotics	48.672312435140284	70.42877399512047	8493
300b2198e916320f1089ae87f28a3b03ab64499b	novel high performance scheduling algorithms for crosspoint buffered crossbar switches		The crossbar-based switch fabric is widely used in today’s high performance switches, due to its internally nonblocking and simply implementation properties. Usually there are two main switching architectures for crossbar-based switch fabric: internally bufferless crossbar switch and crosspoint buffered crossbar switch. As internally bufferless crossbar switch requires a complex centralized scheduler which limits its scalability to high speeds, crosspoint buffered crossbar switch has gained more attention because of its simpler distributed scheduling algorithm and better switching performance. However, almost all the scheduling algorithms proposed previously for crosspoint buffered crossbar switch either have unsatisfactory scheduling performance under non-uniform traffic patterns or show poor service fairness between input traffic flows. In order to overcome the disadvantages of existing algorithms, in this paper we propose two novel high performance scheduling algorithms named MCQF RR and IMCQF RR for crosspoint buffered crossbar switches. Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of input/output ports of the switch. MCQF RR takes advantage of the combined weight information about queue length and service waiting time of input queues to perform scheduling. In order to further reduce the scheduling complexity and make it feasible for high speed switches, IMCQF RR uses the compressed queue length information instead of original queue length information to schedule cells in input VOQs. Simulation results show that our novel scheduling algorithms MCQF RR and IMCQF RR can demonstrate excellent delay performance comparable to existing high performance scheduling algorithms under both uniform and non-uniform traffic patterns, while maintain good service fairness performance under severe non-uniform traffic patterns. key words: crosspoint buffered crossbar switches, scheduling, delay, fairness	algorithm;centralized computing;crossbar switch;fairness measure;input/output;network switch;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;time complexity	Xiaoting Wang;Yiwen Wang;Shichao Li;Ping Li	2015	IEICE Transactions		parallel computing;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	HPC	0.17696130966868323	93.65611096538225	8510

The comparison between the two algorithms is based on the computational complexity and resources. The computational complexity of the two algorithms is analyzed by simulation of the TDE and FDE at at two levels of abstraction: the design specification based on floating point arithmetics using Simulink, and the design implementation based on fixed point arithmetics using Xilinx's System Generator tool. The models are used to measure both floating-point and fixed-point signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) errors based on the two algorithms and provide error estimation for the design specification and design implementation. We analyze the resources used in the implementation of the two algorithms by providing FPGA implementations in System Generator. Our analysis shows that the FDE is more efficient in terms of computational complexity and resources.	adobe framemaker;algorithm;computational complexity theory;design flow (eda);equalization (communications);error analysis (mathematics);fast fourier transform;field-programmable gate array;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;least mean squares filter;mathematical model;performance evaluation;principle of abstraction;profiling (computer programming);signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;simulink;transparent data encryption	Anis Souari;Mohamed Lassaad Ammari;Amjad Gawanmeh;Sofiène Tahar	2014	2014 IEEE 27th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2014.6901121	electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	EDA	46.838758309259696	79.06722684517732	8516

The classical correlation receiver which is adapted to Gaussian noise, is not adapted to the particular form of UWB MUI and is often far from the performance computed through the standard Gaussian approximation. We show that modeling MUI by a generalized Gaussian distribution helps in deriving a simple receiver which increases the performances and may also outperform the standard Gaussian approximation which was considered formerly to be too optimistic.	approximation;gaussian blur;magic user interface;multi-user;performance;ultra-wideband	Jocelyn Fiorina	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.776	normal distribution;gaussian noise;telecommunications;mathematics;generalized normal distribution;radio receiver;statistics	ML	42.9128037187534	75.71387470593685	8529

As real measurements in these scenarios are not possible yet, the objective is to obtain results as realistic as possible to support the design of future satellite missions performing QKD. Therefore, we use realistic values for the optical hardware and take into account usual atmospheric conditions. In the same line, we assume specific types of attacks, namely the photon number splitting and the intercept-resend with unambiguous discrimination attacks, which could likely be the main threat to the first satellite-based QKD applications. A lower bound on the key generation rate of SARG04 with two decoy states is presented. The optimum signal- and decoy-states mean photon numbers for each protocol and each distance are also computed. The resulting values for the signal-state are larger than those often employed. We show that it may be possible to establish QKD with LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and, under certain circumstances, with MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites, but not with GEO (Geostationary) ones. Furthermore, we obtain that the optimum signal-state mean photon number for SARG04 with two decoy states is almost independent of the link distance, which greatly facilitates its use in a real scenario.	bb84;decoy state;fock state;geosynchronous satellite;key generation;link distance;list of quantum key distribution protocols;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);quantum cryptography;retransmission (data networks);sarg04;visual intercept	L.

The transmission power and rate of each user will be adjusted to maximize its own net-utility according to the states of channel, which results in a balance between the effective transmission rate and power consumption. Although the UPRA works based on a non-cooperative game, cooperation among users can be achieved so that the throughput of the whole network will be improved. The convergence of the algorithm has also been studied in both feasible and infeasible cases.	adaptive algorithm;effective transmission rate;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);maximum power transfer theorem;network performance;requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;softening;throughput;utility	Jialing Zheng;Maode Ma	2007	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.132	wireless ad hoc network;game theory;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	34.26131874086476	87.95839981408066	8580

This proposed alternative of the state-of-the-art architectures presents an unprecedented integration of all radar sensing and RadCom functions together in a time-division platform. Furthermore, it is capable of offering a positioning function of both moving and static objects with an enhanced resolution in ranging in addition to providing a greater capability of data communication. The design and the performance incompatibilities between radar and radio systems are explored and investigated. A systematic top-bottom approach is presented, which involves the step-by-step methodology, building block design considerations, and the system level simulation. With the purpose of validating the proposed scheme, a low-frequency prototype around the FCC-commissioned dedicated short range communication (DSRC) band is developed, and its performance is evaluated. Since such a unified transceiver can find applications in intelligent transportation infrastructures, the system demonstrator is designed and examined according to the desired specifications of future automotive radar networks. Through various system level measurements, the proposed scheme has demonstrated attractive features in connection with both radar and radio functions. With the radar mode, the added ability of angle detection and the improved range resolution against the previously demonstrated version make the system suitable for driving assistance applications. With the radio mode, the system demonstrator has proved a great capability of communication at a data rate of 25 Mb/s.	amd accelerated processing unit;data rate units;megabyte;multi-function printer;prototype;radar;simulation;transceiver	Jaber Moghaddasi;Ke Wu	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2530979	embedded system;man-portable radar;intelligent transportation system;radar configurations and types;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;electrical engineering;frequency agility;sensor fusion;digital radio frequency memory;computer security;computer network;transceiver	Mobile	22.82548162957034	77.9433654418013	8588
4b519188ad3d8c44eb9145ee9d97c37ffcb0bb88	subcarrier sharing scheme for overlay anc cooperative d2d communication in cellular networks		Device-to-device (D2D) is a new communication paradigm which has evolved recently to meet the capacity requirements of 4G/beyond 4G cellular networks. In a generic D2D framework, two cellular users living in close proximity can form a direct link for data transmission without routing it through the base station (BS). However control or signaling information between the users will still be carried out by the BS. In this paper, we augment the development of D2D communication by proposing an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based subcarrier sharing scheme to facilitate D2D communication between cellular users. Analytical expressions for outage probability for two different D2D frameworks namely overlay and cooperative D2D have been derived. Through the obtained results, we can determine the exact number of subcarriers available for D2D communication while fulfilling the target rate and outage probability constraint of cellular system. It also has been shown that for low cellular outage constraint, overlay performs better than cooperative D2D whereas for high cellular outage constraint, the cooperative D2D framework completely outperforms the overlay D2D framework.	downtime;frequency divider;inline linking;multiplexing;programming paradigm;relay;requirement;routing;simulation;subcarrier;sun outage	Naveen Gupta;Vivek Ashok Bohara	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2016.7947830	subcarrier;telecommunications link;data transmission;computer network;overlay;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;expression (mathematics);base station;computer science;distributed computing;cellular network	Mobile	30.101080567612755	89.28350820108007	8605

For a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based power control scheme, most previous work has been restricted to a single-cell system or to a multiple-cell system neglecting the effect of multipath fading. This paper is to give a theoretical foundation to the possible reverse link capacity of a multiple-cell system with perfect SIR-based power control, assuming two different multipath Rayleigh fading channel models: uniform and exponential power delay profiles. The effects of the numbers of resolvable propagation paths and Rake fingers, and other system parameters such as the required , the processing gain, and the maximum allowable transmit power of a mobile station, are investigated. The results are compared between singleand multiple-cell systems. When the number of resolvable paths is one or the number of Rake fingers is one, the link capacity becomes zero in a multiple-cell environment. This can be avoided by the use of antenna diversity. Antenna diversity reception is found to linearly increase the link capacity as the number of antennas increases.	interference (communication);multipath propagation;process gain;rake;rayleigh fading;software propagation;telecommunications link;time complexity	Duk Kyung Kim;Fumiyuki Adachi	2001	IEEE Trans.

This modified protocol prohibited the direct forwarding of central nodes, balancing data traffic of different sensors between the source and the sink, and proved to be able of reducing total network flows, energy consumptions and prolonging the lifetime of the network through simulations.	data aggregation;data-directed programming;one-to-many (data model);real-time clock;routing;sensor;simulation	Hui Chen;Yufeng Shi;Ye Wang;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Naixue N.

However, at such high recording density, many new challenges from the magnetic recording medium, read/write head as well as writing and reading channels arise. These challenges hinder the realization of Tb/in2 hard disks and should be addressed. In this paper, we review these major challenges from a communication theory perspective, and propose ways to mitigate the channel impairments by using low-complexity two-dimensional (2D) channel detection, new low-density parity-check (LDPC) code design paradigm, as well as re-synchronizable coding schemes.	additive white gaussian noise;areal density (computer storage);disk storage;exit chart;hard disk drive;information sciences institute;low-density parity-check code;magnetic storage;microwave;monte carlo method;patterned media;programming paradigm;resultant;signal processing;simulation;software release life cycle;terabyte;web services for devices	Yong Liang Guan;Guojun Han;Lingjun Kong;Kheong Sann Chan;Kui Cai;JingPing Zheng	2014	2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785330	electronic engineering;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science	HPC	48.796737382320025	60.49704192582089	8660

In this context, the ICAO and EUROCONTROL are working on the standardization of IP-based aeronautical telecommunications network and future radio access technologies, respectively. With this work, for the first time, we integrate L-DACS 1, which is one candidate for future radio access technologies, with realistic IP-based network layer functionality and analyze the handover delay performance. We first investigate the effect of link layer retransmissions on handover delay performance. We realized that for regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (BER of 1e-3), link layer retransmissions improve the total handover delay (layer 2 and 3) by about 80%. Considering regions with high signal-to-noise ratio (BER of 1e-5), the benefit of link layer retransmissions becomes negligible due to the reduced number of packet losses. During our analysis, we notice frequent transmission of router advertisement messages causing significant overhead on L-DACS 1 and propose two approaches in order to decrease the overhead to an acceptable range. In the last section, we tackle the increase in handover delay due to a limited number of return link resource request opportunities in congested cells.	performance evaluation;proxy mobile ipv6	Serkan Ayaz;Felix Hoffmann;Christoph Sommer;Reinhard German;Falko Dressler	2010		10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684106	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-3.485544649487846	91.13092380334811	8679

A great amount of effort has been invested into research in this area, most of which relies heavily on simulation and analysis techniques. However, simulations do not precisely control hardware interrupts, packet timing and real physical and MAC layer behaviors. As a result, simulation results need to be validated by real implementations, which is evident by the change in focus of research activities increasingly moving towards real implementations, including the deployment of testbeds as a main tool to analyze network protocol functionality. Under this context, we present an overview of SCORPION (Santa Cruz mObile Radio Platform for Indoor and Outdoor Networks), a heterogeneous wireless networking testbed that includes a variety of nodes ranging from ground vehicles to autonomous aerial vehicles. The purpose of SCORPION to is to deploy and investigate nascent networking protocols using a variety of mobile platforms utilizing structured as well as unstructured mobility patterns.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;communications protocol;interrupt;mobile device;network packet;simulation;software deployment;testbed	S.

They are strictly less than the capacity of the channel when the peak-power constrain is removed and replaced by the average-power constraint, for which the Gaussian inputs are optimum. This provides the answer to an often-posed question: peak-power limiting in the case of bandlimited channels does reduce capacity, whereas in infinite bandwidth channels it does not, as is well known.

Such a scenario arises e.g. at music festivals, sport events or in emergency situations. In this context, we propose to serve the mobile stations in such a remote hotspot by user cooperation combined with traffic offloading. That is, the mobile stations shall form a virtual MIMO array and jointly access the WLAN access points in the surrounding. Based on numerical simulations with realistic parameters, the performance of the user cooperation scheme is evaluated and its interdependency with the local users assigned to the WLAN access points is investigated. It is thereby shown, that the performance of the local users strongly suffers from the hotspot traffic. Hence, two different schemes trading off the performance of the local users versus the performance of the mobile stations in the hotspot are proposed and evaluated.

While the conventional null subcarrier based methods estimate the CFO through a single global line search, the proposed method employs a two step procedure. Firstly the integer frequency offset is estimated by means of a cost function minimization over the trial integer offset values. Then the fractional frequency offset is estimated through a fine search over one subcarrier spacing on either side centered on zero offset reference after correcting the integer offset. We also propose a novel null subcarrier allocation scheme based on Fibonacci series, which ensures a CFO estimation range equal to the OFDM bandwidth. Furthermore, performance of the proposed frequency offset estimator is mathematically analyzed by deriving the Cramer-Rao lower bound and compared it with the mean square estimation error to demonstrate its efficiency. Our algorithm is shown to outperform a popular method reported in literature in terms of BER performance and estimation complexity.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;computational complexity theory;frequency divider;line search;loss function;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multiplexing;overhead (computing);semiconductor industry;subcarrier;x.690	S.

Proper monitoring interface is an essential prerequisite to adaptive system reconfiguration in parallel on-chip computing. This work proposes a DMC (dual monitoring communication) architecture to support self-awareness on the NoC platform. One type of monitoring communication is integrated with data channel, in order to trace the run-time profile of data communication in high-speed on-chip networking. The other type is separate from the data communication, and is needed to report the run-time profile to the supervising monitor. Direct latency monitoring on mesochronous NoC is presented as a case study and is directly traced in the integrated communication with a novel latency monitoring table in each router. The latency information is reported by the separate monitoring communication to the supervising monitor, which reconfigures the system to adjust the latency, for instance by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. With quantitative evaluation using synthetic traces and real applications, the effectiveness and efficiency of direct latency monitoring with DMC architecture is demonstrated. The area overhead of DMC architecture is estimated to be small in 65nm CMOS technology.

For one thing, parallel on-chip systems may need to run different applications, with various performance requirements. The details of applications are likely to be unknown at the design time. Secondly, a diversity of software might run on the system, which is likely to have different resource management schemes. Last but not least, the status of hardware becomes anything but predictable with the small transistor size. Variations (Miranda et al., 2009), for instance, significantly influence the hardware performance. Variations refer to the deviation of transistor sizes or metal wire dimensions from the nominal values. With considerable hardware variations, the system performance, such as speed and power consumption, and system dependability become dynamic and unpredictable. Autonomic computing (Horn, 2001) is a promising paradigm to cope with the dynamics of massively parallel processing. Self-adaptive computing belongs to the broad spectrum of autonomic computing, but has a narrower conceptual scope. Paraphrased from Salehie and Tahvildari (2009), a self-adaptive system evaluates its own behavior and changes the behavior when the evaluation indicates failure to achieve functional goals or performance optimization is achievable. This article addresses a specific aspect of self-adaptive computing: self-awareness. As the name itself suggests, a self-aware system is aware of its internal state (Hinchey & Sterritt, 2006). Self-awareness, as an essential part of self-adaptive computing, ensures the visibility of system status, based on which adaptation and optimization can be performed. To provide self-awareness, monitoring and diagnostic operations shall be designed in the system, which can dynamically trace the performance parameters and failures. In embedded system domain, common operations include the monitoring of execution speed, power and energy, errors and failures, as well as temperature. The work proposes a DMC (dual monitoring communication) architecture to support selfawareness in Network-on-Chips (NoCs). NoC is a scalable communication architecture for massively parallel, high-performance on-chip processing (Jantsch & Tenhunen, 2003; Vangal et al., 2008). Components are modularized as nodes in a network, which supports communication between parallel processing units. DMC provides the communication infrastructure for diagnostic and monitoring operations on NoCs. One monitoring communication is integrated with data channel, to trace the run-time profile, e.g., data value and latency, of data communication. The other monitoring communication is separate from the data channel, and is used to report monitoring information and transmit reconfiguration commands if necessary. DMC architecture is not dependent on network topologies and sizes, flow control schemes or other adaptive techniques, thus it is scalable and generically applicable to different NoC architectures. A case study, direct latency monitoring on mesochronous Network-on-Chip (NoC), is presented to demonstrate DMC architecture. Mesochronous timing is a special form of globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) timing (Dally & Poulton, 1997), in which different components run with the same frequency but unknown phase differences. The utilization of GALS timing for the NoC design provides significant improvement in design efficiency and power efficiency compared to synchronous design (Amde, Felicijan, Efthymiou, Edwards, & Lavagno, 2005), by eliminating the need of a global clock. Mesochronous NoC architecture is widely used in existing NoC prototypes, for instance the 80-tile Intel TeraFLOPS processor (Vangal et al., 2008). For such systems, accurate runt-time latency monitoring is challenging, since there is no global system clock. In this case study, the message latency is directly traced by the integrated monitoring communication, while the separate monitoring communication reports the latency to the supervising monitor. Local congestion is also monitored. The latency measurement is performed by distributed hardware, which is small and fast. It is a novel technique to monitor network performance in a scalable manner, and can be utilized for effective power/performance tradeoff.

IoT devices need to report their data or status to base stations at various frequencies. The IoT communications observed by a base station normally exhibit the following characteristics: (1) massively connected, (2) lightly loaded per packet, and (3) periodical or at least mostly predictable. The current design principals of communication networks, when applied to IoT scenarios, however, do not fit well to these requirements. For example, an IPv6 address is 128 bits, which is much longer than a 16-bit temperature report. Also, contending to send a small packet is not cost-effective. In this work, we propose a novel framework, which is slot-based, schedule-oriented, and identity-free for uploading IoT devices' data. We show that it fits very well for IoT applications. We propose two schemes, from an ideal one to a more practical one. The main idea is to bundle time slots with certain hashing functions of device IDs, thus significantly reducing transmission overheads, including device IDs and contention overheads.

With this approach, the channels themselves act as distributed FIFO buffers. Without VCBs, and hence virtual channels (VCs), deadlock prevention is achieved by duplicating physical channels. We develop a channel occupancy detector to apply universal globally adaptive load-balancing (UGAL) routing to load balance traffic in networks using EBs. Using EBs results in up to 8% (12% for low-swing channels) improvement in peak throughput per unit power compared to a VC flow-control network. These gains allow for a wider network datapath to be used to offset the removal of VCBs and increase throughput for a fixed power budget. EB networks have identical zero-load latency to VC networks operating under the same frequency. The microarchitecture of an EB router is considerably simpler than a VC router because allocators and credits are not required. For 5×5 mesh routers, this results in an 18% improvement in the cycle time.	allocator (c++);apollonian network;arbiter (electronics);blocking (computing);cost efficiency;datapath;deadlock;elastic net regularization;fifo (computing and electronics);flow control (data);load balancing (computing);microarchitecture;optimal design;performance per watt;router (computing);routing;semantic network;throughput;vc dimension;variable-length buffer;virtual channel	George Michelogiannakis;James D.

This article investigates the application of NOMA techniques in HUDNs to support massive connectivity in 5G systems. In particular, a unified NOMA framework is proposed, including power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA, which can be configured flexibly to serve different application scenarios. As a further advance, unified NOMA framework enabled HUDNs are further investigated, with particular focus on user association and resource allocation. Two case studies are provided for demonstrating the effectiveness of unified NOMA enabled HUDNs.

Since mmWave signals are highly sensitive to blockages, received signals can experience severe none-line-of-sight (NLOS) pathloss if there are blockages between a mmWave base-station (mBS) and a user equipment (UE). Relay nodes (RNs) can be used in a mmWave cellular network to help alleviate blockages and provide alternative line-of-sight (LOS) links when blockage occurs. In this paper, we provide coverage study in a mmWave network with various distributions of mBSs, UEs, blockages, and RNs. Both analytical and simulation results show that with the assistance of RNs more LOS links are expected and the network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) performance can be improved significantly.	channel capacity;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);internet relay chat;line-of-sight (missile);provisioning;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Bei Xie;Zekun Zhang;Apostolos Papathanassiou	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504422	probability density function;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;antenna;interference;shadow mapping;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;computer network	Mobile	27.465461504253366	83.92917591774672	8822

The encoder first sends a cache message without any knowledge of the user's preference. Upon learning her request, a second message is provided in the update phase so as to attain the desired fidelity on that component. The cache is efficient if it exploits as much of the correlation in the source as possible, which connects to the notions of Wyner's common information (for high cache rates) and Watanabe's total correlation (for low cache rates). For the former, we extend known results for 2 Gaussians to multivariates by showing that common information is a simple linear program, which can be solved analytically for circulant correlation matrices. Total correlation in a Gaussian setting is less well-studied. We show that for bivariates and using Gaussian auxiliaries it is captured in the dominant eigenvalue of the correlation matrix. For multivariates the problem is a more difficult optimization over a non-convex domain, but we conjecture that circulant matrices may again be analytically solvable.	cache (computing);circulant matrix;code;convex set;decision problem;encoder;exploit (computer security);gaussian elimination;linear programming;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;total correlation	Giel J.

5b01be6b4fba28271d214f563db504a2641aac4e	maximum possibility of spectrum access in cognitive radio using fuzzy logic system	interference	Many spectrum methods have been proposed to use spectrum effectively, the opportunistic spectrum access has become the most viable approach to achieve near-optimal spectrum utilization by allowing secondary users to sense and access available spectrum opportunistically. However, a naive spectrum access for secondary users can make spectrum utilization inefficient and increase interference to adjacent users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) to control the spectrum access. We have to minimize the call blocking and interference. The linguistic knowledge of spectrum access are based on three descriptors namely spectrum utilization efficiency of the secondary user, its degree of mobility, and its distance to the primary user. The spectrum is chosen for accessing based on the maximum possibility for better utilization of the spectrum Keywords—CR, FLS, Interference, Spectrum users, Spectrum Utilization.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;free library of springfield township;fuzzy control language;fuzzy logic;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);next-generation network	K.

The most popular techniques based on this concept are orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier with frequency-domain equalisation (SC-FDE). In this paper, we consider OFDM and SC-FDE transmission schemes and study the impact of the number of multipath components and the diversity order on their performance. It is shown that when we have a high number of separable multipath components, the asymptotic performance of both schemes approaches the matched filter bound, even without diversity. When we have diversity, the performance approaches the matched filter bound faster, with a small number of separable multipath components. It was also observed that the SC-FDE has an overall performance advantage over the OFDM option, especially when employing the iterative block decision feedback equaliser with turbo equalisation and for high code rates.

9d97eef2aed0a739dd4a27272027e33f7644f273	interference versus filtering distortion trade-offs in ofdm-based cognitive radios		Cognitive radio (CR) and opportunistic radio access came as a solution for the underutilisation of radio resources. An expected consequence is that the interference management procedures obtain high priority in CR research. While the vast majority of studies focus on interference phenomena towards the licensed primary system (PS), this paper analyses the effects of adjacent primary user (PU) signals to a CR system that uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The lack of orthogonality in OFDM receivers increases out of band interference. The ‘near PU–far CR’ scenario is introduced, an inverse equivalent to the ‘hidden terminal’ problem that may cause serious degradation in the receiver operation. An analytical interference model is developed, and direct filtering of the conventional OFDM waveform is investigated as a means to control interference from PU signals. Closed-form expressions of the induced distortion are extracted. The results are used to evaluate a filtered-based OFDM receiver via simulation and to prove that high-rank filters at CR receivers may be quite beneficial even though OFDM modulation generally avoids their use.

52b4bb1256720681e4826bf731e8b7d9bf12ef12	inspired from ants colony: smart routing algorithm of wireless sensor network		In brief, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a set of limited power nodes, used for gathering the determined data of an area. Increasing the lifetime is the main challenge to optimize WSNs routing protocols, since the sensors’ energy in most cases is limited. In this respect, this article introduces a novel smart routing algorithm of wireless sensor networks, consisting of stable nodes randomly dispersed, and this approach is inspired from ant colonies. The proposed algorithm takes into consideration the distance between two nodes, the chosen path length and the nodes’ residual energy so as to update the choice probability of the next node among the neighbouring nodes, contrary to several routing algorithms; on the one hand, the nodes are aggregating data of their predecessors and sending to all to their successors; on the other hand, the source is almost always changed in each iteration. Consequently, the energy consumption is balanced between the nodes. Hence, the network lifetime will be increased. Detailed descriptions and a set of simulation using Matlab is provided to measure the network lifetime and the energy consumed by nodes of the proposed approach are presented. The replications’ consequences of simulations prove the success of our future routing algorithm (SRA).	algorithm;ant colony;iteration;matlab;randomness;routing;sequence read archive;simulation	Saleh Bouarafa;Rachid Saadane;Moulay Driss Rahmani	2018	Information	10.3390/info9010023	wireless sensor network;ant colony;residual;computer science;energy consumption;path length;almost surely;algorithm;routing protocol	Mobile	8.628639031069103	80.49955096904262	8871

This paper proposes an untethered and probabilistic ultra-lower power time synchronization method for energy intermittent sensor network. It avoids the frequent RF communications with the assistance of a solar clock. The SATS system consists of two main parts: the synchronizer, a low power solar clock module for time synchronization, and the S3-Mapping, an offline sequence matching algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an improved version of S3-Mapping, which reduces the computation complexity from exponential to linear using the redundancy models and the onion peeling method. The SATS system is validated by both simulations and a prototype, which shows that the second level synchronization precision can be achieved under reasonable probability. What's more, the energy consumption of time synchronization is reduced by over 1 ~ 2 magnitudes compared with the up-to-date low power time synchronization protocol.	algorithm;computation;online and offline;prototype;radio frequency;simulation;synchronizer (algorithm);time complexity	Tongda Wu;Yongpan Liu;Hehe Li;Chun Jason Xue;Hyung Gyu Lee;Huazhong Yang	2016		10.1145/2934583.2934601	clock synchronization;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;energy harvesting	Mobile	9.134095030667236	70.86043453279805	8880

This approach allows mobiles to increase their uplink diversity by relaying data of other users. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the terminal mobility on the system performance of the Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in dynamic cooperation transmission scenarios. More precisely, using the Random Way Point (RWP) mobility model and the Effective Exponential SNR Mapping (EESM), we give an analytical expression of the Bit Error Rate (BER) at the destination in terms of the radius of cooperative region and of the users density. We show that for cell radius normalized to one unit, and with the RWP model, the optimal cooperative region radius is equal to 0.8. Compared to the non-cooperative scenario, and depending on the spreading length, the SNR gain obtained through dynamic cooperation can exceed 3 dB. Our results are validated through simulations.	anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;carrier frequency;direction finding;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;x.690	Youssef Nasser;Joumana Farah;Joseph Kirillos;Stéphanie Bassil;Maryline Hélard	2011	2011 8th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2011.5961033	electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer performance;signal-to-noise ratio;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.815919639031414	78.3304021238246	8891

The efficien cy of STC in fading environments is based on a diversity gain: Give n sufficient antenna spacing, the nTnR transmission paths from the nT transmit (Tx) antennas to the nR receive (Rx) antennas can be regarded as statistically independent. Thus, the probabilit y that each path is degraded at the same time is significantly smaller tha n e probability that a single path is in a deep fade. The diversit y gain obtained by means of STC enables a better bit error performan ce d therefore – in systems employing adaptive channel coding – h igher data rates. The popularity of STC is especially due to the fac t that wireless services are often asymmetric, where the downlink direction (from the base station (BS) to the mobile station (MS)) carri es the predominant part of the overall data traffic. Since multiple Rx antennas are optional with STC, only the BS needs to be equipped wit h additional antennas instead of upgrading all MS. The delay diversity scheme [1] and the Alamouti scheme [2] ar e two particularly simple, but nonetheless efficient STC tech niques. In the delay diversity scheme, the same signal is transmitted o v r each antenna, where at Tx antenna i, 1 i nT , a delay(i 1)T is applied (T denotes the symbol interval). The Alamouti scheme employs justnT =2 Tx antennas. The data symbols are processed as pairs(x(k); x(k+1) ) and are transmitted using two consecutive time instants. In this context, a mapping of x(k) andx(k+1) onto the two antennas is performed in such a way that at time index k, Tx antenna 1 transmitsx(k) and Tx antenna 2 transmits x(k+1), whereas at time indexk+1 Tx antenna 1 transmits x (k+1) ( denotes complex conjugation) and Tx antenna 2 transmits x (k) (spatial redundancy). Note that there is no rate loss w.r.t. the conventional singl e Tx antenna system ((1x1)-system). In [3] the application of the delay diversity scheme and the A lamouti scheme in a GSM/EDGE system is investigated, especiall y with regard to compatibility with current specifications. EDGE ( ’ nhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution’) is an evolution of GSM f or the purpose of data rate enhancement. In EDGE most elements o f the GSM physical layer are reused (e.g., carrier frequencies, b urst structure, training sequences, etc.), so as to enable a smooth tra nsition. The 2-ary GMSK modulation scheme of GSM is as well retained. Additionally, EDGE offers an 8-ary modulation scheme using 8-PSK mapping in conjunction with the same Gaussian pulse shape as used in GMSK, i.e., the raw data rate is triplicated. The following topics are, among others, addressed in [3]: A c ompatible transmitter structure is presented for both STC sch emes and the performance improvements obtainable on a typical urban (TU) channel are demonstrated on basis of simulation results. Th e influence of fast fading as well as of non-perfect knowledge of the channel coefficients in the receiver is also investigated. For th e Alamouti scheme, novel partner sequences w.r.t. the 8 GSM training se quences are presented. They yield excellent cross-correlation pro perties, that are crucial in order to enable accurate channel estimation. Moreover, a new trellis-based equalizer/detector algorithm is derived for the Alamouti scheme, which is characterized by the same comp lexity as in case of the (1x1)-system. For the delay diversity sc heme, employingnT=2 Tx antennas and an arbitrary delay Æ at the second antenna, a lower bound on the bit error probability is derive d, which is then utilized in order to optimize the delay parameter Æ. Here, focus shall be on the latter topic. The so-called RAKE r eceiver bound (RRB) is a lower bound on the bit error probabili ty of a slowly time-varying intersymbol interference (ISI) chan nel, where perfect knowledge of the channel coefficients at the receive r is presumed. The channel coefficients are assumed to fade independently.

With the explosive growth in the usage of multimedia applications, it is expected that NoC serves as a multimedia server supportingmulti-class services. This paper addresses rate control problem for applications with scalable multimedia services in Network-on-Chip architectures. Scalable multimedia applications are relying on multi-class services which use layered encoding schemes. We formulate the rate control for multimedia with multi-class services using the optimization approach. This allows us to devise an iterative rate control algorithm as the solution to the optimization problem. The rate control algorithm can be implemented using a controller with low computational overhead. The validity of the obtained expressions is demonstrated by comparing results predicted by the analytical model against those attained through extensive simulation experiments.	algorithm;computation;continuation;controller (computing);experiment;iterative method;mathematical optimization;multiprocessing;network on a chip;network packet;optimization problem;overhead (computing);quality of service;scalability;server (computing);simulation;system on a chip	Salman Mostafavi;Ahmad Khonsari;Mohammad Sadegh Talebi;Mohamed Ould-Khaoua	2009	2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing	10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.129	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-0.4240472551561102	93.99878323372792	8904

In particular, we formulate the rate allocation mechanism of a SU between its two different classes of services namely, delay sensitive (DS) and best effort (BE) services as a Markov decision process. Then the optimal rate allocation mechanism that minimizes the average queuing delay of DS packets while guaranteeing the packet loss probabilities of both classes of packets is obtained using a linear programming technique. Since the optimal rate allocation mechanism can be complex for implementation in a SU device due to its probabilistic nature, we also study a low-complexity suboptimal rate allocation mechanism. For this suboptimal scheme, we develop a queuing analytic model to measure and compare different data-link layer performance parameters e.g., packet loss probability and queuing delay distribution. The developed analytic model for the suboptimal scheme is further useful for a call admission decision. We compare the performances of the suboptimal rate allocation mechanism with its optimal counterpart. Presented simulation results show that the suboptimal mechanism has a quite similar performance as the optimal mechanism.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;glossary of computer graphics;linear programming;markov chain;markov decision process;network packet;performance;queuing delay;simulation;superuser	S.

1e1ee78c01612361b792e78269f27b91b9251da5	optimizing situational awareness in disaster response networks		In a wireless disaster response network, how does the quality of experience (QoE) of the user affect the level of situational awareness (SA)? Is maximum QoE necessary for high SA? In this empirical study, we propose a novel measurement approach to quantify SA based on the QoE of the user. The relationship between QoE and network quality of service (QoS) metrics such as delay and packet loss is well known. Therefore, quantifying the SA–QoE–QoS relationship will help the network operator to ensure a high level of SA when the network is under load, through parsimonious allocation of network resources such as spectrum and power. We first define an objective expression for SA in four contexts: surroundings awareness, target awareness, location awareness, and responsiveness (SETLR model). Using empirical data gathered from real-world experiments, we mathematically formulate SA as a function of QoE and show that this relationship is logistic in nature. An important observation is that maximum QoE is not necessary to ensure high SA; a mean opinion score of just 2–3 is necessary in our scenario. Next, we show through simulations that this new mathematical model of SA can be instantiated in a long-term evolution radio access network and efficiently used in network optimization techniques to avoid over-provisioning of resources.	experiment;high-level programming language;location awareness;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;network packet;occam's razor;optimizing compiler;provisioning;quality of service;radio access network;responsiveness;simulation	Abdoulaye Saadou;Harsha Chenji	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2831448	reliability engineering;computer network;mean opinion score;task analysis;quality of service;radio access network;packet loss;location awareness;computer science;situation awareness;quality of experience	Metrics	24.528675146736607	94.33102265960105	8931

This notion of affinity is used to represent the task-linking topology. For one-hop ad hoc networks, we define three types of affinity measures: node affinity, task affinity, and weighted affinity. Node affinity is defined as the weighted sum of incoming and outgoing task flows at each node, and task affinity as the sum of node affinities of source and destination nodes for each task. Based on these affinity measures, we consider three heuristic scheduling algorithms that are executable in real time: 1) affinity-first shortest task scheduling Qat; 2) task-size-first affinity-based scheduling Qta; and 3) task-size weighted-affinity scheduling Qwa . These algorithms have the advantage of making the total duration of the doze state of all the nodes in the network longer than in other conventional schemes, thereby achieving significant power saving (PS). Our simulation experiments suggest that the PS performance of Qwa  is comparable to optimal scheduling (which is not implementable in practice for realistic link topologies). We also present a framework for a PS medium-access-control (MAC) protocol in which our scheduling algorithm can be deployed, and we describe how to enhance the existing 802.11 PS MAC to implement our framework.

517aa31b379457cd0389dab7968746db3d886f6b	utilizing communication range to shorten the route of sweep coverage		Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) are expected to be used in a variety of different applications. One of the most important problems in WSNs is sweep coverage. Sweep coverage utilizes mobile sensor nodes to monitor Points Of Interests (POIs). Thanks to the mobility, sweep coverage can cover more POIs using fewer sensor nodes. In practice, mobile sensor nodes can often collect the data from POIs at a distance via wireless communication. Namely, mobile sensor nodes do not have to reach the physical location of each POI in order to collect the sensing data. Consequently, the route required to provide a sweep coverage can be significantly shortened if the communication range of POIs can be fully utilized. In this paper, we first define the novel problem of Sweep Coverage Based on POI Communication Range. Then we present a centralized and a distributed algorithm, RS and DRS, to solve the novel sweep coverage problem. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via extensive simulations.	apache poi;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;expect;heuristic;reed–solomon error correction;sensor web;simulation	Chuang Liu;Hongwei Du;Qiang Ye	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997084	computer network;distributed algorithm;wireless sensor network;approximation algorithm;computer science;wireless;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile telephony;wireless ad hoc network;distributed computing	Mobile	12.006767816464057	78.75598918193343	8941

However, current research lacks techniques to effectively quantify the similarity of human beings’ mobility behaviors as they exhibit diversities in both the time and spatial domains. In this paper, we provide a mechanism to encode the human mobility patterns and propose a Golay code based clustering system to facilitate the identification of the set of codeword that incarnate similar mobility behaviors. We will apply this clustering based mobility behavior similarity classification method to design PSN routing protocols in our future research.	algorithm;binary golay code;bit array;cluster analysis;code word;encode;end-to-end principle;hamming distance;network packet;relay;routing	Hongjun Yu;Simon Y.

Simple CIDS-CDMA treats a set of bits at a time and interleaves their chips together for transmission. But bit interleaving may also be used on top of chip interleaving (thus abbreviated BCIDS-CDMA) to enhance performance. For simplicity, we first tackle flat-faded synchronous transmission, in which we treat both the condition with perfect power control and that where the received signal is subject to Rayleigh fading. We then extend the analysis to asynchronous and multipath channels, with the latter treated only briefly. By approximating the correlation among the spreading codes (rather than the ensuing interference) as Gaussian, we obtain novel and relatively simple results for the various conditions above. In general, BCIDS-CDMA performs best, followed by simple CIDS-CDMA and then by BIDS-CDMA. Within simple CIDS-CDMA and BIDS-CDMA, long-code spreading performs better than short-code spreading. For BCIDS-CDMA with perfect interleaving that fully randomizes the fading coefficients, the performance is not affected by the spreading code period. The above ordering of performance follows the amount of diversity each scheme exploits, where the diversity may come from spectrum spreading, channel coding, and independence in fading of different paths. Simulation results agree well with the theoretical analysis.	asynchronous i/o;business intelligence development studio;channel capacity;coefficient;convolutional code;forward error correction;interference (communication);multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;simulation	Yu-Nan Lin;David W.

It becomes even worse in dense WSNs, due to burst-traffic and congestion around sinks. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol to recover collided packets. Our experiments on a testbed reveal that collisions between long packets and short packets cause a partial error pattern on collided packets, which can be used for efficient recovery. We give a theoretical analysis that demonstrates that combining such collision recovery with CSMA protocols achieves a significant performance improvement. Then, we design ACR, an Active Collision Recovery protocol, which actively converts most potential collisions into LS-collisions, and then applies a lightweight FEC scheme to recover collided packets with such partial error patterns. We implement ACR on a Tmote testbed, and compare its performance with other packet recovery schemes. Results show that ACR significantly reduces the number of retransmissions, and achieves around 25% improvement on transmission efficiency over other schemes.	collision domain;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;least squares;network congestion;network packet;testbed;tinyos	Yafeng Wu;Gang Zhou;John A.

We focus on the scenario that each sensor observes a single random variable and transmits it using certain signaling in a shared channel. The objective is the design of channel waveforms (i.e., the signal constellation) to facilitate the estimation of field parameters from the channel output. We propose a communication scheme in which sensors transmit according to the type of their observations-type-based multiple access (TBMA)-and show that the TBMA is asymptotically optimal in the limit of large number of sensors if the sensor channel-gains are identical. In particular, we show that TBMA together with a variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator achieves the Cramer-Rao bound asymptotically.

This research is a part of an Australian Research Council (ARC) project required by a large global shopping mall company located in Australia. It aims to develop an effective customer tracking approach for acquiring shopping behavior of customers and providing them better services. Currently, the log data provided by the company only recorded one Wi-Fi connection at a time for one smartphone user. This makes most of the conventional tracking and positioning methods inapplicable. In order to solve this problem, a new approach was developed, which takes advantage of both the cell of origin (CoO) method and the fingerprinting method. Its implementation mainly includes two phases: 1) the cell determination phase, including partitioning of the floors of the shopping mall using a Voronoi diagram and determining a unique cell for each wireless access point (AP), adjusting the cells manually according to the real floor layout, obstructions as well as an on-site observing and calibrating process. An AP-shop/room matching table and other relevant information are stored in a database; and 2) the user location tracking phase, including determination of the cell that the customer locates in according to the detected AP linked with the customer's mobile phone. A back-tracing method is also used to improve the tracking performance. This new approach was tested in a large shopping-mall-like space covering an area of 1000 square meters, containing 8 simulated shops and 11 APs. The results showed a 96% correct detection rate whilst the 4% erroneous detections occurred when a user was near the cell boundaries. This new approach is also easy to implement and integrate with other location tracking systems.	fingerprint (computing);location-based service;mobile phone;sensor;smartphone;software deployment;testbed;tracking system;voronoi diagram;while;wireless access point	Yuntian Brian Bai;Suqin Wu;Yongli Ren;Kevin Ong;Günther Retscher;Allison Kealy;Martin Tomko;Mark Sanderson;Hong Ren Wu;Kefei Zhang	2014	2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275489	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	20.558141883069062	72.7587812202319	9024

The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains more balanced transmission among the nodes and reduces the power consumption of the routing.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;routing;sensor web;simulation	Hong-Chi Shih;Shu-Chuan Chu;John F.

The architecture thus enables a generalized System.-on-Chip (SoC) platform in which the topology can be customized for the application that is currently running on the chip, including long links and direct links between IP-blocks. The configurability is inserted as a layer between routers and links, and the architecture can therefore be used in combination with existing NoC routers, making it a general architecture. The topology is configured using energy-efficient topology switches based on physical circuit-switching as found in FPGAs. The paper presents the ReNoC (Reconfigurable NoC) architecture and evaluates its potential. The evaluation design shows a 56% decrease in power consumption compared to a static 2D mesh topology.	circuit switching;field-programmable gate array;mesh networking;network on a chip;network switch;network topology;router (computing);system on a chip	Mikkel Bystrup Stensgaard;Jens Sparsø	2008	Second ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (nocs 2008)	10.1109/NOCS.2008.13	reference architecture;embedded system;parallel computing;computer science;network on a chip;field-programmable gate array;logical topology	Arch	2.7002718323280943	60.57735178373434	9068

So far, practical systems have used power control to over come fading and near/far effects. Another approach which has a fundamental potential in not only eliminating near/far effects but also in substantially raising the capacity, is the multiuser detectors and interference cancellers. Various optimal and sub-optimal schemes have been investigated. These schemes, however, get too complex even for considerably simple systems. Previously, we analyzed a simple successive interference cancellation scheme for a simple coherent BPSK modulation scheme. We now extend the simple successive interference cancellation scheme to a more complex (robust) modulation scheme, namely, M-ary Orthogonal modulation. We analyze the performance of the successive IC scheme under Rayleigh fading, where the order of cancellation changes as fast as fading (of the order of every 1 ms). The analysis indicates that the successive IC scheme not only increases the mean post-cancellation SNR (signal to noise ratio), but also lowers the coefficient of variation of the SNRs. This translates to lower BER, increased capacity and near far resistance.	bell laboratories layered space-time;coefficient;coherence (physics);interference (communication);modulation;multi-user;rayleigh fading;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical interference;x.690	Pulin R.

The QoS-aware delivery probability (QDP) is introduced to reflect the capability of a node to deliver data to a destination within a given delay budget. Each node maintains a set of QDPs to make autonomous decisions for QoS-aware data transmission. At the same time, a prioritized queue is employed by each mobile node. To support efficient prioritization and redundancy control, the priority is determined by a function of traffic class and data redundancy. The former is predetermined by the corresponding application, whereas the latter is dynamically estimated during data delivery. Two experiments are carried out to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed QoS-aware data delivery scheme. The first experiment involves multiple clusters of static Crossbow sensors that are connected by air and ground mobile nodes with controlled mobility. The second experiment is under a mobile social network setting, where 23 Dell Streak Android tablets are carried by volunteers with arbitrary and diverse mobility patterns over a period of two weeks. Moreover, simulation results are obtained under DieselNet trace and power-law mobility model to study scalability and performance trends. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves efficient resource allocation according to the desired delay budget and, thus, supports effective QoS provisioning.	android;autonomous robot;data redundancy;end-to-end encryption;experiment;mobile social network;prototype;provisioning;quality of service;scalability;sensor;simulation	Yang Liu;Zhipeng Yang;Ting Ning;Hongyi Wu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2311450	adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile qos;imt advanced;public land mobile network;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	7.6679060949879645	86.74965968199237	9080

However, there are very few protocols that can bound the worst case channel access time to ensure predictability of message transmission for the LAN environment. In addition, there has been no prior work addressing real-time communication over a switched (extended) local area network (SLAN), where several LAN segments are connected through a switch. In this paper, we propose real-time protocols for the LAN and the SLAN. The proposed protocols are based on CSMA/CD with deterministic collision resolution and belong to the dynamic planning based category, where an admission test is performed for guaranteeing message transmission. The admission test used in the proposed protocols is based on the worst case channel access time that can elapse before a particular node can start transmitting its message. We also compute the worst case buffer requirement at the switch for the proposed SLAN protocols. We study the effectiveness of the proposed protocols through extensive simulation studies.	real-time clock	Samphel Norden;G.

UEs and independently acting eavesdroppers (EDs) are positioned randomly according to a Poisson point process. We consider a transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme at the base station (BS) to enhance secrecy performance and propose two metrics to order the UEs: one based on long-term average channel gain information from the BS to the UEs, and the other based on instantaneous channel gains. We derive closed form expressions for the secrecy outage probability subject to each of these ordering policies and verify our calculations through Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that while TAS yields a performance improvement relative to single-antenna systems, the secrecy outage probability for TAS systems actually increases with the path loss exponent. Furthermore, we show that the importance of the specific user ordering policy that is adopted in these systems is reduced for high path loss environments or situations where large numbers of antennas are employed.

The experimental results demonstrate that the reliable video transmission can be provided for the legitimate secondary users, while the eavesdroppers could not recover the information without the knowledge of the key parameters of the chaotic sequences and the shifting matrix, thus the presented system achieves high security transmission for the users.	chaos theory;cognitive radio;labview;modulation;multiplexing;subcarrier;superuser;transceiver;universal software radio peripheral;video processing;virtual instrumentation;workbench	Zhaofeng Liu;Lin Zhang;Weiwei Rao;Zhiqiang Wu	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330482	phase-shift keying;subcarrier;computer network;frequency domain;real-time computing;modulation;video processing;computer science;cognitive radio;universal software radio peripheral;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	Mobile	45.8362407432784	83.89263036088394	9152

Frequency reuse factor of 1 being proposed for the next generation mobile systems will lead to 1 or 2 dominant interferers. We propose in this paper a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) demodulator for interference suppression. The proposed demodulator is also applicable to general multi-stream (spatially multiplexed) MIMO systems where it reduces one complex dimension of the system i.e. the complexity of ML detection reduces from O (|χ|) to O (|χ|n−1) where n is number of transmit antennas/spatial streams. This is a fundamental result as space and technology constraints shall be restricting future MIMO systems to low dimensionality. Therefore reduction of one complex dimension in detection shall enable implementation of ML detectors at the receivers. We look at the performance of linear MMSE demodulator and the proposed demodulator in the presence of interferers of diverse strengths and rates and simulation results demonstrate much improved performance of the proposed demodulator for interference suppression.	interference (communication);mimo;modulation;multiplexing;sensor;simulation;statistical interference;zero suppression	Rizwan Ghaffar;Raymond Knopp	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073610	frequency modulation;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;diversity scheme;interference;maximum likelihood;space technology;demodulation;spatial multiplexing;wireless;mimo;modulation	Mobile	44.858014172664625	77.84107505270752	9157
0f06845450a681d2c9f48130ac6214f17c796fd4	an efficient dca based algorithm for power control in large scale wireless networks		Abstract In recent years, power control and resource allocation techniques for cellular communication systems are very active research areas. Power control is typically used in wireless cellular networks in order to optimize the transmission subject to quality of service (QoS) constraints. One of the most popular power control problems is based on maximizing the weighted sum of data rates under the peak power constraints for all users. It is a difficult nonconvex optimization problem for which standard approach Geometric Programming is not applicable in large scale setting. In this paper, we propose an efficient method based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm), an innovative approach in nonconvex programming framework for solving this problem. The purpose is to develop fast and scalable algorithms able to handle large scale systems. The two main challenges in DC programming and DCA that are the effect of DC decomposition and the efficiency of solution methods to convex subproblems are carefully studied. The computational results on several datasets show the robustness as well as the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of both quality and rapidity, and their superiority compared with the standard approach Geometric Programming.	algorithm	Le Thi Hoai An;Ta Anh Son;Tao Pham Dinh	2018	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.08.061	software framework;wireless network;robustness (computer science);power control;mathematical optimization;scalability;geometric programming;algorithm;resource allocation;computer science;distributed computing;optimization problem	Mobile	35.87469304753842	92.91127662167905	9165
53cf8de41f2d9c0a0baff7e95f821b5f8594a8fd	good neighbor: ad hoc pairing of nearby wireless devices by multiple antennas		The proliferation of personal wireless devices requires secure connection between them. While it is easy to securely pair electronic devices by wires, it is very challenging to pair them wirelessly when they have no prior association. We propose Good Neighbor, a novel scheme that securely pairs nearby wireless devices by exploiting multiple antennas built in them. Our scheme requires neither shared secrets nor out-of-band channels (e.g., audio, visual, keyboard, etc.) between the pairing devices. It only requires that the receiver has multiple antennas and that the sender can be placed nearby the receiver. Our scheme is based on the propagation characteristic of the wireless signal that the power of the received signal is inversely proportional to some exponent of the distance between the sender and receiver. When a nearby sender moves very close to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can observe a large difference between the signal strength measured on its two antennas, whereas a faraway sender would be unable to induce such a large difference. We validate our scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. We discuss the factors that may affect our scheme — including antenna gain, received signal strength (RSS) saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipath effects — and how to mitigate them.

However, such systems suffer from the blockage of the direct path (DP) and occurrence of undetected direct path (UDP) condition and their performance degrades drastically in such conditions. Erroneous detection of the other multipath components (MPCs) as DP, which is the indicator of the true distance between the transmitter and the receiver, will introduce substantial ranging and localization errors into the system. Therefore, identification of the occurrence of large ranging errors and absence of DP from the received radio signal is our subsequent concern. After identification, the second step is to remedy the ranging errors in such UDP conditions. In this paper we present a methodology, based on an application of artificial neural network (ANN) design, to identify the UDP conditions and mitigate the ranging error using statistics extracted from wideband frequency domain indoor measurements conducted in a typical office building. The system bandwidth used for the frequency domain measurement was 500 MHz centered around 1 GHz.	algorithm;angle of arrival;artificial neural network;data-directed programming;indoor positioning system;multipath propagation;rss;radio wave;time of arrival;transmitter	Mohammad Heidari;Ferit Ozan Akgül;Nayef A.

5ebb8cd36c8838435ccde3439f46c191711a7a9c	latency-energy tradeoff based on channel scheduling and repetitions in nb-iot systems		Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is the latest IoT connectivity solution presented by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). NB-IoT introduces coverage classes and offers a significant link budget improvement by allowing repeated transmissions by nodes that experience high path loss. However, those repetitions necessarily increase the energy consumption and the latency in the whole NB-IoT system. The extent to which the whole system is affected depends on the scheduling of the uplink and downlink channels. We address this question, not treated previously, by developing a tractable model of NB-IoT access protocol operation, comprising message exchanges in random-access, control, and data channels, both in the uplink and downlink. The model is then used to analyze the impact of channel scheduling as well as the interaction of coexisting coverage classes, through derivation of the expected latency and battery lifetime for each coverage class. These results are subsequently employed in investigation of latency-energy tradeoff in NB-IoT channel scheduling as well as determining the optimized operation points. Simulations results show validity of the analysis and confirm that channel scheduling and coexistence of coverage classes significantly affect latency and battery lifetime performance of NB-IoT devices.	access control;cobham's thesis;computer simulation;interrupt latency;modulo operation;naive bayes classifier;queueing theory;random access;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Amin Azari;Guowang Miao;Cedomir Stefanovic;Petar Popovski	2018	CoRR		latency (engineering);link budget;computer network;energy consumption;path loss;telecommunications link;scheduling (computing);narrowband;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	20.654629350170715	89.79214829017555	9211

This receiver combines a modified scheme of a parallel interference cancellation detector with antenna arrays with optimum beamforming and is used at the base station for the detection of asynchronous user signals. Each user's transmission channel is assumed to be a multipath frequency-selective independent Rayleigh fading channel. The receiver operates by dividing the signals into reliable and unreliable sets following space-time combining. The reliable signals are detected and canceled from the whole signal received at each sensor. Unreliable signals are then detected to improve the decision reliability. The receiver performance in terms of bit-error probability is analytically derived and optimized. According to the analytical and simulation results, this receiver outperforms previously proposed schemes and, thanks to its low implementation complexity, real-time operation is achieved.	beamforming;bit error rate;channel (communications);computational complexity theory;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation	Romano Fantacci;Dania Marabissi;Simone Morosi	2004	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2003.821217	receiver;code division multiple access;telecommunications;receptor;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;base station;space time;radio receiver design;radio receiver;beamforming;spread spectrum;antenna array;statistics;detection theory	Mobile	48.44526492182194	73.15469314990649	9215

c87bbbf3108d06b4988913eb09160ed2d53ea93a	robust dynamic spectrum access in uncertain channels: a fuzzy payoffs game approach		Despite the great promises in next-generation wireless communications, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) remains still as a major challenge in uncertain environments, e.g., varying unknown channels. Existing popular schemes, i.e. potential game approaches, rely on the definite reward and a greedy strategy, which become unfortunately invalid in such varying and uncertain scenarios. In this paper, we propose a robust fuzzy-game approach to combat inherent channel uncertainties. Rather than the definite reward, we first project the decision space to another fuzzy-logical space and thereby characterize the varying uncertain information with the fuzzy numbers. Thus, the sensitiveness to random fluctuation in definite rewards would be alleviated. On this basis, we formulate DSA in uncertain channels as a centralized fuzzy payoffs game (FPG). We then develop a novel fuzzy-learning algorithm to achieve the optimal network throughput even in face of uncertain information, with which the network controller executes the decision making of sharing users by exploiting the fuzzy-logic method. Numerical results are finally provided to validate our new FPG scheme. Although uncertain environments render existing crisp-game approaches invalid, our new algorithm can converge after tens of iterations (even in fast-varying conditions), thereby permitting reliable shared accessing and improved throughput, which is of great significance to next- generation communications operated in dynamical and uncertain environments.	centralized computing;converge;dynamical system;fuzzy logic;greedy algorithm;iteration;network interface controller;programming paradigm;quantum fluctuation;simulation;throughput	Chaoqiong Fan;Bin Li;Yongjun Zhang;Chenglin Zhao	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254094	fuzzy logic;throughput;real-time computing;network interface controller;potential game;wireless;channel allocation schemes;computer science;fuzzy number;communication channel	Mobile	32.965513209279	96.20679146005938	9239
aa246d341689bc9adcad8bff84b816a8cbe79d32	mode combining and -splitting in optical mimo transmission using photonic lanterns		Within the last years the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has revolutionized the optical fibre community. Theoretically, the concept of MIMO is well understood and shows some similarities to wireless MIMO systems. However, practical implementations of optical components are in the focus of interest of substantial research. Optical couplers have long been used as passive optical components also being able to combine or split SISO (single-input single-output) data transmission. They have been proven to be well suited for the optical MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) transmission despite their insertion losses and asymmetries. Nowadays, next to optical couplers, Photonic Lanterns (PLs) have attracted a lot of attention in the research community as they offer the benefit of a low loss transition from the input fibers to the modes supported by the waveguide at its output. Therefore they seem to be highly beneficial for optical MIMO communication. In this contribution mode coupling and splitting devices such as PLs and fusion couplers have been analysed in a testbed with regard to their respective MIMO suitability. Based on the obtained results, a simplified time-domain MIMO simulation model including PLs for mode-combining at the transmitter side as well as mode-splitting at the receiver side is elaborated. Our results obtained by the simulated bit-error rate (BER) performance show that PLs are well suited for the optical MIMO transmission.

We consider two types of traffic flows: (i) delay-constraint flows (high priority flows) and (ii) Best-effort flows (low priority flows). In OFS, only optical cross connects (OXCs) are used for the switching function in the data plane and there is no buffering and processing involved at intermediate routes. Data flows through a simple all-optical data plane without any electronic processing except for the control plane. The flow QoS-based scheduling mechanism is to be implemented in the control plane using a priority queueing. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the considered OFS network using the proposed scheduling mechanism. Simulations are also conducted in order to validate the obtained analytical results. Numerical results have shown the efficiency of the QoS-based scheduling mechanism in satisfying delay constraint for DC flows especially when the contention for resource becomes noticeable (i.e. high network load).	active queue management;blocking (computing);computer simulation;control plane;differentiated service;erlang (unit);forwarding plane;network scheduler;numerical method;optical flow;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;scheduling (computing)	Iyas Khayata;Halima Elbiaze	2012	2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167548	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-0.2025322209707187	95.69221128283236	9244
c06bb5a7f830c7c1d1997ed60cd52f8f89c83f2f	a generalized volume-correlation subspace detector and its application in multiuser detection		The problem of subspace signal detection, i.e., detecting w hether a signal lies within a subspace arises in a wide range of applications in the signal processing community, i ncluding communication, radar, array signal processing, hyperspectral image, etc. In this paper, a novel volume-cor relation subspace detector is proposed to detect subspace signals contaminated by noises and subspace interferences . It is shown that, the volume of parallelotope, which is spanned by the signal subspace’s basis vectors together w ith multi-dimensional received signal vectors, can be calculated and used to detect subspace signals with interfe renc s. It is also proved in this paper that, with the knowled ge of the signal subspace and the interference subspace, and by accumulating multi-dimensional signal observations, the volume-correlation subspace detector will eliminate the i nfluence of noise as well as the influence of interference asymptotically. And this is an advantage that traditional s ubspace detectors don’t have. Besides, the application of this volume-correlation subspace detector to Active User I d ntification in multiuser detection systems with multipat h channels is discussed in this paper. Active User Identificat ion is a well known and essential preprocess stage in multiuser detection systems, it can reduce the system compl exity and improve the overall decoding performance. It is shown that the proposed volume-correlation subspace detec tor has its interior advantage to deal with the interference of other users in the system with a multipath channel, and pro vides asymptotically ideal performance in detection of active users.

The present paper tries to clarify that even though it is true that interference of an OFDM symbol with delayed versions of itself causes serious impairments in reception, these can be fixed by adaptive channel estimation, and that the guard interval is still necessary to avoid interference of an OFDM symbol with delayed versions of the previous ones.	catastrophic interference;channel state information;interference (communication);multipath propagation;multiplexing;software propagation	Pablo Torio;Manuel García Sánchez	2010	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2010.5505953	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;intersymbol interference;computer network	Arch	47.89835718156684	79.43234829839857	9263
c07809bc3f34dfd858fe97a535537f2799c46b55	design challenges of millimeter wave communications: a mac layer perspective		As the spectrum is becoming more scarce due to exponential demand of formidable data quantities, the new millimiterwave (mmW) band is considered as an enabling player of 5G communications to provide multi-gigabits wireless acccess. MmW communications exhibit high attenuation and blockage, directionality due to massive beamforming, deafness, low-interference, and may need micro waves networks for coordination and fallback support. The current mmW standardizations are challenged by the overwhelming complexity given by such heterogeneous communication systems and mmW band characteristics. This demands new substantial protocol developments at all layers. In this paper, the medium access control issues for mmW communications are reviewed. It is discussed that while existing standards address some of these issues for personal and local area networks, little has been done for cellular networks. It is argued that the medium access control layer should be equipped with adaptation mechanisms that are aware of the special mmW characteristics. Recommendations for mmW medium access control design in 5G are provided. It is concluded that the design of efficient access control techniques for mmW is in its infancy and much work still has to be done.	access control;beamforming;gigabit;interference (communication);recommender system;time complexity	Hossein Shokri-Ghadikolaei;Carlo Fischione;Gábor Fodor;Georgios Athanasiou	2014	CoRR		telecommunications	Mobile	21.847409975201018	86.25635455775213	9264

Unlike existing methods that focus on minimizing or forcing the sidelobes to zero, the proposed precoder is designed with the goal of controlling the out-of-band emissions beneath a particular power level without impacting the bit error rate (BER) performance. A small distortion is added to the information symbols forcing the emitted spectrum under a prescribed radio frequency mask. Obtained results show that the BER performance of the proposed precoder is similar to that of uncoded OFDM under relaxed masks. Moreover, the effect of the proposed precoder on edge subcarriers is investigated. Error vector magnitude (EVM) per subcarrier shows the designed precoder introduces more distortion on edge subcarriers. Consequently, the proposed precoder when combined with adaptive modulation provides further improvement in BER performance under strict masks.	bit error rate;distortion;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;noise shaping;out-of-band agreement;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;subcarrier;variable shadowing;x.690	Anas Tom;Alphan Sahin;Hüseyin Arslan	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.020513.122495	cognitive radio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;precoding;statistics	Mobile	48.30581121322151	83.33394738760585	9277
1e6006caae47296ee028352da5695348d52d5b81	empirical distribution of good channel codes with non-vanishing error probability (extended version)		This paper studies several properties of channel codes that approach the fundamental limits of a given (discrete or Gaussian) memoryless channel with a non-vanishing probability of error. The output distribution induced by an ǫcapacity-achieving code is shown to be close in a strong sense to the capacity achieving output distribution. Relying on the concentration of measure (isoperimetry) property enjoyed by the latter, it is shown that regular (Lipschitz) functions of channel outputs can be precisely estimated and turn out to be essentially non-random and independent of the actual code. It is also shown that the output distribution of a good code and the capacity achieving one cannot be distinguished with exponential reliability. The random process produced at the output of the channel is shown to satisfy the asymptotic equipartition property.	asymptotic equipartition property;code;exponential backoff;isoperimetric inequality;randomness;stochastic process;time complexity	Yury Polyanskiy;Sergio Verdú	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;mathematics;error exponent;statistics	Theory	35.83420039093821	64.1381534634486	9279

The deterministic MPM problem consists in assigning transmission powers to the nodes, so that a multihop connection can be established between a source and a given set of destination nodes and the total power required is minimized. We present a new extension to the basic problem, where node failure probabilities for the transmission are explicitly considered. This model reflects the necessity of taking uncertainty into account in the availability of the hosts. The novelty of the Probabilistic Minimum Power Multicast (PMPM) problem treated in this paper consists in the minimization of the assigned transmission powers, imposing at the same time a global reliability level to the solution network. An integer linear programming formulation for the PMPM problem is presented. Furthermore, an exact algorithm based on an iterative row and column generation procedure, as well as an heuristic method are proposed.

According to the current QoS specifications, network traffic can be broadly classified into four classes-voice, video, background and best effort. However, MCCA does not directly support the standard service differentiation that is essential for service level QoS assurance. Further, assuring fairness among the flows of similar service classes is required for effective bandwidth utilization. Providing service differentiation along with the fairness is challenging in a distributed environment due to their non-linearity and non-additive properties. This paper uses the concept of (α, p)-proportional fairness to design a distributed method for providing service differentiation with minimum fairness guarantee. An admission control mechanism is designed over standard mesh protocols to manage the minimum service guarantee for existing flows in the network. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is analyzed using experimental results from an IEEE 802.11n+s mesh networking testbed. The scalability and performance bound of the proposed scheme is further analyzed using simulation results.	best-effort delivery;control theory;differentiated service;fairness measure;flow control (data);max-min fairness;mesh networking;multistage interconnection networks;network traffic control;nonlinear system;proportionally fair;quality of service;scalability;simulation;testbed;utility functions on indivisible goods;wireless mesh network	Sandip Chakraborty;Sukumar Nandi	2015	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2400453	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;communications protocol;service set;quality of service;ieee 802.1x;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;proportionality;mesh networking;shared mesh;ieee 802.11h-2003;interference;order one network protocol;spread spectrum;computer security;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Mobile	2.7939071867097556	96.14869320845062	9294
25a06f9997dc6ae88d6dc377e1c58608a7e7ec60	multi-user frequency-selective hybrid mimo demonstrated using 60 ghz rf modules		Given the high throughput requirement for 5G, merging millimeter wave technologies and multi- user MIMO seems a very promising strategy. As hardware limitations impede to realize a full digital architecture, hybrid MIMO architectures using both analog and digital precoding are considered a feasible solution to implement multi- user MIMO at millimeter wave. Real channel propagation and hardware non-idealities degrade the performance of such systems thus experimenting the new architecture is crucial to support system design. Nevertheless, hybrid MIMO systems are not yet understood as the effects of the wide channel bandwidths at millimeter wave, the non-ideal RF front end as well as the imperfections of the analog beamforming using phased antenna arrays are often neglected. In this paper, we present a 60 GHz multi-user MIMO testbed using phased antenna arrays at both transmitter and receivers. The base station equipped with a 32 phased antenna array allocates simultaneously two users. We show that frequency selective hybrid precoding can efficiently suppress inter-user interference enabling spatial multiplexing in interference limited scenario doubling the throughput compared to a SISO scenario and compensating the frequency fluctuation of the channel. In addition, we report an EVM constellation improvement of 6 dB when comparing the hybrid MIMO architecture with a fully analog architecture.	beamforming;digital electronics;dyadic transformation;experiment;interference (communication);markov chain;multi-user mimo;period-doubling bifurcation;phased array;quantum fluctuation;radio frequency;simulation interoperability standards organization;software propagation;spatial multiplexing;systems design;testbed;throughput;transmitter	Steve Blandino;Claude Desset;Cheng-Ming Chen;André Bourdoux;Sofie Pollin	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417592	rf front end;computer science;spatial multiplexing;mimo;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;electronic engineering;antenna array;precoding;beamforming	Mobile	43.7449145585928	86.01290085620356	9304

These proposals are hardly adaptable in real networks due to high resource demand, non scalability and difficulties in their implementation. In this paper we propose a new technique that besides of allowing TCP to improve its performance also takes applicability into account. Our solution is based on the idea of explicit loss notification (ELN) to notify the sender about packet losses on the wireless channel. We evaluate the performance of TCP-ELN with different kind of traffic and error models. Simulation results show that ELN significantly improves the efficiency and fairness performance of TCP for FTP-like and Web-like traffic.	fairness measure;internet protocol suite;network packet;scalability;simulation;unix-like;vaxeln	Gergö Buchholcz;Thomas Ziegler;Tien Van Do	2005	First International Conference on Wireless Internet (WICON'05)	10.1109/WICON.2005.31	file transfer protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Mobile	-2.447883744929532	92.46316257242943	9312

One of its main advantages is its ability of identifying objects in a wireless fashion with no contact or a direct sight line among the communicating devices. By improving the underlying collision resolution protocol in an RFID system, the power consumption of such devices is improved as well. In this paper, we present a new p-persistent CSMA collision resolution protocol for RFID systems. We compare our protocol with a non-persistent CSMA protocol previously proposed in the literature as well as with the ISO18000–7 standard. By measuring the average identification time for a wide range of tags, we show by simulation that our protocol outperforms both protocols.	algorithmic efficiency;communications protocol;hash table;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;scale-invariant feature transform;simulation;throughput	D.

d682dc03b7c2e78dacc2cd5be63524fde34c8fa2	optimal relay antenna location in indoor environment using particle swarm optimizer and genetic algorithm	sbr image;ga;ber;pso;outage probability	An optimization procedure for the location of the relay transceiver in ultrawideband wireless communication system is presented. The impulse responses of different transceiver locations are computed by shooting and bouncing ray/image (SBR/Image) techniques and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). By using the impulse responses of these multi-path channels, the bit error rate (BER) performance for binary pulse amplitude modulation (BPAM) impulse radio UWB communication system are calculated. Based on the BER performance, the outage probability for any given relay location of the transceiver can be computed. The optimal relay antenna location for minimizing the outage probability is searched by genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO). The transmitter is in the center of the whole indoor environment and the receivers are uniform distributed with 1.5 meter intervals in the whole indoor environment. Two cases are considered as following: (I) Two relay transceivers with two different cases are employed. First, the whole space is divided into two areas and one relay transceiver is used in each area. The optimal relay antenna locations are searched in each area respectively. Second, the two optimal relay locations are searched in the whole space directly without any prior division. (II) Four relay transceivers with two different cases are employed. First, the whole space is divided into four areas and one relay transceiver is used in each area. The optimal relay antenna locations are searched in each area respectively. Second, the four optimal relay locations are searched in the whole space directly without any prior division. Numerical results have shown that our proposed method is effective for finding the optimal location for relay antenna to reduce BER and outage probability.	bit error rate;downtime;fast fourier transform;genetic algorithm;internet relay chat;mathematical optimization;modulation;numerical method;particle swarm optimization;software release life cycle;standard business reporting;sun outage;transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband;x.690	Shu-Han Liao;Chien-Ching Chiu;Min-Hui Ho;Chin-Han Lin	2012	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-010-0083-8	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;statistics	HCI	29.04061826521798	81.43647628857873	9348

We develop a framework to analyze the impact of various physical layer parameters, e.g., the energy harvesting profiles, size of energy buffer, and power management policies, at both the transmitter and receiver, and the channel statistics and coherence time, on the packet drop probability (PDP) of dual EH links over block fading channels. We derive the closed-form expressions for the PDP of a retransmission index-based power management policy. The presented framework naturally extends to obtain the PDP of mono EH links, i.e., links where only one of the two nodes harvests energy. To obtain further insights, we analyze the PDP of links with zero and infinite energy buffer size, and characterize the energy unconstrained regime, where the PDP is governed only by the average harvesting rate. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of the theoretical expressions, compare performance against existing power management schemes, and illustrate the performance tradeoffs involved.	acknowledgement (data networks);exponential hierarchy;hybrid automatic repeat request;markov chain;monte carlo method;network packet;point-to-point (telecommunications);power management;retransmission (data networks);simulation;transmitter	Mohit K.

Frames contain one or multiple blocks of coded data. The Start Of a Frame (SOF) is especially required to synchronize the decoder, especially in systems which use modern codes such as Turbo codes. This process is known as frame synchronization. We examine the general problem of frame synchronization in the presence of a large residual carrier frequency offset, and study the theoretical and implementation trade-offs between using point estimation and sequential detection in deriving frame synchronizers. We also derive a new sequential detector which is resilient to Automatic Gain Control (AGC) errors. We describe simple state machines which control the one-shot point estimator and the sequential detector to ensure low probability of false detects. We compare the two techniques via simulation results and also a simple Markov chain analysis of the point-estimation scheme.	automatic gain control;carrier frequency offset;dvb-s2;framing (world wide web);markov chain;residual carrier;simulation;synchronization (computer science);synchronizer (algorithm);turbo code;waveform	Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)		frame;residual frame;synchronization;statistical hypothesis testing;turbo code;real-time computing;frame synchronization;computer science;maximum likelihood;finite-state machine;frame synchronization;statistics	Arch	46.63630408835218	70.99748350503575	9423

Though some ad-hoc routing protocols, e.g., extended DSR (Dynamic Source Routing), support routing with unidirectional links, multiple flooding RREP are used and communication overhead is high. In this paper, we propose a new ad-hoc routing protocol based on DSR that supports unidirectional links in mobile ad-hoc networks. We use the neighborhood list of high transmission power node to detect the existence of unidirectional links and to transmit single unicast RREP. Our protocol achieves better performance than the extended DSR in such environments as having unidirectional links in terms of the number of required messages.	source routing	Jun-Jie Piao;Tae-Mu Chang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24082-9_18	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.688472401785459	82.52708474140977	9426

We focus on four optimization problems: minimizing the maximum weighted layer-wise or user-wise MSE under a total power constraint; minimizing the total transmit power subject to a set of layer-wise or user-wise MSE requirements. The non-convexity of these problems makes the derivation of globally optimal algorithms very difficult for transceiver design. New optimal power allocation strategies are derived for the problems considered here. Based on the power allocation, we study how this can be used for iterative transceiver optimization. We propose iterative algorithms and prove the monotonic convergence of the algorithms. The major advantages of the proposed algorithms are their low complexity and fast convergence behavior during the first few iterations. The proposed algorithms are suitable not only for downlink transmission, but also for uplink transmission with a total power constraint.	algorithm;iteration;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;requirement;telecommunications link;transceiver	Shuying Shi;Martin Schubert;Holger Boche	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.920487	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;signal processing;mathematics;iterative method;statistics;global optimization	Metrics	36.962129497854136	88.96984363442975	9440
05a7b26d154f7d0b03704424fdb52f170dcb8d8a	solving minimum cost three-dimensional localization problem in ocean sensor networks		Localization is one of the most fundamental problems in wireless sensor networks (including ocean sensor networks). Current localization algorithms mainly focus on how to localize as many sensors as possible given a set of mobile or static anchor nodes and distance measurements. In this paper, we consider an optimization problem, the minimum cost three-dimensional (3D) localization problem, in an ocean sensor network, which aims to localize all underwater sensors using the minimum number of anchor nodes or the minimum travel distance of the surface vessel which deploys and measures the anchors. Given the hardness of 3D localization, we propose a set of greedy methods to pick the anchor set and its visiting sequence. Aiming at minimizing the localization errors, we also adopt a confidence-based approach for all proposed methods to deal with noisy ranging measurements (which is very common in ocean sensor networks) and possible flip ambiguity. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of all proposed methods.

A potential application of these technologies is to distribute digital video content over wireless in a home environment. However, video streaming is bandwidth demanding, and the number of interference free wireless channels is limited, selecting the best operating channel is critical to guarantee the quality of viewer's experience. We study the feasibility of transmitting video over WLANs in a multi-dwelling unit environment; design a centralized channel selection algorithm that satisfies each client's demand, at the same time, takes the fairness and residual bandwidth into consideration. We use directed edge-weighted graph to model the interference between different basic service systems and classify APs into cooperative APs and non cooperative APs. Our simulation results show that using existing 802.11a channels, a feasible channel allocation scheme for video streaming over WLANs in a dense deployment can be found in most cases.	centralized computing;digital video;directed graph;fairness measure;frequency divider;genetic algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);interference (communication);mimo;multiplexing;selection algorithm;simulation;software deployment;streaming media;transmitter	Mingquan Wu;Hang Liu;Ishan Mandrekar;Ramkumar Perumanam;Saurabh Mathur	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502634	feasibility study;genomics;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	28.30203414903224	94.37455360921396	9480

In addition to computing shortest paths, as in wire-line networks, any routing scheme must consider that the topology of the network can vary while the packet is being routed.Cluster based schemes have been proposed which segregate the network into manageable sets for maintaining routing information. In this paper we propose a novel method of constructing the clusters and a backbone based on the concept of a k-tree core. We also propose an hierarchical routing scheme using this cluster information and evaluate its performance through extensive simulations.	computer cluster;distributed algorithm;file spanning;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;k-tree;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);routing;shortest path problem;simulation;spanning tree	Saurabh Srivastava;R.

In our analysis, we consider that transmissions are performed over Nakagami-m fading where channel state information is only known at the receiving terminals. We derive an exact expression for the ergodic capacity by exploiting the moment generating function (MGF) of the inverse signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The result is applicable for arbitrary numbers of interfering signals at the receiving terminals and can be efficiently evaluated. Furthermore, considering the special case of dual-hop transmission, we propose a more refined characterization where the high-SIR capacity is expanded as an affine function. The zero-order term or the power offset for which we find insightful closed-form expressions, is shown to play a chief role in understanding the impact of interference and power on the system's capacity.

Optimal resource allocation strategies, including sensing time and power allocation schemes, are studied to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary base station under the transmit power and interference power constraints. EE problem is formulated as a nonlinear stochastic fractional programming of a nonconvex optimal problem. The EE problem is transformed into its equivalent nonlinear parametric programming and solved by one-dimension search algorithm. To reduce searching complexity, the search range was founded by demonstration. Furthermore, simulation results confirms that an optimal sensing time exists to maximize EE, and shows that EE is affected by the spectrum detection factors and corresponding constraints.

In OFDM based systems such as LTE (Long Term Evolution), the channel estimation can be successfully designed with processing in a transform domain, both for uplink and downlink. One such popular transform is to use the IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform), window the channel estimate in the time domain and then use DFT to transform back to the frequency domain again. This channel estimate is distorted in the band edges leading to a biased channel estimate. One suggested solution to this problem is to use a DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) based channel estimator, such that this distortion is reduced. However, as discussed in the current paper, the DCT based channel estimate suffers more from cyclically shifted reference signals, as used for MIMO in LTE for uplink, than the DFT based channel estimator. In order to overcome band edge problems with the DFT based channel estimate, a method is proposed of de-biasing over-sampled DFT based channel estimate by using digital sinc functions. Simulation results indicate that the de-biased DFT based channel estimate is more robust against interference from cyclic shifted reference signals than DCT based channel estimates.	biasing;channel state information;compaq lte;discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;distortion;interference (communication);mimo;simulation;sinc function;telecommunications link	Henrik Sahlin;Anders Persson	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092958	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;frequency domain;mimo	Mobile	50.157232265170215	79.56957022818986	9542

A symbolic regression approach is adopted in which we wish to uncover an expression to automatically manage the power settings of individual femtocells in a larger femtocell group to optimise the coverage of the network under time varying load. The generation of symbolic expressions is important as it facilitates the analysis of the evolved solutions. Given the multi-objective nature of the problem we hybridise Grammatical Evolution with NSGA-II connected to tabu search.

b0266cebb0e6fc33266e5db9f3353e0595609728	throughput maximization for the wireless powered communication in green cities		Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a recently developed technique to perfectly address the energy problem for smart city sensors that do not have a readily wired power supply. In a radio-frequency-powered wireless communication system, sensors first harvest energy via the radio-frequency WPT, and then, transmit sensed data to the receiver. The “harvest-then-transmit” protocol is used to coordinate the two operations, in which we wish to optimally decide when to harvest energy, when to transmit data, and what transmission rate should be used such that the data are maximally transmitted. Unlike existing works, we assumed that the wireless transferred power is dynamically changing, instead of being constant, which is more realistic in green smart city applications, e.g., Industry 4.0 workshop, smart transportation, and smart buildings, where environments are continuously changing, so the wireless transferred power is affected dynamically. In this paper, we present an optimal scheduling algorithm for the offline case where the varying WPT is known in advance. Based on the optimal principles learned from the offline case, we have designed an efficient online algorithm. Finally, we report our simulation results that demonstrate that our online scheduling algorithm can adaptively and efficiently achieve high data throughput.	expectation–maximization algorithm;industry 4.0;online algorithm;online and offline;power supply;radio frequency;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;smart city;throughput	Feng Shan;Junzhou Luo;Weiwei Wu;Fang Dong;Xiaojun Shen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2018.2821160	building automation;real-time computing;throughput;online algorithm;smart city;wireless sensor network;computer science;scheduling (computing);wireless;wireless power transfer	Mobile	32.28536097513294	87.00346332342407	9567

10b44d0c65a2614a2f95c099ff7db674a619bc7a	mobile video streaming over dynamic single-frequency networks	mobile multimedia;wireless streaming;single frequency network	The demand for multimedia streaming over mobile networks has been steadily increasing over the past several years. For instance, it has become common for mobile users to stream full TV episodes, sports events, and movies while on the go. Unfortunately, this growth in demand has strained the wireless networks despite the significant increase of their capacities with recent generations. Hence, efficient utilization of the expensive and limited wireless spectrum remains an important problem, especially in the context of multimedia streaming services that consume a large portion of the bandwidth capacity. In this article, we introduce the idea of dynamically configuring cells in wireless cellular networks to form single-frequency networks based on the multimedia traffic demands from users in each cell. We formulate the resource allocation problem in such complex networks with the goal of maximizing the number of served multimedia streams, and we prove that this problem is NP-Complete. Then we present an optimal solution to maximize the number of served multimedia streams within a cellular network. This optimal solution, however, may suffer from an exponential time complexity in the worst case, which is not practical for real-time streaming over large-scale networks. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm with polynomial running time to provide faster and more practical solution for real-time deployments. Through detailed packet-level simulations, we assess the performance of the proposed algorithms with respect to the average service ratio, energy saving, video quality, frame loss rate, initial buffering time, rate of re-buffering events, and bandwidth overhead. We show that the proposed algorithms achieve substantial improvements in all of these performance metrics compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. For example, for the service ratio metric, our algorithms can serve up to 11 times more users compared to the unicast approach, and they achieve up to 54% improvement over the closest multicast approaches in the literature.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;complex network;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;mobile device;multicast;np-completeness;network packet;overhead (computing);polynomial;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;single-frequency network;streaming algorithm;streaming media;time complexity;usb on-the-go;unicast;video	Saleh Almowuena;Mohamed Hefeeda	2016	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2983635	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	21.546743478996763	97.39679156120586	9579

Especially in HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), while various channel-state-aware schedulers have been proposed, each of them has pros and cons, and thus, none of them can be the best solution for all situations and policies in the base station management. To respond to the variety of the base station management, in our previous paper, a unified scheduler that can flexibly vary its characteristics by adjusting its parameters has been proposed, but only the basic packet-level performance was evaluated. In this paper, therefore, the detailed performance characteristics of the proposed unified scheduler are investigated. First, it is shown that the unified scheduler achieves a general fairness criterion—(p, α)-Proportional Fairness—in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the long-term averaged throughput. Second, the TCP-level throughput performance of the unified scheduler with some underlying link-layer technologies actually employed in HSDPA is evaluated by network simulation. In addition, two scenarios to determine the parameters of the scheduler—the semi-proportional fair scheduling and the semi-greedy scheduling—are examined, which demonstrates the flexibility and effectiveness of the unified scheduler.	fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;network packet;proportionally fair;reservation station;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Yoshiaki Ohta;Masato Tsuru;Yuji Oie	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30197-4_19	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	OS	2.792290292270474	102.66337052519687	9602

In this paper we investigate the possibility of using the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm to recover the carrier frequency offset in OFDM terminals with a DCR architecture. Our study leads to a novel scheme that operates in a recursive fashion and exploits a conventional OFDM training preamble composed by several repeated parts. At each iteration, interference arising from I/Q impairments is subtracted from the received samples before updating the frequency estimate. The performance of the new scheme is assessed in terms of estimation accuracy and processing load by considering a wireless local area network (WLAN) compliant with the IEEE 802.11a standard. The main goal is to check whether the SAGE approach exhibits some advantages compared to existing alternatives.	carrier frequency offset;compaq lte;computer simulation;expectation–maximization algorithm;in-phase and quadrature components;interference (communication);iteration;recursion;signal-to-noise ratio	Michele Morelli;Marco Moretti	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.012714.140092	estimation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;accuracy and precision;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Visualization	50.98808895070708	78.72313975814642	9605

A key consideration in sensor networks is that the sensor nodes have limited battery resources that determine the lifetime of the network. Motivated by the fact that geographical routing is localized, scalable and nearly-stateless, we propose three energy-aware geographical forwarding schemes. The aim is to improve the network lifetime by considering the residual energy of neighbours in deciding the next-hop while preserving the localized, scalable and nearly-stateless property of geographical routing. In view of a possible heavy traffic along the perimeter of the hole, which may cause nodes along this perimeter to die faster, a hole avoidance method is proposed to reduce the traffic along the hole to remove this possibility. Topology control algorithm is proposed to be executed at each node to remove undesirable geographical neighbours determined by a link cost. It removes geographical neighbours without causing unnecessary holes and still maintains the connectivity in the network. The main aim of removing undesirable geographical neighbours is to achieve the global objective of having a longer network lifetime. The effectiveness of the three proposed forwarding schemes and the topology control algorithm are verified through extensive simulation results	algorithm;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;internationalization and localization;perimeter;routing;scalability;scheme;sensor;simulation;stateless protocol;topology control	Teck Lee Lim;Gurusamy Mohan	2005	2nd International Conference on Broadband Networks, 2005.	10.1109/ICBN.2005.1589683	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.987952559498111	78.48262140633052	9614

This work models the interrelationships between routing freedom, message blocking, correlated resource dependencies, and deadlock formation. It is empirically shown that increasing routing freedom, as achieved by allowing unrestricted routing over multiple physical and virtual channels, reduces the probability of deadlocks and the likelihood of other types of correlated message blocking that can degrade performance. Moreover, when true fully adaptive routing is used in k-ary n-cube networks with two or more virtual channels (wormhole or virtual cut-through switched), it is empirically shown that deadlocks are virtually eliminated in networks with n 2. These results indicate that deadlocks are very infrequent when the network and routing algorithm inherently provide sufficient routing freedom, thus increasing the viability of deadlock recovery routing strategies.

We show that, given phase shifts and time delays, the empirical mean of the multiple access interference (MAI) for such systems satisfies the conditional large deviations principle (LDP) with the convex, good rate function. By refinement of the large deviations analysis, we also obtain exact asymptotics of bit-error probabilities in such systems. Comparing theoretical expressions of bit-error probabilities with experimental results, we confirm that for too small numbers of users compared to the lengths of spreading sequences, the central limit asymptotics become invalid, but the large deviations asymptotics turn out to be relevant.	intelligence amplification;interference (communication);markov chain;profiling (computer programming);refinement (computing);stochastic matrix	Hiroshi Fujisaki	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2110030	markov chain;combinatorics;telecommunications;mathematics;spread spectrum;communications system;statistics	Metrics	42.15417295770321	74.55649804894134	9690

In this algorithm, we exploit unequal error protection (UEP) Reed-Solomon (RS) coding to compensate for possible data packet loss of base layer and enhancement layers which are obtained from fine-granularity-scalability (FGS) video coding. In order to reduce the feedback load, we only use the knowledge of average channel state information (CSI) for the users. The proposed algorithm maximizes the enhancement layers throughput while guaranteeing the minimum data rate of the base layer in each multicast group. A two-phase suboptimal algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the performance of the algorithm with UEP RS coding is more than the algorithm without UEP RS coding.

In this paper, we present a relay-centric hierarchical optimization model for jointly optimizing the radio resource management (RRM) and network planning for the relay stations in MMR networks. We consider an in-band relaying system. For a relay station, the RRM problem deals with optimizing the amount of bandwidth reserved from the base station and admission control for the mobile subscriber stations (MSSs) using relay-based transmissions so that the utility of a relay station is maximized. A Markov decision process (MDP) model is formulated to obtain the short-term optimal action of a relay station. Based on the optimal action of each relay station, the network planning problem is solved for a group of relay stations by optimizing the relay placement and base station selection over a longer period of time considering uncertainties in user mobility and traffic load in the network. A chance-constrained assignment problem (CCAP) is formulated to obtain the optimal decisions to maximize the total utility of relay stations under the probabilistic constraint on the total bandwidth usage of the base stations. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms a static scheme. The proposed radio resource management and network planning framework will be useful for design and optimization of multihop cellular wireless networks in general.	assignment problem;broadcast relay station;control theory;data recovery;interference (communication);markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;meet-me room;multi-master replication;numerical analysis;optimization problem;radio resource management;rationality	Dusit Niyato;Ekram Hossain;Dong In Kim;Zhu Han	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.12.090640	link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;computer science;base station;resource management;markov process;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.388993841842744	102.09980207992979	9718

The optimal slot combining is difficult to implement, since it requires information on channel and frequency offset. Two practical combining schemes, a noncoherent combining and a coherent combining, are found to be special cases of the optimal combining. In this paper, a novel differentially coherent combining scheme is proposed. This combining scheme may be viewed as a combination of differential detection and coherent combining techniques. The performances of the differentially coherent combining as well as the optimal combining, noncoherent combining, and coherent combining are analyzed for Rayleigh fading environments with frequency offset. It is found that the differentially coherent combining scheme significantly outperforms the noncoherent combining and coherent combining schemes for a typical range of Doppler spread and frequency offset.	cell (microprocessor);coherence (physics);frequency offset;matched filter;performance;rayleigh fading	Yeon Kyoon Jeong;Kwang Bok Lee;Oh-Soon Shin	2000		10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881649	synchronization;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;frequency offset;mathematics;background noise;matched filter;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;fading	Robotics	43.80904960057905	76.11151393449225	9730

A general link and system performance analysis framework is developed to enable thesystem-level performance characteristics of the various link adaptation strategies to be studied and compared. More specifically, this framework is used to compare the downlink performance of fully loaded cellular systems with fixed power and modulation/coding, adaptive modulation/coding (AMC), adaptive power allocation (APA) with system-level AMC, and water-filling (WF). Performance is studied first for idealized methods, and then for cases where some practical constraints are imposed. Finally, a hybrid link adaptation scheme is introduced and studied. The hybrid scheme is shown to overcome most of the performance loss caused by the practical constraints. Moreover, the hybrid scheme, as opposed to WF, enables the system to be tuned to meet the most important performance objective for the system under consideration, such as coverage reliability, capacity, or data rate distribution. The algorithms and the framework presented in this paper can be used to improve the link adaptation performance of modern cellular systems such as HSDPA.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;data rate units;modulation;space-filling tree;telecommunications link	Kevin L.

We maximize the network capacity and alleviate request congestion through broadcasting/multi-casting the most popular services, and locally caching for further request on the user side. In the proposed scheme, we firstly introduce a UE (User Equipment)-based caching mechanism by considering both the frequency and recency of the popular services. Simulations show that the proposed mechanism brings a significant improvement on the capacity of the CWBCN. Based on the mechanism, a sleep-awake algorithm is proposed to further reduce the energy consumption of the UEs. Simulations show that with the proposed algorithm for the converged network can reduce 20%-30% energy consumption by comparing to the traditional one.	algorithm;cache (computing);computer simulation;network congestion;network convergence;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);technological convergence;zipf's law	Xia Li;Jian Xiong;Bo Liu;Lin Gui;Meikang Qiu	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)	10.1109/BMSB.2016.7521932	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Embedded	24.57286613335979	92.47411009153025	9800

We characterize Nash equilibria of random access games, study their dynamics, and propose distributed algorithms (strategy evolutions) to achieve Nash equilibria. This provides a general analytical framework that is capable of modeling a large class of system-wide quality-of-service (QoS) models via the specification of per-node utility functions, in which system-wide fairness or service differentiation can be achieved in a distributed manner as long as each node executes a contention resolution algorithm that is designed to achieve the Nash equilibrium. We thus propose a novel medium access method derived from carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) according to distributed strategy update mechanism achieving the Nash equilibrium of random access game. We present a concrete medium access method that adapts to a continuous contention measure called conditional collision probability, stabilizes the network into a steady state that achieves optimal throughput with targeted fairness (or service differentiation), and can decouple contention control from handling failed transmissions. In addition to guiding medium access control design, the random access game model also provides an analytical framework to understand equilibrium and dynamic properties of different medium access protocols.	access control;distributed algorithm;fairness measure;game theory;nash equilibrium;quality of service;random access;steady state;throughput	Lijun Chen;Steven H.

The developed theoretical analysis indicates that the performance of the proposed algorithm is within a factor of three of that of any optimal algorithm in the worst case. Through simulation experiments, the numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms the previously proposed routing and linkscheduling algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can effectively achieve near-optimal performance, and provide much better throughput than the theoretical worst-case bound in the average case.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;experiment;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;relay;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Chi-Yao Hong;Ai-Chun Pang	2009	IEEE Trans.

The block Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is used for adaptation and both the feedforward and feedback filters are implemented in the frequency-domain. Consequently, the complexity of the block RLS, by exploiting the matrix structure in the frequency-domain, is reduced substantially when compared to its time-domain counterpart. Ultimately, it will be shown that the proposed AFD- DFE exhibits significant excellent performance improvement when compared to a 1-tap AFD-DFE while still enjoying a low computational complexity.	active format description;adaptive equalizer;algorithm;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;colour banding;computational complexity theory;ddos mitigation;equalization (communications);feedback;feedforward neural network;ici (programming language);interference (communication);recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;simulation;sparse matrix;telecommunications link;the matrix	Naveed Iqbal;Azzedine Zerguine;Naofal Al-Dhahir	2015	2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421322	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Robotics	47.94971951312993	77.6721839886476	9839

It suggests that information about each mobile sink's location be continuously propagated through the sensor field to keep all sensor nodes updated with the direction of forwarding future data reports. Unfortunately frequent location updates from multiple sinks can lead to both excessive drain of sensors' limited battery power supply and increased collisions in wireless transmissions. In this paper we describe TTDD, a Two-Tier Data Dissemination approach that provides scalable and efficient data delivery to multiple mobile sinks. Each data source in TTDD proactively builds a grid structure which enables mobile sinks to continuously receive data on the move by flooding queries within a local cell only. TTDD's design exploits the fact that sensor nodes are stationary and location-aware to construct and maintain the grid structures with low overhead. We have evaluated TTDD performance through both analysis and extensive simulation experiments. Our results show that TTDD handles multiple mobile sinks efficiently with performance comparable with that of stationary sinks.	downstream (software development);experiment;location awareness;multitier architecture;overhead (computing);power supply;scalability;sensor;simulation;stationary process;upstream (software development)	Fan Ye;Haiyun Luo;Jerry Cheng;Songwu Lu;Lixia Zhang	2002		10.1145/570645.570664	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	8.770229720008746	77.80216919968734	9840

This paper demonstrates the implementation of a 100 m optical wireless link capable of supporting 10 Mbps. The total cost of building the link is within 20 USD. The relatively low data rate is chosen considering the main applications of voice and messaging in these regions. The low cost has been achieved by designing our own transmitter and receiver circuits.

A smart metering system is envisaged to bring tremendous benefits to customers, utilities, and governments. The advantages include reducing peak demand for energy, supporting the time-of-use concept for billing, enabling customers to make informed decisions, and performing effective load management, to name a few. A key element in an SMI is communications between meters and utility servers. However, the mass deployment of metering devices in the grid calls for studying the scalability of communication protocols. SMI is characterized by the deployment of a large number of small Internet Protocol (IP) devices sending small packets at a low rate to a central server. Although the individual devices generate data at a low rate, the collective traffic produced is significant and is disruptive to network communication functionality. This research work focuses on the scalability of the transport layer functionalities. The TCP congestion control mechanism, in particular, would be ineffective for the traffic of smart meters because a large volume of data comes from a large number of individual sources. This situation makes the TCP congestion control mechanism unable to lower the transmission rate even when congestion occurs. The consequences are a high loss rate for metered data and degraded throughput for competing traffic in the smart metering network. To enhance the performance of TCP in a smart metering infrastructure (SMI), we introduce a novel TCP-based scheme, called Splitand Aggregated-TCP (SA-TCP). This scheme is based on the idea of upgrading intermediate devices in SMI (known in the industry as regional collectors) to offer the service of aggregating the TCP connections. An SA-TCP aggregator collects data packets from the smart meters of its region over separate TCP connections; then it reliably forwards the data over another TCP connection to the utility server. The proposed split and aggregated scheme provides a better response to traffic conditions and, most importantly, makes the TCP congestion control and flow control mechanisms effective. Supported by extensive ns-2 simulations, we show the effectiveness of the SA-TCP approach to mitigating the problems in terms of the throughput and packet loss rate performance metrics. A full mathematical model of SA-TCP is provided.

Either the source knows the direct route to the mobile host, and is informed of all location changes by the mobile host (informed routing), or the source directs messages to a home agent that forwards messages to the mobile host (triangle routing). When the rate at which the mobile host changes location and the rate at which messages are directed to the mobile host are known and fixed, we show that the optimal routing policy is described by a threshold rule that depends on the normalized differential cost of the routing techniques and the ratio of the source messaging to location update rates. Since this call to mobility ratio may not be known a priori or may change slowly with time, we also derive an adaptive policy selection algorithm.The policy is derived from a maximum likelihood estimate of the call to mobility ratio based on observations of message arrivals and location changes.The algorithm is found to work well when there is a clear advantage to either triangle or informed routing. However, when the two routing schemes are relatively close in average cost, the algorithm performance is degraded by repeated policy reversals. For this reason, algorithms which use hysteresis and/or a preset preference (preference threshold) for one routing scheme or another were explored, k was found that neither hysteresis, nor preference threshold techniques alone performed well, but rather a combination of the two resulted in greatly improved performance for a wide range ofvalnes of the call to mobility ratio. 1.

This adaptive algorithm is shown to perform near optimally over a broad range of system parameters. The lack of dependence of our approach on the network substrate should allow its application to many scenarios where information must be transferred to and from mobile hosts over some fixed network. 2. Route cost random variables We assume that the network has an underlying routing algorithm that is responsible for the establishment of communication paths between the source, the mobile host and the home agent. Given the complexity of routing algorithms that respond to changes in network load, we wish to adopt a tractable but not overly simple model for the costs associated with these paths. In particular, we assume that messages between the mobile host and home agent, the source and home agent, and the source and mobile host incur costs described by the random variables X, Y, and Z, as depicted in Fig. 1. We will develop adaptive routing policies that depend on the average costs E[X], ElY l and E[Z]. This assumption of random route costs with fixed mean values is more general than but essentially similar to the standard assumptions of fixed routing costs as in, for example, [9]. However, since instances of X, Y and Z may be dependent and may also depend on the location of the mobile host, it is necessary to clarify our assumptions regarding the message costs and mobile host movements. We assume that the motion process is stationary and memoryless. That is, the mth location Lm of the mobile host is independent of the previous locations L1, . . . , Lm-1 and P{Lm =l}=pl . While the mobile host remains at a particular location l, the communication costs for successive messages of a given type are given by the random vectors X (0 = IX(l),..., X~6], y(l)= [y(t5 9 . . , ~0], and Z(') = [ZI'),.. . , Zk (l)] respectively. The elements of each vector, though possibly dependent on each other, are assumed to have the same marginal distribution. For example, in X (I), the cumulative distribution function of each Xm (0 is assumed to satisfy Fx~> (x) = Fxl,i (x). Moreover, for the sequence of location changes Lm =lm, we assume that the distribution of the random vector of message communication costs	a history of tibet by the fifth dalai lama of tibet;adaptive algorithm;ana (programming language);artificial intelligence;cpu cache;cache (computing);call of duty: black ops;cobham's thesis;cylinder-head-sector;emoticon;fo (complexity);genera;hysteresis;icy;internet key exchange;marginal model;maxima and minima;mobile ip;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;ork;sed;selection algorithm;stationary process;triangular routing;working set;xfig	Roy D.

Eavesdropper can intercept the information transmission from the secondary source or the relay to the corresponding receiver. Relay is equipped with a buffer of finite buffer size so that it can store packets. We propose a max-ratio secure link selection scheme which can optimize the secrecy transmission performance by selecting the link which maximizes the secrecy capacity. It incorporates the instantaneous strength of the wireless links as well as the status of the finite relay buffers, and adapts the relay selection decision on the strongest available link by dynamically switching between relay reception and transmission. A closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability is obtained based on the Markov chain to validate the proposed scheme. Simulation and theoretical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the secure performance compared to the conventional max-min-ratio secure relay selection schemes.	cognitive radio;data buffer;direction finding;downtime;markov chain;multistage interconnection networks;profiling (computer programming);relay;secondary source;simulation;visual intercept	Aiwei Sun;Tao Liang;Yajun Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2015.7448612	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;computer security;computer network	Mobile	34.102082708668824	80.51319986039714	9883
9422c609e8866aaccedc8a82dc95739e7ada0323	proactive algorithm to reduce power consumption and handovers in heterogeneous mobile networks		Energy consumption of communication and cellular networks has recently received increased attention in the research community. Moreover, a large number of base stations (BSs) have been deployed in order to meet these demands on cellular traffic. This leads to considerable increase in the operational cost and contributes as a major portion of the energy consumption of cellular networks. Therefore, network operators are considering how to reduce the energy consumption and design “Green Communication”. The concept of Green Communication is to manage energy consumption and maintain reasonable costs while keeping high quality of service and benefits. In this paper, we present some techniques for reducing power consumption by developing solutions in terms of the network architecture and the base stations components. We use some of these solutions to develop and implement a novel algorithm that combines Cell Zooming and Heterogeneous Networks with many types of base station while taking into consideration user's mobility. The efficiency and the power management of our algorithm, especially in high traffic networks, are achieved and approved by simulations.	algorithm;cell signaling;display resolution;network architecture;power management;quality of service;semantic network;simulation	Michel Nahas;Mohammad Sabati;Rana Kanso;Mohammad Azizi	2017	2017 IEEE 8th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249011	network architecture;power management;quality of service;energy consumption;algorithm;heterogeneous network;computer science;cellular traffic;cellular network;base station	Mobile	24.003100414691453	90.78383734915185	9922

Most of previous work on wireless mobile P2P networks concentrates on the protocols and network structures, and consequently ignores the multiple senders scheduling problem. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for scheduling the multiple senders for multi-source transmission in wireless mobile P2P networks, which can maximize the data rate and minimize the power consumption. Specifically, we formulate the wireless mobile P2P network as a multi-armed bandit system. The optimal distributed sender scheduling policy can be found according to the Gittins indices of the senders. Extensive simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It is shown that the data rate and power consumption in the proposed scheme can be improved significantly compared to existing schemes.	data rate units;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-armed bandit;multi-source;peer-to-peer;processor affinity;scheduling (computing);simulation;uncompressed video	Pengbo Si;Fei Richard Yu;Hong Ji;Victor C.

The design challenge is to maximize the utilization of the limited wireless resources while guaranteeing the various quality of service (QoS) requirements for all traffic classes especially for the stringent real-time constraint of real time variable bit rate (rt-VBR) video service. In this paper a novel resource allocation algorithm for video traffic is proposed. The proposed allocation algorithm aims to provide fair delay for video packets by minimizing the delay difference among transmitted video packets. At the same time it adaptively controls the allocated resources (bandwidth) for video traffic around the corresponding average bit rate, and has the ability of controlling the QoS offered for video traffic in terms of packet loss probability and average delay. A minimized control overhead of only two bits is needed to increase the utilization efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves very high utilization and provides nearly fair delay among video packets. Its efficiency is also investigated under traffic integration condition with voice and data traffic. Under traffic integration condition the data traffic increases the utilization while a good QoS is achieved for all traffic classes.	access control;algorithm;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;simulation;volume boot record	Mohamed R.

However, these technologies pose significant challenges for the design of an iterative receiver. In this paper, an efficient receiver combining soft-input soft-output (SISO) detection based on low-complexity K-Best (LC-K-Best) decoder with various forward error correction codes, namely, LTE turbo decoder and LDPC decoder, is investigated. We first investigate the convergence behaviors of the iterative MIMO receivers to determine the required inner and outer iterations. Consequently, the performance of LC-K-Best based receiver is evaluated in various LTE channel environments and comparedwith otherMIMOdetection schemes.Moreover, the computational complexity of the iterative receiver with different channel coding techniques is evaluated and compared with different modulation orders and coding rates. Simulation results show that LC-K-Best based receiver achieves satisfactory performance-complexity trade-offs.	algorithm;best practice;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;data compression;data rate units;ecc memory;exit chart;error detection and correction;fixed point (mathematics);forward error correction;iteration;lc circuit;low-density parity-check code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;modulation;next-generation network;sensor;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder	Rida El Chall;Fabienne Nouvel;Maryline Hélard;Ming Liu	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/7642590	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	44.6632435684738	66.64683523415984	9974

In a micro-cellular environment, messages from different transmitting terminals will suffer different attenuations (path loss and fading phenomena), yielding different levels of energy at the receiver. Thus, one out of 'i' attempting transmission packets will be successfully transmitted with some capture probability fi. Assuming that the receiver is within the range and in line-of-sight of all the mobile users in the cell, the capture probabilities can be determined by means of simulation, and a new probabilistic Markov model for the above network is introduced and analysed using the slot property of the channel Under moderate packet length size the results obtained in respect of the throughput-delay performance and stability under heavy traffic conditions are promising compared with those of the corresponding conventional p-persistent CSMA schemes. Consider a finite population of N mobile users sharing one channel for transmission to one receiver (base station). The channel is slotted with slot duration equal to T seconds. Any effect due to the propagation delay is assumed negligible. Each user generates packets of fixed length equal to 0 > 1 slots. Thus, the packet transmission time if OT seconds. Each user stores and attempts to transmit at most one packet for each time slot. A user without a packet in his buffer is said to be free; if he has a packet he is said to be ready. We assume a synchronized structure. Each user generates (or does not generate) a packet in a time slot, independently of other users, with probability cr (or 1-c7).

Traditional approaches to mobile sensor deployment are specifically designed for homogeneous networks. Nevertheless, network and device homogeneity is an unrealistic assumption in most practical scenarios, and previous approaches fail when adopted in heterogeneous operative settings. For this reason, we introduce VorLag, a generalization of the Voronoi-based approach which exploits the Laguerre geometry. We theoretically prove the appropriateness of our proposal to the management of heterogeneous networks. In addition, we demonstrate that VorLag can be extended to deal with dynamically generated events or uneven energy depletion due to communications. Finally, by means of simulations, we show that VorLag provides a very stable sensor behavior, with fast and guaranteed termination and moderate energy consumption. We also show that VorLag performs better than its traditional counterpart and other methods based on virtual forces.	sensor;software deployment	Novella Bartolini;Tiziana Calamoneri;Thomas F.

However, there is a lack of analytical techniques that enable one to quantify the benefits and tradeoffs of MTDs. In this paper, a novel approach for implementing MTD techniques that can be used to randomize cryptographic techniques and keys in wireless networks is proposed. In particular, the problem is formulated as a stochastic game in which a base station (BS), acting as a defender seeks to strategically change its cryptographic techniques and keys in an effort to deter an attacker that is trying to eavesdrop on the data. The game is shown to exhibit a single-controller property in which only one player, the defender, controls the state of the game. For this game, the existence and properties of the Nash equilibrium are studied, in the presence of a defense cost for using MTD. Then, a practical algorithm for deriving the equilibrium MTD strategies is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic MTD framework can significantly improve the overall utility of the defender, while enabling effective randomization over cryptographic techniques.	.net framework;algorithm;cryptography;game theory;mtd-f;nash equilibrium;prospective search;simulation	AbdelRahman Eldosouky;Walid Saad;Dusit Niyato	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510985	stochastic process;games;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;computer security;encryption;statistics	Mobile	34.518001511466466	83.138393516383	9985

However, more sensing cooperations for a channel may decrease the transmission time of the secondary users, or lose opportunities for exploiting other channels. In this paper, we study this tradeoff by using the theory of oartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This formulation leads to an optimal sensing scheduling policy that determines which secondary users sense which channels with what miss detection probability and false alarm probability. A myopic policy with lower complexity yet comparable performance is also proposed. We further analytically study the properties and the solution structure for the myopic and the optimal policies under a simplified system model. Theoretical results reveal that under certain conditions, some simple but robust structures of the value function exist, which lead to an easy way to obtain the solution of POMDP. Moreover, the cooperative sensing scheduling problem embedded in our POMDP, which is generally a hard combinatorial problem, can be analyzed in an efficient way. Numerical and simulation results are provided to illustrate that our design can utilize the spectrum more efficiently for CR users.	bellman equation;cognitive radio;embedded system;markov chain;numerical method;partially observable markov decision process;scheduling (computing);simulation	Tengyi Zhang;Yuan Wu;Ke Lang;Danny H.

In addition to employing forward error correction (FEC) codes, joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is a typical approach to combat the significant quality degradation. In this paper, a joint source-channel decoding (JSCD) method is designed when transmitting the JPEG2000 codestream over uncorrelated flat fading channels using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Error resilience modes implemented in the JPEG2000 codec makes it possible to provide new messages as feedback to the channel decoder. Thus, the log-domain sum-product decoding procedure for LDPC codes is updated during each iteration according to the feedback information from the JPEG2000 decoder. Two adaptive modification algorithms are proposed to update the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the bit nodes at the receiver with and without channel side information (CSI), respectively. Simulation results show that the joint source-channel decoding methods not only improve the quality of the reconstructed image greatly but also reduce the number of iterations significantly.	algorithm;codec;decibel;decoding methods;elegant degradation;embedded system;error detection and correction;forward error correction;image compression;iteration;jpeg 2000;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;peak signal-to-noise ratio;qr code;simulation;transmitter	Weiliang Liu;David G.

5d53f8c1e555b5abec6bf92525efdb00982ff456	efficient resource allocation algorithm for spatial multiuser access in miso ofdma systems		The problem of user selection and resource allocation for the downlink of wireless systems operating over a frequency-selective channel is investigated. It is assumed that the Base Station (BS) uses many antennas, whereas a single antenna is available to each user and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is used as a multiple access scheme. The general mathematical formulation is provided but achieving the optimal solution has a high computational cost. For practical implementation, a suboptimal, but efficient algorithm is devised that is based both on Zero Forcing (ZF) beamforming and on spatial correlation and is less complex than other approaches. The algorithm maximizes the sum of the users’ data rates subject to constraints on total available power and proportional fairness among users’ data rates. Simulation results are provided to indicate that the algorithm can satisfy the fairness criterion. Thus, the algorithm can be applied to latest-generation wireless systems that provide Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees.	akaike information criterion;algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;computation;data rate units;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;many antennas;proportionally fair;quality of service;simulation;subcarrier;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Vasileios D.

Considering dynamic channel characteristics and user mobility in wireless networks, the proposed scheme takes advantage of both the point forwarding scheme in mobility management and dynamic RSVP (DRSVP) in QoS guarantee. Moreover, in order to overcome deficiencies in conventional point forwarding scheme, we develop a new decision criterion for performing forwarding chain update, which achieves a better trade-off between network resource consumed by routing path and signaling load for forwarding chain updates. Based on the performance analyses, our proposed scheme can substantially reduce more resource reservation than the conventional pointer forwarding scheme, thus it can achieve efficient resource utilization and guarantee QoS requirements of multimedia applications in the future wireless all-IP networks	internet protocol suite;pointer (computer programming);quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;serial experiments lain	Hui-Juan Yao;Geng-Sheng Kuo	2006	2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2006.1682999	bidirectional forwarding detection;virtual routing and forwarding;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	7.328615398524185	98.17973223960578	10108

The PN aims to minimize its energy consumption by switching off the maximum number of its BSs and offloading its users to the SN's infrastructure to maintain its QoS. In return, the PN pays a roaming price and permits the SN to share or lease the spectrum at a certain price. We propose a low-complexity algorithm allowing the PN to minimize its energy consumption by selecting a suboptimal combination of active base stations. Our algorithm also optimizes the resource allocation of the SN to maximize its total sum-rate while respecting the minimal profit constraints for both networks. In the numerical results, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves close performances to the optimal exhaustive search algorithm. In addition, we investigate the impact of various system parameters in the collaboration decision.

However, to really obtain the potential gain of NC, efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols that operate with awareness of the NC functions are necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel NC-aware MAC protocol for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks that combines k-batch transmissions and multiple receiver-initiated reverse direction exchanges involving NC data to boost the overall network performance. The proposed protocol allows any node to transmit a burst of data packets in a single channel access invocation. Then, an intermediate node can transmit an NC data packet when receiving a valid data packet from a source node, without contending for channel access. Both analytical and simulation results presented in this paper show the high throughput and energy efficiency of the proposed protocol with gains ranging from 33% to 298% when compared to existing mechanisms based on the IEEE 802.11 Standard.	access control;batch processing;burst transmission;complex network;design rule for camera file system;linear network coding;network packet;network performance;network topology;real life;relay;remote desktop protocol;simulation;throughput	Raúl Palacios;Biniam Hailu Dabi;Jesus Alonso-Zarate;Fabrizio Granelli;Frank H.

In particular, this system setting is applied to a wireless sensor node operating in a cognitive radio system as secondary user in the presence of a primary user. As such, not only the queue policy influences the power consumption but also the interference power constraint imposed on the wireless sensor node by the primary user. Thus, a queued sleep/wake-up strategy is analyzed in order to mitigate the average power consumption of a sensor node using min(N,T) policy in the context of an M/G/1 queue and a spectrum sharing environment in the presence of signal fading. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of queuing parameters and fading channel on the power consumption of a wireless sensor node.	cognitive radio;interference (communication);network packet;numerical analysis;sensor node	Charles Kabiri;Hans-Jürgen Zepernick;Hung Tran	2014	2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2014.7023011	cognitive radio;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;fading;wireless;server;computer network	Mobile	32.21692169950444	85.94146498527955	10202
b6a74ef2c2c32f6c0886b57df4a80893fde040c7	nanoscale molecular communication networks: a game-theoretic perspective	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Currently, communication between nanomachines is an important topic for the development of novel devices. To implement a nanocommunication system, diffusion-based molecular communication is considered as a promising bio-inspired approach. Various technical issues about molecular communications, including channel capacity, noise and interference, and modulation and coding, have been studied in the literature, while the resource allocation problem among multiple nanomachines has not been well investigated, which is a very important issue since all the nanomachines share the same propagation medium. Considering the limited computation capability of nanomachines and the expensive information exchange cost among them, in this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for distributed resource allocation in nanoscale molecular communication systems. We first analyze the inter-symbol and inter-user interference, as well as bit error rate performance, in the molecular communication system. Based on the interference analysis, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a non-cooperative molecule emission control game, where the Nash equilibrium is found and proved to be unique. In order to improve the system efficiency while guaranteeing fairness, we further model the resource allocation problem using a cooperative game based on the Nash bargaining solution, which is proved to be proportionally fair. Simulation results show that the Nash bargaining solution can effectively ensure fairness among multiple nanomachines while achieving comparable social welfare performance with the centralized scheme.	bit error rate;british informatics olympiad;centralized computing;channel capacity;computation;fairness measure;game theory;information exchange;interference (communication);modulation;nanorobotics;nash equilibrium;proportionally fair;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications network	Chunxiao Jiang;Yan Chen;K.

In particular, more flexible networks will require localization of transmitters in the networks. In this work we present a novel method for transmitter localization, suitable for rich multipath mmWave 5G scenarios such as dense urban environments. Our work combines stochastic estimation of Radio Environmental Maps (REMs) with the well known concept of triangulation, generalizing the latter into a method for localization in anisotropic propagation environments. It can be considered a conceptual bridge from classical distance-based triangulation into a generalized version where the propagation environment is taken into account. The result is a highly flexible tool for network planning in general and transmitter localization in particular.	internationalization and localization;multipath propagation;propagation delay;software propagation;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link	Anders Landström;Jaap van de Beek	2016	2016 23rd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2016.7500413	estimation;transmitter;electronic engineering;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;knowledge engineering;solid modeling;computer network	Robotics	27.16429460976015	79.15105850521282	10250

The proposed SHCS-MAC protocol includes indispensible CR-MAC features such as bootstrapping, multi-channel operation, cooperative sensing, and self-coexistence. Bootstrapping algorithm enables a new node to join a common hopping based network. Slow hopping based multi-channel (MC) operation improves aggregate throughput by enabling concurrent data exchange in different channels on common hopping sequence in which the slot duration can be flexibly selected. Furthermore, cooperative sensing protocol appropriate for the slow hopping based MC-MAC is devised to increase PU detection probability. The improved detection probability enables SUs to promptly evacuate from the channel in which a PU appears. Finally, self-coexistence algorithm is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation due to the interference among neighboring networks. By using extensive simulation and analysis, SHCS-MAC is shown to more efficiently increase network capacity, improve PU detection probability, and achieve self-coexistence with minimal radio cost.	algorithm;coexist (image);cognitive radio;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;ibm systems network architecture;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation;throughput	Yoh-han Lee;Daeyoung Kim	2014	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.bjp.2014.01.005	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;bootstrapping;computer network	Mobile	8.756259476271612	90.80467493022105	10280

Being the first work in this direction, several types of signal fingerprinting-based approaches have been compared (e.g., CSI-based vs RSSI-based, statistic vs deterministic matching rule). In particular, the paper proposes a novel CSI-based signal fingerprinting that uses as fingerprint not directly the vector of channel gains per subcarrier, but rather some features extracted from these vectors. This method would greatly reduce the memory requirement of the database as well as the computational complexity of the matching phase. Experimental results, shown for both indoor and outdoor environments, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and also provide interesting insights on the use of LTE signal fingerprinting based on CSI.	csi-dos;channel state information;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;fingerprint (computing);k-nearest neighbors algorithm;multipath propagation;online and offline;subcarrier	Giovanni Pecoraro;Simone Di Domenico;Ernestina Cianca;Mauro De Sanctis	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115803	channel state information;theoretical computer science;subcarrier;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;fingerprint recognition;statistic;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	43.928353676132346	84.74078361029727	10303

However, the high overhead of generating stochastic bitstreams can offset the advantages of SC especially when a large number of bitstreams are needed. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic number generator (SNG) that significantly reduces area and energy while improving accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed SNG can reduce energy by more than 72% compared with the state-of-the-art designs.	comparator device component;computation (action);error-tolerant design;greater than;linear-feedback shift register;low-power broadcasting;multiplication;overhead (computing);social network game;stochastic computing	Aidyn Zhakatayev;Kyounghoon Kim;Kiyoung Choi;Jongeun Lee	2018	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2018.2789732	coding (social sciences);real-time computing;computer science;stochastic computing;artificial neural network;offset (computer science);logic gate	EDA	15.245739251214625	62.817031129662375	10311

However, the chained turbo equalization (CHATUE) algorithm, an equalizer required to both equalize the multipath fading effect and cancel the inter-block interference of SC-FDMA without CP, requires high computational complexity due to the non-circulant structure of the past and the future interference matrices. This paper proposes efficient hardware architecture based on systolic architecture for practical implementation. The main idea is to minimize the number of required processing elements by utilizing efficient resources sharing method while exploiting concurrency of the processing. A new computation method using masking matrices is introduced to obtain interference matrix from its corresponding circulant channel matrix. The results with fixed point computation show that the computational complexity can be significantly reduced up to 96% for practical implementation without significant degradation in bit-error-rate (BER) performances.	algorithm;bit error rate;carrier frequency;circulant matrix;computation;computational complexity theory;concurrency (computer science);convolution;elegant degradation;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;fixed point (mathematics);interference (communication);multipath propagation;performance;spectral efficiency;technology aware design;turbo equalizer;vii;x.690	Rian Ferdian;Khoirul Anwar;Trio Adiono	2012	2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381038	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Arch	48.19465286643248	79.87083095794934	10317

A control station with which attached user stations communicate over the power line is used to coordinate the communications process. As serious distortion and losses are incurred by signals that are transmitted across the power line, it is highly desirable to employ relay stations to support the transmission of such data flows. Yet, to date, only limited research results are available for the cross-layer synthesis and management of such a relay-aided power line communications system. In this paper, we develop and study a relay backbone synthesis algorithm (RBSA) that is used to configure the PLC network topology, allowing active source stations to efficiently transport their message flows to the control station. We also present a relay backbone synthesis algorithm under fixed-topology (RBSAF) that enables the system management mechanism to jointly activate selective relay stations and schedule their sharing of the PLC medium, when considering nonadjustable PLC network topologies. Our new computationally efficient RBSA and RBSAF schemes are proven numerically to achieve throughput rates close to the optimal solution.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;broadcast relay station;code rate;data access;distortion;futures studies;internet backbone;network topology;numerical analysis;power management;power-line communication;rss;systems management;telecommunications network;throughput	Izhak Rubin;Yu-Yu Lin;Daniel Kofman	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498155	layout;throughput;electronic engineering;link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;interference;time division multiple access;computer network	Networks	18.229590380325792	87.88061989911508	10342

As shown by our simulations, it converges fast to a fair rate allocation while generating a moderate queue length. While our approach can be easily implemented in ATM switches for managing available bit rate (ABR) traffic, it is also suitable for flow control in TCP router-based networks. Both the introduced overhead and the required modifications in TCP flow control systems are minimal. The implementation of this approach in TCP guarantees fairness and provides a unifying interconnection between TCP routers and ATM networks. The new algorithm easily inter-operates with current TCP flow control mechanisms and thus can be gradually introduced into installed-based TCP networks.	flow control (data);phantom reference	Yehuda Afek;Yishay Mansour;Zvi Ostfeld	2000	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(99)00138-3	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;computer science;bic tcp;flow control;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Networks	-3.342734537878637	93.87868937051921	10369

The encoder and decoder are assumed to be causal and their combined operations are subject to a delay constraint. It is shown that, under the mean-square error distortion metric, an optimal encoder-decoder pair from the linear and timeinvariant (LTI) class can be found by minimization of a convex functional and a spectral factorization. The functional to be minimized is the sum of the wellknown cost in a corresponding Wiener filter problem and a new term, which is induced by the channel noise and whose coefficient is the inverse of the channel’s signal-to-noise ratio. This result is shown to also hold in the case of vector-valued signals, assuming parallel additive white Gaussian noise channels. It is also shown that optimal LTI encoders and decoders generally require infinite memory, which implies that approximations are necessary. A numerical example is provided, which compares the performance to the lower bound provided by rate-distortion theory.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;binary decoder;causal filter;channel (communications);channel capacity;coefficient;colors of noise;column (database);convex function;distortion;encoder;feedback;forward error correction;mimo;mean squared error;numerical analysis;rate–distortion theory;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral method;stationary process;transfer matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods;wiener filter	Erik Johannesson;Anders Rantzer;Bo Bernhardsson;Andrey Ghulchak	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;analog transmission	ML	36.96231719009854	66.04287945818506	10407

Compared with the existing studies which focus on a wired network, this study proposed a multi-path transmission mechanism for improving the performance of transmitting videos from a wired network to a wireless one in a software defined network environment. In the proposed mechanism, a mobile host could apply network bonding to integrate several physical or virtual wireless network modules, each of which was connected to a different access point, into a combined device. Thus, multiple wireless links of the mobile host could be established and hence multiple transmission paths from the video source in the wired network to the mobile host were derived. In addition, different amount of video packets were allocated onto different transmission paths so as to maximize the performance of the multi-path transmission. According to the results of our experiments, the proposed mechanism can enhance the performance of transmission in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).	experiment;peak signal-to-noise ratio;serial experiments lain;software-defined networking;transmitter;wireless access point	Chih-Heng Ke;Yeong-Sheng Chen;Yun-Shuai Yu	2017	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2017.000099	computer science;computer network;wireless network;real-time computing;peak signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;software-defined networking;software;network packet;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	3.544434193797672	91.79039997975329	10408

PUAR realizes uneven clusters by a designed cluster radius related to the distance and the labor cost, with consideration of the residual energy and spatial layout of sensor nodes in the cluster head selection. With QoS support, PUAR uses the quality of link to reduce the packet loss and shortens the total transmitting distance to reduce the average delivery delay in multihop transmission. For the usage requirements of tunnel monitoring, PUAR utilizes the labor cost of replacing batteries to realize local or global energy balance. According to the analysis and simulation results, PUAR is found to achieve low-power consumption and reliable QoS support, and it can also reduce the operating cost of tunnel monitoring.	algorithm;routing	Bin He;Gang Li	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/464963	embedded system;real-time computing;computer network	Mobile	8.66901231996087	81.39575886768147	10414

In this paper, we formalize the notion of the partial interference phenomenon observed in many recent wireless measurement studies and establish analytical models with tractable solutions for various types of wireless multiple access networks. In particular, we characterize the stability region of IEEE 802.11 networks under partial interference with two potentially unsaturated links numerically. We also provide a closed-form solution for the stability region of slotted ALOHA networks under partial interference with two potentially unsaturated links and obtain a partial characterization of the boundary of the stability region for the general M-link case. Finally, we derive a closed-form approximated solution for the stability region for general M-link slotted ALOHA system under partial interference effects. Based on our results, we demonstrate that it is important to model the partial interference effects while analyzing wireless multiple access networks. This is because such considerations can result in not only significant quantitative differences in the predicted system capacity but also fundamental qualitative changes in the shape of the stability region of the systems.	access network;approximation algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel capacity;cobham's thesis;interference (communication);numerical analysis;wireless access point	Ka-Hung Hui;Wing Cheong Lau;On-Ching Yue	2010	EURASIP J.

The major challenges pertaining to such OFDMA-based networks are to design a medium access control scheme that is expected to exploit multi-channel multi-rate diversity and with QoS provision. The previous existing scheduling algorithms either target at maximizing system throughput while starving the low-rate users, or focus on throughput fairness but seriously decreasing the system throughput. While proportional fair (PF) has emerged as a prominent candidate in wireless networks, as it achieves a good tradeoff between system throughput and fairness, PF still leads to low throughput of bad channel users, resulting in limiting the attainable QoS throughput for the entire system.In this paper, we propose a QoS-enhanced proportional fair (QEPF) scheduling algorithm, which aims at maximizing QoS throughput while still retaining fairness as well as maximizing system throughput in downlink OFDMA networks. QEPF proposes a QoS-enhanced PF-based utility function, which supports QoS and is a low-complexity algorithm for multi-channel OFDMA networks. We demonstrate via extensive simulation results, that QEPF outperforms PF in terms of system throughput and mean delay. The results illustrate that QEPF surprisingly attains great performance for poor channel users, while not sacrifices the performance of good channel users. Furthermore, the results show that QEPF well accommodates nearly twice the amount of high priority data than PF does.	algorithm;fair-share scheduling;proportionally fair;quality of service;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	I-Fen Chao;Chuei-Sheng Chiou	2014	J.

This has enabled very compact, autonomous and mobile nodes, each containing one or more sensors, computation and communication capabilities, and a power supply. The missing ingredient is the networking and applications layers needed to harness this revolutionary capability into a complete system.

By exploiting the independent conditional Probability Density Functions (PDF) of different subblocks in a received training sequence, a new complexity efficient frequency offset estimator is proposed in this paper. The same accuracy as that of Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) proposed by Morelli can be achieved in the proposed algorithm, however, with a complexity of only about 4/(3M-2) that of the later (M is the number of sub-blocks that a training sequence comprising). A new frequency offset acquisition algorithm is also proposed in this paper, whose maximum acquisition range is up to ±M/2 times subcarrier spacing, and a negligible acquisition error probability can be achieved. Since the complexity of the proposed algorithm doesn't change as the increases of M (as compared to it, the complexity of Morelli algorithm is a monotonously increasing function of M), its estimation accuracy can be improved by optimizing M without degrading its complexity efficiency, as proven by computer simulation.	algorithm;asymptotic equipartition property;carrier frequency offset;computer simulation;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;portable document format;subcarrier	Xiaomeng Chai;Zhongshan Zhang;Xu Zhang;Keping Long	2013	2013 22nd Wireless and Optical Communication Conference	10.1109/WOCC.2013.6676361	synchronization;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;system;statistics;channel	Vision	50.195085669205305	77.25295197519736	10474

In addition, the min- sum (MS) algorithm can reduce the complexity. The hybrid normalized MS algorithm with TDMP scheduling is presented to achieve good performance and to lower the complexity. For a quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) code with a long code length, parallel degree optimization and an offset iterative sequence rule are proposed. With the proposed techniques, the data correlation problem and memory access conflicts during TDMP scheduling can be resolved so that the iteration can smoothly proceed through the reasonable division of each block row. Fabricated in the 90-nm 1-Poly 9-Metal (1P9M) CMOS process, a multimode 96000-bit irregular QC-LDPC decoder is implemented.

2588753cd6f181a831e0ab7c18628b3f58aadbb0	a unified net-mac-phy cross-layer framework for performance evaluation of multi-hop ad hoc wlans		Most of the existing works have been evaluated the performance of 802.11 multihop networks by considering the MAC layer or network layer separately. Knowing the nature of the multi-hop ad hoc networks, many factors in different layers are crucial for study the performance of MANET. In this paper we present a new analytic model for evaluating average end-to-end throughput in IEEE 802.11e multihop wireless networks. In particular, we investigate an intricate interaction among PHY, MAC and Network layers. For instance, we incorporate carrier sense threshold, transmission power, contention window size, retransmissions retry limit, multi rates, routing protocols and network topology together. We build a general cross-layered framework to represent multi-hop ad hoc networks with asymmetric topology and asymmetric traffic. We develop an analytical model to predict throughput of each connection as well as stability of forwarding queues at intermediate nodes in saturated networks. To the best of our knowledge, it seems that our work is the first wherein general topology and asymmetric parameters setup are considered in PHY/MAC/Network layers. Performance of such a system is also evaluated through simulation. We show that performance measures of the MAC layer are affected by the traffic intensity of flows to be forwarded. More precisely, attempt rate and collision probability are dependent on traffic flows, topology and routing.	data rate units;end-to-end principle;fixed point (mathematics);glossary of computer graphics;hoc (programming language);ibm system i;network packet;network topology;phy (chip);performance evaluation;retry;routing;simulation;throughput	Rachid El Azouzi;Essaid Sabir;Mohammed Raiss El-Fenni;Sujit Kumar Samanta	2014	ICST Trans.

Packet schedulers located after the network point where the aggregation occurred are aware of the aggregate flow, but are unaware of its constituent flows. In spite of this, we show that quality of service guarantees may still be offered to the constituent flows provided the aggregation is performed fairly. In earlier work, we showed that the end-to-end delay is preserved (and in some cases improved) under flow aggregation, when the packet delay is coupled with the reserved rate of the flow. We go beyond these results by showing that, even when the delay is de-coupled from the reserved rate, the end-to-end delay is preserved under flow aggregation.	aggregate data;end-to-end principle;network packet;quality of service	Jorge Arturo Cobb	1999		10.1109/ICNP.1999.801926	real-time computing;packet analyzer;fast packet switching;quality of service;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;fair queuing;distributed computing;transmission delay;packet switch;scheduling;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-1.380531377858312	95.14212458661005	10504

In a typical coexistence scenario, a primary system may have potentially interdependent uplink-downlink communication channels (e.g., simultaneous uplink-downlink communications in a frequency division duplex system) overlapping with the frequency band of a UWB system. If such interdependencies of primary systems' activities are known, the UWB system's ability to detect primary systems can be improved. In this study, we are interested in determining the possible gains in the detection performance when taking interdependencies into account for practically implementable detection methods. Contrary to selecting the detection thresholds individually for each band as in a conventional detection approach, the bands are jointly processed. To this end, maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision variables are generated at the receiver, and bias terms are introduced to achieve a desired trade-off between the probabilities of detection and false alarm. In addition to finding the optimal detection results based on the Neyman-Pearson (NP) test, a suboptimal but practically implementable approach is also considered, and the gain compared to conventional independent detection is quantified for various practical scenarios. The results obtained from this study can be used for improving the primary system detection performance of UWB systems, as well as for cognitive radios that perform spectrum sensing in multiple bands.	coexist (image);cognitive radio;decision theory;duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;frequency divider;integrated reception system;interdependence;pearson hashing;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;ultra-wideband	Serhat Erküçük;Lutz H.-J.

Specifically, a statistical change point occurs at a random time and at a random location in the coverage region (or the region of interest) of a multi-sensor network. Each sensor node in the network has a limited detection range hence the observations of each sensor would be affected by the change point only if the change point occurs in its vicinity. The region of interest is partitioned by the detection ranges of all the sensors in the network. One is required to detect the presence of the change and to locate the partition of the change based on the sequential observations from all sensor nodes. Three performance metrics, namely the average detection delay, the false alarm probability and the false location probability, are of interest. The goal is to find a stopping time τ, at which the decision maker stops taking more observations and claims the change has occurred, and a terminal decision rule δ, by which the decision maker locates the partition that the change occurs at, to minimize a weighted sum of these three performance metrics. We obtain the optimal solution by first converting the proposed problem to a Markovian stopping time problem and then solving the problem using the tools from the optimal stopping theory.	algorithm;optimal stopping;region of interest;sensor node;weight function	Jun Geng;Lifeng Lai	2013	2013 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6737030	machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	15.691984490509913	78.11758623075711	10536

For many applications, a large number of sensors in an active wireless network are more effective and preferable to a few expensive wireless sensors. Location discovery of sensor nodes after they have been deployed is known as a challenge, especially for moving sensors. Algorithms based on radio signal strength indication are considered as the lowest cost method to solve localization problem. But in practice, the accuracy of signal strength indication algorithm varies with the average distances between wireless nodes - the nearer, the better. This paper describes a new integrated dynamic localization algorithm, based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm. In this concept, signals with RSSI values among beacon nodes could help to generate a real time 2D map of the network by self iterations. Unknown nodes use the map to determine their locations in this region. A software simulator is created to test the performance of the algorithm, and practical experiments also show the development of localization accuracy and efficiency.	algorithm;experiment;iteration;location-based service;multidimensional scaling;radio wave;sensor;simulation	Bing Wei;Wu Chen;Xiaoli Ding	2010	2010 Ubiquitous Positioning Indoor Navigation and Location Based Service	10.1109/UPINLBS.2010.5654301	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	16.299161165659175	74.84945000718656	10542

In our non-equilibrium setting, players aim to guarantee a certain payoff with high probability, rather than in expected value. We provide a high probability counterpart of the classical result of Mertens and Zamir for the zero-sum repeated games. Any payoff that can be guaranteed with high probability can be guaranteed in expectation, but the reverse is not true. Hence, unlike the average payoff case where the payoff guaranteed by each player is the negative of the payoff by the other player, the two guaranteed payoffs would differ in the high probability framework. One motivation for this framework comes from information transmission systems, where it is customary to formulate problems in terms of asymptotically vanishing probability of error. An application of our results to compound arbitrarily varying channels is given.	information theory	Payam Delgosha;Amin Aminzadeh Gohari;Mohammad Akbarpour	2016		10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541573	bayesian game;random variable;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;imprecise probability;conditional probability;probability of error;mathematics;mathematical economics;conditional mutual information	ML	34.82948523488835	66.03165180768835	10556

In what concerns the famous two-qubit quantum gate teleportation protocol, the role of the basis of measurement was considered in a recent work by Mendes and Ramos. In this work, we analyze the role of the four-qubit state used as resource. We show that the quantum two-qubit gate teleportation divides the set of pure four-qubit states in two classes. For one class, deterministic and probabilistic teleportation can be achieved, while for the other class, probabilistic remote two-qubit gate preparation is achieved.	probabilistic automaton;quantum gate;quantum state;quantum teleportation;qubit	Paulo Regis Menezes Sousa;Fernando Vasconcelos Mendes;Rubens Viana Ramos	2016	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-015-1108-8	no-teleportation theorem;quantum energy teleportation;quantum teleportation;theoretical computer science;quantum network;controlled not gate;quantum circuit;qubit;quantum channel;quantum computer;superdense coding;quantum entanglement;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum gate	Theory	31.014220132366116	64.63257388458116	10557

The model developed in this analysis determines accurate interference analysis which takes into consideration frequency and timing synchronization errors between cochannel cells in a Nakagami/Rayleigh fading scenario. This leads to new, accurate and computationally efficient expressions for average bit error rates and cutoff rates of MQAM-OFDM in a micro-cellular environment. Results obtained are applicable in the investigation of the effect of synchronization errors on the spectral efficiency of OFDM based micro-cellular systems. Whilst the system is more robust against timing jitters resulting from separation distances from the victim receiver, frequency synchronization errors above 10-1 have the potential to create a loss in spectral efficiency of up to 7.5% for 16 QAM.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;bit error rate;computer performance;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;mobile phone;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;spectral efficiency;statistical interference;telecommunications link;while	Khairi Ashour Hamdi;Yemisi M.

For this purpose, the probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative density functions (CDFs) of the receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the destination and eavesdropper are given by conducting the singular value decomposition (SVD) on the estimated channel coefficient matrices. Consequently, the closed- form expressions for the probability of positive secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability over Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Finally, the Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis.	channel state information;coefficient;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;monte carlo method;performance;portable document format;radio jamming;rayleigh fading;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;singular value decomposition;while	Long Kong;Jiguang He;Georges Kaddoum;Satyanarayana Vuppala;Lin Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881216	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;mimo	Visualization	38.06487087158377	78.52446772805516	10587
cfd467ad35a31bd87d289aa8a797f9ce02ef26d7	pf scheduling in hybrid full duplex system: upper bound and simple algorithms		In-band full-duplex (IBFD) radio system can potentially double the spectral efamp;#64257;ciency of wireless networks. For IBFD radio system, the residual self-interference (RSI) is a critical issue. In addition, in-band full-duplex cellular (FDC) networks, particularly when the cell size is small, inter-user interference (IUI) would be another key factor for the performance degradation. To overcome these issues, we propose the scheduling scheme which adaptively utilizes bidirectional FD (BFD) mode and unidirectional FD (UFD) mode in the halfduplex (HD) networks. This scheme is based on the RSI channels after interference cancellation and IUI channels for each carrier, in order to maximize the proportional fairness. Simulation results revealed that the use of BFD mode is extremely dominant for a small cell with few mobile stations (MSs) if self- interference is sufamp;#64257;ciently canceled since IUI could be large.	binary file descriptor library;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;proportionally fair;rounding;scheduling (computing);set cover problem;simulation;usb flash drive;x86	Jaemin Lim;Jimin Bae;Yonghoon Choi;Youngnam Han	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925897	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	29.89790367136035	90.92711853067526	10599

4711f2f8cba8bae372fd4b12c457186a715c5283	optimal source codes for timely updates		A transmitter observing a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables seeks to keep a receiver updated about its latest observations. The receiver need not be apprised about each symbol seen by the transmitter, but needs to output a symbol at each time instant t. If at time t the receiver outputs the symbol seen by the transmitter at time U(t) ≤ t, the age of information at the receiver at time t is t − U(t). We study the design of lossless source codes that enable transmission with minimum average age at the receiver. We show that the asymptotic minimum average age can be roughly attained by Shannon codes for a tilted version of the original pmf generating the symbols, which can be computed easily by solving an optimization problem. Furthermore, we exhibit an example with alphabet X where the Shannon codes for the original pmf incur an asymptotic average age of a factor O( √ log |X |) more than that achieved by our codes. Underlying our prescription for optimal codes is a new variational formula for integer moments of random variables, which may be of independent interest. Also, we discuss possible extensions of our formulation to randomized schemes and erasure channel, and include a treatment of the related problem of source coding for minimum average queuing delay.

In this paper we summarize some key characteristics of UAV communications, describe fundamentals and challenges for reliable UAV communications, some current efforts in the area, and provide a framework for analysis and modeling of a vital component in any UAV communication system: the air-ground channel.

The objective is to maximize the minimum EE among all base stations (BSs) subject to per-BS power constraints. The resulting optimization problem is a max-min fractional program, and, thus, difficult to solve in general. Our goal is to develop a decentralized algorithm for the max-min EE problem which solves the problem locally. The idea behind the proposed method is to combine the framework of successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We transform the convex program obtained at each step of the SCA procedure into a form that lends itself to the ADMM. The resulting formulation is solved optimally by allowing the BSs to exchange the required information until the ADMM converges. In addition to further reduce the backhaul overhead, the proposed algorithm is modified to enhance the convergence speed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);centralized computing;convex optimization;fairness measure;iteration;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-user;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;overhead (computing);rate of convergence;simulation;stationary process;stationary state;system analysis;telecommunications link;vergence	Kien-Giang Nguyen;Le-Nam Tran;Quang-Doanh Vu;Markku J.

b3e2443f25eb9755cc45bc662366b032fdaa0af5	coverage in battery-free wireless sensor networks		Battery-Free Wireless Sensor Network (BF-WSN) is a newly proposed network architecture to address the limitation of traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The special features of BF-WSNs make the coverage problem quite different and even more challenging from and than that in traditional WSNs. This paper defines a new coverage problem in BF-WSNs which aims at maximizing coverage quality rather than prolonging network lifetime. The newly defined coverage problem is proved to be at least NP-Hard. Two sufficient conditions, under which the optimal solution of the problem can be derived in polynomial time, are given in this paper. Furthermore, two approximate algorithms are proposed to derive nearly optimal coverage when the sufficient conditions are unsatisfied. The time complexity and approximate ratio of the two algorithms are analyzed. Extensive simulations are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed algorithms.

d5efbc15fd6098ea74ca235347288888d2b0329a	design of smart power-saving architecture for network on chip		In network-on-chip (NoC), the data transferring by virtual channels can avoid the issue of data loss and deadlock. Many virtual channels on one input or output port in router are included. However, the router includes five I/O ports, and then the power issue is very important in virtual channels. In this paper, a novel architecture, namely, Smart Power-Saving (SPS), for low power consumption and low area in virtual channels of NoC is proposed. The SPS architecture can accord different environmental factors to dynamically save power and optimization area in NoC. Comparison with related works, the new proposed method reduces 37.31%, 45.79%, and 19.26% on power consumption and reduces 49.4%, 25.5% and 14.4% on area, respectively.	network on a chip	Trong-Yen Lee;Chi-Han Huang	2014	VLSI Design	10.1155/2014/531653	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;engineering;operating system;computer network	EDA	2.878090676141814	61.73872182587769	10751

Our analysis provides new insights on the effect of the TFA attack in the context of video watermarking when the ST is used. To remove the interferences and the attenuation of the watermark caused by the TFA attack, an adaptation of the Spread Transform is proposed. Our solution is based on the embedding of the watermark thanks to different orthogonal directions and by exploiting the temporal diversity of the video signal, i.e. the message is spread over several video frames. Finally, we show that the robustness and decoding performances are close to the ones before the attack.	frame (video);performance	Sofiane Braci;Rémy Boyer;Claude Delpha	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651418	additive white gaussian noise;computer vision;telecommunications;digital watermarking;computer science;information security;resistance;computer security;statistics;robustness	Vision	51.65484395575707	62.95072296582543	10763

The decoders cooperate via cribbing, i.e., the decoder with access only to the common description is allowed to observe, in addition, a deterministic function of the reconstruction symbols produced by the other. We characterize the fundamental performance limits in the respective settings of noncausal, strictly causal, and causal cribbing. We use a coding scheme, referred to as Forward Encoding and Block Markov Decoding, which builds on one recently used by Cuff and Zhao for coordination via implicit communication.

TCP congestion control can perform badly in highspeed wide area networks because of its slow response with large congestion window. The challenge for any alternative protocol is to better utilize networks with high bandwidth-delay products in a simple and robust manner without interacting badly with existing traffic. Scalable TCP is a simple sender side alteration to the TCP congestion window update algorithm. In this paper we numerically evaluate the congestion control method of scalable TCPs and its impact on other existing TCP versions. The general purpose of this work is to study the behavior of scalable TCP not only in situations where it was reportedly performing good but also under more extreme conditions. We also revealed whether scalable TCP maintains an acceptable fairness towards highspeed and/or regular TCP versions. Fairness of scalable TCPs with different round trip times are also investigated.	algorithm;bandwidth-delay product;fairness measure;interaction;network congestion;numerical analysis;scalability;scalable tcp;tcp congestion control	Mohamed Tekala;Róbert Szabó	2005	The 3rd ACS/IEEE International Conference onComputer Systems and Applications, 2005.	10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387049	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;numerical analysis;computer science;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;informatics;network congestion;tcp acceleration;round-trip delay time;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;bandwidth;robustness;computer network;bandwidth-delay product	HPC	-3.419791499956127	94.04754828087799	10805

The analysis is then extended to the case of successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based detection.

0b833130e932ceba2a82541d66cddeb1e4fcc1da	a statistical-physics approach to the analysisof wireless communication systems	elektro och systemteknik;electrical engineering;telekommunikation;telecommunications	MULTIPLE antennas at each side of the communication channel seem to be vital for future wireless communication systems. Multi-antenna communication provides throughput gains roughly proportional to the smallest number of antennas at the communicating terminals. On the other hand, multiple antennas at a terminal inevitably increase the hardware complexity of the latter. For efficient design of such systems relevant mathematical tools, capable of capturing the most significant features of the wireless multi-antenna channel–such as fading, spatial correlation, interference–are essential. This thesis, based on the asymptotic methods from statistical physics and random matrix theory, develops a series of asymptotic approximations for various metrics characterizing the performance of multi-antenna systems in different settings. The approximations become increasingly precise as the number of antennas at each terminal grows large and are shown to significantly simplify the performance analysis. This, in turn, enables efficient performance optimization, which would otherwise be intractable. After a general introduction, provided in Chapter 2, this thesis provides four different applications of large-system analysis. Thus, Chapter 3 analyzes multi-antenna multiple-access channel in the presence of non-Gaussian interference. The obtained large-system approximation of the sum rate is further used to carry out the precoder optimization routine for both Gaussian and finite-alphabet types of inputs. Meanwhile, Chapter 4 carries out the large-system analysis for a multi-hop relay channel with an arbitrary number of hops. Suboptimality of some conventional detectors has been captured through the concept of generalized posterior mean estimate. The obtained decoupling principle allows performance evaluation for a number of conventional detection schemes in terms of achievable rates and bit error rate. Chapter 5, in turn, studies achievable secrecy rates of multi-antenna wiretap channels in three different scenarios. In the quasi-static scenario, an alternating-optimization algorithm for the non-convex precoder optimization problem is proposed. The algorithm is shown to outperform the existing solutions, and it is conjectured to provide a secrecy capacity-achieving precoder. In the uncorrelated ergodic scenario, a largesystem analysis is carried out for the ergodic secrecy capacity yielding a closed-form expression. In the correlated ergodic scenario, the obtained large-system approximation is used to address the corresponding problem of precoder optimization. Finally, Chapter 6 addresses a practical case of random network topology for two v	algorithm;approximation;bit error rate;channel (communications);coupling (computer programming);ergodicity;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;network topology;optimization problem;performance evaluation;performance tuning;profiling (computer programming);random graph;relay channel;sensor;system analysis;throughput	Maksym Girnyk	2014			electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Metrics	38.14929547743756	79.23589307093403	10835

In particular, we focus on the problem of designing the optimal linear precoding for minimizing the total power consumption while satisfying a set of target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). To gain insights into the structure of the optimal solution and reduce the computational complexity for its evaluation, we analyze the asymptotic regime where N and K grow large with a given ratio and make use of recent results from large system analysis to compute the asymptotic solution. Then, we concentrate on the asymptotically design of heuristic linear precoding techniques. Interestingly, it turns out that the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder is equivalent to the optimal one when the ratio between the SINR requirement and the average channel attenuation is the same for all UEs. If this condition does not hold true but only the same SINR constraint is imposed for all UEs, then the RZF can be modified to still achieve optimality if statistical information of the UE positions is available at the BS. Numerical results are used to evaluate the performance gap in the finite system regime and to make comparisons among the precoding techniques.	computational complexity theory;heuristic;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;randomness;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;system analysis;telecommunications link	Luca Sanguinetti;Emil Björnson;Mérouane Debbah;Aris L.

The reliable broadcast service ensures that all the hosts in a group deliver the same set of messages to the upper layer. It represents the building block to construct fault tolerant distributed applications,, whose demand is growing in a mobile environment too. The protocol is intended for use in networks where the host mobility arbitrarily changes the network connectivity and where the rate of change is not so fast as to impose flooding as the only option. In this context, our protocol is a iirst attempt to show that a mechanism more flexible than spanning tree and more efficient than flooding is possible and a service such as the reliable broadcast can be obtained. The protocol is constructed on top of a multi-hop, multicluster architecture. It provides an exactly once message delivery semantics and tolerates communication failures and host mobility. Temporaneous disconnections and network partitions are also tolerated under the assumption that they are eventually repaired.	distributed computing;fault tolerance;file spanning;network packet;spanning tree	Elena Pagani;Gian Paolo Rossi	1997		10.1145/262116.262125	broadcast radiation;fault tolerance;atomic broadcast;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;terminating reliable broadcast	Mobile	-0.6879087153832115	82.92603898177519	10915

In this paper, the frequency resource sharing problem of D2D multicast communications underlying single frequency network (SFN) system is investigated. Firstly, to avoid the interference between D2D and cellular communication and without consuming more frequency resources, we assume that D2D multicast groups do not share frequency with cellular user equipments (CUEs) in the same SFN, but reuse frequency with CUEs in other SFNs. Then, according to a pre-setting threshold of signal to interference ratio (SIR) of D2D communication, a reuse safe distance is confirmed. Finally, a round-robin resource allocation algorithm is proposed.

283d956ff332e30124f87f7ee8f9033d9ae2f968	designing scalable hybrid wireless noc for gpgpus		Data communication in GPU systems exhibits asymmetric patterns that create congestion hotspots. Due to their large number of cores and big die sizes, GPUs also demand highly scalable NoC designs. In this work, we propose hybrid NoC architectures that employ on-chip integrated antennas to build overlaid wireless networks on top of conventional metal/dielectric-based networks. We use low-power high-bandwidth wireless links as express channels to transmit long distance packets and use metal links to deliver local packets. The hybrid architecture can effectively alleviate congestion near traffic hotspots and improve the throughput and scalability of GPU NoCs. We propose solutions for design challenges in such hybrid NoC architectures, such as MAC protocol, router microarchitecture, load balancing and deadlock free routing. To efficiently utilize on-chip wireless bandwidth, we also propose a novel scheme that adaptively allocates bandwidth to wireless channels based on their usage needs. Our evaluation results show that for a GPU with 256 cores, the proposed hybrid architecture can improve performance by 2.4 times on average.	deadlock;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;graphics processing unit;load balancing (computing);low-power broadcasting;microarchitecture;network congestion;network on a chip;router (computing);routing;scalability;throughput	Hui Zhao;Xianwei Cheng;Saraju P.

We introduce Construction A^prime of complex BW lattices that makes new connection between linear codes over polynomial rings and lattices. We show that Construction A^prime of BW lattices is equivalent to the multilevel construction from Reed-Muller codes proposed by Forney. To decode the BW lattice code, we adapt the low-complexity sequential BW lattice decoder (SBWD) proposed by Micciancio and Nicolosi. First we study the error performance of SBWD for decoding the infinite lattice, and demonstrate that it is powerful in making correct decisions well beyond the packing radius. Subsequently, we use the SBWD to decode lattice codes through a novel noise trimming technique, where the received vector is appropriately scaled before applying the SBWD. We show that the noise trimming technique is most effective for decoding BW lattice codes in smaller dimensions, while the gain diminishes for decoding codes in larger dimensions.	additive white gaussian noise;encode;encoder;forney algorithm;iterative method;jacobi method;norm (social);polynomial ring;reed–muller code;set packing;simulation;the wall street journal;utility functions on indivisible goods	J.

However, the optimal distribution is usually obtained through costly computational processes, such as the determination of the system eigenvalues. For communication channels in a fast paced environment, the costs are even higher due to the necessity of tracking channel changes. In addition, the computational costs increase with the number of inputs and outputs, i.e. the size of the MIMO channel matrix. A solution for reducing the computational burden is to utilize pre-determined waterfilling based on the channel’s statistics. No updates are required unless the channel statistical characteristics change. This work studies waterfilling estimations based on random matrix theory. The results can be applied when the channel coefficients follow a Rayleigh distribution and the noise is additive, white, and Gaussian.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;computation;mimo;rayleigh–ritz method;systems design;utility functions on indivisible goods	Victor M.

In this paper, we discuss interference cancellation in a multiuser MIMO environment using Amplify-and-Forward (AF), Decode-and-Forward (DF) and DeModulate-and-Forward (DMF) as relay protocols, and using Thomilson Harashima Precoding and Dirty Paper Coding as precoding techniques, with Zero-Forcing, Minimum Mean Square Error, Successive Interference Cancellation and Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation detection techniques. By using a combination of classical precoding schemes and detection techniques with weighted matrix, we propose a new interference cancellation technique that is capable of cancelling interference. The interference cancellation is managed by AF, DF and DMF relay node protocols and the interference free codeword is transmitted to the selected User Equipment.

eb035cda6efd8060f77eb9108160f25dd79c9262	energy aware cluster based routing protocol over distributed cognitive radio sensor network		Abstract Cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) is a combination of wireless sensor network (WSN) and opportunistic spectrum access technology. It involves the issues related to energy and dynamic spectrum inherited by WSN and cognitive radio network (CRN) respectively. CRSN poses research challenges in designing an efficient topology control for communication in network. In this paper, we propose an Energy Aware Cluster based Routing Protocol (EACRP) for CRSN that jointly considers both the energy and dynamic spectrum challenges. Reported schemes for CRSN suffer from high frequency of re-clustering due to PU activities and are energy inefficient. The proposed scheme employs a self-organized distributed clustering to obtain less average node power by producing the optimal number of clusters. To mitigate the effect of PUs’ activities, our proposed scheme forms clusters having more number of common channels and employs the concept of cooperative sensing in selecting the data channels for intra-cluster communication. To enhance inter-cluster connectivity, EACRP selects gateway nodes having more energy, closer to sink node and more number of common channels with neighboring nodes. Furthermore, a cluster-head (CH) rotation mechanism is employed that picks the CH based on nodes’ residual energy values, available channels, neighbors and distance to the sink in order to have longer network lifetime. Upon detection of an event, the EACRP aims to route the event data through an energy efficient and stable path from source node to the sink node. On performance evaluation, we found that EACRP outperforms in terms of end-to-end packet delay, node energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and stability of selected gateway nodes than considered competitive approaches.	cognitive radio;routing	Ram Narayan Yadav;Rajiv Misra;Divya Saini	2018	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2018.07.020	topology control;computer network;wireless sensor network;sink (computing);computer science;cognitive radio;energy consumption;network packet;routing protocol;default gateway	Mobile	8.023798124922543	81.24352949446802	10994

The analysis is for time-division multiple access (TDMA) with frequency hopping, power control, and discontinuous transmission, and the radio channel is composed of an inverse fourthpower path loss law with log-normal fading. We commence by introducing a single microcell into a hexagonal cluster of macrocells before considering clustered microcells. Both omnidirectional and sectorized cells are examined. We find that high reuse factors are required when channel sharing is employed. When channel partitioning is used, no co-channel interference occurs between the microcells and the macrocells allowing them to be planned independently. The reuse factors in the microcells and macrocells therefore do not need to be increased beyond conventional values. The outcome is that by opting for channel partitioning, the improvement in spectral efficiency compared to channel sharing is two to three times greater.	discontinuous transmission;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);software propagation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Robin Coombs;Raymond Steele	1999	IEEE Trans.

The stability region can be enlarged by two methods, the cooperation between users and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). The cooperative transmission allows users to exploit cooperative gains in random access networks. The HARQ technique increases the transmission efficiency in retransmission. This idea of introduce cooperation in the slotted ALOHA has been implemented in an earlier work. In this paper, we propose to further integrate HARQ into the slotted ALOHA with cooperation to enlarge the stability region. Mathematical analysis and simulation are provided to describe the two-user stability region. Our simulation is practical cross-layer simulation that uses LDPC code in the physical layer first and then simulates the stability region based on the resultant packet-level phenomenon.	access network;hybrid automatic repeat request;low-density parity-check code;network packet;random access;resultant;retransmission (data networks);simulation	Hsiao-Chang Yen;Yen-Ching Liu;Shih-Kai Lee;Mao-Chao Lin	2015	2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354616	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	34.19714189604401	78.90286207541965	11022

For SUs with multi-channel transmission capability, the process of selecting the channels to use by sequentially sensing the presence of PUs and evaluating the channel gains, incurs performance tradeoffs, power constraints, and expensive computations. In this paper, the channel selection problem for SU throughput maximization, limited by the power available at SUs, is formulated in a CRN with both heterogeneous PU-traffic and channel conditions. Our proposed optimal algorithm only requires linear-time and quadratic-space online complexities and cubic offline complexities, with the latter needed when CRN characteristics significantly change. This represents a significant improvement over existing algorithms. Our solution achieves throughput and delays close to maximum, not compromising accuracy for efficiency as approximate channel selection algorithms need to do.	access control;approximation algorithm;backward induction;binary logarithm;cognitive radio;computation;cubic function;expectation–maximization algorithm;general instrument ay-3-8910;one-class classification;online and offline;rewriting;selection algorithm;social inequality;throughput;time complexity	Luca Zappaterra;Hyeong-Ah Choi	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952530	availability;mathematical optimization;throughput;cognitive radio;cognitive network;computer science;sensor;radio resource management;theoretical computer science;computational complexity theory;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	34.29274161783657	92.31700500518826	11038

d92778bd4c8cb137668b68166139db219bff8c16	a little prediction goes a long way: routing in semi-deterministic delay tolerant networks		Realizing delay-capacity in intermittently connected mobile networks remains a largely open question, with state-of-the-art routing schemes typically focusing either on delay or on capacity. We show the feasibility of routing with both high goodput and desired delay constraints, with REAPER (for Reliable, Efficient, and Predictive Routing), a fully distributed convergecast routing framework that jointly optimizes both path length and path delay. A key idea for efficient instantiation of REAPER is to exploit predictability of mobility patterns, in terms of a semi-deterministic model which appropriately captures several vehicular and human inter-contact patterns. Packets are thus routed using paths that are jointly optimal at their time of arrival, in contrast to extant DTN protocols which use time-average metrics for routing. REAPER is also self-stabilizing to changes in the mobility pattern. A simulation-based evaluation confirms that, across the spectrum of ultra-light to heavy traffics, REAPER achieves up to 135% and 200% higher throughput and up to 250% and 1666% higher energy efficiency than state-of-the-art single-copy protocols MEED-DVR and PROPHET, which optimize a single metric only, specifically, expected delay and path probability respectively.	delay-tolerant networking;digital video recorder;goodput;norm (social);reaper;routing;self-stabilization;semiconductor industry;simulation;throughput;time of arrival;universal instantiation	Dhrubojyoti Roy;Mukundan Sridharan;Satyajeet Deshpande;Anish Arora	2013	CoRR		routing;static routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	4.853642422413471	85.48479839328745	11050

The EDCA parameters are: CWmin and CWmax (minimum and maximum contention window), AIFS (arbitration interframe space), and TXOP (transmit opportunity). In this paper we study the joint setting of these parameters to maximize capacity and optimize performance under QoS constraints. We first revisit the analytical modeling in saturation and non-saturation conditions and provide more detailed approximations of the mean channel access delay and throughput. Considering two classes of wireless stations with higher and lower QoS demands, and optimizing with respect to average measures and constraints, we provide Pareto optimal pairs for the number of supported stations from the two classes for different parameter set configurations and load conditions. Further, we examine optimal parameter selection for a class of elastic traffic, in the presence of a delay-sensitive class whose parameters are fixed. Our findings show that drastic service differentiation can undermine capacity of a WLAN. They also demonstrate the optimality of jointly setting high values for TXOP and AIFS in order to maximize the throughput of the elastic traffic class while guaranteeing delay of the delay-sensitive class. We also reveal different optimal settings for CWmin for different load conditions. We summarize our findings as guidelines for the setting of 802.11e parameters in a scenario with data and real-time service classes.	approximation;clock rate;expectation–maximization algorithm;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;quality of service;real-time clock;retransmission (data networks);self-clocking signal;throughput	Ioannis Z.

This helps to reduce the overhead of routing.

In HetNets, small cells serve as offloading spots in the radio access network to offload users and their associated traffic from congested macrocells. In this paper, we perform analytical analysis and investigate how the radio propagation effects such as multipath and shadowing, and small cell base station density affect macro users' offloading to small cell networks. In particular, we exploit composite fading channel in our evaluation when a macro user is offloaded to small cells networks within the stochastic heterogeneous networks framework. We derive the expressions for outage probability (equivalently success probability) of the macro user in macro network and small cells network for Nakagami-lognormal desired and interfering signals. We propose efficient approximation for the probability density functions of the channel fading power for shadowed Nakagami-m fading distribution that does not have closed-form expression employing Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Finally, the outage probability performance of macro user with and without offloading options/services is analyzed for various settings of fading channels.	approximation;cell (microprocessor);downtime;gauss–hermite quadrature;hermite polynomials;multipath propagation;radio access network;software propagation	Mirza Golam Kibria;Gabriel Porto Villardi;Wei-Shun Liao;Kien Nguyen;Kentaro Ishizu;Fumihide Kojima	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)	10.1109/CSCN.2016.7785176	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;small cell;fading;computer network	Mobile	27.43927648930351	84.73707067953707	11061

In these systems, each node has a real-valued local metric, which is a measure of its ability to improve system performance. Our goal is to identify the best node, which has the largest metric. We propose, analyze, and optimize a new distributed, yet simple, node selection scheme that combines the timer scheme with power control. In it, each node sets a timer and transmit power level as a function of its metric. The power control is designed such that the best node is captured even if η other nodes simultaneously transmit with it. We develop several structural properties about the optimal metric-to-timer-and-power mapping, which maximizes the probability of selecting the best node. These significantly reduce the computational complexity of finding the optimal mapping and yield valuable insights about it. We show that the proposed scheme is scalable and significantly outperforms the conventional timer scheme. We investigate the effect of η and the number of receive power levels. Furthermore, we find that the practical peak power constraint has a negligible impact on the performance of the scheme.	computation;computational complexity theory;scalability;timer	Vikas Kumar Dewangan;Neelesh B.

To enable this link adaptation requires an estimation of a suitable link quality measure. This paper details a robust, low complexity algorithm for estimating a link independent measure-carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I)-in GSM over a wide dynamic range. The complexity of the algorithm is reduced by exploiting the structure of GMSK modulation. An algorithm for diversity combining the link quality estimates is also presented. Performance results are presented for TU, RA, and HT multipath propagation conditions for mobile speeds of 3, 50, and 100 km/h. It is shown that the algorithm meets the GSM 05.09 link adaptation specification with sufficient margin and with a reasonably low computational complexity.	algorithm;interference (communication)	Vijay Nangia;Joseph M.

b681c13f51074040fb9662cf929e7dcdb439fb17	5g massive mimo architectures: self-backhauled small cells versus direct access		In this paper, we focus on one of the key technologies for the fifth-generation wireless communication networks, massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO), by investigating two of its most relevant architectures: 1) to provide in-band wireless backhauling to a dense deployment of self-backhauled small cells (SCs) acting as communication relays to end-users, and 2) to provide direct wireless access (DA) to end-users. Through comprehensive 3GPP-based system-level simulations and analytical formulation, we show the end-to-end user rates achievable with these two architectures. Different from the existing work, we provide results for two strategies of self-backhauled SCs deployments, namely random and ad-hoc. Where in the latter SCs are purposely positioned close to UEs to achieve line-ofsight (LoS) access links. We also show the optimal backhaul and access time resource partition due to the in-band self-backhauling operations. For the mMIMO DA, we consider the implication of different pilot reuse schemes for the channel state information (CSI) acquisition, associated overhead and contamination effects. We find that the ad-hoc deployment of self-backhauled SCs closer to the users (UEs) with optimal resource partition and with directive antenna patterns, provides rate improvements for celledge UEs that amount to 30%, and a tenfold gain as compared to mMIMO DA architecture with pilot reuse 3 and reuse 1, respectively. On the other hand, mMIMO s-BH underperforms mMIMO DA above the median of the UE rates when the UEs are in the center of the cell, and the effect of pilot contamination is mitigated.	access time;backhaul (telecommunications);channel state information;directive (programming);dynamic-link library;exptime;end-to-end principle;fifth generation computer;hoc (programming language);johnson–nyquist noise;multi-user mimo;nl (complexity);overhead (computing);relay;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications network;x86	Andrea Bonfante;Lorenzo Galati Giordano;David López-Pérez;Adrian García-Rodríguez;Giovanni Geraci;Paolo Baracca;M.

We have found a remarkably simple function that fits the empirical results as a function of the actual noise level at both high and low noise levels. A linear code may be described in terms of a generator matrix G or in terms of a parity check matrix H, which satisfies Hx = 0 for all codewords x. In 1962, Gallager reported work on binary codes defined in terms of low density parity check matrices [2,3]. The matrix H is defined in a non-systematic form; each column of H has the same small predetermined weight (e.g., 3) and the weight per row is also uniform; the matrix H is constructed at random subject to these constraints. When these codes are decoded using Gallager’s iterative probabilistic decoding method, also known as the sum-product algorithm or belief propagation, their empirical performance is found to be excellent [4,5]. In this paper, we investigate the dependence of the performance of a low density parity check code on both the assumed and actual noise levels of a binary symmetric channel and a Gaussian channel. All the experiments make use of binary codes whose parity check matrices are randomly generated with weight per column t = 3 using construction methods 1A and 1B of [4]. The present work has four motivations. First, since the decoding algorithm (reviewed in detail in [4,5]) is somewhat ad hoc, it seems an interesting experiment to ‘tweak’ it, checking to see whether any of its control parameters can be set to better values than their standard values; specifically, we tweak the assumed noise level to see if setting it to higher or lower values improves the performance of the sum-product algorithm.

The main idea proposed is the design of coded schemes that are well matched to the iterative decoding algorithm being used rather than to hypothetical maximum-likelihood decoding. We first show that the design is crucially dependent on whether the continuous phase encoder (CPE) is realized in recursive form or in nonrecursive form. We then consider the design of convolutionally coded systems and low density parity check codes with MSK to obtain near-capacity performance. With convolutional codes, we show that it is possible to significantly improve the performance by using a mixture of recursive and nonrecursive realizations for the CPE. For low density parity check codes, we show that codes designed for binary phase shift keying are optimal for MSK only if the nonrecursive realization is used; for the recursive realization, we design new LDPC codes based on the concept of density evolution. We show that these codes outperform the best known codes for MSK and have lower decoding complexity.	algorithm;concatenation;constant phase element;convolutional code;decoding methods;encoder;iteration;iterative method;key (cryptography);low-density parity-check code;modulation;parity bit;recursion	Krishna R.

However, there is a trade-off in achieving both goals at the same time. In this work, we consider the joint optimization of the power amplifier and a pulse shaping filter over a single-input single-output (SISO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using 1-bit analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters. The goal of the optimization is the selection of the optimal system parameters in order to maximize the desired figure-of-merit (FOM) which is the product of power efficiency and spectral efficiency. Simulation results give an insight in choosing the optimal parameters of the pulse shaping filter and power amplifier to maximize the desired FOM.	1-bit architecture;am broadcasting;additive white gaussian noise;analog-to-digital converter;audio power amplifier;circuit complexity;digital-to-analog converter;distortion;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;noise shaping;nonlinear system;oversampling;performance per watt;pulse shaping;quantization (signal processing);simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;spectral efficiency;systems design;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hela Jedda;Muhammad Mudussir Ayub;Jawad Munir;Amine Mezghani;Josef A.

In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between energy consumption and delay in a multi-channel full-duplex wireless LAN (WLAN). The goal is to minimize the energy consumption while keeping the packet queues stable. With Lyapunov optimization, we develop an online scheme to achieve the goals with optimized channel assignment, transmission scheduling, and transmission mode selection. We prove the optimality of the proposed algorithm and derive upper bounds for the average queue length and energy consumption, which demonstrate the energy-delay trade-off. The proposed algorithm is validated with simulations.	duplex (telecommunications);scheduling (computing)	Zhefeng Jiang;Shiwen Mao	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21837-3_24	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	12.699739547555943	94.6393911795341	11144

In this paper, we investigate the transmit correlation effect on the ZF receiver with successive interference cancellation (SIC). We show that such an unfavorable condition leads to twofold effects on the performance degradation. In addition to the immediate SNR loss, the transmit correlation can increase the propagation factor to spread decision error significantly. These two effects are evaluated analytically. We derive the probability density function (pdf) of the effective SNR at each decoded stream, and hence accurately quantify the SNR loss. We also calculate the decision error propagation factor in terms of its second moment. In particular, we show that transmit correlation can cause a stable component of error propagation which does not decline during the SIC procedure. Finally, we conduct the simulation to verify the analytical results.	blast;bell laboratories layered space-time;cs-blast;code;condition number;elegant degradation;gore (segment);information theory;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;portable document format;propagation of uncertainty;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;simulation;software propagation;spectral efficiency;trix (operating system);transceiver;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	HaiYou Guo;ZhiGang Zhou;HongLin Hu	2009	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-009-0208-4	zero forcing equalizer;probability density function;telecommunications;computer science;propagation of uncertainty;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;information system;statistics	Security	43.678751625430024	75.317770900882	11148

The receiver is designed to retrieve the hopping pattern without a priori knowledge. The proposed system can effectively mitigate random jamming interference while maintaining high spectral efficiency. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the system's jamming mitigation performance.	catastrophic interference;electronic counter-countermeasure;encoder;frequency band;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);modulation;pseudorandomness;radio jamming;randomness;simulation;spectral efficiency;systems design	Huahui Wang;Tongtong Li	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495956	telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;spread spectrum;statistics	Robotics	44.55637983485825	77.48608873493477	11172
2eced078e9731b44194391fcc170414e3021abad	performance analysis of vehicle platooning using a cellular network		This paper investigates the performance of longitudinal control of a platoon of vehicles using communication of messages through a cellular network. We describe a platooning algorithm that utilizes, at each following vehicle, information communicated by the preceding vehicle and the lead vehicle of the platoon. The information received from the lead vehicle includes the position, speed and acceleration of the lead vehicle, whereas the information received from the preceding vehicle includes the target acceleration the preceding vehicle is attempting to achieve. The information is transmitted in messages that are received by a cellular base station, which then retransmits the messages to the intended vehicles. We perform an analysis of communication system capacity for a highway setting with dense configurations of platoons. We show that (a) the additional latency due to transmission through the infrastructure does not impact platooning performance, and (b) LTE can even support extreme vehicle densities with no impact to platooning.	algorithm;channel capacity;compaq lte;emoticon;platoon (automobile);profiling (computer programming)	Murali Narasimha;Vip Desai;George Calcev;Weimin Xiao;Philippe J.

To better understand the connection between compression and estimation in the Markov regime, we consider a class of Markov sources restricted by a continuity condition. In the absence of an upper bound on memory, the continuity condition implies that $p({{X}}_{0}\vert X_{-m}^{-1})$ gets closer to the true probability $p(X_{0}\vert X_{-\infty}^{-1})$ as $m$ increases, rather than vary around arbitrarily. For such sources, we prove asymptotically matching upper and lower bounds on the redundancy. In the process, we identify what sources in the class matter the most from a redundancy perspective.	markov chain;markov information source;markov model;matching (graph theory);redundancy (engineering);sampling (signal processing);scott continuity	Changlong Wu;Maryam Hosseini;Narayana Santhanam	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437897	combinatorics;redundancy (engineering);discrete mathematics;mathematics;binary number;markov chain;upper and lower bounds	Theory	36.24491453963176	62.90624249770126	11204

Several solutions have been proposed to achieve this goal. However, these solutions only consider how to exploit good channel quality for the direct link between the sender and the receiver. Since IEEE 802.11 supports multiple transmission rates in response to different channel conditions, data packets may be delivered faster through a relay node than through the direct link if the direct link has low quality and low rate. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC layer relay-enabled distributed coordination function (DCF) protocol, called rDCF, to further exploit the physical layer multirate capability. We design a protocol to assist the sender, the relay node, and the receiver to reach an agreement on which data rate to use and whether to transmit the data through a relay node. Considering various issues, such as, bandwidth utilization, channel errors, and security, we propose techniques to further improve the performance of rDCF. Simulation results show that rDCF can significantly reduce the packet delay, improve the system throughput, and alleviate the impact of channel errors on fairness	data rate units;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;inline linking;network packet;relay;simulation;throughput	Hao Zhu;Guohong Cao	2005	Proceedings IEEE 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.	10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1497874	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer performance;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	8.592496243920392	90.51665397019265	11219

The result of the topology optimization is applied to the design of the integration network for modern integrated switching systems (ISSs), which integrate individual switching devices together to boost switching capacity and to reduce network management complexity. The target of the optimization is to maximize bandwidth efficiency on the integration links and hence to maximize the ISS capacity to accommodate traffic. This eventually translates to minimizing the average inter-node hop distance within the ISS.First, the problem is formulated into an integer linear program (ILP) and it is solved to its optimality for moderate-size networks. Then, by comparing with the Moore bound and unconstrained topology optimization, we show the circulant graph can be a qualified candidate with good bandwidth efficiency. Finally, due to the scaling limitation of the ILP approach, a dynamic programming (polynomial-time) algorithm is proposed and results show that it performs very closely to the optimal solutions induced from the ILP solver.	circulant matrix;electronic switching system;mathematical optimization;topology optimization	Dexiang Wang	2015	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2015.03.012	mathematical optimization;topology optimization;computer science;dynamic programming;circulant graph;spectral efficiency	Metrics	32.72374770260144	98.5439472281363	11238

This approach fully utilizes all known users' information, performs interference cancellation (IC) to suppress the interferers within the cell, and exploits blind adaptive decision-directed (DD) MMSE detector to suppress the inter-cell interference. This process can be made iterative and in the multistage process, the tentative decision bits from DD-MMSE detectors can be fed back to the IC part to make interference regeneration more accurate. A simplified RLS (SRLS) algorithm is derived particularly for DD-MMSE detectors and steady-state SIR performance of the SRLS algorithm is analyzed. It is shown that the proposed detector with SRLS algorithm is sufficient to perform accurate multiuser detection and has significant performance gain over that of the pure blind detectors and the non-blind detectors for the given scenario. Moreover, compared with the conventional RLS algorithm, the SRLS algorithm has lower computational complexity and the convergence speed is faster. We also develop two group-blind channel estimation methods to estimate the effective signature waveforms in multipath fading channel. It is seen that the group-blind channel estimation methods using updated received signal correlation matrix can effectively combat the mismatch problem faced by pure blind detectors.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;computational complexity theory;expanded memory;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;machine robo rescue;multi-user;multipath propagation;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;nonlinear system;recursive least squares filter;relative intensity noise;sensor;steady state;telecommunications link;the matrix	Zhiyu Xu;Roger S.

In this paper, we propose a novel wireless resource scheduler, called GAME-C, that integrates our genetic algorithm for mobiles equilibrium (GAME) with the standard CDMA transmitter closed loop power control (CLPC). GAME assigns optimally both transmitting power and bit rate to every mobile station. Optimal allocation is in the sense that every user gets only enough resources necessary for meeting or exceeding its QoS requirements while minimizing interference to other users. Having done that, we gain further benefits as well. In addition to QoS provisioning, lower transmitting power extends a mobile station battery life. Moreover, the base station coverage efficiency is improved by decreasing the probability of blocking new connections or dropping current ones. In short, GAME-C expands the number of QoS-satisfied mobile stations in a cell. Various simulations show improvements achieved over the established (CLPC) basic scheme.	access network;bandwidth (signal processing);blocking (computing);eb/n0;experiment;genetic algorithm;hardware restriction;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;provisioning;quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);separable polynomial;simulation;sun outage;transmitter	Mohamed Moustafa;Ibrahim W.

Target coverage is a fundamental problem in such applications. In some applications, the coverage requirements change with the time. However, none of the existing works on target coverage takes into account the time-dependent characteristic of requirements. In this paper, we study the Maximum Lifetime Temporal Q-Coverage (MLTQC) problem in directional sensor networks. Given m targets with known locations and an energy constrained directional sensor network composed by n sensors, each of which has p sectors, the MLTQC problem is to schedule sensors to switch sectors to maximize the network lifetime such that each target o(1) is covered by at least q(1)(q(1) >= 1) sectors in vulnerable time of a period and by at least one sector in any other time of the period. We formulate the problem into an Integral Programming and compute the upper bound of the network lifetime for the problem. Then we present a relaxation-rounding algorithm based on the relaxation LP. Finally, we propose a greedy algorithm for the MLTQC problem. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.

Furthermore, throughout the selection of forwarder node, channel interference is also taken into account to offer consistent communication. Consequently proposed scheme minimizes the chances of collision and packet duplication at the network layer by controlling number of forwarders and transmitters. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms in term of average number of transmissions per packet, packet delay, energy consumption and residual energy as compared to baseline solution.	baseline (configuration management);catastrophic interference;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);network packet;routing;simulation;transmitter	Aasma Khan;Nadeem Javaid;Arshad Sher;Raza Abid Abbasi;Zeeshan Ahmad;Waseem Ahmed	2018	2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2018.00045	distributed computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer network;network layer;energy consumption;network packet;load balancing (computing);forwarder;routing protocol;communication channel	Mobile	5.718991086374221	83.65341851590794	11303

First, different QoS requirements are converted into different rate requests for simplifying the optimization problem. Second, the sub-channels are assigned to reach certain QoS satisfaction level (QSL) before water-filling based power allocation. The channel resource is not allocated according to highest data rate; users will be assigned channels that best suit the needs. The proposed algorithm is compared with three other algorithms and the simulation results show that it can provide different QoS guarantees for different users while maintaining the system data rate and fair transmission.	algorithm;broadcast delay;data rate units;fairness measure;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;memory management;optimization problem;quality of service;requirement;simulation;uncompressed video;x.690	Nan Bao;Junchao Li;Weiwei Xia;Lianfeng Shen	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554667	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;computer network	Embedded	28.139279952075498	93.19521278001314	11322

Previously, minimum-energy broadcast that exploits the broadcast nature of radio transmission has been studied and shown to be NP-complete for omnidirectional antennas. In this paper, we investigate the minimum-energy broadcast problem under a wide spectrum of directional antenna models, including sectored antennas with fixed sectors and beamwidth and antenna array-based smart antennas with varying degrees of beam orientation and beamwidth. We first propose the RF design and implementation of each model, which suggests the practical parameters of antennas under that model. We then show that the minimum-energy broadcast problem under each of the antenna models is NP-complete. Lastly, we present a heuristic algorithm based on BIP for the above problem under each directional antenna model and experimentally compare the energy efficiency of using different directional antennas using these heuristics. Our results show that using antennas with adjustable orientation and variable beamwidth gives the best results. For such antennas, the scanning angle is the dominant factor in improving the quality of the broadcast trees. The number of antennas per node is not that critical to obtaining a better broadcast tree as long as it is large enough to cover the entire 360◦ around a node so as to prevent network partitioning.	algorithm;experiment;fractal antenna;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);linear programming;mesh networking;np-completeness;network partition;radio frequency;simulation;smart antenna;software propagation;testbed	Sabyasachi Roy;Y.

In most cases nodes follow a predefined trajectory in space that may deviate from the norm due to environment factors or random events. In this paper we propose a DTN routing scheme for applications where the node trajectory and the contact schedule can be predicted probabilistically. We describe a technique for contact estimation for mobile nodes that uses a Time Homogeneous Semi Markov model. With this method a node computes contact profiles describing the probabilities of contacts per time unit, and uses them to select the next hop such that the delivery ratio is improved. We develop the Trajectory Prediction DTN Routing algorithm and we analyze its performance with simulations.	algorithm;computer simulation;delay-tolerant networking;markov chain;markov model;regular grid;routing;state transition table	Ionut Cardei;Cong Liu;Jie Wu;Quan Yuan	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88582-5_7	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;statistics;computer network	Robotics	3.4585802532522	85.6580278128324	11364

In multi-channel wireless networks, the fundamental challenge for data capture is how to assign operation channels to wireless sniffers. The existing approaches make some impractical assumptions, such as the prior knowledge on network traffic and the perfect conditions of data capture. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and investigate the sniffer-channel assignment problem in multi-hop scenarios. Especially, sniffer redundancy deployment is discussed, which enables multiple sniffers to monitor one traffic. This problem is formulated as a combinatorial multi-arm bandit (MAB) problem, and a cooperative distribute learning policy is proposed. We analyze the regret of our policy in theory, and validate its effectiveness through numerical simulations.	adversary (cryptography);assignment problem;hop;network traffic control;numerical analysis;packet analyzer;regret (decision theory);simulation;software deployment	Jing Xu;Wei Liu;Kai Zeng	2016	2016 IEEE 41st Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2016.97	simulation;uncertainty;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;redundancy;spread spectrum;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.045994107939986	93.13384606163861	11365

Hence, they are less effective in queueing-based performance evaluation when the buffer sizes are small. In this paper, we propose a short range dependent (SRD) process modelling by a generalized variance-based Markovian fitting to provide effective queueing-based performance measures when buffer sizes are small. The proposed method is to match the variance of the exact second-order self-similar processes. The fitting procedure determines the related parameters in an exact and straightforward way. The resultant traffic model essentially consists of a superposition of several two-state Markov-modulated Poisson processes (MMPPs) with distinct modulating parameters. We present how well the resultant MMPP could emulate the variance of original self-similar traffic in the range of the specified time scale, and could provide more accurate bounds for the queueing-based performance measures, namely tail probability, mean waiting time and loss probability. Numerical results show that both the second-order statistics and queueing-based performance measures when buffer capacity is small are more accurate than that of the variance-based fitting where the modulating parameters of each superposed two-state MMPP are equal. We then investigate the relationship between time scale and the number of superposed two-state MMPPs. We found that when the performance measures pertaining to larger time scales are not better than that of smaller ones, we need to increase the number of superposed two-state MMPPs to maintain the accurate and reliable queueing-based performance measures. We then conclude from the extensive numerical examples that an exact second-order self-similar traffic can be well represented by the proposed model.	curve fitting	Shou-Kuo Shao;Malla Reddy Perati;Meng-Guang Tsai;Hen-Wai Tsao;Jingshown Wu	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.4.1493	computer simulation;active traffic management;order statistic;systems modeling;poisson process;telecommunications;self-similarity;bicarbonate buffering system;markov process;second-order logic;statistics	Vision	-0.3985335217434838	100.05874681303443	11412

These networks offer improved throughput and latency with minimum distance routing in benign traffic patterns. As a solution to performance problems in adverse traffic pattern of the minimal routing, this article presents a misrouting solution. It uses two parameters to control the generation of routing tables. Using the paths on these tables, packets reach their destination nodes through non-minimal paths, without deadlock, live lock or starvation. Optimal values for the parameters are empirically determined. This routing strategy slightly improves the throughput while hardly increasing the base latency and extending the linear behaviour of the network. Experimental results confirm the good properties of this algorithm compared to minimal routing and Valiant algorithms.	algorithm;deadlock;routing table;starvation (computer science);throughput	Esteban Stafford;Carmen Martínez;José Luis Bosque;Fernando Vallejo;Cristobal Camarero;Borja Pérez;Ramón Beivide	2014	2014 IEEE Intl Conf on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2014 IEEE 6th Intl Symp on Cyberspace Safety and Security, 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Embedded Software and Syst (HPCC,CSS,ICESS)	10.1109/HPCC.2014.78	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;algorithm design;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;throughput;static routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;network topology;bandwidth;routing information protocol;computer network	Embedded	-0.15590102211914791	71.14992939739561	11419

A novel matching algorithm with less computational complexity than, but with performance very close to the state-of-the-art optimal maximal weighted matching algorithm is developed. Numerical results show that, with optimal power allocation, the proposed matching algorithm can achieve 9 ~ 10 dB cooperative diversity gain, which is equivalent to prolonging the cell phone battery recharge time by 10 times.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;maximal set;mobile phone;norm (social);numerical linear algebra;optimizing compiler;rechargeable battery	Veluppillai Mahinthan;Lin Cai;Jon W.

Such an interest originates mainly from optical packet switching due to the lack of optical buffers. These constructions of optical queues are based on optical switches and fiber delay lines (SDL). Theoretical studies in the SDL constructions have been recently reported for the constructions of various types of optical queues, including output-buffered switches, first-in-first-out (FIFO) multiplexers, FIFO queues, last-in-first-out (LIFO) queues, priority queues, linear compressors, nonovertaking delay lines, and flexible delay lines. In this paper, we consider the constructions of optical 2-to-1 FIFO multiplexers with a limited number of recirculations through the fibers, which is a very important practical feasibility issue on the constructions of optical queues that has not been theoretically addressed before. Specifically, we consider the constructions of optical 2-to-1 FIFO multiplexers with buffer size at least 2n-1 by using a feedback system consisting of an (M+2)times(M+2) optical crossbar switch and M fiber delay lines under a simple packet routing policy and under the limitation that each packet can be recirculated through the M fibers at most k times. In one of our previous works, we have shown that this can be done by using n fibers with delays 1, 2, 22,..., 2n-1 if there is no limitation on the number of recirculations through the fibers. The main idea in our constructions in this paper is to use extra fibers (other than the n fibers with delays 1, 2, 22,..., 2n-1) with appropriately chosen delays to emulate the effective delays of the concatenations of some of the n fibers with delays 1, 2, 22,..., 2n-1 so that the number of recirculations is reduced by so doing. It turns out that the number of fibers needed and their delays are determined based on a dynamic programming formulation obtained through a divide-and-conquer approach. We obtain a closed-form expression for the number of fibers needed in our constructions, and show that there are (r k) possible choices for the delays of the required fibers, where r is the remainder of n divided by k. Furthermore, we give the optimal choice of the fiber delays that achieves the maximum buffer size among the (r k) possible choices. Finally, we show that when n=k or nges2k, such an optimal choice also requires the minimum total fiber length among the (r k) possible choices.	concatenation;crossbar switch;delay line memory;dynamic programming;fifo (computing and electronics);multiplexer;network packet;network switch;norm (social);optical switch;packet switching;priority queue;queueing theory;routing	Jay Cheng	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.928285	feasibility study;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;mathematics;optical switch	Theory	-3.0373774591090084	72.81224518385322	11428

The focus is on the HO performance for inbound and outbound mobility which corresponds to handoff between the femtocell and the macro cell. Due to the severe signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) degradation near the edge area of femtocell, HO triggering for inbound and outbound mobility needs to be carefully selected than that of the macro cell. Too late HO triggering leads to radio link failures (RLF), whereas too early HO triggering causes ping-pong HO. In this paper, we take the neighbouring cell configurations into account to keep the allowable RLF rate and low ping-pong rates. We propose a cell-types adaptive handover margins algorithm, which assigns different handover margins in line with neighbouring cell types. Simulation results indicate that the low ping-pong rate and the low RLF rate are achieved simultaneously by using the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;elegant degradation;inbound marketing;interference (communication);performance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Hyung-Deug Bae;Byunghan Ryu;Nam-Hoon Park	2011	2011 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2011.6096636	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	HPC	21.216699592729857	92.23749491447084	11432

Furthermore, we introduce a cross-layer load balancing mechanism that takes into account uplink and downlink channel conditions, routing performance and congestion control. The proposed heuristic algorithms are inspired by the rapidly designed cooperative protocols and control the communication load of each mesh access point in a distributed manner.

Moreover, to account for the limited life-span of the wireless devices, harvesting the energy of the network transmissions provides significant benefits to the lifetime of such networks. In this paper, we study the performance of communication in dense networks with wireless energy harvesting (WEH)-enabled sensor nodes. In particular, we examine two different communication scenarios (direct and cooperative) for data exchange and we provide theoretical expressions for the probability of successful communication. Then, considering the importance of lifetime in WSNs, we employ state-of-the-art WEH techniques and realistic energy converters, quantifying the potential energy gains that can be achieved in the network. Our analytical derivations, which are validated by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of WEH in dense networks and identify the tradeoffs between the direct and cooperative communication scenarios.	colocation centre;information exchange;monte carlo method;randomness;sensor;simulation	Prodromos-Vasileios Mekikis;Angelos Antonopoulos;Elli Kartsakli;Aris S.

Spatial and temporal correlation exhibited by WSNs can be exploited to reduce energy consumption. Previous research works attempt to exploit this correlation by way of aggregation or adaptive sampling. We propose determination of the data correlation at each node by way of local computation and propose avoiding transmission of significantly similar data. This can lead to unused time slots at runtime (dynamic slack) which can be traded off for energy savings. Our approach uses techniques namely Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS), which utilize the slack generated dynamically to reduce energy consumption in a real-time environment. We propose heuristics with varying complexities for efficient slack management. We evaluate the performance of these heuristics by simulating diverse network conditions while incorporating different overheads. Our results show that the proposed heuristics can achieve energy savings up to 40% more than the baseline algorithms employing DVS and DMS, and, can achieve performance competitive with a Clairvoyant algorithm under network scenarios with high volume of redundant messages.	data redundancy;energy minimization;real-time clock	Benazir Fateh;G.

This location methodology needs a database conformed with RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Indicator) measures from the communication transceivers taken at specific locations within the localization area. But, the real world localization environment is dynamic and it is necessary to rebuild the fingerprint database when some environmental changes are made. This paper explores the use of different interpolation functions to complete the fingerprint mapping needed to achieve the sought accuracy, thereby reducing the effort in the training step. Also, different distributions of test maps and reference points have been evaluated, showing the validity of this proposal and necessary trade-offs. Results reported show that the same or similar localization accuracy can be achieved even when only 50% of the initial fingerprint reference points are taken.	channel (communications);evaluation;experiment;fingerprint (computing);internationalization and localization;interpolation imputation technique;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;map;network packet;radio frequency;spline (mathematics);testbed;thin plate spline;transceiver	Santiago Ezpeleta;José M.

While most studies on physical layer secrecy are under the information-theoretic framework and focus directly on the data transmission phase, studies on DCE focus on the training phase and aim to provide a practical signal processing technique to discriminate between the channel estimation performances (and, thus, the effective received signal qualities) at LR and UR. A key feature of DCE designs is the insertion of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal to degrade the channel estimation performance at UR. To do so, AN must be placed in a carefully chosen subspace, based on the transmitter's knowledge of LR's channel, in order to minimize its effect on LR. In this paper, we adopt the idea of two-way training that allows both the transmitter and LR to send training signals to facilitate channel estimation at both ends. Both reciprocal and nonreciprocal channels are considered and a two-way DCE scheme is proposed for each scenario. For mathematical tractability, we assume that all terminals employ the linear minimum mean square error criterion for channel estimation. Based on the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimates at all terminals, we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the optimal power allocation between the training signal and AN is found by minimizing the MSE of LR's channel estimate subject to a constraint on the MSE achievable at UR. Numerical results show that the proposed DCE schemes can effectively discriminate between the channel estimation and, hence, the data detection performances at LR and UR.	authorization;channel state information;information theory;lr parser;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;optimization problem;performance;signal processing;transmitter;ur, ur/web	Chao-Wei Huang;Tsung-Hui Chang;Xiangyun Zhou;Yao-Win Peter Hong	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2245124	transmitter;real-time computing;telecommunications;resource management	Mobile	37.96925494625559	88.6942909447564	11495
587983cefae53583c74bb068fb736c86bf7b5b1c	incentive mechanism design for wireless energy transfer in iot		Wireless energy transfer has been recently viewed as a promising solution to extend the operation time of wireless devices (e.g., sensors) for Internet of Things (IoT) system. In this paper, we formulate a business model and use the contract approach to study the energy transfer and pricing issue in IoT system, where the energy access point (EAP) gains revenue from providing wireless energy transfer to the various devices in the IoT system. Specifically, the EAP designs and offers a set of contract items in the form of transmit power and the corresponding payment. Then each IoT device will choose a contract item to maximize its payoff based on the private information (i.e., the type). Furthermore, we first derive the necessary and sufficient condition to make the contract feasible, i.e., satisfying incentive compatibility (IC) and individual rationality (IR) constraints, and then we analytically derive the optimal and feasible contract that maximizes the profit of the EAP. The numerical results further reveal that the EAP tends to exclude some IoT device from enjoying wireless power transfer service to maximize its profit. And the proposed power-based price differentiation can increase EAP's profit up to 36.6% compared with the no-differentiation case.

One of the major issues with SRAM-PUF is the reliability and uniformity of the start-up pattern with environmental fluctuations. This paper presents a technique for improving uniformity (distribution of 1's & 0's) and reliability (variations in power-up patterns) of SRAM-PUF utilizing aging effects (mainly NBTI). The proposed technique maintains the uniformity of SRAM-PUF by controlling the polarity of the aging in SRAM arrays. The reliability is controlled by further injecting aging to the SRAM arrays after achieving target uniformity.	circuit complexity;negative-bias temperature instability;physical unclonable function;semiconductor device fabrication;static random-access memory	Achiranshu Garg;Tony Tae-Hyoung Kim	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865541	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;engineering	Arch	18.54933878165196	61.224817473511386	11510
f8b8dac53dadd1ac39e96a8fe1a54e1b92e360df	optimized signal distortion for papr reduction of ofdm signals with ifft/fft complexity via admm approaches		"""In this paper, we propose two low-complexity optimization methods to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) values of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, we formulate a nonconvex signal distortion optimization model based on minimizing data carrier distortion such that the constraints are placed on PAPR and the power of free carriers. Second, to obtain the model's approximate optimal solution efficiently, we design two low-complexity ADMM algorithms, named ADMM-Direct and ADMM-Relax respectively. Third, we show that, in ADMM-Direct/-Relax, all the optimization subproblems can be solved semi-analytically and the computational complexity in each iteration is roughly <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathcal {O}(\ell N\log _2\ell N)$</tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\ell$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula> are over-sampling factor and carrier number respectively. Moreover, we show that the resulting solution of ADMM-direct is guaranteed to be some Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point of the nonconvex model when the iteration algorithm is convergent. For ADMM-Relax, we prove that it has theoretically-guaranteed convergence and can approach arbitrarily close to some KKT point of the model if proper parameters are chosen. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."""

The lower layer of the proposed architecture is based on a microcellular solution, for absorbing the traffic loads of Low Speed Moving Terminals (LSMT). The second layer is based on a macro-cell umbrella solution, for absorbing the traffic load of the HSMT. The higher layer is based on satellite cell and absorbs the traffic load of UHSMT. The results show that assigning the optimum number of channels in every layer, the QoS of UHSMT and HSMT are optimized, having a small bad effect on the QoS of LSMT.	cellular architecture;loss function;multitier architecture;optimizing compiler;quality of service;three-layer architecture	Konstantinos Ioannou;Ioannis C.

This paper generalizes the idea of differential encoding by using a nonlinear transformation called multilag high-order instantaneous moment (ml-HIM). The ml-HIM decoder is capable of removing the effects of phase ambiguity, Doppler frequency, Doppler rate, and even higher order phase distortions. The degrees of freedom offered by the different lags is exploited to optimize system performance. In addition to the classical M -ary PSK, the generalized differential encoding idea is also applied to nonconstant modulus constellations, such as M -ary QAM and AM-PM.	blind equalization;distortion;doppler effect;equalization (communications);first-order predicate;key (cryptography);modulus of continuity;modulus robot;nonlinear system;pre-shared key;signal processing	Fulvio Gini;Georgios B.

Based on their sightings, they maintain a dynamic cache that can be queried by a base stationa stationary or fixed node. Since transmitting messages consumes a lot of energy, as against local processing and moreover the limited energy in sensor node does not allow heavy duty computing, we need to develop algorithms that will ensure efficient computing and minimal transmission without degradation of performance. And also data is stored locally, and memory is finite, the nodes must choose their cache lines carefully and need to dump the redundant data so that it could avoid cache overflow. Here we propose a class of algorithms for locating target object moving over a sensor network. The algorithms work with energy and memory limitations of the nodes. Algorithms developed conserves energy by efficiently identifying sensor nodes and use local messages between neighboring nodes to follow the trail of the object, assuming local transmission cost less compared to the long range transmission. Since, we avoid the long-range transmission and maximizing the local granularity security increases. The entire dynamic nature of the algorithm exploits the knowledge management for effective identification of objects through predefined parameters such as the object, object velocity. Hence it effectively exploits the network management for locating the objects over the network with minimal energy conservation and short range transmissions.	algorithm;basic stamp;cache (computing);computation;elegant degradation;entity;knowledge management;sensor node;stationary process;transmitter;velocity (software development)	Arvind Nath Rapaka;Sandeep Bogollu;Donald C.

The pre-rake system has been well known technology in TDD-CDMA to make a mobile station (MS) simple. However, it still has a residual path diversity loss. To gather all the residual paths requires an additional hardware such as a rake combiner to MS. For the reason pre/post-rake system has already been proposed, and it could increase the performance gain comparing with a pre-rake only system by obtaining more path diversity. In the mean time, it has been verified that the maximal ratio post-rake combiner (MRC) at time domain can be designed with a less hardware complexity with a frequency domain MRC (MRC-FDE) and its performance is almost the same without considering the power loss due to the insertion of a cyclic prefix (CP).

Ideally, the aperiodic autocorrelation function should have zero sidelobes in order to eliminate intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation. In practice, such an ideal sequence does not exist in the binary field when data modulation is applied. For high data rates, a small spreading factor is desired in order to avoid an excessive system bandwidth. The family of Barker sequences is investigated in a DSSS–OWS. The Barker sequences are binary spreading sequences which exhibit small aperiodic autocorrelation values and short spreading factors. The system bit error rate (BER) performance is characterized on the diffuse indoor infrared channel when using RAKE reception. Results of BER against Eb/No are presented with data rate and spreading factor as parameters. The results demonstrate that of the seven Barker sequences existing, the length three Barker sequence f0 0 1g provides the best system design trade-off in respect of good BER performance and low implementation complexity.	autocorrelation;bit error rate;code;data rate units;eb/n0;interference (communication);modulation;multipath propagation;optical wireless;rake;software propagation;systems design;uncompressed video;x.690	Timothy O'Farrell	2008	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com:20060372	multipath propagation;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver;spread spectrum;correlation;intersymbol interference;wireless;optical communication;computer network	Networks	43.92601182916957	76.6738488586876	11640

While the requirement of low latency and low-energy consumption is getting more and more importance in emerging applications, the WSN should be capable of fulfilling its mission in a timely manner and without loss of energy. In this paper, we focus on multi-hop flat routing. A mathematical model for Delay and Energy Aware Routing (DEAR) is proposed. Our model aims to build a trade-off between energy consumption and delay. The goal is to find out a route from all sensor nodes to the base station, which has a comparably lower overall distance, with fewer data forwards. We define a multi-objective function for simultaneously minimizing the distance and minimizing the delay in forwarding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DEAR, we compare it with the LeeMoon (Lee and Moon Model), the MHRM (Minimum Hop Routing Model), and the MTEM (Minimum Transmission Energy Model). the numerical results show that our model outperforms those models in terms of latency and energy consumption.	hop;interrupt latency;loss function;mathematical model;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance;routing;sensor node	Manel Souissi;Aref Meddeb	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577155	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;communications protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;mathematical model;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	7.208393842196205	82.92739237589514	11687

This is largely due to their low computational complexity and impressive performance in practice. Still, there is no general understanding of the conditions required for convergence or optimality of converged solutions or both. This paper presents an analysis of both attenuated max-product decoding and weighted min-sum decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which guarantees convergence to a fixed point when a weight factor, β, is sufficiently small. It also shows that, if the fixed point satisfies some consistency conditions, then it must be both a linear-programming (LP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding solution. For (dv, dc)-regular LDPC codes, the weight factor must satisfy β(dv-1) <; 1 to guarantee convergence to a fixed point, whereas the results proposed by Frey and Koetter require instead that β(dv-1)(dc-1) ≤ 1. In addition, the range of the weight factor for a provable ML decoding solution is extended to 0 <; β(dv-1) 1. In addition, counterexamples that show a fixed point might not be the ML decoding solution if β(dv-1) > 1 are given. Finally, connections are explored with recent work on the threshold of LP decoding.	algorithm;assignment problem;casio loopy;computational complexity theory;decoding methods;dynamic programming;fixed point (mathematics);lp-type problem;linear programming decoding;low-density parity-check code;maxima and minima;provable security	Yung-Yih Jian;Henry D.

It is well known that, for OFDM, phase noise and frequency offset cause intercarrier interference (ICI). We first notice the dependency of the instantaneous capacity on the ICI power and on the fading channel. Using a Taylor series approximation, we show that the ICI power can be well represented in a quadratic form whose probability density function we derive. Using the derived distribution and assuming a Rayleigh-fading channel, we derive analytical expressions of average capacity. Different test cases are presented to study the sensitivity of the capacity on phase noise and frequency offset. The main observations suggest that, for reasonable phase noise levels, the capacity is practically insensitive to the frequency offset.	approximation;carrier frequency offset;ici (programming language);in-phase and quadrature components;interference (communication);phase noise;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;test case;transmitter	Pramod Mathecken;Taneli Riihonen;Stefan Werner;Risto Wichman	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362750	transmitter;noise;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;frequency offset;probability;co-channel interference;radio receiver;approximation theory	Arch	41.20351708195021	77.49069609085946	11722

Recent years, tens of WiFi-based localization systems have been proposed which could achieve decimeter-level accuracy with the commercial wireless cards and with no specialized infrastructure. However, such systems require the positions of the Access Points or fingerprint map to be known in advance. In this paper, we present CWISE, an accurate WiFi-Inertial SLAM system without the requirement for Access Points' positions, specialized infrastructure and fingerprinting. CWISE relies only on a commercial wireless card with two antennas and an IMU. We test the CWISE system on a flying quadrotor and it shows that the system is able to work in real time and achieves the mean accuracy of 1.60m.	angle of arrival;external variable;fingerprint (computing);simultaneous localization and mapping	Bing Li;Shengkai Zhang;Shaojie Shen	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2016.7849496	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;wireless distribution system	Robotics	20.697265086958286	77.97435924380099	11759
51c25e737058f6e6d603cad16c378971f50fac58	a dual-link soft handover scheme for c/u plane split network in high-speed railway		The heterogeneous network architecture based on control/user (C/U) plane split is a research hot spot in the fifth generation (5G) communication system. This new architecture for the high-speed railway (HSR) communication system can provide high quality of service (QoS) for the passengers, such as higher system transmission capacity, better transmission reliability, and lower co-channel interference. The relatively critical C plane is expanded and maintained in a reliable low-frequency band to guarantee transmission reliability, and the U plane is supported by the available high-frequency band to meet the increasing system capacity demands. However, there are still many problems to be solved in the C/U plane split network to ensure reliable transmission. In the HSR communication system, the C plane and the U plane are supported by the macro evolved NodeBs (eNBs) and the small eNBs, respectively. The handover between the different macro eNBs involves two types of handovers, which directly reduces its applicability and reliability in HSR. Therefore, a dual-link soft handover scheme for C/U plane split network in HSR is proposed in this paper. By deploying a train relay station (TRS) and two antennas in the train, the handover outage probability will be reduced. Moreover, the bi-casting is adopted to decrease the communication interruption time and the signaling flows of the intra-macro eNB handover and inter-macro eNB handover are designed in detail. Simulation results show that the proposed handover scheme can significantly reduce the outage probability and improve the handover success probability in the inter-macro eNB handover.	broadcast relay station;channel capacity;display resolution;downtime;fifth generation computer;frequency band;hierarchical state routing;interference (communication);interrupt;network architecture;phylogenetic network;quality of service;simulation;split networks;sun outage	Junhui Zhao;Yunyi Liu;Yi Gong;Chuanyun Wang;Lisheng Fan	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794770	handover;communications system;computer network;quality of service;heterogeneous network;soft handover;macro;interference (wave propagation);relay;computer science	Networks	24.062284754455003	87.8258727686412	11765

Although severe fading can be overcome with array antenna systems, a sufficient number of antenna elements are required, which has physical limitations. In addition, a multipath spatially adjacent to the mainpath can significantly degrade the performance of array systems. Accordingly, to overcome these problems, this paper proposes channel selective diversity for choosing the optimum path a long with a cascaded equalizer. To increase the confidence of channel estimation, a channel estimation method is also presented that combines the auto-correlation, cross-correlation, and spatial spectrum techniques. Computer simulations confirm the advantage of the proposed algorithm for 8-VSB DTV in mobile channels.	atsc standards;adaptive beamformer;algorithm;autocorrelation;beamforming;cascaded integrator–comb filter;channel state information;cross-correlation;equalization (communications);multipath propagation;simulation	Chae-Hyun Lim;Jung-Tae Kim;Dong-Seog Han	2005	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2005.1467972	computer simulation;spectrum;electronic engineering;index term;mobile telephony;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;adaptive beamformer;cross-correlation;digital video broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	43.55522426566694	80.0351096855524	11794

The integrated video/voice/data services of UMTS in UTRA TDD mode have different transmission properties. By fuzzy logic control, the resources of the wireless communication can be intelligent assigned for different types of mediums. The voice-video dropping probability and data packet delay are input to FLC to optimally select the maximum number of voice slots. The simulation results demonstrate that the FLC-based MBWIMA/UMTS protocol can greatly improve the voice-video call dropping probability of the GPRS/UMTS protocol under heavy traffic load conditions, providing low voice-video call completion rate and high voice call arrival rate. The data packet delay of the FLC-based MBWIMA/UMTS protocol is less than that for the MBWIMA/UMTS, priority scheme and GPRS/UMTS protocols.

In this case, the duration of pilot sequence transmission plays a critical role on the achieved VWN throughput. Therefore, we consider this parameter as a new optimization variable and propose a novel utility function for the resource allocation problem. The proposed optimization problem is non-convex with high computational complexity. To address this issue, by applying relaxation and variable transformation techniques, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm in which the allocation of power, sub-carrier and number of antennas is first established and then used to optimize the pilot duration. Simulation results reveal that proper pilot duration design improves the VWN performance.	algorithm;channel state information;computational complexity theory;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput;utility	Rajesh Dawadi;Saeedeh Parsaeefard;Mahsa Derakhshani;Tho Le-Ngoc	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564902	real-time computing;simulation;multi-user mimo;computer science;resource management;wireless network;interference;contamination;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	32.88472000027788	91.17074830030182	11821

887247e20bc9066818952f7d88d807caba2e78ac	maca-apt: a maca-based adaptive packet train transmission protocol for underwater acoustic networks	maca;underwater acoustic networks;adaptive packet train length;performance evaluation;simulation;mac protocols;collision avoidance	In wireless communications, collision is one of the principal sources of energy wastage, which often makes collision avoidance strategies preferred for medium access control (MAC) protocols. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance-based MAC protocol called MACA-based Adaptive Packet Train (MACA-APT), which has been designed specifically for underwater acoustic networks (UANs). The design explicitly accounts for prominent characteristics of UANs such as long propagation delays and typically high bit error rates. In particular, the former is compensated via the transmission of multiple consecutive packets to multiple different receivers; the latter, instead, is tackled by embedding a cross-layer Stop-&-Wait ARQ scheme within MACA-APT.  The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated via simulations and compared to another MAC protocol, also based on MACA, showing that MACA-APT achieves better performance for low to intermediate packet generation rates, and equivalent performance at higher rates. Moreover, we assess the impact of the packet train size on the performance of either protocol. This result is a first step towards the design of adaptive multi-packet multi-receiver MAC protocols for underwater networks.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;automatic repeat request;bit error rate;collision detection;network packet;simulation;software propagation	Saiful Azad;Paolo Casari;Khandekar Tabin Hasan;Michele Zorzi	2014		10.1145/2671490.2674580	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	8.614057129982069	89.71770468365072	11899

In this paper we describe the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP) that provides clock synchronization service in such networks. The protocol was designed to utilize low communication bandwidth, scale well for medium sized multi-hop networks, and be robust against topology changes and node failures. The robustness of the protocol is due to the periodic radio broadcast of synchronization messages and the implicit dynamic topology update. MAC-layer time-stamping, comprehensive compensation of errors and linear regression are used to achieve high accuracy of the clock synchronization. The data from a comprehensive multi-hop experiment shows that the average network-wide synchronization error is less than two microseconds per hop. The protocol was further validated as part of our countersniper system that was field tested in a US military facility.	clock synchronization;hop;radio broadcasting	Miklós Maróti;Branislav Kusy;Gyula Simon;Ákos Lédeczi	2004			embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;network performance;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	7.67575574745663	74.73440173719312	11919

A new alternating-offer spectrum bargaining framework is introduced with asymmetrically bilaterial wireless resource, in terms of sequential bargaining equilibria for frequency bands for high efficiency or approximate efficiency. In the proposed framework, the role of spectrum bargaining with user diversity can constrain many items with private information for spectrum allocation, thereby aggregating to a current frequency band surplus with spectrum trading to exchange the use in the reform of spectrum regulatory practice. While the users have an incentive in agreeing on a division of resource, they also have an interest in maximizing the amount of resource that it received. Furthermore, we develop an efficiency-based algorithm to explain why spectrum bargaining based on asymmetrical resource information can get little deviation from the first best resource utilization for high efficiency consideration. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-item spectrum bargaining scheme significantly outperforms the existing schemes.	approximation algorithm;centrality;cognitive radio;fairness measure;frequency allocation;frequency band;hemicontinuity;personally identifiable information;scott continuity;simulation;throughput	Hang Qin;Min Wang;Zhongbo Wu	2018	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-018-1155-0	human–computer interaction;computer science;wireless;cognitive radio;frequency allocation;frequency band;incentive;radio spectrum;private information retrieval;distributed computing	Mobile	31.805302115254097	94.73703073977639	11961

By connecting base stations (mesh nodes) with wireless connections, these network can achieve a wide-area wireless environment with flexible configuration and low cost at the risk of radio interference between wireless links. When we utilize wireless mesh networks as infrastructures for Internet access, all network traffic from mobile nodes goes through a gateway node that is directly connected to the wired network. Therefore, it is necessary to distribute the traffic load by deploying multiple gateway nodes. In this paper, we propose a spanning tree construction algorithm for TDMA-based wireless mesh networks with multiple gateway nodes so as to maximize the traffic volume transferred between the mesh network and the Internet (system throughput) by taking account of the traffic load on the gateway nodes, the access link capacity and radio interference. Through a performance evaluation, we show that the proposed algorithm increases the system throughput regardless of the bottleneck position and achieves up to 3.1 times higher system throughput than a conventional algorithm. key words: wireless mesh network, spanning tree, load balance, radio interference	algorithm;call stack;catastrophic interference;file spanning;interference (communication);internet access;load balancing (computing);mesh networking;network traffic control;performance evaluation;serial experiments lain;spanning tree;throughput;wireless mesh network	Hiroshi Tokito;Masahiro Sasabe;Go Hasegawa;Hirotaka Nakano	2010	IEICE Transactions		wireless mesh network;switched mesh;service set;wireless wan;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;load balancing;mesh networking;wireless network;shared mesh;optical mesh network;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-1.9949380390271203	84.49167851177623	11964

All the receiver needs to do is to apply a modulo operation to undo the perturbation. However existing system with multiuser MIMO support, such as LTE, employ linear precoding. This means that these legacy users will not be able to operate together with new users with vector perturbation capabilities, reducing the system throughput and flexibility in resource allocation. In this paper we present a novel precoding technique which allows the joint precoding of legacy and new users. The precoding ensures that no perturbations are made to linearly precoded users, while minimising the power normalisation using a modified sphere encoder. We also show that the diversity order of the joint precoding scheme is the difference between the number of transmit antennas and the number of legacy users, regardless of the number of new users.	compaq lte;encoder;legacy system;mimo-ofdm;modulo operation;multi-user mimo;perturbation theory;throughput;undo	Magnus Sandell;Henning Vetter;Filippo Tosato	2011	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2011.103111.110542	bit error rate;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;lte advanced;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;transmitter power output;modulo operation;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;multiplexing;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.96557500925375	86.31874091337603	11976

Recent developments in the Internet provide at least two types of service. For example, guaranteed service and controlled load service in Integrated Services networks, and expedited forwarding and assured forwarding in Differentiated Services networks. Providing guaranteed service and expedited service, referred to as bandwidth-guaranteed traffic, requires reservation of a fixed amount of bandwidth while controlled load service and assured forwarding service, referred to as fair-shared traffic, requires reservation of a minimum amount of bandwidth to ensure finite queue length. Routing in a network with these two types of service should take their traffic and QoS characteristics into consideration. In this paper, we propose two routing algorithms that use different cost functions and routing strategies when routing different classes of traffic. Our simulation results show that the proposed soft routing algorithm is able to yield low blocking probability for bandwidth-guaranteed traffic and high max-min fair share rate for fair-shared traffic under various traffic conditions.

Link correlation-aware collective flooding (CF) is a recently proposed technique that provides a substrate for efficiently disseminating a single packet. Applying CF to multiple packet dissemination poses several challenges, such as reliability degradation, redundant transmissions, and increased contention among node transmissions. The varying link correlation observed in real networks makes the problem harder. In this paper, we propose a multi-packet flooding protocol, SYREN, that exploits the synergy among link correlation and network coding. In particular, SYREN exploits link correlation to eliminate the overhead of explicit control packets in networks with high correlation, and uses network coding to pipeline transmission of multiple packets via a novel, single yet scalable timer per node. SYREN reduces the number of redundant transmissions while achieving near-perfect reliability, especially in networks with low link correlation. Test bed experiments and simulations show that SYREN reduces the average number of transmissions by 30% and dissemination delay by more than 60% while achieving the same reliability as state-of-the-art protocols.	elegant degradation;experiment;linear network coding;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;simulation;synergy;testbed;timer;tinyos	S.

The NoC is based on the GigaNoC approach, a scalable NoC featuring packet-switched wormhole routing. At a clock frequency of 750MHz a link bandwidth of up to 6 GByte/s is achieved. To provide a high computational performance, the processing engines (PEs) are based on the CoreVA VLIW architecture. The resource efficiency of mesochronous (TMCS-based) and asynchronous (FIFO-based) communication links is analyzed. In addition an asynchronous coupling of the PE to the switch boxes is evaluated. This allows for multi-voltage/multi-frequency scenarios, where the performance of each PE is adapted to the current performance requirements. Analyses have shown, that TCMS-based communication links and asynchronously coupled PEs allow for the high efficiency of GALS-based NoCs with moderate additional resource requirements.	asynchronous circuit;clock rate;fifo (computing and electronics);gigabyte;globally asynchronous locally synchronous;mesochronous network;network on a chip;network packet;packet switching;requirement;routing;scalability;wormhole switching	Thorsten Jungeblut;Johannes Ax;Mario Porrmann;Ulrich Rückert	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271870	embedded system;synchronization;throughput;parallel computing;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;instruction set;network on a chip;bandwidth	Arch	1.762874157126079	60.94661826052682	11997

For FIFO multiplexed on-chip packet switched networks we consider worst-case delay bounds for Variable Bit-Rate (VBR) flows with aggregate scheduling, which schedules multiple flows as an aggregate flow. VBR Flows are characterized by a maximum transfer size (L), peak rate (p), burstiness (σ), and average sustainable rate (ρ). Based on network calculus, we present and prove theorems to derive per-flow end-to-end Equivalent Service Curves (ESC), which are in turn used for computing Least Upper Delay Bounds (LUDBs) of individual flows. In a realistic case study we find that the end-to-end delay bound is up to 46.9% more accurate than the case without considering the traffic peak behavior. Likewise, results also show similar improvements for synthetic traffic patterns. The proposed methodology is implemented in C++ and has low run-time complexity, enabling quick evaluation for large and complex SoCs.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;c++;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);flow network;multiplexing;network calculus;network packet;packet switching;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);synthetic intelligence;system on a chip;time complexity;volume boot record	Fahimeh Jafari;Zhonghai Lu;Axel Jantsch	2015	ACM Trans.

The framework of CLARM routing protocol incorporates following three things: a new concept of wireless multi-hop network architecture, a new 2.5-layer routing technique with a reputation management scheme, high throughput network performance based on cross-layer approache between MAC (Medium Access Control) and CLARM layers. We compare the performance of the CLARM routing protocol with previous routing algorithms, DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and AODV (Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector), previous reputation management scheme CORE (COllaborative REputation) and CONFIDANT (COoperation Of Nodes Fairness In Dynamic Ad Hoc NeTworks).

c94285048fc837e203818194dae5cf0f5198f8a5	regularized mimo equalization for sc-fdma systems		In this paper, we propose an efficient frequency domain equalization scheme for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Single-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) systems. The proposed scheme avoids the complexity problem associated with the conventional MIMO Zero-Forcing (ZF) equalizer as well as the noise enhancement problem. The matrix inversion process associated with the proposed equalization scheme is performed in two steps to reduce complexity. A regularization term is added in the second step of the matrix inversion to avoid the noise enhancement. Simulation experiments on uplink MIMO SC-FDMA systems show that the proposed equalization scheme provides better performance than that of the ZF equalizer and its complexity is far less than that of the ZF equalizer.	mimo	Faisal S.

The secrecy metric used is the exponent of the probability that the reconstruction of the source sequence by the eavesdropper is within a distortion level. A single-letter characterization is provided when the message rate is large enough. Under the optimal code, the eavesdropper can do no better than either making a reconstruction blindly or guessing the key first and then reconstructing based on the sequence reconstructed by the legitimate receiver.	cipher;distortion;shannon (unit)	Lanqing Yu;Paul W.

These three characteristics may give rise to funneling effects that can lead to severe packet collision, network congestion, packet loss and even congestion collapse. This can also result in hotspots of energy consumption that may cause premature death of sensor nodes and even premature death of entire network. In this paper, exploiting spatial correlation of nodes to form clusters of nodes sensing similar values, and only cluster head sensor reading is transmit to sink, such can efficiently alleviates the funneling effects. A novelty clustering algorithm is proposed which can greatly reduce the number of cluster heads.

Initiating D2D communication device discovery is a vital research problem due to energy consumption, the need for fast discovery in dense areas and discovery in poor coverage areas. Many approaches are suggested for device discovery like Bio-inspired and Firefly proximity base discovery. Ellipsoid device discovery model is proposed for multi users and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network, in which radio resources are divided into time slots and frequency divisions. In large device density areas, devices establish a local area network that can be a centralised or a distributed local area network. In this proposed model, devices which are located in poor coverage area can be discovered easily. An iterative algorithm with linear pre-processing is applied to find the position of devices that gives the ellipsoid solution of the device position. The probability of false alarm and probability of misdetection verify the proposed solution. Results show an enhancement in the system capacity, rate of detection and maximum distance discovery in comparison with the firefly proximity algorithm.

The colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, which increases the overall achievable rate, from transmitter to destination. The transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivers have access to perfect channel state information (CSI). We propose, for this setting, a multilayer broadcast transmission approach. The broadcast approach enables enhanced cooperation between the colocated users. That is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the better the channel quality, the more layers that can reliably be decoded. The cooperation between the users is performed over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, with a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. Three commonly used cooperation techniques are studied: amplify-and-forward (AF), compress-and-forward (CF), and decode-and-forward (DF). These techniques are extended by using the broadcast approach for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. For this case, a separate processing of the layers, which includes multisession cooperation is shown to be beneficial. Further, closed-form expressions for infinitely many AF sessions and recursive expressions for the more complex CF are given. Numerical results for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate how the multisession cooperation outperforms conventional relaying techniques.	additive white gaussian noise;anisotropic filtering;channel state information;code;coefficient;colocation centre;direction finding;optical disc authoring;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;recursion;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Avi Steiner;Amichai Sanderovich;Shlomo Shamai	2007	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.904833	wireless ad hoc network;additive white gaussian noise;telecommunications;information theory;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	36.67408164455025	76.41141776007079	12133

However, MUI-free transmission is guaranteed only when the data length D, channel delay L, and ZCZ length Z satisfy Z + 1 ≥ D + L, and the user population is constraint to be K ≤ N Z+1 , where N is the code length. In this paper, for the purpose of allowing higher bandwidth efficiency for more active users, we propose an iterative partial multiuser detector for CS-CDMA/CP with M-ZCZ code to allow Z + 1 < D + L. Because the detector is implemented in the symbol-level (after despreading) and only a partion of users are jointly considered, its receiver complexity is expected to be acceptable for a mobile terminal. Comparison with the DS-CDMA system employing chip-equalization receiver shows that the CS-CDMA/CP system employing the proposed receiver offers a better tradeoff between the performance and receiver complexity, which indicates its potential application in future wireless communications.	cp system;code;interference (communication);iterative method;mud;magic user interface;mobile phone;multi-user;multipath propagation;spectral efficiency;symbol level;telecommunications link	Li Yue;Nalin S.

Current routing protocols that provide quality of service (QoS) for MANETs have proposed routing based on a single QoS metric. This paper proposes a QoS aware source initiated ad-hoc routing protocol (QuaSAR) that adds quality control to all the phases of an on-demand routing protocol. QuaSAR gathers information about battery power, signal strength, bandwidth and latency during route discovery and uses in route choosing. Additionally, our approach has proactive route maintenance features in addition to the reactive maintenance.

Interestingly, some of these expressions generalise some of the recent results on series representation of the Marcum Q-function since the Marcum Q-function is a special case of the Nuttall Q-function. To the best of our knowledge, five of these representations are novel and the other one is included for the completeness of the article. The performances of these representations are compared using the magnitude of the truncation error which gives a measure of the accuracy and rate of convergence and allow us to show the strength of each representation. We then discussed the area of applications of our result. We showed that our Nuttall Q-function representations and their corresponding special case (Marcum Q-function) (though not limited to only these), can be used in (i) the computation of outage probability of wireless communication system with co-channel interferers, (ii) the evaluation of detection probability of energy detector over generalized fading channels in cognitive radio system, and (iii) the computation of cumulative distribution of selection diversity combining in correlated Nakagami-m fading channel. In all these areas of application, our solution has no restriction on any parameter of interest.	cognitive radio;computable function;computation;performance;rate of convergence;sun outage;truncation error	Oluwatobi Olabiyi;Annamalai Annamalai	2012	2012 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2012.6181164	telecommunications;computer science;fading;statistics	Robotics	39.882998701925274	77.55819210288405	12161
2bb3abd0154cc1489ff799085ef8cbcaa67fc2da	online learning for interference coordination in heterogeneous networks		This paper focuses on interference coordination between the small cell and macro cell tiers of a wireless access network. We propose a new perspective based on a modelfree learning strategy, not requiring any previous knowledge about the network (e.g., topology, interference graph, scheduling algorithms). Our approach is based on a stochastic optimization algorithm known as Response Surface Methodology, that we use to learn the optimal parameter configuration during network operation (online learning) adapting to changes on network conditions (e.g., traffic, user positions). The result is a simple, effective and flexible mechanism that outperforms previous proposals. As a case study we apply our scheme to the dynamic adjustment of LTE-A eICIC parameters (CRE bias and ABS ratio).	aim alliance;access network;algorithm;compaq lte;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;response surface methodology;scheduling (computing);semantic network;stochastic optimization	Jose A.

Time correlation is determined by the relative movement of the transmitter and the receiver, while frequency and spatial correlation depend on the environment layout that can be collected and stored for future use. In this paper, we introduce the concept of channel correlation map stored at the base station (BS), which adds both frequency and space direction channel correlation parameters as overlay information to a geographic map. We propose a measurement method of channel correlation maps by processing uplink transmission data and show the influence of available bandwidth on the measurement accuracy. Two application cases with the correlation map are shown through numerical simulation. One is adaptive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation without online tracking correlation parameters, the other is channel prediction for transmit scheduling and beamforming design to reduce the performance degradation due to outdated channel state information (CSI) caused by the feedback delay.	beamforming;channel state information;computer simulation;elegant degradation;mimo;mimo-ofdm;map;mathematical optimization;pixel;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;transmitter	Huijun Li;Gerd Ascheid	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555116	estimation;spatial correlation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;control theory;correlation;precoding;statistics	Mobile	42.13201869599745	83.47996994634019	12214

All relay nodes in wireless relay networks cannot exchange their received signals from source nodes for relay noncooperation. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of an optimal diagonal amplifying relay matrix in AF SIMO wireless relay system using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. To evaluate the effects of two adverse wireless communication environments on the AF SIMO relay scheme, simulation results are presented for a system using the derived optimal diagonal amplifying relay matrix with bit error rate (BER).

In this paper, based on parametric channel modeling, we present a direction of arrival (DoA) estimation method for multi-cell multi-user 3D massive-MIMO/Full Dimension (FD-MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system using estimation of signal parameter via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT). Furthermore, we analytically characterize the performance of ESPRIT-based DoA estimation in multiuser scenario, and investigate how pilot contamination, intra-cell, and inter-cell interference affect DoA estimation performance.	channel state information;direction of arrival;frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;multiplexing;spectral efficiency	Rubayet Shafin;Lingjia Liu;Jonathan D.

Data modulation is carried out by binary phase shift keying and direct sequence spread spectrum signaling. The micro-cellular communication media is modeled as a frequency selective fading channel with multipath propagation. The multipath diversity of the received signals from the K users is exploited by a bank of K RAKE correlators. Algorithms based on the maximum likelihood rule have been developed for estimating the complex channel coefficients as well as for detection of the desired data packets from the sufficient statistics provided by the RAKE correlators. The performance of the resulting multiuser detector is evaluated analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the estimator of the channel coefficients has a variance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and that the proposed multiuser detector is capable of eliminating the near-far effect as well as processing the signals propagated through multiple paths. >	multi-user;multipath propagation	Urs Fawer;Behnaam Aazhang	1995	IEEE Trans.

Thereby, we consequently pursue a cost function based approach that provides the flexibility to incorporate constraints and requirements of particular services or applications. As typical examples of such requirements, we consider the reduction of buffer underflows in case of streaming traffic, and energy efficiency in networks of battery powered nodes. Compared with the classical throughput optimal control problem, such requirements significantly complicate the control problem. We provide easily verifiable theoretical conditions for stability, and, additionally, compare various candidate cost functions applied to wireless networks with streaming media traffic. Moreover, we demonstrate how the framework can be applied to the problem of energy efficient routing, and we demonstrate the application of our framework in cross-layer control problems for wireless multihop networks, using an advanced power control scheme for interference mitigation, based on successive convex approximation. In all scenarios, the performance of our control framework is evaluated using extensive numerical simulations.	approximation;formal verification;interference (communication);loss function;numerical analysis;optimal control;queueing theory;requirement;routing;simulation;streaming media;throughput	Martin Kasparick;Gerhard Wunder	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2017.2659624	mathematical optimization;power control;wireless network;throughput;efficient energy use;wireless;real-time computing;numerical stability;queueing theory;computer science;optimal control	Mobile	16.20008559575209	96.3692094018134	12248

Specifically, 32-state and 64-state 2 2 space–time trellis codes are presented that provide a bit-error rate (BER) of10 on all2 2 matrix channels with an excess mutual information (MI) within 8% of the excess MI required by standard trellis codes of the same complexity operating only in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Not surprisingly, the universal space–time trellis-coded modulations (ST-TCMs) provide average bitand frame-error rates in quasi-static Rayleigh fading (QRF) that are comparable to those achieved by ST-TCMs designed specifically for QRF as well as standard TCMs followed by the Alamouti space–time block code. However, all of these other schemes require more excess MI in the worst case, and some have a significantly wider variation in the required excess MI. The correspondence also compares the universal and quasi-static Rayleigh fading design approaches analytically and bounds the worst case distance of a trellis code on a2 2 channel using the distances of the code on singular and unitary channels. This bound is extended to the more general scenario.	additive white gaussian noise;best, worst and average case;bit error rate;block code;convolutional code;mutual information;offset binary;rayleigh fading;trellis quantization;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Cenk Köse;Richard D.

In this paper we formalize a recently introduced algorithm that recovers failed actor communication links via the existing sensor infrastructure. We prove via refinement that the recovery is terminating in a finite number of steps and is distributed, thus self-performed by the actors. Most importantly, we prove that the recovery can be done at different levels, via different types of links, such as direct actor links or indirect links between the actors, in the latter case reusing the wireless infrastructure of sensors. This leads to identifying coordination classes e.g., for delegating the most security sensitive coordination to the direct actor-actor coordination links, the least real-time constrained coordination to indirect links, and the safety critical coordination to both direct actor links and indirect sensor paths between actors. Our formalization is done using the theorem prover in the RODIN platform.	actor model;automated theorem proving;b-method;backup;deterministic algorithm;network partition;newman's lemma;partition problem;principle of abstraction;real-time clock;refinement (computing);rodin tool;scalability;sensor;verification and validation	Maryam Kamali;Linas Laibinis;Luigia Petre;Kaisa Sere	2010		10.4204/EPTCS.30.4	real-time computing;computer cluster;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;automated theorem proving	Mobile	2.9177430011779237	73.31767784248555	12334

With continuous advancement, the future applications will require not only sink mobility but also high performance. Multipath routing is one of the promising technologies for improving network performance. However, existing multipath routing protocols have not dealt with the sink mobility. As a result, they lead to bad performance in terms of energy efficiency due to the end-to-end path reconstruction. Consequently, a novel path management scheme is required thereby supporting sink mobility without performance degradation. In this paper we propose a multipath management scheme for supporting sink mobility. The proposed scheme dynamically constructs multipath along the moving path of a sink. In addition, the proposed scheme provides the path shortening mechanism according to the sink's movement for reducing energy consumption. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to existing path management schemes in terms of reliability and energy efficiency.	agent-based model;elegant degradation;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);simulation	Cheonyong Kim;Yongbin Yim;Taehun Yang;Sangdae Kim;Sang Ha Kim	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925729	telecommunications;computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.013667312914162	83.58357724447231	12409

This information is used, among others, for cognitive radio solutions and for intelligent channel selection in wireless networks. Solutions such as spectrum analyzers are capable of scanning a wide spectrum range, but are not dedicated for channel occupation assessment because they are extremely costly and not able to perform continuous recording for a time period longer than a few seconds. On the other hand, low-cost solutions lack the flexibility and required performance in terms of configuration and sensing efficiency. To remedy the situation, this paper presents an alternative for channel assessment on top of a commercial software-defined radio platform. Although there exist software solutions for performing spectrum sensing on such platforms, to the best of our knowledge, continuous spectrum sensing and long-term recording remain challenging. We propose a pioneering solution that is capable of seamless spectrum sensing over a wide spectrum band and guarantees sufficient flexibility in terms of configurations. The proposed solution is validated experimentally. We demonstrate two advantages of seamless spectrum sensing: the capability of accurate channel occupancy measurement and detecting transient signals such as Bluetooth.	bluetooth;cognitive radio;commercial software;existential quantification;experiment;interference (communication);parallel computing;seamless3d;sensor;spectrum analyzer	Binh Yen Nguyen;Daan Pareit;Eli De Poorter;Ingrid Moerman	2013	EURASIP J.

We focus on the case where the “no-input” symbol is not redundant, i.e., the output distribution at the warden induced by the no-input symbol is not a mixture of the output distributions induced by other input symbols, so that the covert communication is governed by the square root law, i.e., at most Θ( √ n) bits can be transmitted over n channel uses. We show that for such a setting of covert communication over broadcast channels, a simple time-division strategy achieves the optimal throughputs. Our result implies that a code that uses two separate optimal point-to-point codes each designed for the constituent channels and each used for a fraction of the time is optimal in the sense that it achieves the best constants of the √ n-scaling for the throughputs. Our proof strategy combines several elements in the network information theory literature, including concave envelope representations of the capacity regions of broadcast channels and El Gamal’s outer bound for more capable broadcast channels.	adversary (cryptography);alphabet (formal languages);code;concave function;covert channel;feedback;image scaling;information theory;os-tan;point-to-point protocol;transmitter	Vincent Y.

This research considers networks that provide connection-oriented services, as in ATM and MPLS technologies, for example. A common scheme for Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) in connection-oriented communications is to dynamically segregate bandwidth between different traffic categories. These categories can represent topological Virtual Paths or different Classes-ofService with different Quality-of-Service requirements. Bandwidth segregation can be efficient if and only if demands for different Classesof-Service or different Virtual Paths can be predicted accurately. This led us to develop a novel algorithm that has a much wider vision in allocating resources than classical distributed algorithms. We call the proposed algorithm, Virtual Demand Distribution (VDD) algorithm. This algorithm utilizes signaling packets to broadcast information that enhances the performance of DBA algorithms. Mathematical analysis of multi-class connection-oriented networks and performance analysis/comparisons of the proposed VDD algorithm and a Simple Distributed algorithm are presented. q 2003 Elsevier B.V.

570cbfa71366b0adf5ae0b6b34b55e18c2d49fdc	an efficient and scalable modeling attack on lightweight secure physically unclonable function		The Lightweight Secure Physically Unclonable Function (LSPUF) was proposed as a secure composition of Arbiter PUFs with additional XOR based input and output networks. But later, researchers proposed a Machine Learning (ML) based modeling attack on x-XOR LSPUF, and they also empirically showed that pure ML based modeling is not computationally scalable if the parameter x of x-XOR LSPUF is larger than nine. Besides this pure computational attack using only challenge-response pairs (CRPs), there are other proposals for modeling attacks on LSPUF using timing and power side-channel information, reliability information and photonic side-channel information of an LSPUF instance. In this paper, we proposed another pure computational attack (i.e. without any sidechannel information) on multibit output LSPUF variants using both cryptanalysis and ML techniques together. We, first, cryptanalyse the output network of LSPUF to reduce the computational efforts required by previously proposed pure ML based modeling of an x-XOR LSPUF. Specifically, we model an LSPUF instance, while its output bit is defined as x-XOR PUF, using the ML modeling of y-XOR PUF where y < x. From the computational complexity view point, our proposed modeling attack is efficient and scalable than previously proposed pure ML based modeling of LSPUFs with respect to both data and time complexities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack using the Matlab based simulation of LSPUFs and LSPUFs implemented on Xilinx Artix-7 Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).	arbiter (electronics);challenge–response authentication;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptanalysis;exclusive or;field-programmable gate array;input/output;matlab;machine learning;physical unclonable function;scalability;side-channel attack;simulation	Phuong Ha Nguyen;Durga Prasad Sahoo	2016	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		scalability;computer security;physical unclonable function;computer science	Security	13.666561344488969	64.51140283448886	12445

In this paper, BS density configurations for achieving the optimal EE performance in two-tier cellular networks are analyzed, where the Poisson point process (PPP) is used to model the BS spatial distribution. To make the EE performances trackable and analyzable, the BS density optimization in each tier is transformed into an equivalent problem that jointly optimizes """"the sum and the ratio of BS densities"""". This equivalent optimization problem is not necessarily convex, while its monotonicity with different power consumptions of BSs is analyzable. Considering the optimal BS density configuration is not unique and the closed-form solution for achieving the best EE performance is extremely difficult to be derived, a dynamic gradient based iterative algorithm by solving the quadratic functions is proposed. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of EE performances based on the data fitting method shows that the approximately linear relationship between the optimal BS density and the user density holds only under specific conditions.

In this article, we introduce a novel model that addresses the cellular system design problem in a complete fashion. We propose a linear mixed-integer programming model that gathers together into the same model the base station location problem, the frequency channel assignment problem and the base station connection to the fixed network. The purpose of unifying these three problems in the same model is to treat the trade-offs among them providing a higher quality solution to the cellular system design. We still present some computational analyses in order to evaluate the model tradeoffs and its time complexity. In conclusion, we mention our current work towards an effective technique to solve the proposed model.	assignment problem;boost;channel (communications);computation;formal concept analysis;integer programming;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;norsk data;programming model;systems design;telecommunications network;time complexity;unified model	Filipe F.

In the proposed algorithm, a redundancy coding matrix is used as an analog version of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that is commonly used for data verification in digital communication. Using this analog CRC enables an alternate decoding scheme in which iterative decoding is possible without transferring new errors between consecutive iterations. In each iteration of the algorithm, the problem of decoding the long block code is decoupled into two sets of parallel small linear programming problems. Simulation results show that this leads to a reduction in decoding complexity as compared to one-step linear programming decoding.	algorithm;block code;code word;converge;cyclic redundancy check;error detection and correction;forward error correction;iteration;lp-type problem;linear programming decoding;simulation;universal product code	Avi Zanko;Amir Leshem;Ephraim Zehavi	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037283	block code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;sequential decoding;computer science;noise;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;linear code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;algorithm;encoding	EDA	42.98664258557773	61.75798592044063	12507

Mobile phones are widely used in our daily lives. Therefore, the PSN composed of human-carried mobile phones will soon become an ubiquitous network environment. In this paper, we propose a communication strategy that applies the WiFi hotspot mode of a mobile phone in the PSN to realize the device-to-device communications. However, due to the lack of energy supply, a phone in hotspot mode could rapidly consume energy and shorten its battery lifetime significantly. To maximize the message dissemination scope within the limited energy constraint of each phone in PSNs, an Energy-efficient Phone-to-phone Communication method based on WiFi Hotspot (EPCWH) is presented to schedule the phone's switching between hotspot mode and client mode. Simulations based on the synthetic random-waypoint mobility pattern and real traces are conducted in an opportunistic network environment; the results show that EPCWH achieves the best performance in terms of message dissemination and energy consumption among different switching strategies.	computer simulation;higher-order function;hotspot (wi-fi);java hotspot virtual machine;mathematical optimization;mobile device;mobile phone;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;scheduling (computing);synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);ubiquitous computing;waypoint;xfig	En Wang;Yongjian Yang;Jie Wu;Wenbin Liu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2514098	embedded system;communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;gsm services;schedule;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	18.63799379033678	90.60013981541651	12517

We utilize the doubly-regular property of the channel to obtain a closed form approximation using the Marčenko Pasture law. We demonstrate the accuracy of our expression by comparing it with Monte-Carlo simulation and the EE-SE trade-off expression based on low-power approximation. Results show the great tightness of our expression with Monte-Carlo simulation.We utilize our closed form expression for assessing the EE performance of cooperation for both theoretical and realistic power models. The theoretical power model includes only the transmit power, whereas the realistic power model incorporates the backhaul and signal processing power in addition to the transmit power. Results indicate that for both power models, increasing the number of antennas leads to an improvement in EE performance, whereas, increasing the number of cooperating BSs results in a loss in EE when considering the realistic power model.	approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);low-power broadcasting;mobile phone;monte carlo method;signal processing;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Oluwakayode Onireti;Fabien Heliot;Muhammad Ali Imran	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6139952	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;signal processing;statistics;monte carlo method	Arch	30.674529737134986	84.87744463851132	12556

CR operates on the channel/band level to exploit white space across spectrum dimension while MIMO operates within the same channel to improve spectral efficiency within the same band. In this paper, we explore MIMO-empowered CR network, which we call CRNMIMO, to achieve the ultimate flexibility and efficiency in dynamic spectrum access and spectrum utilization. Given that CR and MIMO handle interference at different levels (across channels vs. within a channel), we are interested in how to jointly optimize both so as to maximize user throughput in a multihop network. To answer this question, we develop a tractable mathematical model for CRNMIMO, which captures the essence of channel assignment (for CR) and degree-of-freedom (DoF) allocation (for MIMO) within a channel. Based on this mathematical model, we use numerical results to show how channel assignment in CRN and DoF allocation in MIMO can be jointly optimized to maximize throughput. More important, for a CRNMIMO with AMIMO antennas at each node, we show that joint optimization of CR and MIMO offers more than AMIMO-fold throughput increase than a CRN (without MIMO).	cobham's thesis;cognitive radio;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;spectral efficiency;throughput	Cunhao Gao;Yi Shi;Yiwei Thomas Hou;Sastry Kompella	2011	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2011.80	3g mimo;cognitive radio;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;spatial multiplexing;computer network;mimo	Networks	32.32241471875657	88.6356262708571	12570

Initially, we focus on the capacity issues in wireless sensor networks and identify the limiting factors on the capacity improvements. Then, we provide a brief survey on multi-channel communication in wireless ad hoc networks, which share similar characteristics with wireless sensor networks, and next focus on the multi-channel communication in wireless sensor networks. According to this survey, we observe that many of the protocols do not properly address the challenges of multi-channel communication, such as the channel overlaps.

We investigate whether spectral analysis is a useful analytical tool for this purpose by building a mathematically sound theory of the vulnerability phenomenon. This research was originally motivated by the need for deeper, more formal knowledge around vulnerable nonlinear circuits. However, while building this new theoretical framework, we discovered that it can consistently integrate known results about linear ones as well. Eventually, we found it adequate to formally model side-channel leakage in several significant scenarios. In particular, we have been able to find the vulnerability perimeter of a known cryptographic primitive (i.e., Keccak [1] ) and thus tackle the analysis of vulnerability when signal glitches are present. We believe the conceptual framework we propose will be useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of applied cryptography and side-channel attacks.	countermeasure (computer);cryptographic primitive;cryptography;glitch;nonlinear system;perimeter;sha-3;side-channel attack;spectral density estimation;spectral leakage	Vittorio Zaccaria;Filippo Melzani;Georges Bertoni	2018	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2017.2772231	cryptographic primitive;theoretical computer science;real-time computing;computer science;cryptography;side channel attack;glitch;the conceptual framework;phenomenon;countermeasure;vulnerability	Security	12.65904142140466	64.74719653312094	12621

Nonetheless, this requirement can rarely be satisfied in most indoor environments. In this paper, we target one but common situation when the collected measurements on received signal strength information are insufficient, and show limitations of existing location fingerprinting methods in dealing with inadequate location fingerprints. We also introduce a novel method to reduce noise in measuring the received signal strength based on the maximum likelihood estimation, and compute locations from inadequate location fingerprints by using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Our experiment results show that our proposed method can achieve better localization performance even when only a small quantity of RSSmeasurements is available. Especially when the number of observations at each location is small, our proposed method has evident superiority in localization accuracy.	fingerprint (computing);geographic coordinate system;internationalization and localization;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;location-based service;noise reduction;rss;stochastic gradient descent	Kai Dong;Zhen Ling;Xiangyu Xia;Haibo Ye;Wenjia Wu;Ming Yang	2017	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2017/1268515	distributed computing;signal strength;computer science;software deployment;data mining;maximum likelihood;artificial intelligence;stochastic gradient descent;internet of things;pattern recognition	HCI	19.077570740664367	73.56462785980794	12626

Since both the total user throughput and cell-edge user throughput are important in a real system, we compare the cell-edge user throughput, while subject to the same total user throughput. The optimum resource allocation such as bandwidth and transmission power for each user is assumed for the respective access schemes based on the instantaneous channel conditions. Based on the evaluation results, we show that non-orthogonal access with a SIC can significantly enhance the cell-edge user throughput (thus user fairness) compared to the orthogonal access while achieving the same total user throughput in the context of the cellular uplink, which can yield some insights regarding the direction of the wireless access scheme for the systems beyond IMT-Advanced.	bandwidth (signal processing);fairness measure;interactive machine translation;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);simplified instructional computer;telecommunications link;throughput;transceiver	Tomohiro Takeda;Kenichi Higuchi	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093272	throughput;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;interference;bandwidth;wireless;computer network	Mobile	29.361388810588327	89.60086180189532	12630

However, although gossip-based aggregation algorithms scale well for graphs with good expansion, their efficiency for sparse graphs is unexamined. In this paper we analyze the feasibility and efficiency of a gossip aggregation protocol in wireless networks with low expansion. We propose a modification of the existing aggregation algorithm for use in locality-aware, sparse, static wireless networks. Our protocol terminates autonomously, uses less bandwidth than the original version, and removes the need for the leader election process while counting network nodes. Aggregates are calculated only over nodes placed in the vicinity, and nodes communicate only with their immediate neighbors by using a wireless broadcast. We evaluate our approach by simulation on sparse, irregular graphs with low expansion for the simplified system model. Furthermore, we analytically assess the worst-case convergence time of this protocol for sparse wireless networks and also for the simplified system model.	aggregate data;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);best, worst and average case;channel (communications);data aggregation;distributed computing;fault tolerance;global network;gossip protocol;leader election;lightweight portable security;locality of reference;node (computer science);self-organization;simulation;sparse matrix;volatile memory	Joanna Geibig;Dirk Bradler	2010	2010 IFIP Wireless Days	10.1109/WD.2010.5657705	gossip protocol;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.8612630542641035	78.34604186458306	12644

The motivation is to optimize channel usage by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after demodulation while keeping training overhead at a moderate level. This issue is important for single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems but particularly so for the latter. Linear operators offer a general mathematical framework for symbol modulation in channels that vary both temporally and spectrally within the duration and bandwidth of one symbol. In particular, we present a channel model that assumes first-order temporal and spectral fluctuations within one symbol or symbol block. Discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (Slepian sequences) are used as pulse-shaping functions. The channel operator in the Slepian basis is almost tridiagonal, and the simple intersymbol interference pattern can be exploited for efficient and fast decoding using Viterbi's algorithm. To prove the concept, we use the acoustic channel as a meaningful physical analogy to the radio channel. In acoustic 2 /spl times/ 2 MIMO experiments, our method produced estimation results that are superior to first-order time-only, frequency-only, and zeroth-order models by 7.0, 9.4, and 11.6 db. In computer simulations of cellular wireless channels with realistic temporal and spectral fluctuations, time-frequency estimation gains us 12 to 18 db over constant-only estimation in terms of received SNR when signal-to-receiver-noise is 10 to 20 db. The bit error rate (BER) decreases by a factor of two for a binary constellation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bit error rate;channel (communications);computation;computer simulation;experiment;first-order predicate;formal system;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;noise shaping;overhead (computing);pulse shaping;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;slepian–wolf coding;soft-in soft-out decoder;spectral density estimation;temporal logic;viterbi algorithm;x.690	Karin Sigloch;Michael R.

Compressive sensing has been proven effective to elevate some of these problems through efficient sampling and exploiting the underlying sparse structure of the measured frequency spectrum. In this paper, we propose an approach for collaborative compressive spectrum sensing. The proposed approach achieves improved sensing performance through utilizing Kronecker sparsifying bases to exploit the two dimensional sparse structure in the measured spectrum at different, spatially separated cognitive radios. Experimental analysis through simulation shows that the proposed scheme can substantially reduce the mean square error (MSE) of the recovered power spectrum density over conventional schemes while maintaining the use of a low-rate ADC. We also show that we can achieve dramatically lower MSE under low compression ratios using a dense measurement matrix but using Nyquist rate ADC.	cognitive radio;compressed sensing;mean squared error;nyquist rate;overhead (computing);sampling (signal processing);simulation;sparse matrix;spectral density;spectrogram	Ahmed M.

The scheduling sch eme is investigated both by analysis and simulations carried ou t in the context of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) broadcast channels (BC). First the delay optimality is obtained for a static scenario providing solutions for specific subpr oblems, then the analysis is carried over to the dynamic scheme . Furthermore auxiliary tools are given for proving throughp ut optimality. Finally simulations show the superior performance of the presented scheme. I. I NTRODUCTION The allocation of limited resources among users is a fundamental problem in the design of next generation wireless systems. In general, resource allocation problems can be formulated as some kind of optimization problem where the objective is to maximize/minimize some system performance measure under physical layer as well as Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. One of the most important performance measures of a communication systems is the otal system throughputand therefore it is often considered as the objective of the optimization problem. In a queueing system with random packet arrival, the throughput can be considered as t he maximal possible offered load without violating the stabil ity of queues. A scheduling policy is called throughput-optimal , if it can keep the queues stable whenever any other feasible scheduling scheme can stabilize the queues. It was shown that there exist several queue-length-based scheduling sc hemes which achieve throughput optimality [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, since the stability of a queueing system only guarantees that the queue lengths do not grow without bounds , but by no means indicate how long the queue length will be, the next step in the performance optimization is to keep the queue lengths as short as possible so that the queueing delay is minimized. It was shown in [5], [6] that the Longest-Queue Highest-Possible-Rate (LQHPR) policy which maximizes the queue-weighted sum of rates is throughput-optimal and is strongly delay-optimal for the multiple-access channel. T he necessary condition for its delay optimality is the symmetr y both in the fading channels and in the packet arrival rates. However, for the BC the LQHPR is not delay-optimal even with symmetry assumptions. Seong et al. introduced in [4] another throughput-optimal scheduling called Queue Propo rtional Scheduling (QPS) which provides superior delay and fairness properties for the BC compared to LQHPR. Generally, the aforementioned policies are based on the same class of optimization problems: Maximizing the sum of rates weighted with different parameters, i.e. queue lengt h, delay, etc. The solution of the optimization problem always corresponds to some boundary point of the channel capacity region. Since the capacity region of OFDM BC is completely achieved with Costa Precoding and the optimal power allocation and precoding order for the weighted sum rate maximization problem can be efficiently solved [7], all resu lt can also be easily extended to OFDM BC systems. In this paper, we analyze characteristics of all throughput optimal scheduling policies and show that they can be formulated as weighted sum rate maximization problems differing only in the choice of the weight factors. Further, the weight factors are independent of the current channel states, henc e cross-layer optimization problems, which usually involve th optimization over system parameters in medium access contr ol (MAC) layer and physical layer, can be clearly separated int o two steps: 1. Finding the optimal weight factors according to the MAC layer parameters. 2. Solving the weighted sum rate maximization problem. Then we introduce an iterative algorithm to calculate the weight factors that are optimal w ith respect to the average delay in OFDM BC channels. Here the average delay is defined as the average waiting time of each bit in the queues. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system model. The throughput optimality is discussed in Section III. In Section IV we introduce our dela yoptimal scheduling policy and evaluate results in Section V . Finally, we conclude in Section VI. II.

Further, the proposed algorithm is modified to meet the requirements of time-critical data.

In such a network, the wireless nodes can be modeled as agents that can acquire local information from their neighbors and, based on this available information, can make timely transmission decisions to minimize the end-to-end delays of the mission-critical applications. Importantly, the MCN needs to cope in practice with the time-varying network dynamics. Hence, the agents need to make transmission decisions by considering not only the current network status, but also how the network status evolves over time, and how this is influenced by the actions taken by the nodes. We formulate the agents' autonomic decision making problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and construct a distributed MDP framework, which takes into consideration the informationally-decentralized nature of the multi-hop MCN. We further propose an online model-based reinforcement learning approach for agents to solve the distributed MDP at runtime, by modeling the network dynamics using priority queuing. We compare the proposed model-based reinforcement learning approach with other model-free reinforcement learning approaches in the MCN. The results show that the proposed model-based reinforcement learning approach for mission-critical applications not only outperforms myopic approaches without learning capability, but also outperforms conventional model-free reinforcement learning approaches.	autonomic computing;autonomic networking;converge;exptime;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;markov chain;markov decision process;mission critical;priority queue;queueing theory;rate of convergence;reinforcement learning;relay;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;social inequality;time-varying network;transmitter	Hsien-Po Shiang;Mihaela van der Schaar	2010	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2010.100610	markov decision process;simulation;computer science;wireless network;network dynamics;machine learning;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;markov process;queueing theory;reinforcement learning;computer network	ML	19.62759104102355	94.70991574197403	12706

Thus the process of vignetting can affect the performance of MIMO optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. The effect of the vignetting on a pixelated system is measured by using spatial OFDM. It is clear that vignetting can leads to the attenuation and ICI in the spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. SACO-OFDM (spatial asymmetrical clipped optical) and SDCO-OFDM (spatial DC-biased clipped optical) are previous techniques which are used to reduce the impact of vignetting on signals. This paper investigates the result of vignetting on pixelated MIMO systems with OFDM. In this work, we reduce the effect of vignetting by reducing BER of channel using MATLAB simulator. After simulation it is proved that the proposed technique shows better accuracy than previous techniques.	frequency divider;ici (programming language);matlab;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;optical wireless;simulation;south african computer olympiad;x.690	Pallavi Nag;Amit Gupta	2016	2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732231	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;mathematics;optics;vignetting;statistics;mimo	EDA	45.57935088105875	82.9481036724764	12734

A great challenge in VANETs, espe- cially in an urban setting, is the routing scheme used and the subsequent performance obtained. This work presents an experimental performance evaluation of routing mechanisms in VANETs, using simulation, within an urban Manhattan grid like environment. It also describes and evalu- ates an enhancement of the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol that takes into account the motion of the vehicles and the nature of the urban environment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed enhancement to the GPSR protocol manages to significantly increase the delivery ratio without increasing the power consumption; nevertheless, in some cases the improvement on delivery ratio is achieved at the expense of slightly increased end-to-end delay.	performance evaluation;routing	Christos Bouras;Vaggelis Kapoulas;Enea Tsanai	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24024-4_9	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;geography;telecommunications;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer security;computer network	HCI	3.5160385010898847	85.03083472874903	12778

Interestingly, synchrony has often been observed in networks of biological agents (e.g., synchronously flashing fireflies, or spiking of neurons). In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired network synchronization protocol for large scale sensor networks that emulates the simple strategies adopted by the biological agents. The strategy synchronizes pulsing devices that are led to emit their pulses periodically and simultaneously. The convergence to synchrony of our strategy follows from the theory of Mirollo and Strogatz, 1990, while the scalability is evident from the many examples existing in the natural world. When the nodes are within a single broadcast range, our key observation is that the dependence of the synchronization time on the number of nodes N is subject to a phase transition: for values of N beyond a specific threshold, the synchronization is nearly immediate; while for smaller N, the synchronization time decreases smoothly with respect to N. Interestingly, a tradeoff is observed between the total energy consumption and the time necessary to reach synchrony. We obtain an optimum operating point at the local minimum of the energy consumption curve that is associated to the phase transition phenomenon mentioned before. The proposed synchronization protocol is directly applied to the cooperative reach-back communications problem. The main advantages of the proposed method are its scalability and low complexity.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;authorization;bios;british informatics olympiad;broadcast domain;broadcast range;emulator;firmware;ieee xplore;lock (computer science);markov chain;maxima and minima;operating point;scalability;smoothing;social inequality;synchronization (computer science);synthetic environment for analysis and simulations	Yao-Win Peter Hong;Anna Scaglione	2005	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2005.845418	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;synchronization networks;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	12.659582580658842	72.20348554591543	12782

The superframe structure with a inactive period has the following two primary characterizations: (i) deferment of packet transmission until the following active period due to insufficient backoff slots for completing the packet transmission, (ii) high competition in the head part of the active period due to packets which were deferred from the previous active period and were arrived during the previous inactive period. These characterizations complicate the construction of a mathematical model of MAC with the superframe structure including a inactive period. In this paper, we construct a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model which takes into account these characterizations. By analyzing the DTMC, we obtain the main performance measures such as throughput, packet delay distribution, packet loss probability and energy consumptions of devices and the PAN coordinator. We demonstrate high accuracy of the proposed model by comparing the numerical results with simulation results. Finally, we optimize the lengths of the beacon interval and the active period to maximize the battery life of devices while satisfying quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on packet delay and packet loss probability. keywords: IEEE 802.15.4; Medium access control (MAC) protocol; CSMA/CA; Markov chain; Performance analysis	access control;backoff;markov chain;mathematical model;network packet;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;simulation;throughput	Tae Ok Kim;Sangkyu Baek;Bong Dae Choi	2016	Perform.

b85c5ce6a9365ac375b4ff8c9132fe5e71817fcf	distributed data mining in sensor networks		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of a collection of low cost and low powered sensor devices capable of communicating with each other via an ad-hoc wireless network. Due to their rapid proliferation, sensor networks are currently used in a plethora of applications such as earth sciences, systems health, military applications etc. These sensors collect the data about the environment and this data can be mined for a variety of analysis. Unfortunately, post analysis of the data extracted from the WSN incurs high sensor communication cost for sending the raw data to the base station and at the same time runs the risk of delayed analysis. To overcome this, researchers have proposed several distributed algorithms which can deal with the data in situ – these data mining algorithms utilize the computing power at each node to first do some local computations and then exchange messages with its neighbors to come to a consensus regarding a global model. These algorithms reduce the communication cost vastly and also are extremely efficient in terms of model computation and event detection. In this chapter we focus on such distributed data mining algorithms for data clustering, classification and outlier detection tasks.	anomaly detection;blue (queue management algorithm);cluster analysis;computation;data mining;distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);mined;realms;sensor;statistical classification;systems medicine;viz: the computer game	Kanishka Bhaduri;Marco Stolpe	2013		10.1007/978-1-4614-6309-2_8	key distribution in wireless sensor networks	DB	10.543299815047687	73.85846427265857	12787

In the DVC architectures based on Error Control Codes (ECCs) with a feedback channel, the high decoding complexity comes from the decode-check-request iterations between the ECC encoder and the ECC decoder. In this paper, a parallel message-passing decoding algorithm for computing low density parity check (LDPC) syndromes is applied through the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based on General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU). Furthermore, we proposed a novel rate control mechanism, dubbed as the Ladder Step Size Request (LSSR), to reduce the number of requests which leads to much speedup gain. Experimental results show that, through our work, the overall DVC decoding speedup gain can reach 46.52 with only 0.2dB rate distortion performance loss.	cuda;data compression;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;parallel computing	Yu-Shan Pai;Yun-Chung Shen;Ja-Ling Wu	2012	J.

By employing the Rayleigh-Ritz quotient result, we formulate an optimal receiver design and then determine the ORC by solving tfshe derived standard eigenvalue problem. The ORCs are derived as closed forms according to the presence or absence of interference beam information at each CU. When the interference beam information is available, the maximum SINR is given as the largest eigenvalue of the received SINR. In the absence of interference beam information, the ORC based on prediction is proposed based on the prediction of the worst IPI and MUI directions and asymptotically analyzed in terms of the number of transmit antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that the ORC maximizes the sum rate of the cognitive multiuser multiple-input/multiple-output system compared with the reference receive combiners.	diplexer;interference (communication);mimo;magic user interface;multi-user;power dividers and directional couplers;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;tip (unix utility)	Hyukmin Son;Seonghyun Kim	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2366951	input/output;electronic engineering;telecommunications;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;computer science;control theory;mathematics;interference;co-channel interference;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	38.283935381612345	83.96619191432745	12815

We employ the distributed coordination function (DCF) of the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard for our simulation experiments. The performance metrics considered are throughput and medium access control (MAC) delay. We specifically investigate the level of differentiation achievable between high power and low power hosts given various ratios of high power to low power hosts. Our results show that differentiation is more distinct when the ratio of high power to low power hosts is small. It was also determined that in a cell with a fixed number of hosts capable of switching between the two power levels, there exists a threshold beyond which the MAC delay for the low power hosts actually decreases with increasing number of high power hosts.	access control;capture effect;design rule for camera file system;differentiated service;experiment;simulation;throughput	Alfandika Nyandoro;Mahbub Hassan	2004	IEEE 60th Vehicular Technology Conference, 2004.

While powerful and relatively inexpensive, they are subject to behavioural faults which make them unreliable. Due to the complex interactions between network nodes, it is difficult to uncover faults in a WSN by resorting to formal techniques for verification and analysis, or to testing. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to detect anomalous behaviour related to energy consumption in WSN routing protocols. Given a collection protocol, the framework creates candidate topologies and evaluates them through simulation on the basis of metrics measuring the radio activity on nodes. Experimental results using the standard Collection Tree Protocol show that the proposed approach is able to unveil topologies plagued by excessive energy depletion over one or more nodes, and thus could be used as an offline debugging tool to understand and correct the issues before network deployment and during the development of new protocols.	debugger;debugging;depletion region;eventual consistency;fitness function;formal methods;interaction;list of code lyoko episodes;network packet;online and offline;routing;simulation;software deployment	Doina Bucur;Giovanni Iacca;Giovanni Squillero;Alberto Paolo Tonda	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-37192-9_1	wireless routing protocol;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;engineering;interior gateway protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	6.363606191365474	75.41792820974806	12885

Further, it can be extended to space-time block coding (STBC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM systems for the PAPR reduction. In the conventional clipping schemes for STBC MIMO-OFDM systems, the input symbols are first encoded and then clipped. In this paper, a new scheme is proposed, where the clipping operation is performed before space-time block coding. We theoretically prove that the proposed scheme has better bit-error rate (BER) performance while maintaining the same PAPR reduction as the conventional schemes. Additionally, we derive the symbol-error rate (SER) and BER expressions for the new scheme over multipath fading channels. The simulation results show a good match with our analysis.	mimo;mimo-ofdm;power architecture platform reference;x.690	Xiaodong Zhu	2012	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-011-0259-x	space–time block code;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;clipping	Mobile	45.18636445880611	79.7143349921947	12897

T his paper proposes a Cross-layer design based Multipath Routing Protocol (CMRP) for mobile ad hoc networks , by means of the node energy signal from the physica l layer. The purpose is to optimize routing decisio n and path quality. The nodes’ mobility behavior is predi cted using a notion of “Signal Fading Degree, SFD”. Especially, in combination of the IEEE 802.11e stan dard at the MAC layer, we determine that the IEEE 802.11e makes a significant contribution to perform ance improvement of CMRP. Performance evaluation of AODV in legacy 802.11 and CMRP in IEEE 802.11e show s that, as a function of speed of node mobility, a tremendous reduction achieved, in metrics such as t he average end-to-end delay, route overhead, route discovery frequency, normalized routing load – almost more than 80%, 40%, 40%, and 40%.

They consist of body-worn or implanted sensors that wirelessly communicate, leading either to inor on-body communications between sensors, or to off-body communications with devices located in the close vicinity. BAN’s potential applications include, among others, m-health information systems collecting vital parameters in real-time, high-speed connections over the body surface for multimedia transfers or human body interactions with its environment for augmented reality devices. Several technologies are currently under development in order to enable these communications, either narrowband (including RFID technologies), or ultra-wideband (IR-UWB). The latter could be advantageously coupled with positioning algorithms for simultaneous body motion capture. However, in practice, numerous challenges still need to be tackled in order to make BANs viable. The sensor’s autonomy, size, and cost are critical parameters which can only be optimized by adopting an interdisciplinary approach, where the propagation phenomena, the coding or relaying strategies, the MAC protocols, and the network topology are strongly interrelated. The coexistence issue with other networks also seems to be crucial, especially in the hospital environment. This special issue goes through all the layers of telecommunication systems dedicated to body communications, from channel models for onor off-body communications, to global telecare systems based on Bluetooth, smartphones, and GPS. The article “Experimental characterization of an UWB channel for body area networks” by P. Chiang et al. presents UWB channel measurement campaigns, for both onand off-body communications. The measured path loss and multipath analysis suggest that a LOS UWB channel is excellent for low-power, high-data-rate transmission, while NLOS and on-body channels need to be reconfigured to operate at a lower data rate due to high path loss. The article “An analytical modeling of polarized timevariant on-body propagation channels with dynamic body scattering” by L. Liu et al. presents an analytical model of the on-body scattering and propagation on the trunk of a walking person. The results act as an example of how analytical models can provide efficient yet precise predictions of time-variant, on-body propagation to understand the mechanisms underlying the propagation characteristics. The article “In-body Path Loss Models for Implants in Heterogeneous Human Tissues using Implantable Slot Dipole Conformal Flexible Antennas” by F. Axisa et al. discusses the path loss of implant communication channel for a 6-year male child with slot dipole conformal antennas at 2.45 GHz via 3D electromagnetic simulations. The article proves that exponential attenuation model is well applicable to the heterogeneous model as well, but homogeneous phantom may underestimate the pathloss compared with more realistic heterogeneous phantom. The article “Secure Precise Clock Synchronization for Interconnected Body Area Networks” by D. Sanchez et al. tackles secure time synchronization in BANs. A combination of secure pairwise synchronization, rate adaptive time synchronization, and μTESLA is used to achieve energy efficient, accurate, and secure synchronization between BAN nodes. In “Emergency Handling for MAC protocol in Human Body Communication (HBC-MAC)” by O. Buyanjargal et al., a specific emergency handling operation is proposed for BAN’s MAC protocol in order to meet the emergency requirements for BAN without wasteful dedicated slots for emergency in each superframe. The article “Impact of the Environment and the Topology on the Performance of Hierarchical Body Area Networks” by J.-M.

Routing mechanisms in MANETs are considered as a major research challenge due to the nature of the network topology, where the nodes are able to move in any direction in the network showing unpredictable behavior. Nodes failures and absence of centralized coordinators are also important challenges in such network configurations. In addition, the routing protocols that are usually exploited in MANETs are characterized as proactive (Table-driven) and reactive (On-demand). In this context, this paper elaborates on a preliminary comparison study among different reactive protocols, such as the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). This comparison was conducted towards investigating the optimum exploitation of such routing protocols in MANETs, in terms of their performance against the number of the nodes in the network.	ansi escape code;centralized computing;cognitive radio;hoc (programming language);network topology;profiling (computer programming);self-organization;simulation;source routing;throughput	Michalis Papadopoulos;Constandinos X.

The distortion filter is modeled as a linear function of the frequency with unknown slope. We present a novel slope estimator, analytically derived by exploiting the spectral properties of the distorted signal, which results to be unbiased and does not exhibit false locks in the scenarios of practical interest. Since an ideal slope compensator would require an unmanageable filtering, we focus on a low-complexity compensation filter that ensures nearly the same performance. Extensive simulation results prove the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed solution, which can also work blindly at very low values of the signal-to-noise ratio.	algorithm;communications satellite;distortion;flux limiter;general-purpose modeling;linear function;lock (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Dario Fertonani;Alan Barbieri;Giulio Colavolpe;Daniel Delaruelle	2008	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2008.2000466	filter;electronic engineering;amplitude distortion;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;frequency;signal processing;control theory;estimation theory;signal-to-noise ratio;communications satellite;robustness;broadband networks	Vision	51.97760823151435	72.51256147957871	12961
f36f46233d28a5e653b93ec36270c4e026ae492b	scma uplink decoding with codebook collision		Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a non-orthogonal multiplexing technique proposed to the 5G mobile communication system, which can improve the system performance in massive connectivity scenarios. However, during the random access phase of the SCMA system, the codebook used by a user is unknown to the base station. It is very likely some of the users will choose the same codebook in the same time-frequency resource. Therefore all the data in this resource block will be corrupted and can not be recovered. This paper proposes a new method to deal with collision situation by dividing the decoding process into two parts. First, we use a short pilot to detect the codebook used by each user in an SCMA system. Then, with the knowledge of codebook usage, the decoding of actual user data can be simplified. Using the proposed method, codebook collision can be detected. Although the conflicted users can't be decoded by the receiver, other users using the same resource block can still be recovered with relatively low performance penalty. The random access protocol we propose here is called SCMA-Aloha. Its peak throughput can be 20 percent higher than traditional slotted-Aloha.	algorithm;code;codebook;multiplexing;neural coding;random access;sparse;telecommunications link;throughput	Yanjun Yang;Yuping Zhao;Dou Li	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287923	collision;computer science;throughput;computer network;multiuser detection;telecommunications link;real-time computing;codebook;decoding methods;random access;multiplexing	Mobile	43.98890017224996	82.6587430565372	12963

We integrated a new proof-of-concept physical layer into existing software defined radio (SDR) hardware and with the existing upper open systems interconnection (OSI) layers of SRW, and then demonstrated improvements with head-to-head field trials. To be specific, the new physical layer offers the following improvements over the baseline physical layer of SRW: (i) broadband throughputs above 6 Mbps, (ii) improved robustness to dynamic airborne and terrestrial multipath channels, and (iii) discontinuous spectra with carrier bandwidth flexibility (enabling operation even where continuous bandwidth is unavailable). The physical layer design is based on TrellisWare's universal air and ground (UAG) physical layer introduced in [1]. In that work, we discuss how the UAG's flexibility in terms of bandwidth usage and interface to upper layers could be leveraged to provide a physical layer retrofit to an existing waveforms. This paper covers the effort to target SRW, an effort which concluded in a demonstration of significant performance enhancements to SRW.	airborne ranger;baseline (configuration management);data rate units;etsi satellite digital radio;interconnection;multipath propagation;osi model;phy (chip);requirement;super robot wars;terrestrial television;throughput;unified access gateway;waveform	Alex Blyskun;Mark Johnson;Sungill Kim;James Speros;Gautam Thatte;David R.

A statistical method to evaluate the scheduling gain is proposed and a proof of its convergence is given. This method is three orders of magnitude faster than full system simulation. Based on these results, a queuing theory analysis is performed and is applied to the pedestrian A 3km/h channel model and LMMSE receiver. The evaluation uses drive tests measurements to reflect the realistic distribution of radio conditions. The derived flow-level performance of PF scheduling, including blocking rate, outage rate and flow throughput, is of major interest for network operators.	blocking (computing);channel (communications);computer architecture simulator;downtime;proportionally fair;queueing theory;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Richard Combes;Salah-Eddine Elayoubi;Zwi Altman	2011	2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks	10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930005	fair-share scheduling;cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;fair queuing;gain scheduling;queueing theory;round-robin scheduling;proportionally fair;statistics;computer network	Metrics	3.6554860645758973	97.48765051109342	12971

Contemporary research works have traditionally dealt with these two problems in an isolated manner though they should be considered within the same problem formulation. Furthermore, even though deployment of additional APs can improve the network capacity in case there are a few APs in a given area, the APs cannot be indefinitely added to the wireless network. This means that there is an upper bound to the network capacity maximization with respect to the number of APs. In fact, the network capacity starts to dramatically decrease when the number of deployed APs becomes excessive. This performance decrease can be accredited to the substantial interference among the high number of deployed APs. In order to address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an approach to jointly optimize the number of APs and POCs assignment. Our proposal derives the existence of the optimal density of APs with POCs, and models the POC assignment to the deployed APs from a novel perspective. Computer-based simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.	expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maximal set;network performance;regular expression;simulation;software deployment;wireless access point	Wei Zhao;Zubair Md.

With the growing need to analyze high speed data streams, the task of outlier detection becomes even more challenging as traditional outlier detection techniques can no longer assume that all the data can be stored for processing. While researchers mostly focus on detecting global outliers for data streams, detecting local outliers on streaming data has been neglected. This is an example of the utility problem in machine learning, where the machine learning algorithm needs to consider how the scarcity of a critical resource in the deployment environment affects the utility of any learned model. In this paper we focus on local outliers and propose an incremental solution assuming finite memory available. Our experimental results on a variety of data sets show that our solution is well suited to application environments with limited memory (e.g., wireless sensor networks) where the state of the system is changing.	algorithm;anomaly detection;central processing unit;data mining;data point;deployment environment;experiment;gait analysis;intrusion detection system;local outlier factor;machine learning;sensor;software deployment;stream (computing);streaming media	Mahsa Salehi;Christopher Leckie;James C.

There exist many jamming waves arising from illegal (non-licensed) repeating antennas or wireless cameras that seriously interfere to CDMA signals especially in urban districts. It makes lower communication quality such like crossed communication in voice and lower throughputs in data transmission.

013670efba0abfc4b5347697e66b32a085d83c35	on the energy efficiency of coherent communication in multipath fading channels	wireless communications;signal processing	Conventional research on energy-efficient wireless systems tends to focus on saving transmit energy. However, as the evolution of wireless systems moves towards shorter distance transmission and smaller cell sizes, the computational energy in wireless hardware becomes significant alongside transmit radio energy. In this paper, we develop energy models for a point-to-point wireless transmission that consider practical aspects such as multipath fading, error-control coding and receiver synchronization. The total energy consumption of the wireless system is modeled as a function of modulation scheme, data rate, signal bandwidth, code rate, received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel parameters. We choose a multipath Rayleigh-fading channel model and Reed-Solomon coding scheme for the numerical analyses. Simulation results show that there exists an optimal parameter configuration that gives the minimum energy consumption for given data and bit-error rates. At short transmission distances, computational energy dominates and higher-order modulation schemes with low bandwidth allocation are shown to be more energy efficient.	bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);code rate;coherence (physics);computation;data rate units;error detection and correction;feedback;iterative method;li-chen wang;mathematical optimization;modulation;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;point-to-point protocol;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;reed–solomon error correction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter;uncompressed video;victoria (3d figure)	Dinuka Kudavithana;Qasim M.

Small cells deployment and cognitive radio which facilitates efficient utilization of radio spectrum are the promising techniques for evolution of the NGCN. In a heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) design where interference is an important issue, outage probability is a fundamental performance measure. In this paper, stochastic geometry based model is used for deriving the outage probability for different resource allocation strategies, which are both interference and instantaneous signal power limited. This paper considers a cognitive based two tier HCN where the macro base stations (MBSs) and cognitive pico base stations (CPBSs) are distributed by two independent homogeneous spatial Poisson point processes (HSPPPs). Co-channel resource allocation strategy considers cross-tier and co-tier interference, while orthogonal channel strategy considers only co-tier interference to calculate the outage probability. Moreover, depending on the outage probability expression, the area spectral efficiency (ASE) and EE are calculated for co-channel and orthogonal channel deployment. Analytical results, with a constraint on minimum instantaneous signal power, show that the outage performance and EE are better for orthogonal resource allocation compare to the co-channel resource allocation strategy.	adaptive server enterprise;cognition;cognitive radio;downtime;interference (communication);multitier architecture;next-generation network;software deployment;spectral efficiency;sun outage	Mukesh Kumar Mishra;Aditya Trivedi	2014	2014 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications (OnlineGreenComm)	10.1109/OnlineGreenCom.2014.7114427	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management	Mobile	28.077121987327143	86.21760152756866	13037

Recently, several distributed QoS mechanisms have been proposed which translate user QoS requirements into typically a single parameter of the DCF protocol. In this paper, we compare the pros and cons of the major distributed QoS mechanisms, and propose a new mechanism provides superior performance and supports two different QoS models. The proposed mechanism is based on deficit round robin scheduling and translates the user throughput requirements into the 802.11 MAC InterFrame Space and Backoff Interval parameters. We show via simulations that the proposed mechanism provides low variability of throughput and delay and has the advantage of low complexity.

In order to communicate with each other, nodes need to detect each other through sending and receiving beacons. Due to the strict constraint of energy supply, a sensor node without being in sleep mode cannot work long enough to meet the applications' lifetime requirements. Hence nodes need to work in low duty cycle to conserve energy. This working style makes it difficult for the nodes to discover each other and consequently will decrease the possibility for the data exchange among nodes. In order to increase the efficiency of energy usage, it is necessary for nodes to adjust their duty cycles according to the change of the number of the neighbouring nodes. In this paper a flock detection based duty cycle scheduling scheme is proposed for the mobile sensor network with non-periodic motion pattern. Based on the flock detection method through neighbour node number estimation presented in this paper, the duty cycle scheduling scheme is designed to increase the efficiency of the energy use of the sensor node. Experimental results show that the mechanism is able to significantly improve the performance of the system.	duty cycle;experiment;flock;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;network packet;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;sleep mode	Xiaoguang Zhang;Zheng Da Wu	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115550	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	9.678245157557216	80.94270656567195	13097
ae25b4d648b8233103e70a5a43662ecaf6d7302f	using improved product-coded modulation codes to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio in single-carrier frequency division multiple access systems	product coded modulation codes;papr;slm;sc fdma;reed muller codes	Single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) is a wireless transmission technology based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. SC-FDMA is considered an uplink transmission technology according to long-term evolution standards and long-term evolution advanced standards, the latter of which is the transmission standard for fourth-generation mobile communication systems. A peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can be used to assess the power efficiency of transmitters. For a transmitter, a higher PAPR indicates lower power efficiency. The PAPR of an SC-FDMA system increases as the order of modulation increases, reducing the efficiency of the power amplifier. The method suggested in this paper is a new PAPR improvement technique based on product-coded modulation codes, in which the component codes of the product codes are built using Reed–Muller codes. The suggested method uses product-coded modulation to develop selective mapping (SLM). Unlike the traditional SLM technique, this method does not require side information to be transmitted to the receiver but proposes a mechanism for producing a phase factor to improve PAPR performance. The simulation results show that the suggested method produces higher PAPR efficiency compared with the conventional SC-FDMA system. In addition, multilevel coding, modulation technology, and PAPR improvement techniques are integrated into the suggested method to improve coding gains as well as spectral and PAPR efficiency.	carrier frequency;modulation	Hsin-Ying Liang;Cheng-Ying Yang;Kuang-Hao Lin;Chia-Hsin Cheng	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3532-1	reed–muller code;telecommunications;statistics	Mobile	44.671544333332164	81.07101389907697	13099

For pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) communication links, the combination of transmitter waveform and linear receiver that minimizes the mean-squared error arising from these sources is determined. An extension to include the effects of timing jitter is performed in a companion paper. Performance characteristics of the optimal PAM systems, showing the mean-squared error versus the signal-to-noise ratio, are determined explicitly for several examples. These characteristics are compared both with those of certain suboptimal systems and with the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA), derived by combining Shannon's concepts of the capacity of a channel and the rate distortion function of a source. The optimal PAM systems are seen to perform very close to the OPTA for low signal-to-noise ratios. For high signal-to-noise ratios, however, the mean-squared error of optimal PAM systems decreases as the reciprocal of the signal-to-noise ratio, but the OPTA decreases more rapidly, except for band-limited channels. The performance of PAM systems can be improved at high signal-to-noise ratios by coding techniques. One such technique, called Shannon-Cantor coding, is discussed briefly.	information theory;modulation;transmitter	Toby Berger;Donald W. Tufts	1967	IEEE Trans.

First, it is proved that the secrecy function determining Eve's performance attains its maximum at y = 1 on all known extremal even unimodular lattices. This is a special case of a conjecture by Belfiore and Solé. Further, a very simple method to verify or disprove the conjecture on any given unimodular lattice is given. Second, preliminary analysis on the behavior of Eve's probability of correct decision in the fast fading wiretap channel is provided. More specifically, we compute the truncated inverse norm power sum factors in Eve's probability expression. The analysis reveals a performance-secrecy-complexity tradeoff: relaxing on the legitimate user's performance can significantly increase the security of transmission. The confusion experienced by the eavesdropper may be further increased by using skewed lattices, but at the cost of increased complexity.	code;eve;rayleigh fading;unimodular polynomial matrix	Anne-Maria Ernvall-Hytönen;Camilla Hollanti	2011	2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop	10.1109/ITW.2011.6089380	combinatorics;channel code;telecommunications;information theory;theoretical computer science;rayleigh fading;lattice;probability;mathematics;statistics;polynomial	Theory	34.61803778950102	68.68029647839974	13114

ZigBee modules are powered by a battery because it has to be movable. Energy saving of the ZigBee module has been one of important issues because its battery life time is limited. Nowadays many energy efficient software algorithms have been developed for ZigBee modules, that are used in data transmission between nodes. A node means a ZigBee module. In order to save energy in the ZigBee module, software algorithm was not used in this study, but we used the hardware technique. The microcontroller of ZigBee controls power of the sensors which connected on the ZigBee module. Sensors are active only when they need to transmit data and in other case the module switches to the power down mode and save energy.	algorithm;intel mcs-51;microcontroller;network switch;radio frequency;sensor;system on a chip	Odgerel Ayurzana;Byambajav Ragchaa;Hiesik Kim	2014	2014 20th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)	10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097903	embedded system;neurfon;sensor;battery;computer network;miwi	Embedded	8.882362282105442	70.07666000677776	13116

For distortion measures which are “locally quadratic” a rigorous derivation of the asymptotic distortion and entropy-coded rate of multidimensional companders is given along with conditions for the optimal choice of the compressor function. This optimum compressor, when it exists, depends on the distortion measure but not on the source distribution. The rate-distortion performance of the companding scheme is studied using a recently obtained asymptotic expression for the rate-distortion function which parallels the Shannon lower bound for difference distortion measures. It is proved that the high-resolution performance of the scheme is arbitrarily close to the rate-distortion limit for large quantizer dimensions if the compressor function and the lattice quantizer used in the companding scheme are optimal, extending an analogous statement for entropy-coded lattice quantization and MSE distortion. The companding approach is applied to obtain a high-resolution quantizing scheme for noisy sources.	companding;data compression;distortion;entropy encoding;image resolution;parallels desktop for mac;quantization (signal processing);rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit);vector quantization	Tamás Linder;Ram Zamir;Kenneth Zeger	1999	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of virtual bandwidth and discuss its application to ABR flow control. We develop a new explicit rate marking algorithm that adopts a traffic-driven measurement-based approach to track the available bandwidth and the virtual bandwidth concept to achieve both fairness and high utilisation. This algorithm exhibits O(1)-computational complexity, O(1)-storage complexity, fast responsiveness, and quick convergence.

However, since each additional antenna has a cost and requires additional circuits for processing, one of the rst question people in charge of realizing actual systems (and not only simulations) usually ask is: what is the required number of antennas? In this paper, we use random matrices theory to derive a theoretical approximation of the error rate with respect to the number of antennas. Thanks to this result, long simulations can be avoided and the required number of antennas can be easily determined.	approximation;mimo;mevio;mobile phone;simulation	Gilles Burel	2002			transmission system;wireless;random matrix;local area network;electronic engineering;word error rate;wi-fi;ask price;mathematical optimization;communication channel;computer science	Mobile	25.574098187698024	80.56993016686356	13155

Algorithms for using measured crosstalk data to jointly optimize DSL performance have been recently published, and are based on finding the optimal transmit PSD in an iterative fashion. However, these algorithms can ensure joint optimization of homogenous DSL services only. In this paper, we present an iterative algorithm for jointly optimizing single-carrier and multi-carrier DSL services. In particular, we address the case of joint optimization of ADSL and G.shdsl. Simulations are run with many different crosstalk couplings for several scenarios of loop length and numbers of crosstalkers. Simulation results show that average bit rate increases of several hundred percent are commonly achieved on relatively long loops with these dynamic spectrum management (DSM) techniques.	algorithm;asymmetric digital subscriber line;computer simulation;crosstalk;data rate units;database;iterative method;langton's loops;mathematical optimization;shortest path problem;telephone exchange;transmitter;windows rt	Kenneth J.

Estimating the network traffic performance for a given time window with a probabilistic tolerance enables better data routing and transfers that is particularly important for large scientific data movements, which can be found in almost every scientific domain. In this paper, we develop a network performance estimation model based on statistical time series approach, to improve the efficiency of network resource utilization and data transfer scheduling and management over networks. Seasonal adjustment procedures are developed for identification of the cycling period and patterns, seasonal adjustment and diagnostics. Compared to the traditional time series models, we show a better forecast performance in our seasonal adjustment model with narrow confidence intervals.	bundle adjustment;data access;network packet;network performance;network traffic control;routing;scheduling (computing);simple network management protocol;time series	Kejia Hu;Alex Sim;Demetres Antoniades;Constantinos Dovrolis	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39712-7_46	seasonal adjustment;simulation;computer science;time series;data mining;statistics	HPC	4.711040118865612	70.74988327680128	13178

We show such a set of sequences can be obtained by minimizing the Integrated Side Lobe (ISL) with the binary requirement imposed as a design constraint. By using the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework, we propose an efficient monotonic algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), to minimize the objective function which is non-convex and NP-hard in general. Simulation results illustrate that the ISL of designed binary set of sequences is the neighborhood of the Welch bound, Indicating its superior performance.

On-body radio devices determine their position by estimating their distance to other nodes from the measurement of the Round Trip Time Of Flight of Impulse Radio-Ultra Wideband signals. The nodes not only measure their distance to fixed anchors, but also use device-to-device measurements, which improves spatial diversity and redundancy yielding to a better localization accuracy and robustness. However, such measurements are easily biased by line-of-sight conditions and body shadowing. We propose to apply a biased version of the extended Kalman filter to alleviate the effect of measurement biases in Non Line Of Sight (NLOS) conditions and combine this filter with an NLOS detection mechanism from the literature and evaluate, by simulation, the achieved gain.

At the same time, studies conducted by governmental bodies show that a considerable part of the allocated spectrum is underutilized. This paper aims to design and develop a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme from a comprehensive perspective including sensing, communication, decision, and transmission along with some other additional features. The scheme is based on dynamic weighting of cooperating users according to their reliability based on historical decision data. The work is articulated into a model development, the definition of mathematical metrics, and rounds of simulations to asses the validity of the model. Simulation results indicate that the model provides an adequate answer to some of the most challenging aspects of cognitive spectrum sensing.	cognitive radio;cooperative multitasking;ibm systems network architecture;pmd;pervasive informatics;population;predictive failure analysis;prime-factor fft algorithm;requirement;shading;simulation;throughput;tip (unix utility)	Adamant Sula;Chi Zhou	2009	JCM	10.4304/jcm.4.10.741-751	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	21.73071307575871	90.63842620075137	13247

93d264436b4d4637ee70e756a805a69291d4c6c6	random neural network based novel decision making framework for optimized and autonomous power control in lte uplink system	coverage and capacity optimization;cognitive engine design requirements;random neural network;cognitive radio;long term evolution system;decision making framework	This paper presents a novel decision making framework for cognitive radio networks. The traditional continuous process of sensing, analysis, reasoning, and adaptation in a cognitive cycle has been divided into two levels. In the first level, the process of sensing and adaptation runs over the radio transmission hardware during run-time. In the second level, the process of analysis and reasoning runs in the background in offline mode. This arrangement offloads the convergence time and complexity problem of reasoning process during run-time. For implementation of the first level, a random neural network (RNN) based controller trained on an open loop case based database on the cloud has been designed. For the second level, a genetic algorithm (GA) based reasoning and an RNN based learning has been developed. The proposed framework is used to address the uplink power control problem of long-term evolution (LTE) system. The performance of RNN is compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and state-of-the-art fractional power control (FPC) scheme in terms of essential cognitive engine (CE) design requirements, capacity, and coverage optimization (CCO). The simulation results have shown that RNN based CE can achieve comparable results with faster adaptation, even subject to severe environment changes without the need of retraining.	artificial neural network;autonomous robot;compaq lte;random neural network;telecommunications link	Ahsan Adeel;Hadi Larijani;Ali Ahmadinia	2016	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2015.11.004	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;random neural network;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer network	AI	25.61494656064861	94.9766408328615	13301
0660a50b1e405b2be113338c41015a35a029db20	context-based routing: techniques, applications and experience	wireless network;route selection;network coding;routing protocol	Routing protocols in multi-hop networks are typically based on finding low cost paths by modeling the cost of a path as thesum of the costson the constituting links. However, the insufficiency of this approach becomes more apparent as new lower layer technologies are incorporated. For instance, to maximize the benefit of multiple radios, ideally we should use routes that contain low interference among the constituting links. Similarly, to maximize the benefit of network coding, we should ideally use routes that create more coding opportunities. Both of these are difficult to accomplish within the conventional routing framework because therein the links are examined in isolation of each other, whereas the nature of the problem involves interdependencies among the links. This paper aims at revealing a unifying framework for routing in the presence of inherent link interdependencies, which we call “context-based routing”. Through the case studies of two concrete application scenarios, network coding–aware routing and self-interference aware routing in multi-radio systems, we highlight the common key pillars for context-based routing and their interplay: context-based path metric and a route selection method. We implement context-based routing protocols in Windows XP and Linux and evaluate them in detail.

The distin- guishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line- of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated into the energy efficiency analysis. Following the description of the system model for mmWave cellular networks, coverage probabilities are computed for each link. Subsequently, average power consumption of BSs and RSs are modeled and energy efficiency is determined in terms of system parameters. Energy efficiency in the presence of beamforming alignment errors is also investigated to get insight on the performance in practical scenarios. Finally, the impact of BS and RS densities, antenna gains, main lobe beam widths, LOS interference range, and alignment errors on the energy efficiency is analyzed via numerical results.	acoustic lobing;beamforming;broadcast relay station;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);numerical analysis;point process	Esma Turgut;Mustafa Cenk Gursoy	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880984	stochastic process;cellular network;telecommunications;antenna;mathematics;interference;efficient energy use;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;stochastic geometry	Mobile	28.382956643846082	84.53846572189535	13324

The sensing principle exploits the fact that the human body interacts with wireless signals, introducing variations of the radiowave fields due to shadowing and multipath phenomena. As a result, human motion can be inferred from fluctuations of radiowave power collected by a receiving terminal. In this paper, we investigate the potentialities of widely available wireless communication devices in order to develop an improvised motion detection system (IMDS). Experimental tests are performed in an indoor environment by using a smartphone as a Wi-Fi access point and a laptop with dedicated software as a receiver. Simple detection strategies tailored for real-time operation are implemented to process the received signal strength measurements. The achieved results confirm the potentialities of the simple system here proposed to reliably detect human motion in operational conditions.	algorithm;applicative programming language;cns disorder;conflict (psychology);distance;experiment;heart rate variability;in-memory database;inference;kinesiology;laptop;microbiological phenomena;movement;quantization (signal processing);rss;radio frequency;radio wave;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;shadowing (histology);smartphone;spatial variability;system of measurement;wireless access point;centimeter;radiofrequency	Francesco Soldovieri;Gianluca Gennarelli	2016	Sensors	10.3390/s16030307	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;physics	Mobile	20.859202453263237	77.34522254848922	13367

The power allocation in each link is built into a non-cooperative game where a utility function is identified and maximized. Due to poor channel conditions, some links have very low data transmission rates even though their transmit powers are high. Therefore, a mechanism for shutting down links is proposed in order to reduce cochannel interference and improve energy efficiency. The multiuser water-filling and the gradient projection methods are compared with the proposed game theoretic approach in terms of system capacity and energy efficiency. It is shown that using the proposed method with the link shut-down mechanism allows the MIMO ad hoc network to achieve the highest energy efficiency and the highest system capacity	catastrophic interference;channel capacity;data rate units;game theory;gradient;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;power management;shutdown (computing);simulation;space-filling tree;transmitter;utility	Chao Liang;Kapil R.

Thanks to the ability to update soft code to sensor nodes, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) brings profound changes to Internet of Things. However, it is a challenging issue to minimize delay and transmission times and maintain long lifetime when broadcasting data packets in high loss ratio and low duty cycle WSNs. Although there have been some research concerning code dissemination, those schemes can only achieve a tradeoff between different performances, instead of optimizing all these important performances at the same time. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new strategy that can reduce delay and transmission times simultaneously. In traditional method, the broadcasting nature of wireless communication is not sufficiently utilized. By allowing sons of the same parent node to share awake slots, the broadcasting nature is well exploited and delay is thus reduced as well as transmission times with lifetime not affected. And, as we discover there is energy surplus when collecting data in area away from sink, we further improve this strategy so that all the performances can be further bettered. Compared with traditional method, the methods we design (IFAS, BTAS and AAPS) can respectively reduce delay by 20.56%, 31.59%, 55.16% and reduce transmission times by 29.53%, 43.93%, 42.04%, while not reducing lifetime.	algorithm;anatomic node;aspartate transaminase;conflict (psychology);duty cycle;internet of things;manuscripts;mathematical optimization;natural science disciplines;network packet;open research;performance;sensor;simulation;softcoding;tree (data structure)	Wei Qi;Wei Liu;Xuxun Liu;Anfeng Liu;Tian Wang;Naixue N.

The conventional all-digital synchronization methods encounter some formidable implementation difficulties such as high rate sampling and high complexity RAKE structure. To avoid these challenges, semi-analog methods have been motivated recently. We have recently proposed a code-assisted blind synchronization (CABS) algorithm to realize timing synchronization blindly with the help of the discriminative property of both time hopping codes and well- designed polarity codes. The algorithm requires sampling at the frame rate only and bypasses channel estimation during the synchronization phase. This paper analyzes the identifiability and both the probability of acquisition and the the mean square error performance of CABS analytically. A data-aided code-assisted synchronization (CAS) algorithm is also proposed and a modified version of CABS which relies solely on the time hopping code is investigated.	algorithm;channel state information;code;elsevier biobase;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;mean squared error;rake;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;ultra-wideband	Yeqiu Ying;Mounir Ghogho;Ananthram Swami	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.708	sampling;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Robotics	52.96180210636445	78.36639942876715	13400

Coordination is performed based o n spatial Voronoi tessellation, while taking into consideration the limited sensing capabilities of the agen ts. Each node performs an independent optimization in order to increase network’s area coverage via its motion, wh ile it attains information from its current and future Delaunay neighbors. A decentralized algorithm is proposed in order to achieve optimal network’s coverage, based on local information. Connectivity issues are analyz ed in detail, while a lower bound on the communication radius of the nodes is derived, in order to attain suffi cient information for performing the corresponding optimization. An agent moves inside its region of responsib ility in a way that the total area surveyed by the network is a monotonically increasing function of time. The online control action makes the network adaptive to possible changes in the environment.	algorithm;computer simulation;control theory;decentralized autonomous organization;delaunay triangulation;distributed control system;mathematical optimization;mobile agent;non-functional requirement;swarm;voronoi diagram	Yiannis Stergiopoulos;Anthony Tzes	2011	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-010-9537-1	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	13.162201242294119	75.5829693109953	13414

This paper classifies the principal techniques for quality improvement in video communications, which can be embedded in a communication network or in dedicated, network-external middleware components. With these techniques we distinguish, on one hand, mechanisms achieving quality improvement by means of local decisions within the sending or receiving endsystem and, on the other hand, mechanisms requiring communication and cooperation between middleware components on both, sending and receiving side. We also emphasize the combined usage of different techniques for quality-of-service (QoS) improvement. In order to judge the current service quality on different layers within the protocol hierarchy we introduce a set of QoS measures for each of the basic service interfaces identified. Finally, we solve the mapping problems between these QoS measures by way of example.		Bernd E.

The authors first analyze three sources of signal distortion: sensing noise, data quantization error and data communication noise. The sensing noise is often negligible. We need to choose the proper data quantization levels to balance the communication cost and the desired signal quality. Besides, data fusion at a local fusion center can be used to mitigate the communication noise due to the poor wireless channel. Instead of making a hard binary decision, the probability for a sensor node to be a contour node is calculated at the local fusion center. An adaptive data fusion scheme is proposed to avoid excessive packet retransmissions. Simulation results are given to show the effects of different system parameters on the overall system performance.	contour line;distortion;network packet;quantization (signal processing);sensor node;simulation	Pei-Kai Liao;Min-Kuan Chang;C.-C.

1ebb2195e859d7bfab55af8d146056c5dd7258a5	efficient collaborative spectrum sensing under the smart primary user emulation attacker network		In this paper, collaborative spectrum sensing to detect random signals corrupted by Gaussian noise in the presence of Primary User Emulation Attackers (PUEAs) is studied. We consider smart PUEAs which aims at increasing the false alarm probability and constitute a PUEA network on a Cognitive Radio (CR) network by impersonating Primary Users (PUs). In addition, we propose two security schemes in which sensing nodes get assistance from the Secondary Users (SUs) using two different approaches. In the first approach, the proposed scheme requires having some knowledge about the PUEA network similar to most of the schemes available in the literature. In our second proposed scheme, information about the PUEA network is not required yielding a scheme which is robust to the strategy of attackers. In both proposed approaches, we propose an algorithm to incorporate the SUs assistance in spectrum sensing. The final collaborative decision is made through solution of an optimization problem in order to achieve the best performance and protect the CR predefined requirements. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed detector at the SUs and at the employed detector in the Fusion Center (FC), the closed form expressions for detection and false alarm probabilities are computed analytically. The provided closed-form analytical results in addition to simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the existing secure spectrum sensing schemes.	algorithm;cognitive radio;emulator;ibm systems network architecture;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;simulation	Zahra Pourgharehkhan;Abbas Taherpour;Tamer Khattab;Ridha Hamila	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417754	emulation;detector;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;information security;reliability;computer security;statistics;computer network;collaboration	Mobile	34.211844328180014	83.96762960807803	13512

In addition to personal communication tools, devices have been developed to bring intelligence to users, objects and spaces via inter-terminal connections, such as the internet of things IoTs and 5G mobile communications. Hence, seamless mobility of the sensors used for these communications is important for fulfilling their services. To address this need, network-based mobility management protocols can be applied to sensor networks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of mobility management using F-HMIPv6, PMIPv6, HMIPv6 and FPMIPv6 with fluid-flow and random-walk models. Experimental results show that the location update costs of PMIPv6 and FPMIPv6 are better than those of HMIPv6 and F-HMIPv6.

IBFD, the technology of simultaneously transmitting and receiving in one frequency band, combined with a scheduling scheme are applied to a femtocell which acts as a relay to upload the traffic of a high density area to a macrocell. Numerical evaluation of the proposed scheduling scheme shows that the scheme increases the network throughput up to two times when self-interference of IBFD is low.	duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;interference (communication);relay;scheduling (computing);software deployment;spectral density;throughput;transmitter;upload	Mohammad Mollashahi;Mehri Mehrjoo;Majid Abiri	2017	2017 9th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2017.8255150	macrocell;throughput;computer network;duplex (telecommunications);heterogeneous network;scheduling (computing);frequency band;computer science;femtocell;distributed computing;cellular network	Mobile	26.621570338143602	89.97992944335263	13522

In this scenario, the traditional transmit power control scheme becomes less effective. To address this issue, we propose a multiplex transmission scheme using both underlay and overlay transmission scheme, and we also consider the cooperation and power allocation between CR users. The key feature of the new transmission scheme is that CR user can communicate with CR receiver even if it is very close to the primary receiver. The achievable rate of a cognitive user under multiplex transmission scheme is simulated and analyzed, the simulation results demonstrate that the transmission rate of the proposed scheme is higher than that of underlay transmission scheme.	cognitive radio;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;simulation	Yingwei Wang;Shengnan Yan;Hongtao Zhang;Yihua Huang	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493681	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	34.4081751760299	84.46683180353364	13527

The dominance protocol is an important approach in which transmitting nodes use priority identifiers to dynamically regulate access to the shared medium. This protocol, however, has an unresolved problem called the Multihop Competing Problem (MCP). Despite recognizing that the problem could occur, the current literature offers no characterization of the problem or when it can occur. Because MCP could occur, it was not possible to analytically determine the end-to-end latency bounds of the message streams. When MCP occurred, the end-to-end latency of the message streams was affected adversely. We characterize MCP and show that it is an exposed terminal problem that occurs when the nodes use certain priority identifiers in adjacent two-hop neighborhoods of a transmitting node. Using a random disk graph model, we show that MCP occurs often in such systems. We utilize our characterization of MCP to derive priority identifiers that guarantee that MCP will not occur. The MCP free labels propose enable the predictable delivery of multihop message streams, improve end-to-end latency of the streams, and improve throughput in well-engineered and ad hoc networks.	best, worst and average case;cyber-physical system;directed graph;end-to-end principle;graph coloring;heuristic;hoc (programming language);identifier;interference (communication);internet of things;online algorithm;response time (technology);revision control system;simulation;throughput;transceiver;transmitter	Shivakumar Sastry;Sajal K.

The present paper extends these blind estimation approaches to the more general problem of estimating the unknown intersymbol interference (ISI) and carrier frequency offset/Doppler effects using such precoders. An all-digital open-loop carrier frequency offset estimator is developed, and its asymptotic (large sample) performance is analyzed and compared to the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB). A subspace-based channel identification approach is proposed for estimating, in closed-form, the unknown channel, regardless of the channel spectral nulls. It is shown that compensating for the carrier frequency offset introduces no penalty in the asymptotic performance of the subspace channel estimator. Simulations are presented to corroborate the performance of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;catastrophic interference;computer simulation;cyclostationary process;interference (communication);modulation;stationary process;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Erchin Serpedin;Antoine Chevreuil;Georgios B.

Several fair queuing algorithms have been proposed in order to provide QoS in presence of errors in a fair manner. However, most of these algorithms are unpractical as they require perfect channel predication or do not work well with the Link Layer. Wireless fair queuing with retransmission (WFQ-R) algorithm was recently suggested to address these problems by penalizing flows that use wireless resources without permission in the link layer. However, the WFQ-R algorithm is based on stop-and-wait LLR scheme which also costs the network extensive delay and low utilization. In this paper, a new wireless fair queuing based on the WFQ-R algorithm is proposed to work with the window-based error control schemes in the link layer. The proposed algorithm has shown outstanding results compared with WFQ-R in terms of lower queuing delay, better throughput and fairly allocated resources.	error detection and correction;fair queuing;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;network scheduler;pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms;queuing delay;retransmission (data networks);throughput;weighted fair queueing	Abdul-Rahman Elshafei;Uthman A.

In particular, IEEE 802.11b WLAN is the most widespread wireless network today. The IEEE 802.11b WLAN supports multiple transmission rates and the rate is chosen in an adaptive manner by an auto rate control algorithm. This auto rate control algorithm deeply affects the total system performance of the IEEE 802.11b WLAN. In this paper, we examine the WLAN performance with regard to the auto rate control algorithm, especially the ARF scheme, which is the most popular auto rate control algorithm in 802.11b based WLAN products. The experimental results indicate that the ARF scheme works well in the face of signal noise due to node location. However, the ARF scheme severely degrades system performance when multiple nodes contend to obtain the wireless channel and the packet is lost due to signal collision.	acoustic radiation force;algorithm;control theory;internet;network packet;noise (electronics);serial experiments lain;throughput	Namgi Kim;Sunwoong Choi;Hyunsoo Yoon	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31957-3_123	embedded system;throughput;real-time computing;the internet;internationalization and localization;mass spectrometry;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer performance;computer network	Mobile	1.118868732064941	104.71364059220194	13622

6f5a799dbb8a72b14762b210c1ca113a733bee6a	distributed anomaly detection using autoencoder neural networks in wsn for iot		Abstract-Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are fundamental to the Internet of Things (IoT) by bridging the gap between the physical and the cyber worlds. Anomaly detection is a critical task in this context as it is responsible for identifying various events of interests such as equipment faults and undiscovered phenomena. However, this task is challenging because of the elusive nature of anomalies and the volatility of the ambient environments. In a resource-scarce setting like WSN, this challenge is further elevated and weakens the suitability of many existing solutions. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce autoencoder neural networks into WSN to solve the anomaly detection problem. We design a two-part algorithm that resides on sensors and the IoT cloud respectively, such that (i) anomalies can be detected at sensors in a fully distributed manner without the need for communicating with any other sensors or the cloud, and (ii) the relatively more computationintensive learning task can be handled by the cloud with a much lower (and configurable) frequency. In addition to the minimal communication overhead, the computational load on sensors is also very low (of polynomial complexity) and readily affordable by most COTS sensors. Using a real WSN indoor testbed and sensor data collected over 4 consecutive months, we demonstrate via experiments that our proposed autoencoderbased anomaly detection mechanism achieves high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate. It is also able to adapt to unforeseeable and new changes in a non-stationary environment, thanks to the unsupervised learning feature of our chosen autoencoder neural networks.		Tie Luo;Sai G.

Following the approach of resource sharing, we introduce a general formulation that covers current fixed and dynamic approaches as special cases. Unlike previous approaches, our formulation maximizes spectral efficiency by occasionally penalizing an operator within defined boundaries. This interesting tradeoff between sharing guarantees and system performance is studied by simulation. Our results clarify the costs of fair sharing and how much spectral efficiency can be gained by relaxing fairness in a controlled manner. This study, thus, provides important insight into the efficient design of shared base stations in future cellular networks.	fairness measure;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;tom gruber	Ilaria Malanchini;Stefan Valentin;Osman Aydin	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906459	channel allocation schemes;cognitive radio;wireless wan;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	29.60563330579134	94.25199563289708	13652

The space shifted constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequence based preamble is proposed for channel estimation. Two flexible frame structures are proposed for adaptive system design as well as cyclicity reconstruction of the received inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) block. With regard to channel estimation and cyclicity reconstruction, the complexity of the proposed scheme is only around 7.20% of that of the conventional solutions.

The protocol is based on Stable Election Protocol (SEP). Fuzzy logic control based on three variables, distance of nodes form base station, density of nodes and the battery level of nodes along with the traditional threshold values used in SEP are used to enhance the process of cluster head election in the existing SEP protocol and improve the lifetime and throughput of the Wireless Sensor Network. The result of the simulation which has been done in MATLAB simulator indicates that Stable Election Protocol based on fuzzy logic is more energy efficient and improves the lifetime and throughput of the network by 73.2 and 68.54 % respectively comparing with the existing SEP protocol.	algorithm;communications protocol;cylinder-head-sector;fuzzy logic;logic control;matlab;routing;simulation;symantec endpoint protection;throughput	Yahya Kord Tamandani;Mohammad Ubaidullah Bokhari	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-0997-x	wireless routing protocol;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.702602970732862	81.45756660876401	13729

Routing capability is defined with respect to the entire spectrum of distance. As a result, the amount of information that is useful for message routing is increased. An algorithm is presented to facilitate efficient fault-tolerant routing of messages. The algorithm routes a message in an attempt to minimize derouting. Furthermore, the concept of directed routing capability which contains more useful information for fault-tolerant routing is introduced. Simulation results demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.	routing	Ge-Ming Chiu;Kai-Shung Chen	1997	IEEE Trans.

The root of the tree is a fusion center that makes an overall decision. Every other node in the tree is a relay node that fuses binary messages from its two child nodes into a new binary message and sends it to the parent node at the next level. We assume that the relay nodes at the same level use identical fusion rule. The goal is to find a string of fusion rules used at all the levels in the tree that maximizes the reduction in the total error probability between the leaf nodes and the fusion center. We formulate this problem as a deterministic dynamic program and express the optimal strategy in terms of Bellman's equation. Moreover, we use the notion of string-submodularity to show that the reduction in the total error probability is a string-submodular function. Consequentially, we show that the greedy strategy, which only maximizes the level-wise reduction in the total error probability, performs at least within a factor $(1-1/e)$ of the optimal strategy in terms of reduction in the total error probability, even if the nodes and links in the trees are subject to random failures.	bellman equation;greedy algorithm;relay;sensor;submodular set function;tree (data structure)	Zhenliang Zhang;Edwin K.

The user and packet scheduling mechanisms employed are the determining factors on the communication system performance and must utilize multiple layers of the OSI protocol stack. The semantic and decodability (concealment related) importance and hence priorities of video packets can be considered at the application layer. In this paper, the use of video content and packet priorities for multi-objective optimized (MOO) scheduling in 1xEV-DO system is introduced. Rate adaptive AVC/H.264 encoding is used for content adaptation and a user with the least buffer fullness, best channel throughput and highest video packet importance is targeted for scheduling. Hence, losses are forced to occur at packets with low semantic/decodability importance. Results show that the proposed framework achieves 1-to-2 dB's better PSNR in high importance temporal regions compared to the state-of-the-art CBR encoding case.	streaming media	Tanir Ozcelebi;Fabio De Vito;M.

Calls generated by service-classes of finite source population (quasi-random call arrival process) compete for their acceptance to a W-CDMA cell, under the complete sharing policy. An arriving call can be accepted with one of several contingency Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, depending on the resource availability in the cell; the latter is indicated by thresholds. We present an approximate but recurrent formula for the efficient calculation of the system state probabilities; consequently, the call blocking (time congestion) probabilities and other performance metrics in the uplink direction are provided. The model's accuracy is verified by simulation and found to be quite satisfactory. Moreover, the proposed model performs much better than the corresponding model of infinite number of sources.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);computer simulation;low-discrepancy sequence;network congestion;quality of service;requirement;telecommunications link;threshold model	Vassilios G.

Doing so would inevitably incur high time complexity and large number of restoration nodes. However, for many applications, 100% recovery of the original connectivity is not necessary. We propose a scheme for deploying restoration sensors for a disconnected WSN to reconnect the network, achieving remarkable restored connectivity while keeping the number of restoration nodes at a low level. Since an accurate, optimal solution to the problem is NP-hard, we resort to tackling the problem in a greedy and heuristic manner. Analysis and performance evaluation via simulation show that the proposed scheme can restore the network's connectivity to a very good level with relatively low cost in terms of algorithm time and restoration nodes needed.	circuit restoration;greedy algorithm;heuristic;np-hardness;performance evaluation;sensor;simulation;time complexity	Dajin Wang;Juncheng Jia;Liwei Lin	2015	2015 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2015.7057859	time complexity;wireless sensor network;computer science;sensor;base station;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computational model;computer network	Robotics	11.231293901803912	79.67358504944362	13785

In contrast to many other differential unitary space-time codes, this new class of differential monomial space-time codes does not require the transmitted matrices to form a group. Instead, the signals at each transmit antenna are constrained in MPSK constellations. Due to this feature, the transmitted signals on each transmit antenna can be generated by a simple table lookup and modulus-add operation with low complexity. We give design examples for 4 transmit antennas and show the performance improvement over conventional differential unitary space-time codes.	code;lookup table;modulus robot;monomial	Zheng Du;Norman C.

Further, previous MANET quality-of-service (QoS) routing/multicasting protocols determined bandwidth-satisfied routes for QoS applications. However, they suffer from two bandwidth-violation problems. In this paper, a novel algorithm that can avoid the two problems is proposed and integrated with the twotier infrastructures to construct bandwidth-satisfied multicast trees for QoS applications in large-scale MANETs.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);hoc (programming language);humanoid robotics project;internet backbone;multicast;multitier architecture;network packet;quality of service;regular expression;routing	Chia-Cheng Hu	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74917-2_15	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;multicast;mobile ad hoc network;integer programming;ip multicast;inter-domain;quality of service;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;theoretical computer science;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address;satisfiability	Mobile	-0.9957987287544797	82.85202820360118	13819
50d6e39e1eee0cbb0b6786d0bf7d7a2b790a78e8	efficient proactive caching in storage constrained 5g small cells		With the increase in demand for multimedia data, content caching at the edge nodes like base station (eNodeB) or user equipment (UE) has become an essential requirement in order to meet lower latency for faster access to data in the fifth generation (5G) wireless systems. However, the content caching has many challenges to be solved. The major ones among them are limited storage capability at the edge nodes, prediction of the user preferences and the content update over time. In this paper, we are addressing two use case scenarios, one where caching is performed at the base station and second, where caching is done at the UE which communicates based on the device to device (D2D) communication methodology. For both the use cases, we are addressing two fundamental problems. Firstly, what is the minimum cache size which is needed to attain a defined satisfaction quotient of the network? Secondly, what is the best caching mechanism to attain a minimum satisfaction quotient per user? In this work, we present a novel algorithm for the purpose of popularity estimation of content, named as Rank-Directed Sparse Bayesian Learning (RD-SBL). Further based on the estimated popularity matrix we propose another novel algorithm for content placement at the cache. RD-SBL performs better than the existing solution by providing 30% to 45% per user cache hit to 98.9% users along with better system level cache hit. In a D2D environment as well, RD-SBL provided a significant gain in terms of reduction in memory size and an increase in cache-hit.	algorithm;cache (computing);difference quotient;fifth generation computer;ruby document format;sparse;user (computing)	Samir Kumar Mishra;Puneet Pandey;Prince Arya;Alok Jain	2018	2018 10th International Conference on Communication Systems & Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2018.8328210	real-time computing;user equipment;computer network;latency (engineering);enodeb;cache;data access;computer science;cpu cache;base station;quotient	HPC	24.397192072848664	95.84755133283207	13822

Based on quantized channel state information at the transmitters, we derive the information-theoretic optimal downlink and uplink resource allocation/scheduling strategies. When the fading statistics are not known a priori, we develop an SPD algorithm which can dynamically adapt the scheduling policy online. We established analytically and confirm by simulations that with affordable complexity, this SPD algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimal scheduling strategies from any initial value.	algorithm;channel state information;complexity;information theory;modulation;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Xin Wang;Georgios B.

However, pseudo-random sources have liabilities that make them hardly suitable for some tasks (notably security related ones). Previous attempts to conciliate security, cost-effectiveness, and rapid development included the exploitation of the analog accessory parts often present on programmable devices. In these designs some analog blocks are used for their side effects (noise amplification) rather than for their originally intended behaviour. Conversely, here we report a direct implementation of a true random source on programmable, low-cost, general-purpose hardware, where all blocks are used only for their nominal function. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first proposal of this sort. The design exploits an FPAA, and is based on a non-linear system exhibiting chaotic behaviour. Measures confirm the correct operation, high throughput, and robustness of the system. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		Sergio Callegari;Riccardo Rovatti;Gianluca Setti	2005	I. J.

ABR selects routes based on their stability and is an on-demand reactive routing protocol similar to Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV). The multipath protocols proposed in this paper seek to reduce the number of route discoveries and average end-to-end delay by providing alternative routes between communicating source and destination nodes. Four protocols are developed and compared using different route selection criteria in order to find the most effective method used in the creation of multipath routes. The selection criteria cover node-disjoint, partial node-disjoint, disjoint and intermediate node-disjoint based approaches.	ansi escape code;distance-vector routing protocol;effective method;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);multipath propagation;multipath routing;source routing	Patrick McCarthy;Dan Grigoras	2005	Second Annual Conference on Wireless On-demand Network Systems and Services	10.1109/WONS.2005.24	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;administrative distance;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.7002782402187047	83.46663811880049	13882

By means of Generalized nets is synthesised a model of PIM (Parallel Iterative Matching) algorithm for computing of non-conflict schedule in crossbar switch node. The results of computer simulation of a GN-model performing uniform load traffic are presented. It is shown that so obtained by the simulation evaluation for throughput of switch mode tend near the theoretical boundary. A simple model for uniform traffic is suggested for switch throughput calculating which is capable to estimate approximately but faster at a rate depending on the rank of switch.	algorithm;computer simulation;crossbar switch;grid north;network packet;numerical analysis;packet switching;parallel computing;throughput	Tasho D.

We consider Diffserv networks able to support real-time traffic and we propose a novel framework for admission control that involves both traffic descriptor and measurement-based techniques and we compare its performance with existing approaches. Our simulation results show that the performance of our approach is rather insensitive to variations of the traffic sources. Even when the provided traffic descriptors are as simple as a single value denoting the required peak rate, the proposed scheme achieves satisfactory performance.	differentiated services;end-to-end principle;network packet;real-time transcription;simulation;traffic analysis	Stylianos Georgoulas;Panos Trimintzios;George Pavlou	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

These constraints are summarized under the term Quality of Service (QoS), which comprise a number of parameters. Among those, delay and delay jitter are the most important. In the study presented in this paper, measurement and modelling methods have been applied to analyse the delay and delay jitter incurred by audio/video streams. An experimental audio/video distribution system called HeiDi (Heidelberg A/V Distribution System) intended for the fully digital distribution of compressed, packetized audio and video over a token ring local area network served as testbed for the analysis. Measurements were conducted with the ZM4 (abbreviation for the German name Zahlmonitor 4) monitoring system developed at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg especially for performance analysis of distributed systems. For modelling, Monitoring Petri Nets are used, a class of Petri nets which lends itself well for the integration of measurement and modelling. Results indicate that the audio/ video subsystem and the communication subsystem must be closely integrated to yield a sufficient performance.

The design can be configured to implement the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), multimodulus algorithm (MMA), radius-adjusted modified-multimodulus algorithm (RMMA), and radius-adjusted multimodulus decision-directed algorithm (RMDA), while it can achieve channel equalization for square QAM signals up to 256-QAM. The input samples to the equalizer tapped delay line are sampled at twice the symbol rate, while the equalizer output and tap coefficients are updated at the symbol rate. This is exploited by the equalizer tap and update modules of the design, which utilize the same hardware to implement two consecutive equalizer taps per module. The IP core is implemented for the Altera Stratix II EP2S130F780C4 FPGA and targets cable demodulators. The implementation operates at a maximum symbol frequency of 8.055 MBaud, which is comparable to recent QAM equalizer designs for cable modems.	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;blind equalization;cma-es;cable modem;coefficient;equalization (communications);field-programmable gate array;modulation;modulus robot;prototype;semiconductor intellectual property core;stratix	Kevin Banovic;Mohammed A.

The receivers exploit two dimensional diversity that is offered by UWB signaling, namely multipath diversity and repetition diversity (i.e., repetition coding). Non-Gaussian modeling of the MUI results in employing a nonlinear process at each finger, jointly considering the desired users, path gain being estimated and the order associated with MUI statistics. For this, the MUI statistics are characterized in terms of their second and fourth order moments, especially considering the channel sparseness and cluster overlapping observed in realistic UWB channels, which leads to modeling the MUI by a generalized Gaussian distribution. It is shown that the MUI statistics exhibit non-Gaussian nature even for relatively large number of users, and the diversity gain against MUI can be significant when relatively small number of users coexist.	coexist (image);interference (communication);magic user interface;multi-user;multipath propagation;neural coding;nonlinear system;repetition code;ultra-wideband	Dong In Kim	2009	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2009.10.070528	electronic engineering;telecommunications;ultra-wideband;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	42.414539012503425	75.66149450364362	13961

The limitations of the RF circuitry make necessary to develop specific designs for this architecture. For instance, the space and time encoders must operate separately (the former works in the RF domain and the latter works in baseband), and at different time scales: the spatial encoder or RF beamformer must remain fixed during the transmission of a probably large number of symbols, whereas the time-encoder can work at the symbol rate. We show in the paper that although the multiplexing gain of the system is limited to one, we are still able to achieve the full spatial diversity of the MIMO channel as well as to increase the received signal-to-noise ratio through array gain. Specifically, when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available only at the receiver we propose to use a scheme referred to as orthogonal beam division multiplexing (OBDM). With this scheme the symbols are time-precoded with a unitary discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, then they are successively transmitted through orthogonal directions and, finally, we use a receiver comprising maximal ratio combining (MRC) followed by a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) decoder. The performance of the proposed techniques in terms of outage capacity and bit error rate is illustrated by means of several simulations examples.	baseband;beamforming;bit error rate;channel state information;dft matrix;discrete fourier transform;electronic circuit;encoder;mimo;maximal set;multiplexing;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;transceiver	Ignacio Santamaría;Victor Elvira;Javier Vía;David Ramírez;Jesús Pérez;Jesús Ibáñez;R.

On frequency selective channels the orthogonality between the spreading codes is lost and inter-code-interference (ICI) arises. This interference limits performances in case the base stations have a classical receiver (Rake), especially for HSUPA 5,76 Mbps mobiles. Realistic performances of those mobiles are shown in this paper. A new kind of simulation method, based on existing drive test measurements, is used. The measurements are combined with link level simulation results to obtain reliable performance estimation. Simulation results show that the throughput does not exceed 2,5 Mbps if the base stations have a Rake receiver.	apache axis;code;data rate units;ici (programming language);interference (communication);modulation;performance;rake;simulation;throughput	Jean-Baptiste Landre;Stefan Wendt	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699440	telecommunications;computer science;base station;computer network	Arch	40.9482705531321	79.77719682296724	13971

The full-duplex mode is used at the secondary relay to improve the spectrum efficiency which in turn leads to an improvement of the secrecy capacity of the full-duplex CCRN. We utilize an approximation-and-fitting method to convert the complicated expression of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio into polynomial form which is then utilized to derive an expression for the secrecy capacity. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effect of network parameters such as transmit power, interference power limit, self-interference parameters of the full-duplex mode, and distances among links on the secrecy capacity. To reveal the benefits of the full-duplex CCRN, we compare the secrecy capacity obtained when the secondary relay operates in full-duplex and half-duplex mode.	approximation;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);polynomial;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency	Thi My Chinh Chu;Hans-Jürgen Zepernick	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269124	transmitter power output;computer network;duplex (telecommunications);secrecy;cognition;computer science;polynomial;relay;spectral efficiency	Mobile	35.862611286603695	82.05173925592469	13977

Multipath fading channels exhibit inherent diversity that can be exploited via appropriate signaling and reception. In this paper, we develop a virtual multiple-input multiple-output framework for characterizing single-transmitter single-receiver multipath fading channels, where thevirtual multiple inputs and outputs are created by dimensions of the signaling scheme. The essence of the framework is a representation of the system with respect to appropriately chosen basis waveforms for the signal space that expose the inherent structure of the channel. The structure makes it possible to derive closed-form expressions for ergodic and outage capacity for a variety of transceivers and to design novel transceivers. In many cases, the analysis clearly reveals the key factors that affect system performance. We provide new capacity expressions for a variety of transceivers. In particular, by analyzing particular transceivers, we provide new expressions that bound the outage capacity performance of the multipath channel. A novelty of this work lies in being able to apply codes developed for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems and multiple antenna systems to existing code-division multiple-access-based systems.	code;downtime;ergodicity;mimo;multipath propagation;multiplexing;norm (social);sun outage;transceiver;transmitter	Ashwin Ganesan;Akbar M.

The problem of localization of MS in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment with uncooperative emitters is investigated. In our framework, a given MS must be localized, whose transmission is received on 2 base stations (BS) through AOA measurements and on a set of neighbor nodes (MS or anchors) with known positions through RSS (Radio Signal Strength) measurements. Uncooperative transmission implies that the MS transmission power is unknown. Our localization approach is then based on relative RSS measurements denoted as RSSD, combined with AOAs. For NLOS effect mitigation, we first use a selective aspect where only the best 4 RSS are considered. Second, a weighting procedure (in both range and angle) corrects at a certain level the effect of NLOS and allows its mitigation by reducing the set of possible locations of the MS. Using numerical results, we demonstrate the impact of (1) the proposed selective hybrid RSSD/AOA weighting strategy with uncooperative emitters on the accuracy of localization in mixed NLOS/LOS (line-of-sight) environment, (2) the cooperation between MS on the localization accuracy.	algorithm;angle of arrival;angularjs;cooperative mimo;line-of-sight (missile);numerical analysis;rss;simulation	Leila Gazzah;Leïla Najjar Atallah;Hichem Besbes	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289198	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;non-line-of-sight propagation;peer-to-peer	Mobile	21.214994202431814	75.09204368349768	14020

For the concatenated scheme, the outer code has redundancy and the overall transmission rate is reduced. The problem of bandwidth expansion can be overcome by two procedures. First, the code rate of inner codes is increased with a special coding design. Second, a two-level concatenated scheme is constructed to compensate the rate loss. This way, the low-complexity concatenated coded modulation schemes can be designed without bandwidth expansion as compared with the uncoded scheme.	concatenated error correction code;concatenation	S.-C.

We propose a QR decomposition-based interference alignment (QRD-IA) scheme for efficient limited feedback and investigate the conditions for the antenna configuration. We characterize the interference leakage caused by quantization error as a function of the number of feedback bits. To minimize the interference leakage, we further propose a quantized-precoder-based IA (QP-IA) scheme by modifying the proposed QRD-IA scheme. By characterizing the interference leakage of the QP-IA scheme, we investigate the number of feedback bits to maintain the degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the two-cell interfering MIMO-MAC and a feedback bit allocation algorithm to improve the sum rate. From simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed schemes can provide better sum-rate performance than the existing scheme using the same number of feedback bits, and our feedback bit allocation algorithm provides a higher sum rate compared with equal feedback bit allocation.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;feedback;interference (communication);mimo;qr decomposition;quantization (signal processing);simulation;spectral leakage	Myeong-Jin Kim;Hyun-Ho Lee;Young-Chai Ko	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2366470	input/output;electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;antenna;control theory;mathematics;interference;degrees of freedom;matrix decomposition;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.49632872809959	85.36972613616793	14036

Such decisions are highly relevant for both DSA technologies in licensed bands and for technologies coexisting in unlicensed bands. In this paper we demonstrate the benefit of risk-informed interference assessment as an effective method that aids spectrum regulators in making decisions, and readily conveys engineering insight. We apply risk assessment to a Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence study in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. Our contributions are: (i) we apply, for the first time, risk assessment to a real-life problem of inter-technology spectrum sharing; and (ii) we demonstrate that risk assessment comprehensively quantifies the effect of interference in an intuitive manner. We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations and we consider throughput degradation and fairness metrics to assess the risk of co- and adjacent channel interference for different network densities, numbers of available channels, and deployment scenarios. Our risk assessment results show that no regulatory intervention is needed to ensure harmonious technical coexistence between Wi-Fi/LTE in the unlicensed band. As an engineering insight, Wi-Fi coexists better with itself in locally dense deployments, but better with LTE in sparse deployments. For the large number of available channels typically expected in practice in the 5 GHz band, the risk of interference for Wi-Fi coexisting with LTE is negligible, rendering policy and engineering concerns largely moot.	coexist (image);compaq lte;effective method;elegant degradation;fairness measure;interference (communication);monte carlo method;real life;relevance;rendering (computer graphics);risk assessment;simulation;software deployment;sparse matrix;telecommunications link;throughput	Andra M.

In this paper, we propose a combined channel estimation in time domain and frequency domain. In time domain, the channel statistics like the channel correlation matrix can be achieved by PPS sequence, which may be used for frame synchronization in MIMO system. In frequency domain, in order to reduce the complexity of the estimator, we still apply theory of optimal rank-reduction to linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimators, This enables us to achieve performance superior to any other structure without increasing bandwidth or incorporating redundancy. The performance is presented in terms of BER and MSE, and confirms that the estimator is robust to changes in channel characteristics.	channel state information	Desheng Wang;Guangxi Zhu;Zengping Hu	2003		10.1109/PIMRC.2003.1264412	covariance matrix;time–frequency analysis;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;frame synchronization;time domain;computer science;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics	Mobile	48.907491535060736	78.41923199381345	14066

The control overhead of a routing protocol has to be minimized in order to preserve limited resources at the node. Furthermore, it is widely expected that the gateway of the sensor network will not be static in many application scenarios, but will be moving around the network. The gateway could move to collect data, or because it is not associated with a specific location, but with a specific mobile user. We study a simple protocol and consider the cost it imposes on the networks in terms of number of messages sent, or equivalently, bandwidth or power usage. We study the scaling behavior of the so-called bread crumbs (BC) protocol, and show that it is optimal in its scaling behavior in one-and two-dimensional graphs. The BC protocol is thus named as the mobile gateway leaves a trail in the network as it moves about, as Little Tom Thumb, or Hansel and Gretel do in the forest, in the well-known fairy tales. The BC protocol routes packets along the path followed by the mobile sink, taking short cuts whenever possible. We compare this protocol with the cost of routing on the shortest path from the sensor node to the mobile sink, and with the cost of flooding the network in the hope of finding the sink. We show that the path attained with the BC protocol is asymptotically optimal, and scales as the shortest path. We support the analysis with some simulations and also consider a one step diffusion extension of the bread crumbs protocol as well.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);breadboard;communications protocol;hoc (programming language);image scaling;overhead (computing);routing;sensor node;shortest path problem;simulation;streaming media;tom;the forest;whole earth 'lectronic link	Cédric Westphal	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.215	private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;asymptotic analysis;wireless sensor network;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;tunneling protocol;distributed computing;port control protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network;open shortest path first	Mobile	2.692842309402557	78.70761738401968	14068

Indoor spaces do not have line-of-sight to global navigation satellite systems and do not have a truly universal localization system to allow mobile devices to localize themselves. Previous approaches focused in using custom made hardware with several types of signals that, even though with good performance, are not feasible to adopt in a wide scale utilization. The proposed approach uses pre-existent off-the-shelf hardware and easy to handle audio signals present in our everyday lives. However, the challenges when using audible and very susceptible to multipath types of signals are many and require validation of the subjacent principles. An experiment in a real indoor environment was conducted to estimate localization while using spread spectrum noise like signals barely perceptible to people. Results demonstrated a 1.3 cm average accuracy in the center area. These and other results demonstrate the possibility of the use of audio signals with all the advantages regarding wide scale dissemination of an indoor localization solution.	acoustic cryptanalysis;emulator;internationalization and localization;line-of-sight (missile);linear programming relaxation;microphone;mobile device;modulation;multipath propagation;satellite navigation;smartphone;spectrum analyzer	João Neves Moutinho;Diamantino Freitas;Rui Esteves Araujo	2015	2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2015.45	loudspeaker;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;spread spectrum	Mobile	21.076011559832242	76.93213983781179	14069

A common rule-of-thumb is that these systems should have an order of magnitude more antennas M than scheduled users K because the users' channels are likely to be near-orthogonal when M/K 10. However, it has not been proved that this rule-of-thumb actually maximizes the SE. In this paper, we analyze how the optimal number of scheduled users K* depends on M and other system parameters. To this end, new SE expressions are derived to enable efficient system-level analysis with power control, arbitrary pilot reuse, and random user locations. The value of K* in the large-M regime is derived in closed form, while simulations are used to show what happens at finite M, in different interference scenarios, with different pilot reuse factors, and for different processing schemes. Up to half the coherence block should be dedicated to pilots and the optimal M/K is less than 10 in many cases of practical relevance. Interestingly, K* depends strongly on the processing scheme and hence it is unfair to compare different schemes using the same K.	coherence (physics);interference (communication);mimo;maximal set;relevance;simulation;spectral efficiency;transceiver	Emil Björnson;Erik G.

In this research the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for joint channel estimation and multi-user detection. For improving exploration and exploitation strengths of GA, a GA-based approach called SAM-GA is developed by incorporating the simulated annealing (SA) to mutation operation. Furthermore, a threshold-based mutation is proposed to refine the SAM-GA scheme. The resulting scheme is called modified SAM-GA for simplicity. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed modified SAM-GA scheme achieves the best performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), and convergence rate for joint CIR estimation and multi-user detection in the MC-CDMA system as compared to other schemes.	bit error rate;channel state information;committed information rate;genetic algorithm;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;rate of convergence;simulated annealing;simulation;software release life cycle;x.690	Tan-Hsu Tan;Yung-Fa Huang;Ling-Cheng Hsu;Chao-Hsin Wayne Wu	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642243	genetic algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;computer performance	Robotics	46.81090349725127	76.32232339293704	14080

However, most of them have failed to achieve an acceptable level of fairness in satisfying diverse QoS requirements in a multi-media service. On the other hand, reducing consumed power is essential today in cooperative networks. In this paper, we aim to improve fairness and reduce consumed power in a multi-user cooperative network with multi-media service. For this purpose, we propose a novel algorithm based on management of relay nodes' buffer space and the priority concept during relay selection. Simulation results certify that our algorithm outperforms previous ones in terms of system spectrum efficiency, fairness, and average consumed power.	computational complexity theory;cooperative multitasking;fairness measure;multi-user;performance per watt;quality of service;relay;requirement;selection algorithm;simulation;spectral efficiency	Farimah Mapar;Bahman Abolhassani	2012	2012 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2012.6181153	algorithm design;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	HPC	29.38536509204816	93.50599301583796	14082

The protocol cannot and does not aim to handle real-time traffic. Its central concern is to conserve battery-powered energy used for transmission, even at the expense of slower data throughput. It attempts to conserve energy expenditure by adjusting the amount of data transmitted, trying to keep it below perceived network congestion. The higher the detected congestion risk-level in the network the less it attempts to transmit, thereby minimizing the need for duplicate data retransmission due to congested routers losing packets and so on. We outline the protocol specification, mechanisms and implementation, as well as preliminary evaluation results that clearly demonstrate the energy-saving capabil ities of the protocol.	byte;communications protocol;mobile ip;network congestion;real-time computing;retransmission (data networks);throughput;women writers project	Vassilis Tsaoussidis;Hussein G.

The study compares the signaling costs of the protocols as well as the overall load for packet forwarding. Our study shows that MIFA minimizes the packet delivery cost compared to HMIP. Additionally, MIFA is more efficient when the arrival rate of the packets increases. Thus MIFA outperforms HMIP with respect to signaling cost. From the performance point of view MIFA performs similar to HMIP when the domain consists of two hierarchy levels only, and outperform HMIP otherwise. However, MIFA does not require a hierarchical network architecture as HMIP does.	authentication protocol;gfa basic;interrupt latency;mobile ip;network architecture;network packet;point of view (computer hardware company);queueing theory;real-time clock;tree network;triangular routing	Ali Diab;Andreas Mitschele-Thiel;René Böringer	2005		10.1007/11424505_2	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;authentication;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.1964706427655665	102.9853447338702	14095

Specifically, the statistic weights of the results produced by the TOA and AOA methods are dynamically varied according to the signal propagation environment. In this way the combined result can be as accurate as possible regardless of the environment. The feasibility and advantages of this hybrid TOA/AOA algorithm are verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, the implementation proposal, several practical issues, and the social impacts of the system are elaborated and analysed in details.	algorithm;angle of arrival;computer simulation;laptop;numerical analysis;smartphone;software propagation;time of arrival	Zhongli Wang;Long Zhang;Abigail S.

However, the DCF uses wireless resource ineffectively when there are many contending stations and a high bit error rate. To enhance the performance of the wireless LAN, Ki et al. proposed a Binary Negative-Exponential Backoff (BNEB) algorithm. We found that the performance of the BNEB algorithm was better than the conventional DCF. However, erroneous channel environment was not considered. In our work, we propose an analytical model for the BNEB algorithm in the presence of transmission error and compare the performance of the DCF with the BEB algorithm to that with the BNEB algorithm. From the result, the BNEB algorithm yields better performance than the DCF when the bit error rate (BER) ≤ 10−5.	algorithm;bit error rate;design rule for camera file system;exponential backoff;performance evaluation;time complexity;x.690	Bum-Gon Choi;Hyung Joo Ki;Min Young Chung;Tae-Jin Lee	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72590-9_77	real-time computing;bit error rate;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	7.121149906734414	93.41294210522885	14119

It can be seen that since the demand for Voice over IP (VoIP) over wireless network is growing, the use of VoIP over mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is expected to grow as well. However, security is a critical issue in MANETs where mobile nodes communicate with each other over relatively unreliable wireless links without any preexisting infrastructure. In this paper, we present a framework for secure voice transmission over multipath MANET. An efficient traffic allocation approach for multipath MANET is proposed in order to deliver real-time traffic over it. The proposed security mechanism was evaluated through two analyses. The correctness of the proposed mechanism was proved using Gong, Needham, and Yahalom (GNY) logic while the security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is resistant to various attacks. For the performance evaluation of the proposed framework, simulations were conducted and the results of the simulation experiments show that it is efficient and robust in terms of various performance metrics.

This offloading can be made more aggressive and robust if the macrocells leave a fraction of time/frequency resource blank, which reduces the interference to the offloaded users. We investigate the joint optimization of this technique - referred to in 3GPP as enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) via almost blank subframes (ABSs) - with offloading in this paper. Although the joint cell association and blank resource (BR) problem is nominally combinatorial, by allowing users to associate with multiple base stations (BSs), the problem becomes convex, and upper bounds the performance versus a binary association. We show both theoretically and through simulation that the optimal solution of the relaxed problem still results in an association that is mostly binary. The optimal association differs significantly when the macrocell is on or off; in particular the offloading can be much more aggressive when the resource is left blank by macro BSs. Further, we observe that jointly optimizing the offloading with BR is important. The rate gain for cell edge users (the worst 3-10%) is very large - on the order of 5-10x - versus a naive association strategy without macrocell blanking.	algorithm;biasing;convex optimization;entropy maximization;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;naive bayes classifier;network performance;semantic network;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;vertical blanking interval	Qiaoyang Ye;Mazin Al-Shalash;Constantine Caramanis;Jeffrey G.

The main resarch in sensor networks has been focused on minimizing power consumption of sensors to maximize network life time. In some critical applications, however, the most important issue is to transmit sensing information to the end user (the sink node) with reliability. Reliable information forwarding using multiple paths in sensor networks (ReInForM) can achieve desired reliability in the error-prone channel, but it needs increasing transmission overhead as the channel error rate becomes high and the number of hops between the source node and the sink node increases. In this paper, we propose reliable transmission using intermediate source nodes in sensor networks (ReTrust) to reduce packet overhead while keeping the desired reliability. Intermediate source or sink (IS) nodes between the source node and the sink node are set and they play a role as intermediate source/sink nodes. The IS nodes should be determined so that the given transmission reliability is satisfied while reducing the number of packets or multi-paths. ReTrust has been shown to provide desired reliability and reduced overhead via simulations and analysis.	algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;network packet;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation	Bo-Hyung Lee;Hyung-Wook Yoon;Jongho Park;Min Young Chung;Tae-Jin Lee	2005		10.1007/11573036_80	multipath propagation;exposed node problem;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;sensor array;packet switching;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-0.07854927277799487	76.41437092946123	14196

Received Signal Strength Indicator is a parameter which plays a major role in addressing this issue. Received Signal Strength Indicator can be obtained from the transceiver which is an indicative measure of the quality of the link established by a Wireless Sensor Network. It depends on many factors including the distance between the nodes, atmospheric variations, interference from other signal sources and transmission power. Motes designed by the manufacturers provide a built in code that displays this. However, these motes are costly and are specific to an application. So, if sensor nodes are to be designed for some specific applications, then measurement of Received Signal Strength becomes questionable. Hence, an attempt is made to estimate this through a Fuzzy Logic Controller. The proposed Received Signal Strength evaluation is based on the distance between the nodes, temperature, humidity and the transmitted power. The proposed Fuzzy logic estimator is implemented in MATLAB. To show the effectiveness of this approach, experiments are conducted in real environment using motes and the Received Signal Strength values perceived by these motes are compared with the simulated results. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposal and also ascertain the flexibity and usage of this technique in the sensor node design.	experiment;fuzzy logic;interference (communication);matlab;sensor node;transceiver	M.

44204e72e7eb04dbbf993ee1ee1495a24c51bed4	exploiting interference for energy harvesting: a survey, research issues, and challenges	tk electrical engineering electronics nuclear engineering	Interference is one of the fundamental aspects that makes wireless communication challenging, which has attracted great research attention for decades. To solve this interference problem, many interference management (IM) techniques have been developed. Nevertheless, interference can also provide some benefits to wireless networks if it is properly utilized according to the latest research advances. Wireless signal can carry information as well as energy, and thus the redundant resource of interference can be exploited using energy harvesting (EH) to provide the power to support the operation of wireless nodes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the research works of exploiting interference for wireless EH. Some fundamental aspects are first reviewed, including the receiver architecture, antenna dimension, network topology, and IM techniques, for wireless EH systems that exploit interference. Then, two IM techniques for wireless EH, beamforming optimization and interference alignment, are discussed in detail. In addition, several research issues are also presented, including the adversarial jamming signal and artificial noise for EH. Finally, some research challenges of exploiting interference for wireless EH are discussed.		Nan Zhao;Shun Zhang;Fei Richard Yu;Yunfei Chen;Arumugam Nallanathan;Victor C. M.

To this end, we first model the channel between an elevated BS and typical user equipment as a 3-D probabilistic line-of-sight channel by considering the height of BSs. Using stochastic geometry, we then derive the expression for the coverage probability of our considered UDNs. Finally, through numerical results, we show how the coverage probability can be maximized by judiciously selecting the height and the density of BSs. The results reported here provide insights into the deployment of BSs in the UDNs.	3d computer graphics;line-of-sight (missile);network performance;numerical analysis;software deployment;software propagation	Hewon Cho;Chenxi Liu;Jemin Lee;Taegyun Noh;Tony Q.

We applied the ACA to inter-cluster routing mechanism and looked for the best path from cluster heads to base station. Thanks to the algorithm, the transmission of information, for the cluster heads node away from the base station (Sink), along the best path was achieved and the energy consuming of cluster heads node was decreased. Meanwhile, not only the node residual energy, but also the distance between the cluster heads was considered for the selection of cluster heads. It resulted in the more even distribution of cluster heads. Simulation result indicates that the new algorithm has a more than 30% increase in extension of network life compared with LEACH.	algorithm;american cryptogram association;ant colony optimization algorithms;cluster analysis;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;routing;self-organization;simulation	Guifeng Wang;Yong Wang;Xiaoling Tao	2009	2009 Third International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing	10.1109/WGEC.2009.22	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;algorithm;computer network	Robotics	8.009482241791053	80.69233156247874	14274
fa84888a0ac3bab909d3bc805ddb543f7040c597	gfdm - a framework for virtual phy services in 5g networks		The next generation of wireless networks will face different challenges from new scenarios. The main contribution of this paper is to show that Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM), as a baseline of flexible circular filtered multicarrier systems, can be used as a framework to virtualize the PHY service for the upper layers of 5G networks. This framework opens the possibility to apply software-defined network principles to produce software-defined waveforms capable of addressing the requirements of future mobile networks. Hence, a block oriented concept will be used to provide the modulation service, emulating different flavors of waveforms designed to go beyond the well-established Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) principles, in scenarios where they perform best. The virtual physical layer (PHY) service opens the opportunity to have a fast and dynamic evolution of the infrastructure, as applications change over time. The presented unified modulation concept contributes with future research directions to address burst and continuous transmissions, referencing basic approaches for synchronization and advanced receiver design that can be exploited in future for the whole frame structure design and channel estimation strategies.	baseline (configuration management);centralized computing;channel state information;corner case;emulator;finite difference method;legacy system;modulation;multiplexing;network function virtualization;next-generation network;phy (chip);programming paradigm;requirement;software deployment;software-defined networking;virtual machine;waveform;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ivan Gaspar;Luciano Leonel Mendes;Maximilian Matthe;Nicola Michailow;Dan Zhang;Antonio Albertiy;Gerhard P.

Compared with the well-solved positioning issue in outdoor areas, indoor positioning is still far from being well explored, and existing techniques in this area are still far from being sufficiently mature to be widely used in practice. Recently, visible light communication based indoor positioning, also referred to as visible light based positioning, has attracted great attention and much work has been carried out, which reveals remarkable positioning accuracy. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of visible light based positioning. We first introduce some fundamental issues in visible light based positioning and further categorize existing systems in this field according to different design criteria. We then give a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art systems, and introduce how each of the systems works and discuss their merits and deficiencies. Finally, we discuss challenging issues in this area and also point out future directions.	categorization;indoor positioning system;whole earth 'lectronic link	Zhenzhen Jiao;Baoxian Zhang;Min Liu;Cheng Li	2017	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2017.1600264	distributed computing;photodiode;optoelectronics;global positioning system;visible spectrum;visible light communication;computer science;light-emitting diode;telecommunications;pulse-width modulation	Mobile	20.1020686615543	74.9160231141033	14286

Also the benefit of femtocells is found more in downlink since the traffic in downlink is several times more than in uplink. However, the femtocells share the same licensed frequency spectrum as that of the macrocell resulting in cross tier interference which degrades the downlink traffic considerably. This paper investigates a novel method for seamlessly embedding femtocells within a macrocell resource distribution framework to create a two-tier system, which incorporates a cross-tier complementary spectrum sharing known as Reverse Frequency Allocation (RFA) along with Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) strategy. The proposed scheme guarantees inter-cell orthogonality with reduced interference. It also assures a reasonably high system spectral efficiency, while providing better performance for the users especially in the downlink. Simulation results prove that this scheme can bring about higher system throughput and lower co-channel interference irrespective of the distance of the femtocell from the macrocell base station.	channel capacity;data rate units;elegant degradation;frequency allocation;interference (communication);multitier architecture;simulation;software deployment;spectral density;spectral efficiency;supercomputer education research centre;telecommunications link;throughput	Ponnu Jacob;Ashish James;A.

In particular, a secondary user (SU) in the CR network proactively predicts the future spectrum status and decides whether to keep idle, or stay in the current channel, or switch to a new channel to resume its transmission. A problem of completing a target data packet size of V bits within a predefined deadline D time slots is formulated as a discrete-time Markov decision process, in which the SU aims at minimizing its expected total cost, i.e., transmission cost, handoff cost, and overtime penalty. We solve the problem using dynamic programming, and propose a general optimal transmission with the proactive spectrum handoff (OTPH) algorithm whose complexity is 2 x |V| x D. Furthermore, we prove that for a convex penalty function, the optimal handoff-aided transmission exhibits a threshold structure. A monotone OTPH algorithm with a complexity of max(|V |, D) is used in this case. Simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves both the minimal total cost and the highest data transmission efficiency as compared with the traditional always staying and always changing schemes.	algorithm;cognitive radio;complexity;dynamic programming;markov chain;markov decision process;network packet;penalty method;simulation;superuser;monotone	Yan Wu;Qinghai Yang;Xuefang Liu;Kyung Sup Kwak	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2561936	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;sensor;computer network	Mobile	26.764181078128583	97.39226959909436	14305

In this paper, we propose a relay-assisted network cooperation scheme, through which we can achieve a reduction of energy consumption in data transmissions while ensuring the quality of service (QoS). When the traffic load is light in a network, the proposed scheme tries to switch off the base station (BS) in this network and assign the corresponding service requests to other networks. To handle these service requests, the proposed scheme selects the best neighboring users as relays to provide data transmissions for the users in the network with BS switched off. Besides, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed to solve the energy consumption minimization problem in proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can remarkably reduce the energy consumption of wireless networks.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;frequency response;mathematical optimization;quality of service;relay;simulation	Xiaofang Jie;Haili Shi;Jian Liu;Zeyang Dai	2013	2013 15th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology	10.1109/ICCT.2013.6820382	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	26.610182893446794	93.28277744434865	14314

In an effort to further improve our ns-2 simulation model for mobile WiMAX, we have implemented a selective repeat automatic retransmission request (SR-ARQ) mechanism into our model and evaluated its performance and accuracy. In this paper, we present the design and implementation methodology of the WiMAX SR-ARQ simulation model in ns-2 and discuss its accuracy via extensive simulation studies. Our evaluation clearly shows that SR-ARQ achieves increased successful packet delivery ratio and goodput, which is true for both non-saturated channels and saturated channels. In each case a cost of increased bandwidth consumption and latency overhead for received packets is also quantitatively analyzed. We believe the implementation of SR-ARQ in the ns-2 simulation model and its evaluation studies will provide profound empirical values to WiMAX field test studies.	access network;goodput;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;simulation	Michael Hempel;Wei Wang;Hamid Sharif;Ting Zhou;Puttipong Mahasukhon	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664174	real-time computing;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-1.779938971604544	91.57501733324973	14319

Downlink rate or throughput in such heterogeneous networks is a crucial metric and has been primarily studied using system level simulations. To derive the distribution of rate analytically we develop a fairly general tractable model that consists of M different RATs, each deploying up to K different classes of access points (APs), where each class differs in transmit power, path loss exponent, and deployment density. Each class of APs is modeled as an independent Poisson point process (PPP), with mobile user locations modeled as another independent PPP, all channels further consisting of i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. Using a weighted association strategy, the distribution of rate over the entire network is derived. Further, it is shown that in a two-RAT setting there exists an optimum fraction of traffic that should be associated with each RAT to maximize rate coverage, defined as the fraction of users achieving a given rate.	cobham's thesis;point process;rayleigh fading;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Sarabjot Singh;Harpreet S.

45a1c7fb2fcf2fcad2e380db8ccea6e40c619a3e	blind joint mimo channel estimation and decoding		We propose a method for MIMO decoding when CSI is unknown to both the transmitter and receiver, which works when the underlying sources are drawn from a hypercubic space. Our proposed technique fits a minimum volume parallelepiped to the received samples. This problem can be expressed as a non-convex optimization problem that empirical results suggest can be solved with high probability by gradient descent. Our blind decoding algorithm can be used when communicating over unknown MIMO wireless channels using either BPSK or MPAM modulation. We apply our technique to jointly estimate MIMO channel gain matrices and decode the underlying transmissions with only knowledge of the transmitted constellation and without the use of pilot symbols. Empirical results show small sample size requirements, making this algorithm suitable for realistically encountered block-fading channels. Our approach has a loss of less than 3 dB compared to zero-forcing with perfect CSI, imposing a similar performance penalty as space-time coding techniques with no loss of rate.		Thomas R.

As SUs spend energy for sensing licensed channels, they may choose to be inactive during a given time slot in order to save energy. Then, there exists a tradeoff between large packet delay, partially due to collisions between SUs, and high-energy consumption spent for sensing the occupation of licensed channels. To overcome this problem, we take into account packet delay and energy consumption into our framework. Due to the partial spectrum sensing, we use a Partial Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) formalism, and we analyze the existence and some properties of the Nash equilibrium using a Linear Program (LP). We identify a paradox: when licensed channels are more occupied by PUs, this may improve the spectrum utilization by SUs. Based on this observation, we propose a Stackelberg formulation of our problem where the network manager may increase the occupation of licensed channels in order to improve the SUs' average throughput. We prove the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium and we provide some simulations that validate our theoretical findings.	cognitive radio;linear algebra;linear programming;nash equilibrium;network packet;observable;semantics (computer science);simulation;throughput	Oussama Habachi;Rachid El Azouzi;Yezekael Hayel	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.032013.120559	cognitive radio;simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;mathematical economics;computer network	Mobile	32.89977488354391	95.0428464635774	14396

Some recent works considered instead a fully random (Poisson point process) BS deployment. Given that the best signal-to-interference ratio distribution can be achieved when BSs are located on a hexagonal layout, we study applying CSO to irregular network layouts with the objective of making the active BS locations as regular as possible, regardless of the irregularity of the original network layout. In this letter, we test the suitability of several CSO algorithms for this new objective; we also introduce a novel algorithm which performs very well when the number of BSs to switch off is high.	ccso nameserver;cell (microprocessor);chief security officer;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);mike lesser;point process;regular grid;software deployment;timing library format	Quoc-Nam Le-The;Tamer Beitelmal;Faraj Lagum;Sebastian S.

In this paper, we analyze the coverage performance and energy efficiency of a two tier heterogeneous network which is composed of micro tier and pico tier. With the aid of stochastic geometry tools and PPP properties, the analytical expression of success probability for each tier is derived to evaluate the tier's coverage performance how to vary with the SBS deployment density. In addition, the energy efficiency optimization question is formulated in terms of the resource allocation fairness proposed in this paper. Base on the analytical results, numerical simulations show that the effects that the SBS deployment density has on the coverage performance and energy efficiency and confirms that there exits an optimal SBS density ratio among the two tier which can be applied to maximize the energy efficiency.	complex network;computer simulation;digital subchannel;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pico;randomness;simulation;smart battery system;software deployment;throughput	Wenjie Chen;Huashan Li;Zhongfeng Li;Zhu Xiao;Dong Wang	2016	2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)	10.1109/CITS.2016.7546432	telecommunications;engineering;operations management;computer network	HPC	28.194607988690247	86.09507019013027	14456
8b597dc8297eda5884cdaa682e1b21f664252bad	a novel mobility prediction scheme for outdoor crowded scenario using fuzzy c-means		Forecasting the users movement and behavior is extremely valuable for communication networks to support the explosive mobile data in the outdoor crowded area, in the respects such as network deployment, resource allocation and mobility management. Due to the large users number and complex individual behavior, it is difficult to accurately predict the user's movement. In this paper, we take an academic campus as a study example and propose a novel mobility prediction scheme based on data mining algorithm. First, we divide the whole area into several prediction areas based on the number of mobile users, and divide the prediction time into several periods according to the scenario feature. Then, we classify the trajectories of the mobile users into groups based on Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, and discover the frequent mobility patterns in each prediction area at different periods using sequence pattern mining. Finally, we determine the group for the new user and find the most matched mobility pattern to predict its future location. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better performance compared with exiting schemes in terms of the handoff numbers and dwell time.	algorithm;cluster analysis;data mining;fuzzy cognitive map;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications network	Pengbo Yang;Xi Li;Hong Ji;Heli Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292536	software deployment;handover;mobile broadband;real-time computing;fuzzy logic;cluster analysis;computer science;mobility management;dwell time;resource allocation	Mobile	11.750018903068932	99.69352128351535	14462

Joint optimum two-stage encoding is accomplished by exhaustive search of the parent codebook of the two-stage product code. Due to the relative ease of lattice vector quantization, optimum encoding is feasible for moderate-to-large encoding rates and vector dimensions, provided the first-stage codebook size is kept reasonable. For memoryless Gaussian and Laplacian sources, encoding rates of 2 to 3 b/sample, and vector dimensions of 8 to 35 the signal-to-noise ratio performance is comparable or superior to equivalent-delay encoding results previously reported. For Gaussian sources with memory, the effectiveness of the encoding method is dependent on the feasibility of using a large enough first-stage vector quantizer codebook to exploit most of the source memory. >	vector quantization	Jianping Pan;Thomas R.

Number of primary channels is usually larger than the number of piconet members available for channel sensing. This means that at the given time only a subset of primary channels will be sensed and that information about channel state of the other channels will be inaccurate. In this paper we try to establish the dependency of the sensing error on the number of sensors (piconet members) and the number of primary channels. Results show that a number of sensors which is about one-half of the number of channels allows the sensing error to remain below 1%.	cpan;distortion;global communications conference;primary source;sensor;subject matter expert turing test;virtual channel	Jelena V.

Also, Internet spreads all over the globe, and made possible transfer large data instantly. Thereby, large scale weather sensor networks have been constructible. In this kind of sensor network, we need to consider load balancing, network redundancy, and reliability of sensor data. Using P2P technology is one of the solutions for load balancing and network redundancy. Fault detection is a method for calculating reliability of sensor data. We propose a system that can calculate reliability of sensor data. This system can install method of fault detection by plug-in. It can install and update not only existing method but also new method. In other words, this system is a sustainable fault detection system. In these days, pinpoint heavy rain is occurring frequently. In this paper, we validate a fault detection system at a pinpoint heavy rain. We consider a validation, and improve a plug-in that can be useful at a pinpoint heavy rain. We install the improved plug-in to system, and experiment it using real pinpoint heavy rain data. The result shows that our system can detect 100% of data fault at pinpoint heavy rain which occurred in August 29th, 2008.	balancing network;fault detection and isolation;internet;load balancing (computing);plug-in (computing);sensor;social infrastructure	Masato Yamanouchi;Satoshi Matsuura;Hideki Sunahara	2009	2009 Ninth Annual International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2009.58	real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Embedded	9.122836153091038	75.60785784291078	14510

The proper selection of NC coefficients and measurement matrix is investigated for this scheme. This design ensures successful reconstruction of original data with a considerably high probability and enables successful deployment of NC and CS in a real field. Moreover, in contrast to other spatio-temporal schemes with the same computational complexity, the proposed scheme possesses lower reconstruction error by employing independent encoding in each sensor node (including the cluster head nodes) and joint decoding in the sink node. In order to further reduce the reconstruction error, we construct a new optimization model of reconstruction error for the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme. A distributed algorithm is developed to iteratively determine the optimal solution. Finally, simulation results verify that the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme outperforms other two categories of compression schemes significantly in terms of recovery error and compression gain and the distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution with a fast and stable speed.

The proposed approach adopts a swarm intelligence paradigm inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocks. The main idea is to ‘guide’ packets (birds) to form flocks and flow towards the sink (global attractor), whilst trying to avoid congestion regions (obstacles). The direction of motion of a packet flock is influenced by repulsion and attraction forces between packets, as well as the field of view and the artificial magnetic field in the direction of the artificial magnetic pole (sink). The proposed approach is simple to implement at the individual node, involving minimal information exchange. In addition, it displays global self-* properties and emergent behavior, achieved collectively without explicitly programming these properties into individual packets. Performance evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed Flock-based Congestion Control (Flock-CC) mechanism in dynamically balancing the offered load by effectively exploiting available network resources and moving packets to the sink. Furthermore, Flock-CC provides graceful performance degradation in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet loss, delay and energy tax under low, high and extreme traffic loads. In addition, the proposed approach achieves robustness against failing nodes, scalability in different network sizes and outperforms typical conventional approaches.	elegant degradation;emergence;failure;flock;flocking (behavior);information exchange;network congestion;network packet;programming paradigm;scalability;swarm intelligence;while	Pavlos Antoniou;Andreas Pitsillides;Andries Petrus Engelbrecht;Tim Blackwell;Loizos Michael	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10865-5_21	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;information flow;information exchange;swarm intelligence;computer science;collective behavior;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;statistics;computer network	Mobile	4.80734792840428	81.16940488638834	14569

This paper studies LPD communication over parallel Gaussian channels, which are used to model a variety of communication scenarios. First a lower bound on the miss detection probability is derived assuming the adversary employs Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing. It is shown that at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the LPD constraint is equivalent to a constraint on the adversary's mean-square SNR. The optimal power allocation strategy that maximises the achievable number of transmitted information bits per codeword under constraints on the receiver's decoding error probability and the adversary's detection probability is analysed. Intuitively, it is shown that the optimal strategy favours channels where the receiver's noise power is low relative to that of the adversary's. Furthermore, as the block length increases, the optimal power allocation is simply a weighted version of the adversary's noise power profile, where the weights are the ratio of the adversary and receiver's noise power.	adversary (cryptography);authorization;block code;code word;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;lagrangian system;noise power;public-key cryptography;quadratic function;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Nick Letzepis	2016	MILCOM 2016 - 2016 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795309	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	Metrics	34.28862339654144	69.59244521806315	14577

The proposed ESPAR antenna is capable of mapping phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulated symbols to be transmitted onto orthogonal basis functions on the wavevector domain of the multi-element antenna (MEA), instead of the traditional approach of sending different symbol streams in different locations on the antenna domain. In this way, different symbols are transmitted simultaneously towards different angles of departure at the transmitter side. We show that the proposed system, called beamspace-MIMO (BS-MIMO) can achieve performance characteristics comparable to traditional MIMO systems while using a single radio-frequency (RF) front-end and ESPAR antenna arrays of total length equal to lambda/8, for popular PSK modulation schemes such as binary-PSK (BPSK), quaternary-PSK (QPSK), as well as for their offset-PSK and differential-PSK variations.	basis function;key (cryptography);mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;pre-shared key;radio frequency;spectral efficiency;tls-psk;transceiver;transmitter	Antonis Kalis;Constantinos B.

Meanwhile, the secondary user conducts spectrum sensing and seeks transmission opportunities in the temporarily unoccupied primary channels. In order to improve the stable throughput of secondary user, we propose a cognitive relay strategy, which suggests the secondary user to intelligently relay packets for some selected primary users in addition to sending its own packets. The criterions of selecting primary users are given in system with and without sensing errors, respectively. Numerical results show the benefits of cognitive relay strategy in terms of secondary throughput.	access network;internet relay chat;throughput	Haiyan Luo;Zhaoyang Zhang;Jianmin Zhang	2010		10.1145/1815396.1815495	telecommunications	HCI	31.952662942317104	94.78486442401986	14594

In typical deployment, the coverage areas of nearby access points (APs) usually overlap with each other to provide satisfactory coverage and seamless mobility support. Clients tend to associate (connect) to the AP with the strongest signal strength, which may lead to poor client throughput and overloaded APs. Although a number of AP association schemes have been proposed for IEEE 802.11 WLANs in the literature, the challenges brought by the new features in 802.11n have not been thoroughly studied nor the impact of legacy 802.11a/b/g clients in 802.11n WLANS on AP association. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we explore AP association for 802.11n with heterogeneous clients (802.11a/b/g/n). We first present a bi-dimensional Markov model to estimate the uplink and downlink throughput of clients and formulate AP association into an optimization problem, aiming at providing each client a bandwidth proportional to its usable data rate. Based on this Markov model, we propose an on-line AP association algorithm under the condition that each client can acquire timely information of all clients associated with nearby APs. Furthermore, for WLANs with densely deployed APs, we provide another on-line AP association algorithm with lower complexity, which takes full advantage of 802.11n transmissions by simply associating different types of clients with different APs. We have conducted extensive simulations and experiments to validate the proposed algorithms. The results show that our algorithms can significantly improve both 802.11n throughput and aggregated network throughput under various network scenarios, compared to previous AP association schemes. Our experiments also confirm the effectiveness of the algorithms in enhancing network throughput, maintaining proportional fairness among clients, and balancing load among APs.	algorithm;data rate units;experiment;fairness measure;markov chain;markov model;mathematical optimization;online and offline;optimization problem;proportionally fair;seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput;typeof;uncompressed video;wireless access point	Dawei Gong;Yuanyuan Yang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2013.156	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	23.642709231827265	91.69336518665276	14603

Numerous algorithms have been proposed, but there is a lack in methodologies to assess these algorithms, to compare them, and to determine algorithms best suited for a given networking and end-system environment and application. In this paper a methodology to assess synchronization algorithms for distributed multimedia applications is presented. The methodology is based on four Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for synchronization comprising asynchrony, synchronization error probability, synchronization delays, and buffer requirements. An analytical analysis of these parameters is performed. A key feature of this methodology is that it parameterizes the network, the end-system, and the application. Thus, it allows for the assessment of any synchronization algorithm independent from network and end-system. Influences of the infrastructure on synchronization can be determined by the proposed methodology.	algorithm;asynchronous i/o;environment variable;quality of service;requirement;synchronization (computer science);unicast;user requirements document	Christina Class;Burkhard Stiller	1998		10.1109/LCN.1998.727655	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;data synchronization;synchronization;computer network	HPC	-4.481593717274547	98.10035602855726	14637

The SUs aim at mitigating the effect of eavesdropping by changing their positions using only partial information about the locations of the eavesdroppers. Accordingly, for each SU, we propose an appropriate utility function and then maximize the social welfare of all SUs without interfering with the PUs' radio receivers and taking into account the interference thresholds set by the PUs on each channel. Given these constraints, we formulate the problem so as to optimize the social welfare of all SUs. Depending on the possible communication links and the available information, we propose three different algorithms to solve the proposed constrained optimization: first we solve the problem centrally at the BS, second we propose a decentralized game theoretic approach, and third we consider a Lagrangian-heuristic based algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralized algorithms can achieve high near-optimal performances.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;centralized computing;cognitive radio;constrained optimization;generalized assignment problem;heuristic;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;performance;secure communication;simulation;superuser;theory;transmitter;utility	Ali Houjeij;Walid Saad;Tamer Basar	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831139	games;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;information security;radio resource management;interference;computer security;wireless;computer network	AI	34.740548468606576	84.34060503198693	14655

Any message in data plan can be sent if and only if the RRC (Radio Resource Control) connection is built. Keep-alive messages are transmitted periodically, which leads to periodic establishment of RRC connections in some cases. High frequency of state transition may induce heavy burden in control channel in both UMTS and LTE network. Besides, it may also induce low efficiency in data channel in UMTS network. This paper presents a novel scheme to deal with these problems. Two new concepts, establishment probability “p” and “Rejected” state, are introduced to reduce the frequency of RRC connection establishment. Hence, the load in channels, especially in control channel, can be reduced to a low level. An analysis is developed based on queuing theory for the scheme and the performance is verified with simulations.	channel (communications);compaq lte;queueing theory;simulation;storm botnet	Hong Zhang;Kaiping Xue;Peilin Hong	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992173	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Robotics	6.225252948420725	88.27923635849889	14665

For this reason, many researchers have proposed modifications on the arithmetic operation functions required for RSA in order to thwart those attacks. However, these modifications are applied on theoretic — algorithmic level and do not necessary result in high performance RSA designs. This paper constitute the first complete attempt for an efficient design approach on a fault and simple power attack resistant RSA based on the well known, for its high performance, Montgomery multiplication algorithm. To achieve this, a fault and simple power attack resistant modular exponentiation algorithm is proposed that is based on the Montgomery modular multiplication. In order to optimize this algorithm's performance we also propose a modified version of Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm that employs value precomputation and carry save logic in all input, output and intermediate values. We introduce a hardware architecture based on the proposed Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm and use it as a building block for the design of a fault and simple power attack resistant modular exponentiation unit. This unit is optimized by taking advantage of the inherit parallelism in the proposed fault and simple power attack resistant modular exponentiation algorithm. Realizing the proposed unit in FPGA technology very advantageous results are found when compared against other well known designs even though our design bears an extra computation cost due to its fault and simple power attack resistance characteristic.	computation;cryptography;encryption;field-programmable gate array;matrix multiplication;modular exponentiation;montgomery modular multiplication;multiplication algorithm;parallel computing;precomputation;rsa (cryptosystem);theory;whole earth 'lectronic link	Apostolos P.

The estimation is performed by using a single most likely replacement (SMLR) algorithm specifically derived for complex baseband signals where a Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) model is introduced for the multipath channel. In the proposed algorithm, an interference cancelling technique is associated to the SMLR to enhance its performance. The proposed algorithm performs very well; it yields a satisfactory performance at a moderate extra computational cost compared to the SMLR	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;baseband;channel state information;computation;euler–bernoulli beam theory;interference (communication);job control (unix);multipath propagation;telecommunications link	Lahouari Fathi;Geneviève Jourdain;Marylin Arndt	2005	2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2005.1651450	code division multiple access;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;delay spread;computer network	Mobile	49.87945137618222	79.57769177551788	14701

Various communication technologies have been deployed for emergency response; however communication between different first response organizations has always been a problem. This is due to either broken networks or lack of knowledge regarding the channel frequency in use for the same device. According to recent investigations, text messaging was shown to be more reliable than voice to exchange short messages carrying critical information. Additionally, posting and updating the information on an electronic webpage accessible to all is also very useful. In addition, we would also suggest that team leaders physically stand together, thus improving network resource utilization plus ensuring receipt of updates and information from peers in the event the higher ranked person in the hierarchy is not reachable. In this paper, we present supporting arguments for the choice of a wireless mesh network as a candidate to provide communication infrastructure for emergency response. We also present a comprehensive set of technical, social and organizational challenges which we experienced first hand during several deployments, learned about in interviews with emergency responders and by examination of the after-incident reports. Many of these challenges become even more of a concern and have a greater impact on international disasters concerning multiple countries when traditionally different technologies are used often in conjunction with different languages. We also present the results of network performance analysis which identifies sources of bottleneck and overhead in communication. A distributed control hierarchical authority is necessary to prevent bottleneck and the need to cancel an already scheduled path due to resource unavailability or security breach.	bottleneck (engineering);distributed control system;electronic funds transfer;hoc (programming language);information source;instant messaging;inter-process communication;interoperability;mesh networking;network performance;overhead (computing);software deployment;testbed;ultra high frequency;unavailability;web application;web page;wireless mesh network	Raheleh B.

6012920aace7568247cfc2591cca7fc65bce7178	relay selection based hybrid rf/fso transmission over double generalized gamma channels under outdated csi and pointing errors		This paper analyzes the performance of dual-hop amplify-and-forward hybrid radio-frequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) transmissions with partial relay selection based on outdated channel state information estimates. The FSO channel modeling accounts for turbulence-induced fading, path loss, and pointing errors as well. Essential statistics of the system endto-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived in closed-form, yielding novel expressions for its cumulative distribution function and probability density function. Afterwards, novel closedform expression for the system outage probability is obtained. High SNR approximation is applied to the obtained expression, yielding simple and easily tractable results, that, additionally, offer useful insights into the system performance. The analysis is unified, applying to both types of detection techniques, i.e., intensity modulation/direct direction and heterodyne detection. Monte Carlo simulation results corroborate the proposed analysis, and provide additional insights on the system performance.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;camera serial interface;channel state information;cobham's thesis;dd (unix);downtime;end-to-end principle;heterodyne;modulation;monte carlo method;performance evaluation;portable document format;procedural reasoning system;radio frequency;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;turbulence	Gervais N.

The interaction among the SUs is considered as a learning problem, in which every SU behaves as an intelligent agent. Each SU believes that its competitors alter their future medium access strategies in proportion to its own current strategy change. These beliefs adapt in accordance with limited information exchange. In this way, each SU can obtain the behavior feature of other users through conjecture, optimize the medium access strategy, and finally achieve the goal of reciprocity, based on which two learning algorithms are proposed. We show that the SUs' stochastic behaviors and beliefs converge to a steady state under some conditions. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the two algorithms, and show that the achieved system performance gain outperforms some existing protocols.	algorithm;awareness;cognitive radio;converge;information exchange;intelligent agent;machine learning;numerical method;simulation;steady state;superuser	Xianfu Chen;Zhifeng Zhao;David Grace;Honggang Zhang	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554544	stochastic process;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-agent system	Mobile	33.12517995949634	96.45490094139603	14740

However, distributing the link state information may introduce a significant protocol overhead on network resources. In this paper, based on rate-distortion analysis, we investigate the issue on how to update the link state information efficiently and effectively. A theoretical framework is presented, and a high performance link state policy that is capable of minimizing the false blocking probability of connections under a given update rate constraint is proposed. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the proposed policy outperforms the current state of the art in terms of the update rate and false blocking probability of connections. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

fdd0422c91425089104ae48d01037050f8c87b05	study of propagation characteristics of outdoor-to-indoor channel in the 60-ghz band		The millimeter-wave frequency band (30∼300 GHz) has received significant attention. Millimeter-wave frequencies have been used for backhaul, cell communication, and other high speed communication. With the advent of 5G communication, millimeter-wave frequencies such as 60-GHz band have been attracting attention as possible candidate for next-generation wireless networks. The traditional application for 60-GHz band is point-to-point communication. Some typical scenarios have been cited in a recent 5G white paper. There exist some traditional channel models for 3G and 4G communication. However, 5G has a new channel model (the outdoor-to indoor channel model, or O2I) that has not been clearly studied. Some conventional channel measurements have been conducted for this new band. Two measurement systems in the 60-GHz band for penetration loss and small-scale measurement for different scenarios are presented. By analyzing our measurement data, we can prove that the O2I channel does not generate new paths and only add some material penetration loss.	backhaul (telecommunications);cell signaling;channel (communications);communications of the acm;frequency band;loss function;point-to-point (telecommunications);quantum fluctuation;software propagation;system of measurement;transmitter;value network analysis	Long Cheng;Wencheng Bao;Ning Liu;Guangrong Yue;Xianbing Zou;Robert Caiming Qiu	2016	Journal of Communications and Information Networks	10.1007/BF03391561	q band;electronic engineering;telecommunications	Mobile	23.48887330481111	82.86043768127364	14785

By proper mapping, we create distribution function which allows considering characteristics of a sensor node. We show the functionality of our proposed forwarding method when adapted to the energy of sensor node. We also propose enhancement in order to maximize lifetime of the sensor nodes.

Standard approaches make explicit assumptions relating to the statistical characteristics of the physical process and propagation environments which result from distributional model assumptions in a likelihood-based inference method. In contrast, we adopt an approach known in statistics as a non-parametric modeling framework which allows one to relax the number of required statistical assumptions, specifically with regard to the distributional properties of the received signal and the physical process. This is achieved via a re-formulation of the problem as a flexible non-parametric regression model via the framework of Gaussian Processes. Coupling this modeling perspective with a Bayesian optimization mechanism, we frame the global optimization objective as a sequential decision problem. We then develop an efficient algorithm to sequentially select the optimal location at which the mobile sensor should obtain observations under communication and mobility constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm at achieving accurate localization in a wireless sensor network.	algorithm;bayesian network;bayesian optimization;decision problem;gaussian process;global optimization;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;modeling perspective;multi-source;optimization mechanism;sensor;sequential algorithm;simulation;software propagation	Ido Nevat;Gareth W.

CCI cancellation algorithms by using only one receiving antenna named single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) have been under intense research. However, most of these algorithms require additional information from interfering signals. Furthermore, the orthogonality of a asynchronous interfering signal is destroyed and therefore, conventional SAIC algorithms cannot be applied. In this paper, we propose a blind SAIC algorithm named least mean square-blind joint maximum likelihood sequence estimation (LMS-BJMLSE) for asynchronous interference cancellation. The proposed LMS-BJMLSE algorithm is blind with respect to interfering signals and neither the training sequence (TS) nor pilot signal from interfering signals is needed. Its complexity is independent of channel length compared to the conventional time domain JMLSE algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed LMS-BJMLSE algorithm could greatly improve the BER performance in both synchronous and asynchronous interference conditions.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel (communications);frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;mean squared error;multiplexing;simulation;x.690	Zhenyu Zhou;Takuro Sato	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449793	single antenna interference cancellation;speech recognition;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;base station	Mobile	48.335332683225126	78.23899112652688	14823

On the other hand, Hierarchical Modulation (HM) is a means to increase the spectral efficiency of a given system by superposing an additional information stream over a basic one, by means of embedded constellations. This, in turn, results in a high resource utilization and hence overall system throughput. In this work, we model the system performance, obtained by jointly using PF with HM, for a realistic dynamic setting where users come to the system at random time epochs and leave it after a finite duration, upon the completion of their data transfers. We show that, in the presence of HM, a simple cyclic service, such as round robin, yields a better performance than PF, along with less complex implementation.	blocking (computing);channel state information;deficit round robin;embedded system;epoch (reference date);fairness measure;maxima and minima;modulation;multistage interconnection networks;nsa product types;proportionally fair;quantum superposition;rapid refresh;relay;round-robin scheduling;scenario (computing);scheduling (computing);software propagation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;superposition principle;throughput	Anis Jdidi;Tijani Chahed	2011	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2011.01.009	fairness measure;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;data transmission	Mobile	32.71532456103685	88.9085554129729	14847

It is characterized by frequent and unpredictable network partitions and intermittent connectivity. Anycast in opportunistic networks is anticipated in many application scenarios, and deserves great attention. In this paper, we propose an anycast routing algorithm in which each node is associated with a forwarding metric indicating its delivery probability to the destination anycast group and the node with lower value hands over the message to the encountered node with higher metric. The forwarding metric is determined according to historical node encounter information. We use three different forwarding metrics (variables) to guide the transmission of messages. The Group Forwarding Metric (GFM) treats the entire group as a whole, and it is defined as the probability of meeting any member in the anycast group to deliver a message. Similar to GFM, Probability Forwarding Metric (PFM) is defined as the probability of encountering at least one anycast group member, but it relies on the probability of meeting individual group members. The Distance Forwarding Metric (DFM) takes a function of the delivery probability to an anycast group member as the distance to the member. The DFM is the combination of these distances to forward messages towards the higher member density. Different metrics can be adopted for different mobile opportunistic networks based on the connectivity characteristics of the networks. We analyze the control overhead of the anycast algorithm and the message delivery delay of the routing protocol. Extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution under synthetic and realistic traces. The results show that our algorithm will significantly improve the anycast delivery performance when compared with simple routing algorithms in term of average message delivery delay and transmission overhead.	algorithm;anycast;design for manufacturability;dhrystone;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;tracing (software)	Yongping Xiong;Limin Sun;Wenbo He;Jian Ma	2010	The IEEE symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546790	routing table;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.063366025973685	84.24760544398849	14895

The objective of power allocation is to minimize the maximum MSE among all users each of which has limited transmit power. This problem is a nonlinear optimization problem. Using the Lagrange multiplier method, we derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions which are necessary for a power allocation to be optimal. Numerical results indicate that, compared to the minimum total MSE criterion, the minimax MSE criterion yields a higher total MSE but provides a fairer treatment across the users. The advantages of the minimax MSE criterion are more evident when we consider the bit error rate (BER) estimates. Numerical results show that the minimax MSE criterion yields a lower maximum BER and a lower average BER. We also observe that, with the minimax MSE criterion, some users do not transmit at full power. For comparison, with the minimum total MSE criterion, all users transmit at full power. In addition, we investigate robust joint transmitter and receiver power allocation where the channel state information (CSI) is not perfect. The CSI error is assumed to be unknown but bounded by a deterministic value. This problem is formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. Numerical results show that, with imperfect CSI, the minimax MSE criterion also outperforms the minimum total MSE criterion in terms of the maximum and average BERs.	minimax;transmitter	Chirawat Kotchasarn;Poompat Saengudomlert	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.6.1970	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;robust optimization;control theory;mathematics;lagrange multiplier;semidefinite programming	Vision	36.7336427905354	88.46739430685312	14904

As the primary example of the effectiveness of the techniques introduced here we present a receiver for the emergent 10 GBASE-LRM standard for 10 Gb/s Ethernet over multimode optical fibers [1]. We show that an MLSE receiver provides an advantage of at least 2 dB over other receivers, such as the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), on 99% of the local area network (LAN) multimode fiber population, as modeled by a database proposed by the IEEE 802.3aq Task Force [2]. The paper deals with both theoretical and practical aspects of the architecture. To enable the complete integration of this receiver as a single chip in current 90 nm CMOS technology, we propose the parallel-processing digital implementation of a feedforward equalizer (FFE) and a Viterbi decoder together with an interleaved front-end analog to digital converter (ADC). The MIMO structure jointly compensates for fundamental channel impairments such as multimode dispersion, and implementation-related effects such as the limitations of the analog front end (AFE), particularly the one known as fixed-pattern noise (FPN) [3]. As a result of the high speed operation, FPN has a major impact on performance. We show that, without compensation, FPN could result in a degradation of 7.86 dB. With the compensation proposed here, the latter is reduced to 0.23 dB.	analog front-end;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;computer performance;data rate units;elegant degradation;emergence;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;feedforward neural network;filtered-popping recursive transition network;fixed-pattern noise;gigabyte;incremental funding methodology;learning relationship management;mimo;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;modal dispersion;optical fiber;viterbi decoder	Diego E.

Both analytical and simulation results illustrate the major impact or localization errors on the protocol goodput and route discovery energy. The performance metrics observed were the packet delivery ratio and the power consumed at a node for routing. It is shown that significant performance deterioration occurs with location errors as low as 20% of a node's radio range with no other obstacles in the network. To counteract this degradation, an enhancement is proposed that increases the error tolerance to about 40% radio range and in addition improves the performance consistently for any location error. Furthermore, the effect of obstacles in conjunction with location errors on the routing performance is also investigated.	elegant degradation;error-tolerant design;flood fill;geographic routing;goodput;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;network packet;planarization;simulation	Rahul C.

Despite this fact, most of previously proposed medium access control (MAC) protocols for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) were designed while ignoring the effects of ACI (assuming ideal filtering). The effect of ACI can be reduced by introducing guard bands (GBs). However, this solution comes at the expense of degrading spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we develop an efficient GB-aware MAC protocol that attempts at maximizing network throughput while improving fairness in CRNs. Unlike most of previously proposed GB-aware MAC protocols that perform channel assignment sequentially, our MAC performs the channel assignment for multiple CR links simultaneously (the so-called batch method). Batching enables concurrent channel assignment for multiple CR links, which consequently allows for concurrent data transmissions. Batching can be realized by introducing an admission control phase for CR users to share their control information. The batch method can effectively provide distributed decisions that achieve better throughput while reducing the number of GBs. Our MAC also allows the CR users to utilize the reserved GBs of primary networks under predefined FCC power constraints. Simulation results indicate that our protocol achieves significant performance improvement compared to previous GB-aware protocols.	access control;assignment (computer science);catastrophic interference;channel bonding;cognitive network;cognitive radio;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme;simulation;spectral efficiency;stochastic optimization;stochastic process;throughput;time complexity;uncompressed video	Haythem Bany Salameh;Hadi Kasasbeh;Bassam Harb	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2523509	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	31.925301263933097	90.86637827969632	14994
46d149dba4ffd45b4dcd07a4cac6849067cd0c9d	joint offloading and resource allocation for computation and communication in mobile cloud with computing access point		We consider a general multi-user mobile cloud computing system with a computing access point (CAP), where each mobile user has multiple independent tasks that may be processed locally, at the CAP, or at a remote cloud server. The CAP serves both as the network access gateway and a computation service provider to the mobile users. We aim to jointly optimize the offloading decisions of all users' tasks as well as the allocation of computation and communication resources, to minimize the overall cost of energy, computation, and delay for all users. This problem is NP-hard in general. We propose an efficient three-step algorithm comprising of semidefinite relaxation (SDR), alternating optimization (AO), and sequential tuning (ST). It is shown to always compute a locally optimal solution, and give nearly optimal performance under a wide range of parameter settings. Through evaluating the performance of different combinations of the three components of this SDR-AO-ST algorithm, we provide insights into their roles and contributions in the overall solution. We further compare the performance of SDR-AO-ST against a lower bound to the minimum cost, purely local processing, purely cloud processing, and hybrid local-cloud processing without using the CAP. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the joint management of computation and communication resources in mobile cloud computing systems with a CAP.	access network;algorithm;ambient occlusion;computation;etsi satellite digital radio;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;local optimum;mathematical optimization;mobile cloud computing;multi-user;np-hardness;numerical analysis;server (computing);virtual private server;wireless access point	Meng-Hsi Chen;Ben Liang;Min Dong	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057150	computer network;mobile cloud computing;distributed computing;cloud computing;computer science;computation;default gateway;access network;real-time computing;mobile computing;server;resource allocation	HPC	31.090615856708002	92.03037975973392	14999

However, with the increasing pervasiveness of optical networking and the occasional trend toward using over-provisioning as the solution to congestion, a router's processor also becomes a critical resource to which, ideally speaking, all competing flows should have fair access. For example, if the network is not fair in allocating processing resources, denial of service attacks based on an excessive use of the router processor (such as by using unnecessary optional headers) become possible. In this paper, we investigate the issue of achieving fairness in the joint allocation of the processing and bandwidth resources. We first present a simple but powerful general principle for defining fairness in such systems based on any of the classic notions of fairness such as max-min fairness, proportional fairness and utility max-min fairness defined for a single resource. We apply our principle to a system with a shared processor and a shared link with max-min fairness as the desired goal. We then propose a practical and provably fair packet-by-packet algorithm for the joint allocation of processing and bandwidth resources. We demonstrate the fairness achieved by our algorithm through simulation results using real gateway traffic traces. The principles and the algorithm detailed in this paper may also be applied in the allocation of other kinds of resources such as power, a critical resource in mobile systems.	algorithm;denial-of-service attack;fairness measure;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;network congestion;network packet;proportionally fair;provisioning;router (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Yunkai Zhou;Harish Sethu	2003		10.1007/3-540-44884-5_6	fairness measure;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;maximum throughput scheduling;fair queuing;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Metrics	3.15683032385054	103.03373824802976	15012

Due to the lower cost, less energy consumption and CO2 emission of RSs comparing with those of Base Stations (BSs), the relay-based wireless access networks are also appealing to infrastructure operators. In this paper, we focus on the problem of RS site planning, which is a critical task of network planning and deployment to achieve an efficient and scalable network environment. An optimization framework is developed to minimize the total cost of RSs as well as meet the minimal traffic demand for each SS. The problem of joint RS placement and bandwidth allocation is formulated into an mixed integer nonlinear program. We resort to an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to yield optimal or near-optimal solutions. Simulation results show that our approach is fairly effective and robust to different scenarios of the RS site planning problem.	access network;genetic algorithm;internet relay chat;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;network planning and design;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;reed–solomon error correction;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software release life cycle;throughput;wireless access point	Bin Lin;Lin Lin	2011	2011 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR)	10.1109/SoCPaR.2011.6089134	genetic algorithm;integer programming;telecommunications;nonlinear programming;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Robotics	25.3437677314234	93.64305822740685	15047

Although the good performance of QCN has been validated in many experiments, we find that QCN has two drawbacks. First, the incomplete binary search in QCN fails to find the proper sending rate, leading to complicate supplement mechanisms. Second, in face of unknown network environment, the rate setting of QCN is inconsistent. Consequently, QCN spends much time on acquiring the spare bandwidth. To address theses problems, we propose the Fast and Simple QCN (FSQCN), following the same framework as QCN. FSQCN complements the binary search and removes other complicate supplement mechanisms in QCN. Thus, FSQCN is much simpler than QCN. Moreover, FSQCN resets the sending rate to the link rate explicitly when the switch detects spare bandwidth. Extensive simulations validate that FSQCN controls the queue length well like QCN and responds faster than QCN.	data center bridging;network congestion	Chang Ruan;Jianxing Wang;Wanchun Jiang	2016		10.1109/ICDCS.2016.64	face;communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;distributed database;computer security;bandwidth;computer network	ML	-4.362529416427036	91.10152047240157	15081

Typical applications include, but are not limited to, noise and air pollution detections, people gathering, even disaster prediction. Given this problem, although many existing centralized solutions are effective and widely used, they usually cause heavy communication overhead. Thus, it is strongly desired to design distributed solutions to reduce energy consumption, while achieving a high level of detection accuracy with limited sensing task budget. In this paper, we first present two novel centralized detection algorithms as the performance benchmark, which make use of the Minimum Cut theory and support vector machine (SVM)-based pattern recognition techniques. Then, we introduce a novel distributed and energy-efficient event detection framework under task budget constraint, where we formulate an optimization problem and derive an optimal utility function. Finally, based on a real trace-driven data set in an urban area of Beijing, extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;computational complexity theory;distributed algorithm;high-level programming language;mathematical optimization;minimum cut;noise (electronics);optimization problem;overhead (computing);participatory sensing;pattern recognition;sensor;simulation;smart device;support vector machine;utility	Chi Harold Liu;Jianxin R.

A scheduling scheme that satisfies QoS requirements has become more important for wireless communications. We propose a downlink scheduling scheme called adaptive priority-based downlink scheduling (APDS) for providing QoS guarantees in IEEE 802.16 networks. APDS comprises two major components: Priority assignment and resource allocation. Different service-type connections primarily depend on their QoS requirements to adjust priority assignments and dispatch bandwidth resources dynamically. We consider both starvation avoidance and resource management. Simulation results show that our APDS methodology outperforms the representative scheduling approaches in QoS satisfaction and maintains fairness in starvation prevention.	dynamic dispatch;fairness measure;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link	Shih-Jung Wu;Shih-Yi Huang;Kuo-Feng Huang	2012	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2012.00035	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;deadline-monotonic scheduling;distributed computing;bandwidth;wireless;computer network	Embedded	4.591488162650168	96.67981482262529	15115

The channel study is based on the narrowband measurements at 2.11 GHz in Manhattan, New York with 16 transmitting antennas and 16 receiving antennas. Doppler spread and angle of arrival (AOA) are derived from the temporal correlation of field components. The results show that the AOA at the mobile is not uniformly distributed. The restricted AOA distribution results in approximately twice the correlation distance and correlation time than the predicted values from the Jakes (1974) model. The measured median coherence time is at least a few seconds for stationary channels, and 90 ms at a mobile pedestrian speed of 3 km/hr. These observations hold for both vertically and horizontally polarized antennas. The measured median RMS angular spread at the mobile is 22.5/spl deg/ for horizontally polarized antennas and 25.5/spl deg/ for vertically polarized antennas.	mimo	Hao Xu;M. J.

d53b279db08c0b558f876d0b2e1fd1dc4de9e040	an improved smurf scheme for cleaning rfid data		With the increasing usage of Internet of Things’ devices, our daily life is facing Big Data. RFID technology enables the reading over a long distance, provides high storage capacity and is widely used in the Internet of Things environmental supply chain management for object tracking and tracing. With the expansion of the RFID technology application areas, the demand for reliability of business data is increasingly important. In order to fulfil the needs of upper applications, data cleaning is essential and directly affects the correctness and completeness of the business data, so it needs to filter and handle RFID data. The traditional statistical smoothing for unreliable RFID data (SMURF) algorithm dynamically adjusts the size of window according to tags’ average reading rate of sliding window during the process of data cleaning. To some extent, SMURF overcomes the disadvantages of fixed sliding window size; however, SMURF algorithm is only aimed at constant speed data flow in ideal situations. In this paper, we overcome the shortage of SMURF algorithm, and an improved SMURF scheme in two aspects is proposed. The first one is based on dynamic tags, and the second one is the RFID data cleaning framework, which considers the influence of data redundancy. The experiments verify that the improved scheme is reasonable in dynamic settings of sliding window, and the accuracy of cleaning effect is improved as well.

b3b917f7411576aa2d129e122f95b0d7a8eac561	a connection entropy-based multi-rate routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks	routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network	This paper introduces a new approach to modeling relative distance among nodes under a variety of communication rates, due to node’s mobility in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). When mobile nodes move to another location, the relative distance of communicating nodes will directly affect the data rate of transmission. The larger the distance between two communicating nodes is, the lower the rate that they can use for transferring data will be. The connection certainty of a link also changes because a node may move closer to or farther away out of the communication range of other nodes. Therefore, the stability of a route is related to connection entropy. Taking into account these issues, this paper proposes a new routing metric for MANETs. The new metric considers both link weight and route stability based on connection entropy. The problem of determining the best route is subsequently formulated as the minimization of an object function formed as a linear combination of the link weight and the connection uncertainty of that link. The simulation results show that the proposed routing metric improves end-to-end throughput and reduces the percentage of link breakages and route reparations.	data rate units;end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);metrics (networking);routing;simulation;throughput	Cao Trong Hieu;Choong Seon Hong	2010	JCSE		wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.094388036021224	83.18896011403893	15137
3f5948af39dc50e84d7f649563b22834ff05ad23	genetic algorithm based fault tolerant clustering in wireless sensor network		In wireless sensor network (WSN), during fault detection and recovery, average energy loss, and message loss occurs including the link failure. Also, the number of faulty nodes and the traffic overhead is increased with the size of WSN. In order to overcome this issue, in this study, a cluster-based fault tolerance technique using genetic algorithm is proposed. Here the network is clustered according to energy-efficient distance-based clustering algorithm. For each cluster head, a set of backup nodes are selected using genetic algorithm based on the sponsored coverage and residual energy parameters. This helps in detecting the faults occurring in cluster members and cluster heads. Simulation results show that the proposed technique minimises the energy loss and overhead.	backup;cluster analysis;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;genetic algorithm;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation	Kasilingam Rajeswari;Subbu Neduncheliyan	2017	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2016.1074	brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	8.50692873548501	80.13374923333863	15162

Three adaptive multicast wormhole routing strategies are proposed and evaluated. The methods include minimal partially adaptive, minimal fully adaptive, and nonminimal adaptive routing. All the algorithms are shown to be deadlock-free. A study has been conducted that compares the performance of these multicast algorithms. The results show that the minimal fully adaptive routing method creates the least traffic; however, double vertical channels are required in order to avoid deadlock. The nonminimal routing algorithm exhibits the best adaptivity, although it creates more network traffic than the other methods.	mesh networking;multicast;routing;wormhole switching	Xiaola Lin;Philip K.

09e43a9bade54a2423e2ba91c9e2aa3dbfeb3e41	a rapid convergent max-sinr algorithm for interference alignment based on principle direction search	low complexity;rapid convergence;interference alignment;max sinr	The maximal signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (Max-SINR) algorithm for interference alignment (IA) has received considerable attention for its high sum rate achievement in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel. However, its complexity may increase dramatically when the number of users approaches the IA feasibility bound, and the number of iterations and computational time may become unacceptable. In this paper, we study the properties of the Max-SINR algorithm thoroughly by presenting theoretical insight into the algorithm and by providing the potential of reducing the overall computational cost. Furthermore, a novel IA algorithm based on the principle direction search is proposed, which can converge more rapidly than the conventional Max-SINR method. In the proposed algorithm, it searches along the principle direction, which is found to approximately point to the convergence values, and can approach the convergence solutions rapidly. In addition, the closed-form solution of the optimal step size can be formulated in the sense of minimal interference leakage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional minimal interference leakage and Max-SINR algorithms in terms of the convergence rate while guaranteeing the high throughput of IA networks.	algorithm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;statistical interference	Zhilu Wu;Lihui Jiang;Guanghui Ren;Gangyi Wang;Nan Zhao;Yaqin Zhao	2015	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2015.05.012	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science	Vision	38.865879676610916	91.45817759632583	15186
b7d19e3cbdc5600bfcf9384c5d71530075b47da2	wireless barcodes for tagging infrastructure	terahertz;barcodes;propagation	There are numerous scenarios where embedding static information into objects would prove to be very useful. For example, by embedding navigation information into the road surface we could enable driverless cars, similarly embedding information into major infrastructure such as building walls would enable easier classification of debris, and so forth. The key requirement is that the embedded information should survive as long as the infrastructure itself. We discuss the concept of wireless barcodes that allow us to achieve exactly this goal of tagging infrastructure. The barcodes are designed to be read at terahertz frequencies that allows good packing of information (bits/m). We use a TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) technique to read the barcodes which provides robustness to wear and tear of the surface. This paper reports on the results of an experimental study that examines the challenges in building such barcodes and demonstrates the idea by constructing such a barcode.	autonomous car;barcode;embedded system;experiment;ibm notes;multilateration;set packing	Farnoosh Moshir;Suresh Singh	2014		10.1145/2639108.2639125	terahertz radiation;computer security	Mobile	19.39281041455039	70.5391830246114	15187

In this paper, we present a new routing protocol called Self-selection Based Adaptive Routing (SBAR), which is improved from the SSR protocol by using slot back-off delay time, adding Expanding Ring Search mechanism, and designing an adaptive back-off delay time formula. Experimental results on ns-2 shows that the SBAR can reduce packet collision rate, provide higher available bandwidth and low end to end delay of data.	algorithm;autonomous robot;collision domain;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);routing	Hongpeng Wang;Zhongqiu Li	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.580	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	EDA	1.5109098288713045	83.79698311643	15196

This extends the Kolmogorov 2-capacity to packing sets of overlap at most δ. For δ = 0, a previous lower bound on the 2ε-capacity is recovered, and an improved version of the upper bound is derived. For δ > 0 new bounds are obtained, and a notion of deterministic error exponent is introduced, that depends only on the transmission rate, the bandwidth, and the signal to noise ratio. The functional form of upper and lower bounds indicates that in both Kolmogorov and Shannon's settings capacity grows linearly with the number of degrees of freedom, but only logarithmically with the signal to noise ratio. This basic information-theoretic insight transcends the details of the stochastic or deterministic description of the communication model.	bandlimiting;error exponent;higher-order function;information theory;kolmogorov complexity;set packing;shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Taehyung J.

Unlike most previous similar work which concentrated on transmit correlation only and pair-wise error probability (PEP) metrics, the precoder is designed to minimize the exact symbol error rate (SER) as a function of the channel correlation coefficients, which are fed back to the transmitter, and the correlation may or may not follow the so-called Kronecker structure. The proposed method can handle general propagation settings including those arising from a cooperative macro-diversity (multi-base) scenario. We present two algorithms. The first is suboptimal, but provides a simple closed-form precoder that handles the case of uncorrelated transmitters, correlated receivers. The second is a fast-converging numerical optimization which covers the general case. The results show the SER based precoder has small gains over the PEP based precoder for moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Several properties of the minimum SER precoder are given.	algorithm;code;coefficient;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;transmitter	Are Hjørungnes;David Gesbert	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

dd5d1f181753d711db5206949a91e6344e56669a	propagation-model-free coverage evaluation via machine learning for future 5g networks		As densification and heterogeneity are the promising trends of future mobile networks, deployment of base stations (BSs) becomes increasingly difficult due to the laborious procedures of alternating optimization between field measurements and coverage evaluation via propagation models. In this paper, we present a coverage evaluation tool based on machine learning (ML) which is free from propagation model. In particular, received signal strengths (RSSs) reported by users and factors that affect the transmitted signal, such as distance, geography and configuration parameters of BS, are collected and used to train a classifier which allows to predict the RSS at the user side. In this way, the complicated procedures to obtain propagation model can be skipped, which reduces the great cost in coverage evaluation. Moreover, in order to acquire better prediction performance, hyper-parameters optimization is performed via exhaustive grid search methods in each learning algorithm. Simulations are conducted by using vast real-world data for a better training result. We also compare the performance by means of different machine learning algorithms and the numerical results show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other classifiers in terms of prediction accuracy, which is up to 86.7%.

This scheme performs only binary (XOR) operations and involves a network of queues, along with special rules for coding and moving packets among the queues, that ensure instantaneous decodability. Additionally, for the scheme to work, one has to specify which packets to select for encoding at each time, based on the received feedback. Contrary to prior work where this packet selection was explicitly specified a priori, we employ a backpressure-type policy that makes the selection based only on queue backlogs. We next provide a stability region outer bound for arbitrary and erasure patterns and show that this bound effectively coincides with a bound on the system's information-theoretic capacity region (accounting for idle slots). Finally, for and i.i.d. erasures, we provide a policy that achieves the stability outer bound and employs the proposed XOR scheme using a restricted set of coding rules.	acknowledgement (data networks);binary erasure channel;exclusive or;feedback;information theory;linear network coding;network packet;programming style;transmitter;unicast	Sophia Athanasiadou;Marios Gatzianas;Leonidas Georgiadis;Leandros Tassiulas	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2014.2366435	broadcast radiation;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.80472105462622	68.60126449441715	15210

However, with the proliferation and diversification of wireless services, there have been urgent needs in fine-grained and decoupled security metrics towards future mobile communications. In this paper, we propose a statistical model to characterize the finegrained security level, while evaluating the secrecy independently from the reliability. Specifically, we model the data eavesdropping process by a queuing system, where the data arrival represents the information overheard by the eavesdropper. The departure process is modeled by a constant leaving rate, implying that the eavesdropped data will become useless after certain time. The eavesdropper has to accumulate sufficient amount of data for successful decipherment. We further define the novel statistical security metric via a queue-length bound and a bound-violation probability threshold. As long as the violation probability is below the specified threshold, the statistical security is guaranteed. This model can fit diverse services well by tuning corresponding parameters for the statistical security metric. Following the statistical security model, we formulate the security-driven power adaptation problem for throughput maximization over fading channels. Applying asymptotic queuing analyses and effective bandwidth theory, we solve the problem and obtain a set of power control schemes under diverse system parameters. Simulation evaluations are also presented to demonstrate the superiority of our scheme over the baseline schemes.	baseline (configuration management);decipherment;diversification (finance);entropy maximization;information-theoretic security;simulation;statistical model;throughput	Qinghe Du;Li Sun;Pinyi Ren;Yichen Wang	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341246	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	31.345051425500593	75.56023309264351	15211

MR-WMNs allow the supported mesh clients (MCs) to access the Internet gateway by multi-hop packet forwarding over the mesh routers (MRs), which can be equipped with multiple radio interfaces. In such a scenario, the routing protocol should (i) decide the address of the next-hop node and the radio-interface to be used for each transmission and (ii) exploit the presence of multiple paths between the MCs and the Internet gateways. To address these issues, we propose a cross-layer architecture that comprises a novel joint multi-path routing and channel allocation scheme for MR-WMNs. During the route setup, multiple node-disjoint paths are discovered and channel allocation is performed so that nodes on different paths, but within the same interference domain, transmit on different channels. Moreover, we propose a load-balancing scheme, which allows to distribute traffic among the available node- and channel-disjoint paths. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the end-to-end delay and enhances the system good put significantly over several network topologies and under different traffic workloads.	end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;gateway (telecommunications);interference (communication);internet access;load balancing (computing);mesh networking;multipath routing;network packet;network topology;router (computing);simulation;wireless mesh network	Luciano Bononi;Marco Di Felice;Antonella Molinaro;Sara Pizzi	2009	2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops	10.1109/ICDCSW.2009.42	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;shared mesh;modeling and simulation;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.5730903118508002	84.82629699749339	15229

Several competing algorithms have appeared that make use of this mode to minimize energy consumption with little disruption to the traffic. Two algorithms stand out among those because of their simplicity and performance: frame transmission and burst transmission. Although these algorithms have been shown to be very efficient in simulated scenarios, there is a lack of general analytical models for their behavior. In fact, to this date, the only analyzed traffic patterns have been variants of Poisson traffic. In this paper we provide a general GI/G/1 model for energy consumption and traffic delay for both algorithms. We then develop specializations of the general model for Poisson and deterministic traffic. Finally, we validate the model with the help of both synthetic traffic and real Internet traffic traces.	algorithm;burst transmission;correctness (computer science);denial-of-service attack;gigabyte;network packet;simulation;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software)	Sergio Herrería-Alonso;Miguel Rodríguez-Pérez;Manuel Fernández-Veiga;Cándido López-García	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081512.120089	traffic generation model;local area network;real-time computing;the internet;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;10g-epon;computer network	Metrics	-2.8928735287394622	92.60884257371862	15245

However, no framework for multicarrier-based broadband systems, such as MC-CDMA (Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access) or OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) is available, from the perspective of link capacity. This paper presents a handover technique, referred to as semi-soft handover utilizing macro diversity, which permits both hard and soft handover advantages for services over multicarrier-based broadband networks to be retained. A theoretical analysis is then performed to measure the handover gain over the forward link in terms of an outage probability. The simulation data verifies that the semi-soft handover outperforms other traditional handover techniques, in particular, for high data rate services.	data rate units;downtime;quality of service;semiconductor industry;simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications network	Hyungkeuk Lee;Hyukmin Son	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394392	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;handover;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	29.26049945650545	87.49297821110598	15258

These devices should be small in size and have a characteristic of extremely low power consumption. Therefore, in 2004, IEEE802.15.4 has been established as a global standard satisfying low power and low cost. After that, the phenomenal popularity of this standard has also led to the indiscreet deployment of WPANs. Therefore, LR-WPANs sometimes suffer from several types of collisions. In spite of being able to avoid data packets colliding with each other by using CSMA/CA, the risk of beacon collisions still remains. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel dynamic channel management scheme using MDS (multi-dimensional scheduling). By using a newly proposed scan method, MDS can find the new clean channel to change and time offset to transmit a new beacon frame. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme through simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can minimize the possibility of beacon collisions by efficiently managing the multiple available channels in a hybrid manner combining proactive and reactive methods while the dissipated power consumption of PAN coordinator that uses MDS is more than that of PC that use IEEE 802.15.4.	frame (networking);image scanner;lr parser;microelectromechanical systems;microprocessor;network packet;prospective search;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment	Jin-Woo Kim;Jihoon Kim;Doo Seop Eom	2008	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2008.4560105	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;technology management;operating system;computer network	Mobile	9.252094648301233	83.9890076419401	15273

All these features have an impact on the temporal properties of interference which is often neglected. In this paper, we show how to incorporate correlated user mobility into the interference and outage correlation models. We use the random waypoint mobility model over a bounded one-dimensional domain as an example model inducing correlation, and we calculate its displacement law at different locations. Based on that, we illustrate that the temporal correlations of interference and outage are location-dependent, being lower close to the center of the domain, where the level of mobility is higher than near the boundary. Close to the boundary, more time is also needed to see uncorrelated interference. Our findings suggest that an accurate description of the mobility pattern is important, because it leads to more accurate understanding/modeling of interference and receiver performance.

Anycast is a one-to-one-of-many delivery technique that allows a client to choose a content server of a set of replicated servers. We formulate an optimization problem of anycast flows assignment in a connection-oriented network, which is 0/1 and NP-complete. Thus, we propose a new effective heuristic algorithm based on Lagrangean relaxation technique. To our best survey, this is the first study that applies the Lagrangean relaxation to anycast flow problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by making a comparison with its counterpart using a sample network topology and different scenarios of traffic demand patterns and replica location. Obtained results show advantage of the Lagrangean heuristic over a previously proposed algorithm.

Most research work in space-time coding, however, assumed that the symbol timing at the receiver is perfectly known. In practice, this has to be estimated with high accuracy. In this paper, two symbol timing recovery algorithms for space-time coding systems are proposed. The first one is based on orthogonal training sequences and approximated log likelihood function. It is an improvement of a previous symbol timing synchronization algorithm in that high estimation accuracy can be achieved even when the over sampling factor is small. The second one employs the squaring algorithm. It offers good performance and does not require training sequences.	carrier recovery	Yik-Chung Wu;Shing-Chow Chan	2003		10.1109/WCNC.2003.1200386	real-time computing;information engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;likelihood function;space–time code;statistics	HCI	50.68917794850796	76.71305089057749	15350

We first develop an approach to channel estimation which is crucial for the decoding of the transmitted data. We then discuss the implementation of the proposed method for WiMax systems under various channel conditions. The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated through the simulation of the MIMO-OFDM system for two and four transmit antennas and different number of receive antennas. The Space-Time Coding with 192 information subcarriers per codeword is used as defined in the WiMax standard. Through simulations, it is shown that the proposed method has between 1.5 dB and 2dB loss compared to the ideal case where the channel coefficients are known at the receiver. In summary, with the proposed channel estimation technique, combining diversity using Space-Time Codes with OFDM is proved to be a promising technique for the present and future wireless communications.	algorithm;channel state information;code word;coefficient;computation;computer simulation;decibel;download;frame (networking);mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;subcarrier	Fabien Delestre;Yichuang Sun	2010	2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications	10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645005	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;space–time code;precoding;computer network;mimo	Mobile	44.27677126975476	80.0398182828243	15376
93a516aa86fded13fcceb851aeb26f08df7aeabe	saturation throughput analysis of an asymmetric full-duplex mac protocol in wlans with hidden terminals		The wireless in-band full-duplex technique enables wireless nodes to transmit and receive in the same channel simultaneously. To fully and effectively leverage this capability of the IBFD technique, new full-duplex medium access control (FD MAC) protocols that accommodate the features of the IBFD technique must be designed and analyzed. In this paper, we first propose an asymmetric FD MAC protocol, and then we develop an analytical model for the proposed protocol to evaluate the saturation throughput performance of wireless local area networks in the presence of hidden terminals. In the proposed protocol, asymmetric full-duplex transmissions can be established with the access point (AP) and two stations that hidden from each other. Thus, the well-known interstation interference problem in asymmetric full-duplex transmissions can be overcome. In the developed model, we adopt the stationary distribution of the backoff counter values at the beginning of a generic transmission to characterize the behavior of a node. The saturation throughput is then derived based on the stationary distribution. The accuracy of the proposed analytical model is verified through simulations. Using the proposed analytical model, the saturation throughput performance of the FD MAC protocols is studied with respect to different numbers of stations in each region and the minimum contention windows. In addition, the effects of hidden terminals on performance are thoroughly investigated, since the hidden terminals play an important role in the saturation throughput. Moreover, we compare the saturation throughput performance between symmetric and asymmetric FD MAC protocols to demonstrate the gains provided by asymmetric full-duplex transmissions.

To improve system throughput, a scheduling algorithm is necessary to choose a subset of links at each time slot for data transmission. Throughput optimal link scheduling discipline in such a wireless network is generally an NPhard problem. In this paper, we develop a polynomial time algorithm for link scheduling problem provided that network conflict graph is line multigraph. (i.e., line graph for which its root graph is multigraph). This result can be a guideline for network designers to plan the topology of a stationary wireless network such that the required conditions hold and then the throughout optimal algorithm can be run in a much less time.	algorithm;forbidden graph characterization;interference (communication);line graph;motif window manager;multigraph;np-hardness;p (complexity);polynomial;scheduling (computing);serializability;stationary process;throughput;topology control;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ali Ghiasian;Behnaz Omoomi;Hossein Saidi	2012	CoRR		fair-share scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;maximum throughput scheduling;round-robin scheduling;proportionally fair	Mobile	16.573646333441495	92.01352290257701	15425

More importantly, the proposed FDAF scheme is capable of attaining a multiuser performance, which is bett er than that of the conventional single-user TD-AF protocol operating i n a multipath environment, because of the subband-based AF and noise supp ression capability of the relay.	anisotropic filtering;bett;carrier frequency;etsi satellite digital radio;multi-user;multipath propagation;relay;simulation;telecommunications link;iversity	Jiayi Zhang;Lie-Liang Yang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378760	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;cooperative diversity;frequency domain;statistics	Mobile	42.94493863000132	80.29246778012676	15426

This guard interval consists of a redundant prefix cyclically appended to each block of modulated symbols so as to exploit the cyclic convolution property of the DFT. Therefore, besides decreasing the useful transmitted symbol rate, this technique is very specific to DFT-based OFDM systems. In order to implement a digital modulator, an oversampled version of the continuous signal that would be produced by the all-analog ideal modulator is often computed. This amounts to appending null symbols to the block of symbols to be modulated. This work shows that forcing the presence of these null symbols at the appropriate places on the receiver side is sufficient to equalize the channel. Here, a linear equalizer is adapted by minimizing a quadratic criterion based on the energy of the subband signals that should be zero. Since no knowledge about the useful data is required, this method performs blind equalization. Moreover, it requires neither a guard interval nor any reference symbol. As a result, for a given channel bitrate budget, the data rate is increased.	blind equalization;least mean squares filter	Marc de Courville;Pierre Duhamel;Philippe Madec;Jacques Palicot	1997	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03001045	electronic engineering;equalization;least mean squares filter;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;blind equalization;discrete fourier transform;control theory;mathematics;frequency-division multiplexing	Crypto	46.784149776441254	79.65713938242658	15427

The conventional group detection (GD) suffers from a considerable performance loss since the noise components are not taken into account. The output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is defined in each subgroup in order to consider both the desired signal and noise statistics. Adopting the real-valued representation, we provide an optimal receive combiner which maximizes the SINR with a general group size. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a large performance gain over the conventional GD in coded systems. Also, when combining with near-optimal detection algorithms such as sphere decoder, the proposed GD scheme offers a comparable performance with significant reduced complexity.	algorithm;complexity;computer performance;diplexer;interference (communication);mimo;power dividers and directional couplers;roland gs;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spatial multiplexing	Sung Hyun Moon;Jeongsik Jeong;Heunchul Lee;Inkyu Lee	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.090135	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;size of groups, organizations, and communities;control theory;mathematics;interference;maximum likelihood;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;fading;multiplexing;statistics;mimo	Visualization	49.23822470006255	73.16214997821392	15508

ESOMPs use very small antennas and require tracking systems to maintain accurate pointing to the target satellite. Because they operate while moving, there may be instances when antenna mispointing may produce interference to other satellites or other radio systems. To account for pointing errors and other time-varying characteristics of a network of ESOMPs, it is necessary to use statistical approaches for interference analysis. This paper provides an overview of ESOMPs, their technical and operational characteristics, statistical approaches for interference analysis, and the standards and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for their successful operation.	imperative programming;interference (communication);tracking system	Enrique Cuevas;Vijitha Weerackody	2015	MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357643	meteorology;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	Mobile	24.12216900883575	79.63940876268646	15520

However, clipping is a nonlinear process that causes both in-band and out-of-band distortions. Filtering the clipped OFDM signal can eliminate the out-of-band distortion but it can lead to peak regrowth. Therefore, iterative clipping and filtering have been used to both remove the out-of-band interference and suppress the regrowth of the peak power. However, the iterative process will degrade the bit error rate performance further. In this paper, we proposed a semi-analytic scheme based on compressed sensing to reconstruct the iterative clipping noise. Moreover, the proposed scheme is also applicable for reconstructing the total nonlinear distortion of a system so that the OFDM signal passes both the clipper and HPA. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well and the nonlinear distortion can be recovered effectively.	audio power amplifier;bit error rate;clipper;clipping (computer graphics);compressed sensing;distortion;frequency divider;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;nonlinear system;out-of-band agreement;semiconductor industry;simulation;windows firewall	Lin Yang;Kun Song;Yun-Ming Siu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2017.2669641	frequency domain;electronic engineering;filter (signal processing);telecommunications;distortion;bit error rate;nonlinear distortion;computer science;amplifier;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;clipping (audio)	HPC	48.95448266857755	81.12937557612763	15522

This setting naturally generalizes the problem of sending a single Gaussian source over an AWGN channel, in the case of bandwidth-matched, and with uncorrelated interference in which separation-based scheme with Costa coding is optimal. We analyze the modifeied scheme to obtain achievable (mean-squared error) distortion-power tradeoff. For comparison, we also obtain a new outer bound for the achievable distortion-power tradeoff. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, a two layered coding scheme consisting of analog and digital Costa coding layers, performs well compared to other provided JSCC schemes in the literature [1], [2].	additive white gaussian noise;coding theory;distortion;forward error correction;hd radio;interference (communication);mean squared error;numerical analysis;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Morteza Varasteh;Hamid Behroozi	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363729	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;coding gain;mathematics	Robotics	37.84235082347633	66.87038657880719	15548
0df9283816a79a33d37eea01ac715c9e321214a0	optimal time allocation in relay assisted backscatter communication systems		In this paper, we consider a relay assisted backscatter communication (RaBackCom) system, where a user backscatters incident signals from a carrier emitter (CE) to a relay and a receiver simultaneously, and then the relay forwards the useru0027s information to the receiver for throughput improvement. We consider two cases that the relay is with/without an embedded energy source. Specifically, if the relay does not have an energy source, it first harvests energy from the signals from the CE and then uses its harvested energy for information forwarding. For both cases, we formulate time allocation problems on the useru0027s information backscattering, the useru0027s information forwarding, or the relayu0027s energy harvesting to maximize the system throughput, and then derive closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed relay cooperation scheme with the optimal time allocation in terms of system throughput.	embedded system;embodied energy;lambert's cosine law;relay;simulation;throughput	Bin Lyu;Zhen Yang;Tianyi Xie;Guan Gui;Fumiyuki Adachi	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417655	computer network;time allocation;throughput;communications system;information processing;wireless;embodied energy;common emitter;computer science;relay	Mobile	33.82932914974394	85.87995298747124	15569
831ce858aaf1dc353dea665a4789bac41f8d4f77	fronthaul for 5g: low bit-rate design enabling joint transmission and reception		Centralization of base-band processing in mobile networks is a key element of 5G architecture and aims to achieve significant performance and efficiency gains. Large transmission bandwidth and high number of antennas require an adaptation of Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture in order to realize efficient and affordable data transfer between remote units (RUs) included in the distributed access points (APs) and the Central Office (CO) which is the server processing data transmission of several cells. In this paper we propose a dynamic placement of physical layer processing functions that uses an affordable overall data-rate on the fronthaul links between RUs and the CO while allowing multi-cell joint processing both on the downlink and on the uplink. We take into account various practical constraints such as latency and synchronization to evaluate the feasibility of our solution. A tradeoff between fronthaul data-rate and RAN centralization enables joint processing to achieve higher spectral efficiency especially in dense networks in order to ensure high quality 5G mobile broadband service.	c-ran;display resolution;field-programmable gate array;hardware virtualization;mimo;prototype;radio access network;requirement;server (computing);spectral efficiency;synchronization (computer science);telecommunications link;wireless access point	Dora Boviz;Yacine El Mghazli	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7848911	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	23.1578443527743	88.32796045254754	15570

So far, most papers considered traditional uniform quality of services (QoS) for target positioning in sensing fields. However, it is possible that all regions in a sensing field have different requirements for target positioning accuracy. We also concern the terrain of sensing fields might have some limitations for placing sensors. Therefore, this paper proposes a generic framework for the sensor deployment problem supporting differential quality of services (QoS) for target positioning to all regions in a sensing field. We define weighted error distance as metric of quality of positioning services. This problem is to optimize the QoS level for target positioning under the limitations of budget and discrimination priorities of regions, where locations and sensing radiuses of all sensors should be determined. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem where the objective function is to minimize of the maximum weighted error distance subject to the complete coverage, deployment budget, and discrimination priority constraints. A Lagrangean relaxation (LR) based heuristic is developed to solve the NP-hard problem. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework can provide better quality of services for positioning than the previous researches, which only handles uniform QoS requirements. Moreover we evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm. As well as we adopt the previous algorithm, ID-CODE, as the benchmark to examine the proposed heuristic. The results show the proposed algorithm is very effective in terms of deployment cost. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to their centralized nature, these protocols have difficulty coping with dynamic large-scale networks. To address this problem, we propose D-SAR, a distributed resource reservation algorithm that allows source nodes to meet the Quality-of-Service requirements for peer-to-peer communication. D-SAR uses concepts derived from circuit switching and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and applies them to wireless sensor and actuator networks. Simulations show that latency in connection setup is 93% less in D-SAR compared to WirelessHART and that 89% fewer messages are sent during connection setup in case the distance from source to destination is 12 hops.	atm turbo;algorithm;centralized computing;circuit switching;computer simulation;peer-to-peer;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Pouria Zand;Supriyo Chatterjea;Jeroen Ketema;Paul J.

We study a WOBAN deployment scenario and investigate an algorithm to optimize the placement of multiple ONUs. To obtain some representative data on locations of typical wireless users, we have conducted a survey on the distribution and types of wireless routers in the Wildhorse residential neighborhood of North Davis, CA. We also formulate the multiple-ONU deployment problem using a combinatorial optimizer, viz., simulated annealing. Having found the suitable locations for ONUs, we compare the expenditures of a WOBAN vs. a wired access solution, namely Passive Optical Network (PON). To capture the challenges behind a complete WOBAN setup, we propose and investigate a joint optimization algorithm, which considers design aspects of both the wireless front end, such as avoiding interference among neighboring APs, and the optical back end, such as minimizing expensive fiber layout.	access network;algorithm;interference (communication);internet access;mathematical optimization;network interface device;passive optical network;router (computing);simulated annealing;software deployment;viz: the computer game;wireless access point;wireless router	Suman Sarkar;Hong-Hsu Yen;Sudhir S.

A test bed of a core-access network was implemented to investigate such issues and in this paper, the authors report measurements concerning the QoS of multimedia services for different traffic conditions. The network was implemented with a differentiated service over Multi-Protocol Label Switch (MPLS) architecture; it consists of a real optical network based on core routers with optical Gigabit Ethernet (GBE) interfaces connected by means of long single mode fibres (about 50\,km), contained in an installed cable between Rome and Pomezia. The network is based on different access devices, but in this paper we only refer to an access based on Fibre To The building (FTTB) architecture. The QoS was investigated both in terms of network (or objective) tests that include packet loss, jitter, one way delay and throughput measurements and perceptive (or subjective) tests that conversely are based on the evaluation of user perception. The services under test mainly consisted of video streams that circulated in the network according to the switching operations based in the IP differentiated service over MPLS technique that allowed us to guarantee the QoS for some class of service, also in the presence of network overload. Particular attention was given to the correlation between objective and subjective measurements. Furthermore, in order to have a complete analysis about QoS of real networks, measurements were performed also in the presence of restoration operations for link failures; in particular we compare the results in the case of conventional IP network restoration with a procedure proposed by us and based on a link switching activated by the loss of signal command coming from the routers.

Our approach makes the movement trace of individual mobile stations more realistic than common approaches for random movement. After giving a survey of mobility models found in the literature, we give a detailed mathematical formulation of our model and outline its advantages. The movement concept is based on random processes for speed and direction control in which the new values are correlated to previous ones. Upon a speed change event, a new target speed is chosen, and an acceleration is set to achieve this target speed. The principles for a direction change are similar. Moreover, we propose two extensions for modeling typical movement patterns of vehicles. Finally, we consider strategies for the nodes' border behavior (i.e., what happens when nodes move out of the simulation area) and point out a pitfall that occurs when using a bounded simulation area.	simulation;stochastic process	Christian Bettstetter	2001		10.1145/381591.381600	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;modeling and simulation;mobile station;mobility model;computer security;statistics	Mobile	12.590976316358732	88.9121215113517	15622

In (I. Toufik et al, IEEE VTC2004) a max-min allocation algorithm is proposed for an N-user system with N parallel sub-channels. Here, we extend this algorithm to the multiple-antenna systems and compare its performance in two different transmission scenarios (spatial multiplexing and space time coding). The techniques are applicable, for instance, in MIMO systems using OFDMA systems with dynamic sub-carrier allocation. We show that multiuser diversity, and thus an increase of aggregate data rates with the size of the user population, can still be successfully achieved even under a hard fairness constraint. Moreover, multiple-antennas permit spatial multiplexing. The techniques considered here do not require phase information in the channel allocation process, which, from a practical point-of-view is particularly important for time-division duplex systems exploiting channel reciprocity.	aggregate data;algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);fairness measure;mimo;maxima and minima;memory management;multi-user;spatial multiplexing;subcarrier	Issam Toufik;Raymond Knopp	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

7b1709e6acce305dd990f4bfc24e49665ee0a2df	on the efficient broadcasting of heterogeneous services over band-limited channels: unequal power allocation for wavelet packet division multiplexing	power allocation;wavelet packet	Multiple transmission of heterogeneous services is a central aspect of broadcasting technology. Often, in this framework, the design of efficient communication systems is complicated by stringent bandwidth constraint. In wavelet packet division multiplexing (WPDM), the message signals are waveform coded onto wavelet packet basis functions. The overlapping nature of such waveforms in both time and frequency allows improving the performance over the commonly used FDM and TDM schemes, while their orthogonality properties permit to extract the message signals by a simple correlator receiver. Furthermore, the scalable structure of WPDM makes it suitable for broadcasting heterogeneous services. This work investigates unequal error protection (UEP) of data which exhibit different sensitivities to channel errors to improve the performance of WPDM for transmission over bandlimited channels. To cope with bandwidth constraint, an appropriate distribution of power among waveforms is proposed which is driven by the channel error sensitivities of the carried message signals in case of Gaussian noise. We address this problem by means of the genetic algorithms (GAs), which allow flexible suboptimal solution with reduced complexity. The mean square error (MSE) between the original and the decoded message, ψ which has a strong correlation with subjective perception, is used as an optimization criterion.

However, channel state information (CSI) is required at a transmitter, and the performance of the systems depends much on the accuracy of the CSI at a transmitter and a receiver. In time-varying fading environments, the channel change between the transmission weight matrix determination time and the actual data transmission time causes the system performance to degrade. To compensate for the channel error, a linear extrapolation method has been proposed for a time division duplexing system. Unfortunately, the performance still deteriorates as the maximum Doppler frequency increases. Here, two new techniques of channel extrapolation are proposed. One is second order extrapolation, and the other is exponential extrapolation.

465c9e39e8f1bc5c9e1ddfd056befdbdf1cc5c9e	statistical inference attack against phy-layer key extraction and countermeasures		With the fast growth of high-performance computing, the security of traditional cryptographic secret key establishment mechanisms are seriously challenged by computingintensive attacks. As an alternative, considerable efforts have been made to develop physical (PHY) layer security measures in recent years, such as link-signature-based (LSB) secret key extraction techniques. Those mechanisms have been believed secure, based on the fundamental assumption that wireless signals received at two locations are uncorrelated when they were separated by more than half a wavelength apart. However, this assumption does not hold in some circumstances under latest observations, rendering LSB key extraction mechanisms vulnerable to attacks. The formal theoretical analysis on channel correlations in both real indoor and outdoor environments are provided in this paper. Moreover, this paper studies empirical statistical inference attacks (SIA) against LSB key extraction, whereby an adversary infers the signature of a target link. Consequently, the secret key extracted from that signature has been recovered by observing the surrounding links. Prior work assumes theoretical link-correlation models for the inference, in contrast, our study does not make any assumption on link correlation. Instead, we take machine learning (ML) methods for link inference based on empirically measured link signatures. ML algorithms have been developed to launch SIAs under various realistic scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed inference algorithms are still quite effective even without making assumptions on link correlation. In addition, our inference algorithms can reduce the key search space by many orders of magnitudes compared to brute force search. We further propose a countermeasure against the statistical inference attacks, FBCH (forward-backward cooperative key extraction protocol with helpers). In the FBCH, helpers (other trusted wireless nodes) are introduced to provide more randomness in the key extraction. Our experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;antivirus software;brute-force search;cryptography;experiment;inference attack;key (cryptography);key exchange;least significant bit;machine learning;phy (chip);randomness;supercomputer	Rui Zhu;Tao Shu;Huirong Fu	2018	CoRR		theoretical computer science;randomness;brute-force search;physical layer;adversary;inference;machine learning;statistical inference;computer science;artificial intelligence;countermeasure;communication channel	Security	24.073009794372517	70.73706445408666	15656

This scenario imposes several challenges to the ad hoc routing protocols, and there is no single solution for all scenarios. This paper proposes the application of Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) for dynamic reconfiguration of ad hoc networks. PBNM uses the concept of policies formed by events, conditions and actions. The occurrence of an event triggers conditions evaluation, and if evaluated to true, a set of actions should be performed. The paper contribution comprises the proposal of an ad hoc policy information model based on DEN-ng policy model for the implementation of a policy manager prototype to be integrated in the NS-2 simulator allowing dynamic reconfiguration of routing protocol parameters in simulation time; and the proposal of policies for dynamically adjusting the ad hoc routing protocol behavior.	hoc (programming language);information model;instability;prototype;router (computing);routing;simulation;xml	Marcos A. de Siqueira;Fabrício L.

We investigate a dynamic user clustering problem from a fairness perspective. In order to solve this optimization problem, three sub-optimal algorithms, namely, top-down A, top-down B, and bottom up, are proposed to realize the different tradeoffs of complexity and throughput of the worst user. In addition, for each given user clustering case, we optimize the power allocation coefficients for the users in each cluster by adopting a bisection search-based algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can lower the complexity with an acceptable degradation on the throughput compared with the exhaustive search method. It is worth noting that the top-down B algorithm can achieve a good tradeoff between the complexity and the throughput among the three proposed algorithms.	algorithm;bisection method;brute-force search;cluster analysis;coefficient;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;elegant degradation;fairness measure;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;telecommunications link;throughput;top-down and bottom-up design	Yuanawei Liu;Maged Elkashlan;Zhiguo Ding;George K.

Our approach is based on the principle of cooperative diversity and fail-over concepts of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), by grouping, gathering, and rejecting redundant packets with the unique packet ID per message. It is suitable for nodes which require high reliability in message delivery but have enhanced energy capability. Our approach imitates two RAID levels to investigate their effect in reliability by redundancy. Based on an analytical model and ns-2 simulations, we compare the performance of our packet-based diversity schemes with direct transmission. Our schemes improve the reliability significantly in terms of the Improved Message Reconstruction Ratio per Redundancy (MRR/R) about 25% in the analytical model and 15% in simulation. The results indicate that our approach is especially effective in situations with strong interferences.	failover;floppy disk;network packet;raid;simulation	Yuan Yang;Matthias Wählisch;Yubin Zhao;Marcel Kyas	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364008	fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cooperative diversity;statistics;raid;computer network	Embedded	5.114561840140165	83.5512737147631	15689

Information obtained by the monitoring nodes needs to be routed to a set of designated gateway nodes. In these networks, every node is capable of sensing, data processing, and communication, and operates on its limited amount of battery energy consumed mostly in transmission and reception at its radio transceiver. If we assume that the transmitter power level can be adjusted to use the minimum energy required to reach the intended next hop receiver then the energy consumption rate per unit information transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node, i.e., the routing decision. We formulate the routing problem as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to maximize the network lifetime, which is equivalent to the time until the network partition due to battery outage. Two different models are considered for the information-generation processes. One assumes constant rates and the other assumes an arbitrary process. A shortest cost path routing algorithm is proposed which uses link costs that reflect both the communication energy consumption rates and the residual energy levels at the two end nodes. The algorithm is amenable to distributed implementation. Simulation results with both information-generation process models show that the proposed algorithm can achieve network lifetime that is very close to the optimal network lifetime obtained by solving the linear programming problem.	algorithm;downtime;energy level;hoc (programming language);linear programming;network partition;routing;simulation;transceiver;transmitter	Jae-Hwan Chang;Leandros Tassiulas	2004	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2004.833122	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	11.22987424038485	80.30700090699575	15696

In contrast to conventional cooperative networks, the source and relay in the considered network have no embedded energy supply. They need to rely on the energy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the AP for their cooperative information transmission. Based on this three-node reference model, we propose a harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocol, in which the source and relay harvest energy from the AP in the downlink and work cooperatively in the uplink for the source's information transmission. Considering a delay-limited transmission mode, the approximate closed-form expression for the average throughput of the proposed protocol is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Subsequently, this analysis is extended to the multi-relay scenario, where the approximate throughput of the HTC protocol with two popular relay selection schemes is derived. The asymptotic analyses for the throughput performance of the considered schemes at high signal-to-noise radio are also provided. All theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The impacts of the system parameters, such as time allocation, relay number, and relay position, on the throughput performance are extensively investigated.	apollonian network;approximation algorithm;computer simulation;embedded system;embodied energy;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;reference model;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput;uninterruptible power supply	He Chen;Yonghui Li;João Luiz Rebelatto;Bartolomeu F.

In this paper, we investigate the path selection problem in multihop cognitive radio networks (CRNs) under constraints on flow routing, link scheduling and CR source's budget. We extend the per-user-based spectrum trading in prior work to CR session-based spectrum trading, and effectively develop the spectrum trading mechanisms based on the cross-layer optimization in multihop CRNs. We introduce a new service provider, called secondary service provider (SSP), to help CR sessions to select the paths for packet delivery. Considering the price of bands and the potential returning of primary services at different CR links, the SSP purchases the licensed spectrum and jointly conducts flow routing and link scheduling under the budget constraints. We also propose a 4D conflict graph to characterize the conflict relationship among CR links and mathematically formulate the path selection problem under multiple constraints into an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the end-to-end throughput. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we have also developed a heuristic algorithm to find the approximate solution.	approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;end-to-end principle;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network packet;network performance;optimization problem;peer-to-peer;procurement;routing;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;serializability;simulation;throughput	Miao Pan;Hao Yue;Chi Zhang;Yuguang Fang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.85	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	29.302642975736912	96.88574833181447	15704

The optimization method must be energy competent in terms of utilization and communication. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective optimization method known as Green (Energy Efficient)-Multi-Objective Hybrid Routing Algorithm (G-MOHRA) in WSNs. G-MOHRA uses hierarchical clustering. The information is dispatched using the finest path that uses a weighted average of various metrics in order to achieve energy efficiency and energy stability in the entire network. G-MOHRA uses various metrics such as Average Energy consumption (AEC), Control Overhead, Reaction Time, Link Quality Indicator (LQI), and HOP Count for identifying the best path from source to sink. In this paper, G-MOHRA uses objective functions that are said to be conflicting and provides Pareto optimal solutions. The performance of G-MOHRA is evaluated through intensive simulation and equated with Simple Hybrid Routing Protocol (SHRP) and Dynamic Multi-objective Routing Algorithm (DyMORA). The metrics such as AEC, Residual Energy, Packet Delivery Ratio, Jitter, and Normalized Routing Load are used for comparison. Performance of G-MOHRA has been observed to outclass SHRP and DyMORA. It improves the Packet Delivery Ratio by 18.72% as compared to SHRP and 24.98 % as compared to DyMORA. G-MOHRA outperforms SHRP and DyMORA in terms of Average Energy Consumption by a factor of 19.79 % and 15.52 % as compared to SHRP and DyMORA respectively.	algorithm;cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;routing;simulation	Nandkumar Kulkarni;Neeli R.

There are three methods can be used to implement FDE in CDMA uplink [I. Martoyo et al., 2003]: the cyclic prefix [K.L. Baum et al., 2002], the zero padding and the overlap-cut (OC). However, the first two methods not only yield lower bandwidth efficiency, but also create higher latency, so the OC is the better choice. In this case, we don't have to modify the structure of the frame. This is very important and useful for applications in which the frame structure is predefined. Thus, this paper proposes an approach to use the improved overlap-cut (IOC) method and parallel interference cancellation (PIC) architecture integrate with frequency domain decision feedback equalization (FD-DFE).	adobe framemaker;baum–welch algorithm;bit error rate;dispersive partial differential equation;interference (communication);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;x.690	Liang Ren;Guoping Xu;Lin Sang	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.182	code division multiple access;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;frequency domain	Mobile	47.53418254403815	78.63523685867834	15711

It constitutes a throughput-critical task at the medium access control layer of today's wireless networks that has been tackled by seemingly unrelated information-theoretic and protocol design approaches. Capitalizing on convex optimization and stochastic approximation tools, the present paper develops a unified framework for channel-aware QoS-guaranteed scheduling protocols for use in adaptive wireless networks whereby multiple terminals are linked through orthogonal fading channels to an access point, and transmissions are (opportunistically) adjusted to the intended channel. The unification encompasses downlink and uplink with time-division or frequency-division duplex operation; full and quantized channel state information comprising a few bits communicated over a limited-rate feedback channel; different types of traffic (best effort, non-real-time, real-time); uniform and optimal power loading; off-line optimal scheduling schemes benchmarking fundamentally achievable rate limits; as well as on-line scheduling algorithms capable of dynamically learning the intended channel statistics and converging to the optimal benchmarks from any initial value. The take-home message offers an important cross-layer design guideline: judiciously developed, yet surprisingly simple, channel-adaptive, on-line schedulers can approach information-theoretic rate limits with QoS guarantees.	access control;algorithm;best-effort delivery;channel state information;communications protocol;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);information theory;mathematical optimization;online and offline;quality of service;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing);stochastic approximation;telecommunications link;throughput;unification (computer science);unified framework;wireless access point	Xin Wang;Georgios B.

However, promptly providing a reliable position is a problem in places where the global positioning system (GPS) signal is extremely weak. We propose an acquisition scheme for the assisted GPS (AGPS) architecture based on a timing-synchronized mobile network. System errors as well as code uncertainty range and frequency uncertainty range are discussed. With this method, the acquisition search range is significantly reduced, and a long-time coherent correlation is made possible. Simulations and experiments prove that the method is fast, efficient and power-saving for the user handset. Furthermore, the AGPS receiver can perform a short TTFF (Time To First Fix) start even with no ephemeris kept in the handset.	assisted gps;global positioning system	Zhixing Liu;Chunming Fan;Shoichiro Asano;Nobuhiro Kishimoto;Harumasa Hojo;Akio Yasuda	2009	IEICE Transactions		embedded system;cellular network;time to first fix;telecommunications;computer science;precision lightweight gps receiver;operating system;assisted gps	Visualization	22.96804865351976	76.89166298115234	15731

The proposed scheme is based on linear precoding at the base stations (BS) and requires feedback only within each cell. For the 3-cell case, mathematical analysis is provided to show that the proposed scheme approaches to interference-free degree-of-freedom (dof) of this channel as the number of users grows. A geometric interpretation is presented to generalize the proposed scheme for more than three cells. Simulation results illustrate the dof achieved using this scheme for the 3-cell case which is important in a real cellular environment because of the three adjacent interfering cells.	column (database);emoticon;feedback;image scaling;interference (communication);simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;the matrix;time complexity	Mohsen Rezaee;Said Nader-Esfahani	2012	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2012.070312.120266	adjacent-channel interference;channel code;telecommunications;radio resource management;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;co-channel interference;precoding;statistics	Mobile	39.32626194982505	85.77400337767526	15762

b8eef1409246d932b8dda52f53ace321729f5027	survey and taxonomy of transmissions power control mechanisms for wireless body area networks		Wireless body area networks (WBANs) comprise several sensor nodes equipped with a short range radio-frequency transceiver, implanted and/or attached to the human body. Their low form-factor and localization imply less resources available and limited energy capabilities. Therefore, energy efficiency of WBANs is a critical issue since, in many cases, batteries cannot be replaced or recharged, requiring mechanisms to extend their life-time. The aim of transmission power control (TPC) mechanisms, which can be combined with other energy-saving mechanisms, is to reduce the energy consumption, external interferences, and specific-observation-rate in wireless communications by dynamically adjusting the transmission power output of data transmission, with the minimum effect on other performance aspects, such as reliability and latency. This paper describes and analyzes the TPCs developed as a result of a synergy created by two mechanisms, a link quality estimator and the transmission power level control. Design choices, in terms of the solutions devised to each mechanism, as well as, the strategy adopted to combine them in a TPC, are highlighted. A comparison between the newest and the most relevant research works in this area is provided as a guideline to future research. A taxonomy to classify the different TPC mechanisms developed is proposed.	conformity;emoticon;form factor (design);ibm tivoli storage productivity center;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;interrupt latency;network packet;network utility;radio frequency;requirement;star network;synergy;taxonomy (general);transceiver	Duarte Fernandes;Andr&#x00E9; Filipe Gon&#x00E7;alves Ferreira;Reza Abrishambaf;Jos&#x00E9; Mendes;Jorge Miguel Cabral	2018	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2017.2782666	latency (engineering);power control;computer network;wireless sensor network;electricity generation;computer science;efficient energy use;data transmission;energy consumption;wireless	Mobile	12.191404746902329	82.26957412416378	15775

The real-time data retrieval from a network of large-amount wireless seismic nodes to a central server is virtually impossible due to the sheer data amount and resource limitations. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-resolution evolving tomography algorithm for processing data and inverting volcano tomography in the network, while avoiding costly data collections and centralized computations. The new algorithm distributes the computational burden to sensor nodes and performs real-time tomography inversion under the constraints of network resources. We implemented and evaluated the system design in the CORE emulator. The experiment results validate that our proposed algorithm not only balances the computation load, but also achieves low communication cost and high data loss tolerance.	algorithm;centralized computing;computation;data retrieval;emulator;image resolution;real-time clock;real-time data;server (computing);systems design;tomography	Lei Shi;Wen-Zhan Song;Mingsen Xu;Qingjun Xiao;Jonathan M.

A close relation between guessing and compression is first established. Then it is shown that if the sequence of distributions of the information spectrum satisfies the large deviation property with a certain rate function, then the limiting guessing exponent exists and is a scalar multiple of the Legendre-Fenchel dual of the rate function. Other sufficient conditions related to certain continuity properties of the information spectrum are briefly discussed. This approach highlights the importance of the information spectrum in determining the limiting guessing exponent. All known prior results are then re-derived as example applications of our unifying approach.	hurst exponent;interaction;kolmogorov complexity;scott continuity;sullivan conjecture;time complexity;user-generated content	Manjesh Kumar Hanawal;Rajesh Sundaresan	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2090221	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;information theory;mathematics;statistics;source code	Visualization	36.451272741837435	63.16045599557954	15792

To illustrate approach 1), we determine an outage-based admission region; to illustrate approach 2), we investigate the performance of the greedy admission policy in a generalized knapsack problem.	bit error rate;common access card;control theory;downtime;greedy algorithm;knapsack problem;one-way function;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Tara Javidi;Demosthenis Teneketzis	2003	IEEE Trans.

In this work, we compare the two relay systems in term of system capacity under user resource fairness constraint. We jointly study the effect of resource allocation and user association rule for maximizing the system capacity, where the user association rule determines the access station for each user. Different system configurations are compared, including: Single-Input Single-Output or Multi-Input Multi-Output in the relay links between base stations and relay stations, and different number of relay stations in a sector. Simulation results show that the highest capacity is achieved by the NT-RS with 3 relay stations per sector in distributed scheduling mode. Two simple user association rules, Highest Modulation-and-Coding-Scheme (MCS) scheme and Highest Modified Effective-Spectrum–Efficiency (ESE) scheme, are compared along with the optimal rules that maximize system capacity. It is demonstrated that Highest (Mod) ESE scheme achieves system capacity close to the optimal rules’.

e2f0b01bd546058e1bcf88428ff61e8c755b1bb0	group buying-based data transmission in flying ad-hoc networks: a coalition game approach		In scenarios such as natural disasters and military strikes, it is common for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to form groups to execute reconnaissance and surveillance. To ensure the effectiveness of UAV communications, repeated resource acquisition issues and transmission mechanism designs need to be addressed urgently. Since large-scale UAVs will generate high transmission overhead due to the overlapping resource requirements, in this paper, we propose a resource allocation optimization method based on distributed data content in a Flying Ad-hoc network (FANET). The resource allocation problem with the goal of throughput maximization is constructed as a coalition game framework. Firstly, a data transmission mechanism is designed for UAVs to execute information interaction within the coalitions. Secondly, a novel mechanism of coalition selection based on group-buying is investigated for UAV coalitions to acquire data from the central UAV. The data transmission and coalition selection problem are modeled as coalition graph game and coalition formation game, respectively. Through the design of the utility function, we prove that both games have stable solutions. We also prove the convergence of the proposed approach with coalition order and Pareto order. Based on simulation results, coalition order based coalition selection algorithm (CO-CSA) and Pareto order based coalition selection algorithm (PO-CSA) are proposed to explore the stable coalition partition of system model. CO-CSA and PO-CSA can achieve higher data throughput than the contrast onetime coalition selection algorithm (Onetime-CSA) (at least increased by 34.5% and 16.9%, respectively). Besides, although PO-CSA has relatively lower throughput gain, its convergence times is on average 50.9% less than that of CO-CSA, which means that the algorithm choice is scenario-dependent.	aerial photography;allocation;business logic;classification;convergence (action);drug vehicle;entropy maximization;graph - visual representation;hoc (programming language);log-linear model;mathematical optimization;natural disasters;neural network simulation;overhead (computing);pareto efficiency;plant components, aerial;requirement;selection algorithm;sleep apnea, central;throughput;transaction log;unmanned aerial vehicle;utility	Lang Ruan;Jin Chen;Qiuju Guo;XiaoBo Zhang;Yuli Zhang;Dianxiong Liu	2018	Information	10.3390/info9100253	artificial intelligence;throughput;selection algorithm;machine learning;computer science;nash equilibrium;system model;pareto principle;wireless ad hoc network;resource allocation;convergence (routing);distributed computing	AI	31.774651838036597	94.099318206157	15830

The chip-level detection can enhance the tolerance of multiple access interference (MAI) because the channel collision does not occur as long as there is at least one weighted position without MAI. Moreover, the spectral-slice scheme can reduce the interference probability because the MAI with the different frequency has no adverse effects on the channel collision rate. As a result, these techniques mitigate channel collisions. We analyze the channel collision rate theoretically, and show that the proposed system can achieve a lower channel collision rate in comparison to both conventional systems with and without the time-encoding method.	intelligence amplification;interference (communication);transmitter	Takaya Miyazawa;Iwao Sasase	2009	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2009.6388367	code division multiple access;transmitter;signal-to-interference ratio;telecommunications;computer science;interference;encoding;spectral method	Mobile	49.93679572376885	69.36420759493511	15832
680caf385f22c37f9d1cf2670d8f80359a577da5	self-organized data aggregation among selfish nodes in an isolated cluster		This paper considers a delay tolerant network, where a message ferry travels multiple isolated clusters, collects data from nodes in the clusters, and finally delivers the data to a sink node. In our previous work, we proposed a self-organized data aggregation technique for collecting data from nodes efficiently, which can automatically accumulate data from cluster members to a limited number of cluster members called aggregators. The proposed scheme was developed based on the evolutionary game theoretic approach, in order to take account of the inherent selfishness of the nodes for saving their own battery life. The number of aggregators can be controlled to a desired value by adjusting the energy that the message ferry supplies to the aggregators. In this paper, we further examine the proposed system in terms of success of data transmission and system survivability. We first introduce a new type of game model with retransmissions. Through both theoretic and simulation approaches, we then reveal feasible parameter settings which can achieve a system with desirable characteristics: Stability, survival, and successful data transfer.

In this paper, we present an adaptive decentralized power control algorithm. Power control in the uplink direction is been considered. The proposed algorithm is a first order algorithm and utilizes bit error rate (BER) as a decision criterion for power update. Pilot bits in the uplink frame are used to measure the BER. We incorporate a nonlinear exponential term in the power update function to improve the speed of convergence of the algorithm which is also demonstrated through simulation results. Changing the adaptation parameter also changes the speed of convergence. The algorithm is examined in a time varying Rayleigh fading environment with frequency selective channel. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves gain in the average required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value compared to other algorithms. The users are assumed to be mobile during the simulation period.

In this paper, we contribute to proposing and analyzing the push-based and cache-based content delivery in a three-tier heterogeneous network, where base stations, relays and device-to-device (D2D) pairs are included. We propose to proactively push the popular contents to the relays and parts of the users with caching ability via broadcasting when the network is off-peak. The cached contents can be reused for frequent access to offload the cellular network traffic. The node locations are first modeled as mutually independent Poisson Point Processes (PPPs) and the corresponding content access protocol is developed. The average ergodic rates in the downlink are then analyzed theoretically. We further derive the global throughput gain and the impact of network characteristics on the system performance is illustrated. Simulation results show that the proposed system has significant performance gain, especially for the high density network.	cache (computing);digital distribution;ergodicity;interference (communication);multitier architecture;network traffic control;profiling (computer programming);relay;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Chenchen Yang;Zhiyong Chen;Yao Yao;Bin Xia	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248650	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	30.464073360313414	85.30599668564913	15865

0c928556606d5404afa9dc89d5702796665e18c0	an interactive context-aware power management technique for optimizing sensor network lifetime		A key problem in sensor networks equipped with renewable energy sources is deciding how to allocate energy to various tasks (sensing, communication etc.) over time so that the deployed network continues to gather high-quality data. The state-of-the-art energy allocation algorithm takes into account current battery level and harvesting energy and fairly allocates as much energy as possible along the time dimension. In this paper we show that by not considering application-context this approach leads to very high and uniform sampling rates. However, sampling the environment at fixed predefined intervals is neither possible (need to accommodate system failures) nor desirable (sampling rate might not capture an important event with desired fidelity). To that end, in this paper we propose a novel interactive power management technique that adapts sampling rate as a function of both application-level context (e.g., user request) and system-level context (e.g harvesting energy availability). We vary several key parameters including application request patterns, geographic locations, time slot length, battery end point voltage and evaluate the performance of our approach in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy. Our simulations use sensor data and system specifications (battery and solar panel specs, sensing and communication costs) from a real sensor network deployment. Our results show that the proposed approach saves significant amounts of energy by avoiding oversampling when application does not need it while using this saved energy to support sampling at high rates to capture events with necessary fidelity when needed. The computational complexity of our approach is lower (O(n)) than the state-of-the-art noninteractive energy allocation algorithm (O(n2)).	algorithm;computational complexity theory;ibm notes;interactivity;optimizing compiler;oracle call interface;oversampling;power management;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor research corporation;simulation;software deployment	Jinseok Yang;Sameer Tilak;Tajana S.

We focus on a single cell scenario based on WCDMA technology. We propose to use a maximin criteria to introduce fairness among the different users' throughputs. An stochastic approximation is implemented to obtain an online algorithm where the Lagrange multipliers are estimated at each scheduling period. Our results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher fairness among the users and, in some cases, a higher sum-rate compared with the well-known proportional fair scheduler.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);best, worst and average case;computer simulation;const (computer programming);data rate units;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;minimax;online algorithm;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);stochastic approximation;stochastic optimization;telecommunications link;whole earth 'lectronic link	Javier Rubio;Olga Muñoz;Antonio Pascual-Iserte;Josep Vidal	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794672	fairness measure;stochastic approximation;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;max-min fairness;computer science;lagrange multiplier	Embedded	27.64817188051809	92.98211512610216	15958

Their values must contain enough randomness to be unpredictable to attackers. Pseudo-random number generators require initial data with high entropy as a seed to produce a large stream of high quality random data. Yet, despite the importance of randomness, proper high quality random number generation is often ignored. Primarily embedded devices often suffer from weak random number generators.  In this work, we focus on identifying and evaluating SRAM in commercial off-the-shelf microcontrollers as an entropy source for PRNG seeding. We measure and evaluate the SRAM start-up patterns of two popular types of microcontrollers, a STMicroelectronics STM32F100R8 and a Microchip PIC16F1825. We also present an efficient software-only architecture for secure PRNG seeding. After analyzing over 1000000 measurements in total, we conclude that of these two devices, the PIC16F1825 cannot be used to securely seed a PRNG. The STM32F100R8, however, has the ability to generate very strong seeds from the noise in its SRAM start-up pattern. These seeds can then be used to ensure a PRNG generates high quality data.	cryptographic nonce;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;display resolution;embedded system;integrated circuit;pic microcontroller;pseudorandom number generator;random number generation;randomness;seed;static random-access memory	Anthony Van Herrewege;Vincent van der Leest;André Schaller;Stefan Katzenbeisser;Ingrid Verbauwhede	2013		10.1145/2517300.2517306	real-time computing;engineering;theoretical computer science;computer security	Security	12.152402796270115	64.41677634264609	15970

In this paper, we deal with a wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission in the presence of an external interference which occupies partially the signal band and whose time duration is shorter than the OFDM block. We parameterize the unknown interference waveform by a number of parameters assuming prior knowledge of its frequency band and time duration, and develop an iterative receiver, which couples interference detection via a generalized likelihood-ratio-test (GLRT), interference reconstruction and cancellation, channel estimation, and data detection. In addition to simulation results, we verify the receiver performance using data sets collected from two experiments. In both time-invariant and time-varying channels, the proposed iterative receiver achieves robust performance in the presence of unknown interference.	acoustic cryptanalysis;channel state information;experiment;frequency band;frequency divider;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;multiplexing;simulation;time-invariant system;waveform	Zhaohui Wang;Shengli Zhou;Josko Catipovic;Peter Willett	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1145/2076569.2076572	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;acoustics;telecommunications;engineering;co-channel interference	Mobile	51.02230804456266	79.81320127007746	15990

In this study, it is shown that if we assume the channel correlation function (CCF) of a quasistatic channel is perfectly known at the receiver, all of the available pilot power should be allocated to the pilot sub-carrier with the maximum channel amplitude. In addition, a practical water-filling-type power allocation scheme, designated as the gain-powered pilots (GPP) scheme, is proposed for the case in which the CCF is subject to a certain amount of error. The simulation results indicate that the GPP scheme consistently outperforms the EPP method in terms of improving the performance of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimator.	channel state information;frequency divider;graph partition;ieee 1284;mean squared error;microsoft customer care framework;multiplexing;simulation;subcarrier	Wei-Chieh Huang;Chun-Hsien Pan;Chih-Peng Li;Hsueh-Jyh Li	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378724	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	49.255515309802384	78.88893064903006	15992

In the case of multimedi a call, each of it s substreams (i.e., video, audio and data) has its own distinct QoS requirements viz., Cel Loss Ratio (CLR), Cell Transfer delay (CTD) and Cell Delay Variation (CDV). The network attempts to deliver the required QoS by allocating an appropriate amount of resources (e.g. Bandwidth, Buffers) to the admitted calls. Bandwidth allocation play a key role in achieving the promised QoS for every connection or every class of connections. There are dynamic bandwidth allocation polices reported in the literature , but they deal wit h homogeneous sources viz., video sources only. These dynamic algorithms do not deal wit h the QoS parameters, and also the main drawback of these schemes is that they lead to unequal queue growth. In this work, we present and analyse dynamic bandwidth allocation based on fuzzy logic for hetrogenous sources with multipl e QoS (CLR,CTD,CDV and the arrival rate) requirements. Here, it is considered that each substream declares a present range of acceptable QoS level s (e.g. High, Medium and Low) instead of just a single one. As the QoS demand varies, the proposed algorithm allocates the best possible bandwidth to the substream. This is done however, under the constraint of achieving maximum utilization of resources while simultaneously distributing them fairl y among the calls. We validate the proposed allocation method for various hetrogeneous traffi c profiles with various bit rates and QoS parameters and show that the required QoS can be satisfied by appropriatel y tuning the fuzzy logic controller from the declared QoS parameters and instantaneous traffi c arrivals.	atm turbo;algorithm;cell (microprocessor);check digit;cisco lan2lan personal office for isdn;comparative toxicogenomics database (ctd);dynamic problem (algorithms);fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;integrated services digital network;quality of service;queueing theory;requirement;viz: the computer game	Soundararajan Chandramathi;Subbaiah Shanmugavel	2002		10.1109/ICC.2002.997055	fuzzy logic;shared resource;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;resource allocation;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;distributed computing;queueing theory;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation;satisfiability	Embedded	1.3946409442951617	96.0308499445363	15996
87e993a05d6715eafcad391e7125b7a13f2d2c34	secrecy constrained distributed detection in sensor networks		The data collected by sensor networks often contain sensitive information and care must be taken to prevent that information from being leaked to malicious third parties, e.g., eavesdroppers. Under both the Neyman–Pearson and Bayesian frameworks, we investigate the strategy of defending against an informed and greedy eavesdropper who has access to all the sensors’ outputs via imperfect communication channels. Meanwhile, the legitimate user, e.g., fusion center, is guaranteed to achieve its desired detection performance. Under the Neyman–Pearson framework, we propose a novel approach for analyzing the performance tradeoff, using the maximum achievable detection performance ratio between the fusion center and eavesdropper. Under the Bayesian framework, we derive the asymptotic error exponent, and show that the detectability of a given eavesdropper (Eve) can be limited to her prior information, in other words, Eve's observations do not improve her decision-making ability. Furthermore, we show that as the number of sensors goes to infinity, both asymptotic perfect secrecy and asymptotic perfect detection can be achieved under both frameworks, given noiseless communication channels to the fusion center.	error exponent;eve;greedy algorithm;information sensitivity;information-theoretic security;malware;sensor	Jun Guo;Uri Rogers;Xia Li;Hao Chen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks	10.1109/TSIPN.2017.2705479	information-theoretic security;secrecy;wireless sensor network;information processing;information sensitivity;bit error rate;computer security;distributed computing;bayesian probability;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	30.723202483674545	68.71122892393282	16017
71956557a825206ef7a2fa9c438184f27c389852	massive csi acquisition for dense cloud-rans with spatial-temporal dynamics		Dense cloud radio access networks (cloud-RANs) provide a promising way to enable scalable connectivity and handle diversified service requirements for massive mobile devices. To fully exploit the performance gains of dense cloud-RANs, channel state information of both the signal link and interference links is required. However, with limited radio resources for training, the channel estimation problem in dense cloud-RANs becomes a high-dimensional estimation problem, i.e., the number of measurements will be typically smaller than the dimension of the channel. In this paper, we shall develop a generic high-dimensional structured channel estimation framework for dense cloud-RANs, which is based on a convex structured regularizing formulation. Observing that the wireless channel possesses ample exploitable statistical characteristics, we propose to convert the available spatial and temporal prior information into appropriate convex regularizers. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting the spatial and temporal dynamics can achieve good estimation performance even with limited training resources. The alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is further adopted to solve the resultant large-scale high-dimensional channel estimation problems. The proposed framework thus enjoys modeling flexibility, low training overhead, and computation cost scalability.	access network;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;augmented lagrangian method;channel state information;computation;deep learning;encode;estimation theory;first-order predicate;interference (communication);mobile device;overhead (computing);real-time transcription;requirement;resultant;scalability;simulation;sparse matrix	Xuan Liu;Yuanming Shi;Jun Zhang;Khaled Ben Letaief	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2797969	real-time computing;channel state information;wireless;computation;scalability;interference (wave propagation);mathematics;cloud computing;distributed computing;communication channel;access network	Mobile	39.49468800045637	92.34496105684822	16053

f2781063b66133a6833f8e09e782aa518de29787	opportunistic channel selection based on time series prediction in cognitive radio networks		To improve the utilisation efficiency of licensed spectrum in cognitive radio network, two new channel selection strategies are proposed for the secondary user SU in this paper. The proposed solution tries its best to reduce collision and switching probabilities of the SU during data transmission. By using historical information of the licensed spectrum, the SU chooses the channel with the lowest busy probability within its service time for data transmission. Time series prediction is employed to forecast the near future busy probabilities of the licensed spectrum units, and a novel time series prediction method named distance factor recursive least square is also presented. Simulations prove that the performances of the SU, which is measured by collision probability with primary user, switching probability during data transmission and throughput within limited time slots, are all significantly improved when compared with random channel selection method. Higher prediction accuracy than the conventional recursive least square and lazy learning methods is achieved by proposed time series prediction algorithm when tested by voice traffic data and Lorenz time series.

In this paper we introduce a new stability-driven clustering algorithm for pseudo-linear highly mobile ad hoc networks such as that of communication between aircraft, ships, trains and cars on highways. The new algorithm aims at establishing stable clusters, where clusterhead re-election is reduced, and cluster membership periods are increased in the targeted system. The scheme is suitable even in systems where global positioning systems (GPS) is not available. The algorithm involves dynamic clusterhead election. Simulations show that the proposed clustering algorithm provides highly stable clusters with several advantages over previous 1-hop clustering schemes.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer simulation;global positioning system;hoc (programming language)	Ehssan Sakhaee;Abbas Jamalipour	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.225	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Visualization	3.3899501113568817	85.66788888577297	16101

We consider competitive interactions between a selfish secondary user (SU) transmitter-receiver pair and a jammer under realistic physical interference constraints. Assuming incomplete knowledge of the jammer's location in the network, the SU chooses its transmission power strategy, subject to a total power budget, with the objective of satisfying a minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the intended receiver.We model the strategic power allocation problem as an incomplete and imperfect information game and investigate self-enforcing strategies of the SU and the jammer. The solution of the game corresponds to Nash Equilibria (NE) points. We carry out the equilibrium analysis for this game by considering the mixed strategy solution space and provide closed form expressions of the equilibria points.

The isolated seem ing problems of maximizing a weighted sum of rates for a given power budget̄ P and minimizing sum power for given rate requirements R̄ can be interpreted jointly in this framework. To this end we embed t he problems in a higher dimensional space. Based on these results, we subsequently consider the combin ed problem of maximizing a weighted sum of rates under given rate requirements R̄ and a fixed power budget̄ P . This new problem is challenging, since the additional constraints do not allow to use the hith erto existing approaches. Interestingly, the optimal decoding orders turn out to be the ordering of the Lag ran ian factors in all problems.

To incorporate the delay into the scheduler design, we consider the objective of maximizing the total utility (UT). However, since a utility-based scheduler that concerns delay requires high complexity, we introduce the concept of marginal utility. Representing the objective as minimizing the total marginal utility (mt), we develop some related properties for maximizing UT and minimizing MT. For the case with fixed service time, we show that the outcome of MT minimization becomes equivalent to that of UT maximization. For the more complicated case of varying service time, the MT minimization sheds light on the design of a simple scheduler. Overall, the marginal utility requires significantly low complexity for packet scheduling compared to the ordinary utility. Through simulations, we confirm that the marginal utility gives a way of flexible scheduling in meeting various delay requirements	call stack;expectation–maximization algorithm;flexible-fuel vehicle;marginal model;network packet;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;ut-vpn;utility	Young-June Choi;Saewoong Bahk	2006	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2006.149	real-time computing;marginal utility;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;scheduling;service quality;packet switching;telecommunications network;computer network	Mobile	4.165901075406469	101.02977428494691	16157
40142cc1da7559541ffd00398d045971beca2714	defense against spectrum sensing data falsification attacks in cognitive radio networks	ssdf attack;cognitive radio network;802 22	IEEE 802.22 is the first standard based on the concept of cognitive radio. It recommends collaborative spectrum sensing to avoid the unreliability of individual spectrum sensing while detecting primary user signals. However, it opens an opportunity for attackers to exploit the decision making process by sending false reports. In this paper, we address security issues regarding distributed node sensing in the 802.22 standard and discuss how attackers can modify or manipulate their sensing result independently or collaboratively. This problem is commonly known as spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack or Byzantine attack. To counter the different attacking strategies, we propose a reputation based clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of attacker distribution or complete identification of malicious users. We compare the performance of our algorithm against existing approaches across a wide range of attacking scenarios. Our proposed algorithm displays a significantly reduced error rate in decision making compared to current methods. It also identifies a large portion of the attacking nodes and greatly minimizes the false detection rate of honest nodes.	algorithm;bit error rate;cluster analysis;cognitive radio;malware;recursion;sensor	Chowdhury Sayeed Hyder;Brendan Grebur;Li Xiao	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-31909-9_9	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	47.92442485253457	88.86949160100104	16172

However, the stream nature of the data, the limited resources, and the distributed nature of sensor networks bring new challenges for the mining techniques that need to be address. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation for the association rules, a well known data mining technique, that is able to generate the time relations between sensor devices in a particular sensor network. This new formulation will allow traditional data mining algorithms proposed to solve the classical association rules mining problem to be applied on sensor based class of applications that generate and use sensor data. The generated rules will give a clear picture about the correlations between sensors in the network and can be used to make decisions about the network performance, or it can be used to predict the sources of future events. In order to prepare for the data needed in the mining process and to maximize the network lifetime, a distributed extraction methodology is introduced, in this distributed methodology sensors perform optimization based on local computation to decide whether it will participate in sending data or not. Experimental results have shown that the distributed extraction solution is able to reduce the number of exchanged messages and the data size by 50% compared to a direct transmission of the data.	algorithm;association rule learning;business analysis;centralized computing;computation;data mining;distributed computing;fault detection and isolation;mathematical optimization;network performance;sensor	Azzedine Boukerche;Samer Samarah	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.648	wireless sensor network;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;data stream mining;visual sensor network	DB	10.948758694377124	74.15032748942595	16182

The use of dual-polarized antennas in MIMO systems has emerged as a cost-and space-effective alternative, where two spatially separated uni-polarized antennas can be replaced by a single antenna element employing orthogonal polarizations. Several papers show mainly polarization diversity in multiple antenna system so far. In this paper, we show the simulation results of spatial multiplexing(SM) and space frequency block codes (SFBC) MIMO employing dual-polarized antenna. Also, we measure the PER (packet error rate) of downlink signal in implemented SM and SFBC MIMO system which is employing dual-polarized antenna under the indoor field environment. Dual-polarized antenna system achieved the similar trend PER (packet error rate) curve with uni-polarized one. That means that multiplexing gain is obtained from polarized antennas system having space and cost effective.	bit error rate;code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;network packet;polarization (waves);simulation;spatial multiplexing;telecommunications link	Hyeongsook Park	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666107	block code;wimax;omnidirectional antenna;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;antenna diversity;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;antenna measurement;computer science;reconfigurable antenna;directional antenna;antenna;smart antenna;spatial multiplexing;statistics;computer network;antenna efficiency;mimo	Mobile	26.95705958188676	82.30359809122888	16183

In addition, many noise and interferences, including multiple access interference (MAI), optical beating interference (OBI), and receiver’s noise are included in the analysis. Besides, we propose to use the heterodyne detection receiver so that the receiver’s sensitivity can be improved. Analytical results show that, under the impact of GVD, the number of supportable users is extremely decreased and the maximum transmission length (i.e. the length at which BER ≤ 10−9 can be maintained) is remarkably shortened in the case of normal single mode fiber (ITU-T G.652) is used. The main factor that limits the system performance is time skewing. In addition, we show how the impact of GVD is relieved by dispersion-shifted fiber (ITU-T G.653). For example, a system with 32 × 1 Gbit/s users can achieve a maximum transmission length of 111 km when transmitted optical power per bit is −5 dBm. key words: two-dimensional optical CDMA (2-D OCDMA), wavelength hopping/time spreading (WH/TS), heterodyne detection receiver, group velocity dispersion (GVD), fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs)	dbm;fiber to the x;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;gigabit;heterodyne;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);optical fiber;software propagation;velocity (software development);x.690	Ngoc T.

By converting the outage constraint into user and subcarrier dependent peak power constraints, we obtain the optimal joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation solution by applying Lagrange dual-decomposition method. We also propose a low-complexity, fast-convergent suboptimal algorithm which uses an opportunistic channel gain-to-noise ratio based subcarrier assignment and an efficient constrained power allocation scheme. The optimality of the latter power allocation scheme is verified as well. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared with the optimal solution, the suboptimal scheme suffers only minor performance loss. We also shown that the use of more transmit antennas by a cognitive base station not only yields better spectrum efficiency but also lessens the outage-induced peak power constraint.	cognitive radio;downtime;duality (optimization);expectation–maximization algorithm;memory management;numerical linear algebra;scheme;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;system analysis	Yuan-Bin Lin;Yu Ted Su	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6213988	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;mathematics;computer network	Mobile	34.47789114901759	90.42933724034965	16196

Throughout the paper, we focus on the scenario of a transmitter with nT = 2 antennas. The idea behind R-TSTD is to use only one antenna at a time while still ensuring that all constellation symbols are transmitted via both antennas. Thus, unlike the classical TSTD technique, R-TSTD does provide a transmit diversity effect similar to that achieved with space-time coding (STC) algorithms. The error performance of the proposed R-TSTD system is compared to that of the Alamouti STC scheme via Monte Carlo computer simulations. It is shown that, in the absence of any outer error-correcting code, Alamouti STC slightly outperforms R-TSTD. However, when a near-capacity channel code is employed as an outer code, the error performance achieved using R-TSTD is significantly better than that obtained with Alamouti STC, provided that the desired spectral efficiency is sufficiently low.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;channel capacity;computer simulation;concatenated error correction code;forward error correction;monte carlo method;spectral efficiency;transmitter;turbo code;whole earth 'lectronic link	Boon Kien Khoo;Stéphane Y.

In particular, the receiver consumes the harvested energy in decoding the received data and bidirectional energy cooperation is allowed between any two nodes in order to facilitate data transmission and decoding. Our objective is to maximize the number of decoded bits at the receiver, assuming offline knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) and the energy harvesting profiles. We first show that the original problem can be decomposed into an inner problem in which we optimize over the energy transfer variables and an outer problem that characterizes the optimal power allocation. For the inner problem, we derive analytical expressions for the energy transfer variables in terms of the fading coefficients and the energy transfer efficiencies between the nodes. On the other hand, the outer problem is solved using a generalized iterative directional water-filling algorithm. The numerical results show that transmitters and receiver energy cooperation can significantly enhance the system performance.	channel state information;coefficient;download;iterative method;numerical analysis;online and offline;transmitter;water filling algorithm	Shiyang Leng;Abdelrahman M.

First, we consider a discrete moduloadditive channel with alphabet X , where the noise sequence Z is arbitrary and unknown and may causally depend on the transmitted and received sequences and on the encoder’s message, possibly in an adversarial fashion. Although the classical capacity of this channel is zero, we show that rates approaching the empirical capacity log |X | − Hemp(Z) can be universally attained, where Hemp(Z) is the empirical entropy of Z. For the more general setting where the channel can map its input to an output in an arbitrary unknown fashion subject only to causality, we model the empirical channel actions as the modulo-addition of a realized noise sequence, and show that the same result applies if common randomness is available. The results are proved constructively, by providing a simple sequential transmission scheme approaching the empirical capacity. In part II of this work we demonstrate how even higher rates can be attained by using more elaborate models for channel actions, and by utilizing possible empirical dependencies in its behavior.

We consider a MANET that consists of    $n_{s}$    multicast sessions. Each multicast session has one source and    $p$    destinations. Each source sends identical information to the    $p$    destinations in its multicast session, and the information is required to be delivered to all the    $p$    destinations within    $D$    time-slots. Assuming the wireless mobiles move according to a 2-D independently and identically distributed mobility model, we first prove that the capacity per multicast session is    $O(\min \{1, (\log p)(\log (n_{s}p)) ({{D}/{n_{s}}})^{1/2}\})$   .  1   We then propose a joint coding/scheduling algorithm achieving a throughput of    $\Theta (\min \{1,{({D}/{n_{s}})}^{1/2}\})$   .

d3e4a98ae9688e08b681ad789e95e9017dd43b72	a multi-memory multi-population memetic algorithm for dynamic shortest path routing in mobile ad-hoc networks		This study investigates the dynamic shortest path routing (DSPR) problem in mobile ad-hoc networks. The goal is to find the shortest possible path that connects a source node with the destination node while effectively handling dynamic changes occurring on the ad-hoc networks. The key challenge in DSPR is how to simultaneously keep track changes and search for the global optima. A multi-memory based multi-population memetic algorithm is proposed for DSPR in this paper. The proposed algorithm combines the strength of three different strategies, multi-memory, multi-population and memetic algorithm, aiming to effectively explore and exploit the search space. It divides the search space by multiple populations. The distribution of solutions in each population is kept in the associated memory. The multimemory multi-population approach is to capture dynamic changes and maintain search diversity. The memetic component, which is a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and local search, is to find high quality solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark DSPR instances under both cyclic and acyclic environments. Our method obtained better results when compared with existing methods in the literatures, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in handling dynamic optimisation.	hoc (programming language);memetic algorithm;memetics;routing;shortest path problem	Nasser R.

4bec61474f0c84e5bd17aaff8f9b105e1da139f5	on the capacity of the two-user symmetric interference channel with transmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints	receivers;transmitters;integrated circuit modeling;interference channels;encoding	This paper studies the value of limited rate cooperation between the transmitters for managing interference and simultaneously ensuring secrecy, in the two-user Gaussian symmetric interference channel (IC). First, the problem is studied in the symmetric linear deterministic IC (SLDIC) setting, and achievable schemes are proposed, based on interference cancelation, relaying of the other user's data bits, and transmission of random bits. In the proposed achievable scheme, the limited rate cooperative link is used to share a combination of data bits and random bits depending on the model parameters. Outer bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived, using a novel partitioning of the encoded messages and outputs depending on the relative strength of the signal and the interference. The partitioning helps to bound certain negative entropy terms, leading to a tractable outer bound. The inner and outer bounds are derived under all possible parameter settings. It is found that, for some parameter settings, the inner and outer bounds match, yielding the capacity of the SLDIC under transmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints. In some other scenarios, the achievable rate matches with the capacity region of the two-user SLDIC without secrecy constraints derived by Wang and Tse; thus, the proposed scheme offers secrecy for free, in these cases. Inspired by the achievable schemes and outer bounds in the deterministic case, achievable schemes and outer bounds are derived in the Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian case is based on Marton's coding scheme and stochastic encoding along with dummy message transmission. One of the key techniques used in the achievable scheme for both the models is interference cancelation, which simultaneously offers two seemingly conflicting benefits: it cancels interference and ensures secrecy. Many of the results derived in this paper extend to the asymmetric case also. The results show that limited transmitter cooperation can greatly facilitate secure communications over two-user ICs.	arithmetic coding;catastrophic interference;cobham's thesis;dummy variable (statistics);integrated circuit;interference (communication);negentropy;secure communication;transmitter	Parthajit Mohapatra;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2593624	transmitter;telecommunications;mathematics;encoding	Mobile	34.97429054848639	70.70481501520982	16306

AHVN is an integrated architecture between the vehicular ad hoc NETwork (VANET) and the existing vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) network. The proposed MAC is based on an adaptive backoff algorithm for accessing cooperative codes in V2I network while taking into account the failure connectivity probability in VANET. Further, we utilize a Markov chain to study the analysis of the backoff algorithm to access the cooperative channel codes. The metrics performance of the proposed scheme is measured in terms of vehicular throughput, average packet delay, access probability, and code utilization. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme attains to deliver both a delay- sensitive level of service for safety applications and satisfy QoS contracts for pre-negotiated non- safety applications.	algorithm;backoff;code;hoc (programming language);markov chain;network packet;numerical analysis;quality of service;throughput;vehicle-to-vehicle	Saied M.

The transmission scheme is based on orthogonal beam division multiplexing (OBDM) and minimum MSE beamforming, i.e., the data is sequentially transmitted by means of different transmit beamformers, whereas the receive beamformers are selected to minimize the MSE of the linear MMSE receiver.

For the proposed nonlinear secure transceiver, we reveal the mechanism behind which makes this nonlinear precoding superior than the linear precoding methods in guaranteeing secrecy of wireless multiuser multi-antenna systems. We also obtain analytical bounds of the ergodic secrecy rate of each legitimate receiver and the ergodic secrecy sum rate of the system. Based on the analytical result, the near optimal power allocation to the information signals and AN can be obtained using numerical method.

Fortunately, many user tasks are delay-tolerant, which offers the network users a favorable degree of freedom in waiting for and accessing the opportunistic resource at the time of its best quality. For such delay-tolerant and opportunistic resource sharing networks (DT-ORS-Net), the corresponding optimal accessing strategies developed in existing literature mainly focus on the single-user scenarios, while the potential competition from other peer users in practical multi-user DT-ORS-Net is often ignored. Considering this, a multi-player Markov stopping game (M-MSG) is developed in this work, and the derived Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy of this M-MSG can guide network users to properly handle the potential competition from other peers and thus exploit the time diversity of the opportunistic resource more effectively, which in turn further improves the resource utilization efficiency. Applications in the cloud-computing and the mobile crowdsourcing networks are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and simulation results show that using the NE strategy of the proposed M-MSG can provide substantial performance gain as compared to using the conventional single-user optimal one.	cloud computing;crowdsourcing;grid computing;markov chain;multi-user;nash equilibrium;scenario (computing);simulation	Xiaofan He;Huaiyu Dai;Peng Ning;Rudra Dutta	2016	IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524350	simulation;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Robotics	31.367386575682694	94.39702315578245	16354

Several solutions have been proposed for improving the transmission rate of unicast communications using frame receptions/losses, BER (Bit Error Rate) and SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) measurements. Nevertheless, rate adaptation for multicast transmissions represents a more challenging tasks due to the complexity of estimating the reception correlation of wireless links. This paper presents a novel scheme for selecting the best transmission rate for multicast communications using the packet reception correlation of the links established among the nodes of the multicast group with the access point. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a real-life testbed using commercial wireless cards. The results show that our solution accurately estimates the reception correlation of wireless links, thus considerably increasing the performance of multicast transmissions up to 3x and 5x in terms of throughput and delay, respectively.	algorithm;bit error rate;data rate units;linux;middleware;multicast;network packet;real life;signal-to-noise ratio;testbed;throughput;unicast;wireless access point;x.690	Stefano Paris;Nicolò Facchi;Francesco Gringoli;Antonio Capone	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6691882	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;wireless lan controller;wi-fi array;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;fixed wireless;xcast;computer network	Mobile	9.8486912932966	89.52645785996843	16374

The main objective here is to improve quality of service by efficient channel utilization. In this paper, a new scheme called probabilistic emergency prioritization scheme (PEPS) is proposed which provides highest priority for emergency calls. The proposed method minimizes the dropping or blocking of emergency calls even if the number of emergency calls are more than 25% of the calls. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed scheme works better than the existing adaptive probabilistic scheduling scheme (APS).	throughput	N Mohan Babu K. RamaMohanBabuK.;K. N.

We extend the use of this notion to wireless multi-hop networks, e.g. ad hoc networks, where the link capacities at the flow level are not fixed but depend on lower layer issues such as scheduling and interference. Utilizing this extension we present the theoretical framework for flow level performance analysis of elastic traffic in the setting, assuming that the wireless bandwidth resources are subject to linear constraints. We discuss how different physical and access layer configurations can be described by the linear constraint model and devise an efficient computational scheme for solving the system. The concepts and the computational scheme are illustrated by a number of examples.	computation;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing)	Aleksi Penttinen;Jorma T.

Such a complicated system is typically challenging and requires distributed solutions. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem in fog computing to maximize the utility function from the energy efficiency perspective. The formulated problem is a mix integer nonlinear programming problem, which is NP-hard. We adopt a modified distributed inner convex approximation (NOVA) to approximate the problem first. Then, the Benders decomposition algorithm is applied to deal with integer variables. In the subproblem, we use the Dinkelbach algorithm to transform the fractional programming into an equivalent parametric subtractive form. Furthermore, the subproblem is decomposed distributedly, which enables users to update without information exchange. The simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	approximation algorithm;benders decomposition;computation;fog computing;fractional programming;information exchange;inner loop;local variable;np-hardness;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;simulation;utility	Ye Yu;Xiangyuan Bu;Kai Yang;Zhu Han	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422199	nonlinear programming;cloud computing;approximation algorithm;parametric statistics;fractional programming;algorithm;integer;edge computing;resource allocation;computer science	Robotics	31.331035793878023	92.6410811442112	16432
567b12f4ab34e9e07ab9d2052897df96076a345e	analyzing voltage bias and temperature induced aging effects in photonic interconnects for manycore computing		Silicon photonic interconnects are being considered for integration in future networks-on-chip (NoCs) as they can enable higher bandwidth and lower latency data transfers at the speed of light. Such photonic interconnects consist of photonic waveguides with dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) for signal traversal and microring resonators (MRs) for signal modulation and detection. To enable MRs to modulate and detect DWDM photonic signals, carrier injection in MRs through their voltage biasing is essential. But long-term operation of MRs with constant or time-varying temperature and voltage biasing causes aging. Such voltage bias temperature induced (VBTI) aging in MRs leads to resonance wavelength drifts and Q-factor degradation, which increases signal loss and energy delay product in photonic NoCs (PNoCs) that utilize photonic interconnects. This paper explores VBTI aging in MRs and demonstrates its impacts on PNoC architectures for the first time. Our system-level experimental results on two PNoC architectures indicate that VBTI aging increases signal loss in these architectures by up to 7.6dB and increases EDP by up to 26.8% over a span of 5 years.	biasing;electrical connection;electronic data processing;elegant degradation;manycore processor;modulation;multi-core processor;optical computing;parametric oscillator;resonance;system on a chip;wavelength-division multiplexing	Sai Vineel Reddy Chittamuru;Ishan G.

We also show its cost-effective areas in different cases of cost calculation. The obtained results indicate that it is very promising for future regional/metro networks, which demand a large number of wavelengths.	centralized computing;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;metro (design language);network architecture;numerical analysis	Yueping Cai;Eiji Oki;Motoharu Matsuura;Naoto Kishi;Tetsuya Miki	2009		10.1109/ICC.2009.5199275	telecommunications;computer science;resource management;band-pass filter	Mobile	26.074096837825724	87.76042128733881	16443

However, to achieve IA, users have to bear heavy burdens, such as providing enough dimensions, acquiring global channel statement information and affording high computational complexity, which makes IA difficult to apply in practical networks. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a centralized IA (CIA) scheme, where a relay is employed to off-load the burden of mobile users, i.e., interferences are aligned only by the relay. Furthermore, considering that the receivers still need to zero-force the aligned interference, another scheme called centralized zero-forcing (CZF) is proposed to further reduce the burden of the receivers. Closed-form solutions and feasibility conditions of both schemes are presented. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.	centralized computing;computational complexity theory;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;maximal set;relay;simulation;transceiver;zero-forcing precoding	Xuanheng Li;Yi Sun;Nan Zhao;Fei Richard Yu;Zhehui Xu	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2465381	transmitter;telecommunications;mathematics;interference;co-channel interference;statistics;mimo	Mobile	40.44120084955298	86.66987100088491	16451

We consider a wireless communication system composed of a single transmitter and multiple legitimate users in the presence of several eavesdroppers with each node having multiple antennas under quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel. The transmitter selects the best transmitting antenna and the best user to maximize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the selected user. The user and eavesdropper can employ either selection combining (SC) or maximal ratio combining (MRC) to combine the received signals. New closed-form expressions for probability of positive secrecy and outage are derived. Moreover, asymptotic analysis reveals the outage diversity gain and array gain for the proposed scheme. The impact of number of users, eavesdroppers, and antennas on secrecy performance are clearly demonstrated with mathematical analysis and numerical results.	downtime;maximal set;multi-user;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;thermal-assisted switching;transmitter	Anish Prasad Shrestha;Kyung Sup Kwak	2014	EURASIP J.

In multicarrier systems, because of sensitiveness to frequency offset, estimation and compensation are of great importance, which determine system performance directly. In this paper, we consider this problem in FBMC-OQAM system, and based on the property of it, a proper structure of preamble sequence, combined with classic parameter estimator, is proposed to achieve joint estimation of Doppler Rate, integer Doppler Frequency and fractional Doppler Frequency in FBMC-OQAM system. Simulation results show that performance of the scheme approaches ML estimation.

This gives results of a precision that commonly applied traffic spreading methods in planning tools cannot achieve and gets more and more important when planning micro cells.

A strive for “intelligent” cars, at certain stage probably even entirely autonomous, has triggered advanced studies — in both academia and industry. One of the significant issues to be addressed is how to efficiently share the available radio resources among various type of eligible users: legacy cellular and those emerging vehicle-type UEs. This paper proposes an enhanced algorithm for ensuring a robust co-existence of the aforementioned system users. This underlay Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithm attempts to mitigate the interferences and ensure the different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications.

The steepest decent method converges quickly at initial iterations and has less computational complexity. The performance of Taylor series method depends on initial estimation. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of these methods. Results show that HOA achieves better performance on position accuracy as it takes the advantages of both the methods.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;experiment;iteration;location (geography);optimizing compiler;sensor;series expansion;simulation	Lichuan Liu;Geetha Mavidi	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.189	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computational complexity theory	Robotics	16.875640482446222	74.86759106045372	16575

The overhead of dynamic SKB management has been considered as the significant bottleneck in packet I/O. Some novel non-SKB mechanisms, such as DPDK, were thus proposed to solve the problem. However, these mechanisms usually cannot be widely adopted in the data path of most packet forwarding applications, due to their incompatibility with SKB. In this paper, a new SKB-compatible mechanism, namely Self-described buffer (SDB), is proposed to improve the efficiency of packet I/O. SDB eliminates SKB allocation/deallocation overhead by offloading SKB management into NIC hardware. It also reduces the overhead of dynamic binding/unbinding operations existed in SKB management by statically binding related information in advance using the free space of Databuf. To evaluate the proposed approach, a SDB-enabled NIC and its driver has been designed and implemented based on FPGA. Experimental results show that the proposed SDB achieves 2× throughput compared with a traditional SKB mechanism in raw packet forwarding, and 34.75% improvement for typical network forwarding applications (e.g. IP forwarding, Bridge forwarding and SDN forwarding) on average.	asynchronous i/o;bridging (networking);central processing unit;dpdk / dpdk.org;data structure;field-programmable gate array;input/output;late binding;linux;memory management;network interface controller;network packet;network processor;operating system;overhead (computing);protocol stack;sdb (debugger);software incompatibility;software-defined networking;throughput	Jinli Yan;Lu Tang;Zhigang Sun;Tao Li;Donglai Xu	2016	2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)	10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590426	communications protocol;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;metadata;linux kernel;computer network	OS	-4.34296568095484	65.07741248425437	16591

MPICH2 is the most famous implementation of MPI, inherited from MPICH, features a completely new design which to provide more performances and flexibilities. However, optical fiber is a based on circuit-switched network, which can dynamicly establish and disconnect lightpaths when needed. The communication operations in MPI are designed for package-switched networks such as Ethernet, which can not support the feature of dynamic connection and disconnection.

b52e26d47a9551d5ebae25915e44a7d99618e6bc	bio-inspired scheme for congestion control in wireless sensor networks		Congestion in a network is determined by the resource constraints and the number of deployed sensor nodes. Congestion can significantly degrade the quality of services (QoS) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) regarding throughput and end-to-end delay. In this paper, a hybrid bio-inspired algorithm is proposed for congestion control in large-scale WSNs. First, a competitive Lotka-Volterra (C-LV) model to avoid congestion is employed, while fairness among sensor nodes is maintained. Second, particles swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to enhance C-LV by optimizing the parameter for minimizing end-to-end delay. PSO makes this scheme adaptive to change. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme improves the QoS in WSNs.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;logical volume management;lotka–volterra equations;mathematical optimization;network congestion;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;simulation;throughput;volterra's function	Muhammad Royyan;Muhammad Rusyadi Ramli;Jae-Min Lee;Dong-Seong Kim	2018	2018 14th IEEE International Workshop on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS)	10.1109/WFCS.2018.8402366	swarm behaviour;wireless sensor network;throughput;computer science;computer network;quality of service;network congestion;particle swarm optimization	Embedded	7.468752527978852	83.45685449678368	16645

We present and analyze a transmission scheme for the hybrid FSO/RF communication system based on adaptive combining. Specifically, only FSO link is active as long as the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the FSO receiver is above a certain threshold level. When it falls below this threshold level, the RF link is activated along with the FSO link and the signals from the two links are combined at the receiver using a dual-branch maximal ratio combiner. Novel analytical expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received SNR for the proposed hybrid system is obtained. This CDF expression is used to study the system outage performance. Numerical examples are presented to compare the outage performance of the proposed hybrid FSO/RF system with that of the FSO-only and RF-only systems.	diplexer;downtime;hybrid system;maximal set;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;turbulence	Tamer Rakia;Hong-Chuan Yang;Mohamed-Slim Alouini;Fayez Gebali	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2443771	telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;radio frequency	Mobile	34.15794328045639	80.83741861764716	16683

In particular, we are interested in geographic routing solutions with a very limited control overhead and overall bandwidth consumption. Existing geographic multicast routing protocols require nodes to periodically exchange beacon messages to gather information about the position of their neighbors. These beacons represent a waste of resources, specially in areas of the network with no active communications. Beacons also induce significant problems in real deployments such as interferences and collisions that cause inconsistencies in neighboring tables. In this paper we propose a new beacon-less geographic multicast routing protocol called BRUMA. Unlike previous solutions, BRUMA uses the propagation of data packets to opportunistically select next hops among those that are reachable from the sending node. This allows the protocol to overcome most of the issues of beacon-based solutions in real deployments. Our simulations show that BRUMA achieves a higher packet delivery ratio and a lower overall bandwidth consumption than GMR, which is the protocol performing best among existing geographic multicast solutions.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);geographic routing;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);simulation;software propagation	Juan A.

We analyze the performance of a receive antenna selection scheme in spectrum sharing systems where the antenna that results in highest signal-to-interference plus noise ratio at the secondary receiver is selected to improve the performance of secondary transmission. Exact and asymptotic behaviours of the received SINR are derived for both general and interference limited scenarios over general fading environment. These results are then applied to the outage and average bit error rate analysis when the secondary transmitter changes the transmit power in finite discrete levels to satisfy the instantaneous interference constraint at the primary receiver.	bit error rate;cognitive radio;downtime;interference (communication);numerical analysis;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	Muhammad Fainan Hanif;Hong-Chuan Yang;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2363163	cognitive radio;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;mathematics;interference;co-channel interference;signal-to-noise ratio;fading	Mobile	37.69569587985558	80.07923346294024	16771
9ed51e331617e9eb3e68c74bb3af67e70b8933fc	iterative equalization with decision feedback based on expectation propagation		This paper investigates the design and analysis of minimum mean square error (MMSE) turbo decision feedback equalization (DFE), with expectation propagation (EP), for single carrier modulations. Classical non iterative DFE structures have substantial advantages at high-data rates, even compared with turbo linear equalizers-interference cancellers (LE-IC), hence making turbo DFE-IC schemes an attractive solution. In this paper, we derive an iterative DFE-IC, capitalizing on the use of soft feedback based on expectation propagation, along with the use of prior information for improved filtering and interference cancellation. This turbo iterative DFE-IC significantly outperforms turbo LE-IC, especially at high-spectral efficiency and also exhibits performance improvements over existing DFE-IC variants. The proposed scheme can also be self-iterated, as done in the recent trend on EP-based equalizers, and it is shown to be an attractive alternative to linear self-iterated receivers. For time-varying (TV) filter equalizers, an efficient matrix inversion scheme is also proposed, considerably reducing the computational complexity relative to existing methods. Using finite-length and asymptotic analysis on a severely selective channel, the proposed DFE-IC is shown to achieve higher rates than known alternatives, with better waterfall thresholds and faster convergence, while keeping a similar computational complexity.	computational complexity theory;expectation propagation;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mean squared error;software propagation;spectral efficiency	Serdar &#x015E;ahin;Antonio Maria Cipriano;Charly Poulliat;Marie-Laure Boucheret	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2843760	asymptotic analysis;single antenna interference cancellation;control theory;computational complexity theory;filter (signal processing);equalization (audio);expectation propagation;minimum mean square error;computer science;communication channel	Vision	50.91303298486733	80.26340144035954	16781

The most important 802.11n MAC enhancement is frame aggregation which significantly reduces the headers overheads of the legacy MAC by aggregating multiple frames into a single large frame. In this paper we drive an analytical model to study the impact of the frame aggregation on the saturation throughput and access delay under error-prone channels. We describe the throughput as a function of physical data rate, and Frame Error Rate(FER). The analytical results show that the throughput and delay depend significantly on MPDU subframes size in high FER channels. Thus, We propose an algorithm which can dynamically adjust the MPDU subframe size based on the maximum FER tolerable by frame's access category. We use the feedback Block Acknowledgement (BACK) frame to compute the next MPDU subframe size which can takes into account the FER and the delay QoS requirements for the corresponding access category traffic.	algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;data rate units;network performance;quality of service;requirement;simulation;throughput;uncompressed video	Nasreddine Hajlaoui;Issam Jabri;Maher Ben Jemaa	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583565	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;short interframe space;computer science;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Mobile	6.738173067251637	95.97475006268304	16792

A specific case where the user prefers to be served by the RAT which has the least service cost is modeled and evaluated using Markov decision process.

In this paper we propose a new handover control method for the next generation mobile multimedia networks, in which the handover setup process is done in advance of a handover request by predicting the handover cell from mobile terminal's current position. The handover procedures for real-time sessions are performed based on the handover cell information and the resource reservation condition. The radio resources in the estimated adjacent cells should be reserved and allocated to guarantee the continuity of the real-time sessions. We conduct a simulation model that is focused on the handover failure rate and packet loss rate. The simulation results show that our proposed method provides better performance than the previous methods.

It is robust to the changes in channel distribution and SNR range. The performance for a VLC system using 16-quadrature amplitude modulation is presented in terms of mean square error (MSE) and uncoded bit error rate. In the high SNR range, the proposed scheme improves the MSE up to more than 10 dB.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information	Tian Zhang;Shuxu Guo;Haipeng Chen;Fei Zhong;Chunyang Ma	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0649	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;mean squared error;statistics	Mobile	49.058558288170026	78.92260892914663	16827

For any general time synchronization protocol involving a two-way message exchange mechanism, e.g., timing synch protocol for sensor networks (TPSN) [see S. Ganeriwal, R. Kumar, and M. B. Srivastava, """"Timing Synch Protocol for Sensor Networks,"""" in Proceedings of the First International Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems,"""" 2003, pp. 138-149], the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for clock offset under the exponential delay model was derived in [D.

Since all practical clocks are running at different rates with respect to each other, the skew correction becomes important for achieving long term synchronization since it results in the reduction of the number of message exchanges and hence minimization of power consumption. In this paper, the joint MLE of clock offset and skew under the exponential delay model for a two way timing message exchange mechanism and the corresponding algorithms for finding these estimates are presented. Since any time synchronization protocol involves real time message exchanges between the sensor nodes, ML estimates for other synchronization protocols can be derived by employing a similar procedure. In addition, due to the computational complexity of the MLE, a simple, computationally efficient and easy to implement algorithm is presented as an alternative to the ML estimator which particularly suits the low power demanding regime of wireless sensor networks."""	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;clock skew;clock synchronization;computational complexity theory;embedded system;time complexity	Qasim M.

The proposed schemes leverage consecutive uses of a single transmit antenna combined with automatic repeat request (ARQ) feedback, possibly with multiple receive antennas. Unlike multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications without feedback, the schemes we propose allow for low-complexity transmitters and receivers because they do not require a space-time encoder or decoder. We compare the performance of IMIMO schemes with the corresponding MIMO system without feedback using outage probability as the metric for comparison. These comparisons show that for relatively low rates IMIMO schemes have better performance than the corresponding MIMO system without feedback. For higher rates, MIMO does better up to a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but beyond that threshold IMIMO schemes again have better performance.	algorithm;automatic repeat request;code;downtime;encoder;feedback;mimo;multiplexing;next-generation network;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Peyman Hesami;J.

Under similar conditions, (discrete) Shannon entropy is shown to be O(n)-Lipschitz in distributions over the product space with respect to Ornstein's d̅-distance (Wasserstein distance corresponding to the Hamming distance). These results together with Talagrand's and Marton's transportation-information inequalities allow one to replace the unknown multi-user interference with its i.i.d. approximations. As an application, a new outer bound for the two-user Gaussian interference channel is proved, which, in particular, settles the “missing corner point” problem of Costa (1985).	approximation;differential entropy;entropy (information theory);hamming distance;interference (communication);multi-user;shannon (unit)	Yury Polyanskiy;Yihong Wu	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541691	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;mathematics;statistics	Arch	35.81207263709966	69.23165799877772	16852

In this paper we develop techniques based on existing long term evolution (LTE) measurements - open loop power control (OLPC) and pilot sequence reuse schemes, that avoid PC within a group of cells. We compare the performance of simple least-squares channel estimator with the higher-complexity minimum mean square error estimator, and evaluate the performance of the recently proposed coordinated pilot allocation (CPA) technique (which is appropriate in cooperative systems). The performance measures of interest include the normalized mean square error of channel estimation, the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise and spectral efficiency when employing maximum ratio transmission or zero forcing precoding at the base station. We find that for terminals moving at vehicular speeds, PC can be effectively mitigated in an operation and maintenance node using both the OLPC and the pilot reuse schemes. Additionally, greedy CPA provides performance gains only for a fraction of terminals, at the cost of degradation for the rest of the terminals and higher complexity. These results indicate that in practice, PC may be effectively mitigated without the need for second-order channel statistics or inter-cell cooperation.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;coherence (physics);compaq lte;consensus dynamics;elegant degradation;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);least squares;mimo;mean squared error;pilot ace;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;whole earth 'lectronic link	Vidit Saxena;Gábor Fodor;Eleftherios Karipidis	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145932	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Mobile	40.15382228301882	85.59354317730714	16868

The IEEE 802.16e WiMAX standard enables the deployment of metropolitan area networks to mobile terminals in non-line-of-sight radio environments. Current concerns include leveraging high data rates, increasing area coverage, and competing with beyond 3G networks. Based on the IEEE 802.16e wirelessMAN-OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) physical (PHY) layer air-interface, this paper presents a physical layer study of MIMO enabled mobile WiMAX in an urban environment.

5e3429fb64ddc197ad5bb793ea38e0c44639f57d	a study on the impact of delayed packet forwarding in content-centric networking		Recently, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) has been extensively studied by networking researchers as a promising network architecture to realize an information-centric network. In CCN, to reduce the amount of redundant Interest and Data packet transmissions, routers can aggregate multiple Interest packets requesting the identical content into a single packet. In the literature, the effect of Interest packet aggregation at CCN router on the performance has been investigated. In this paper, we analyze the impact of delayed packet forwarding at routers on the performance of CCN. With delayed packet forwarding, every router does not immediately forward the Interest packet; instead, it intentionally delays packet forwarding by a fixed amount of time. We analytically derive the content delivery delay with and without delayed packet forwarding at routers to reveal the impact of delayed packet forwarding.	aggregate data;cyclomatic complexity;digital distribution;network architecture;network packet;router (computing)	Yuichi Yasuda;Ryo Nakamura;Hiroyuki Ohsaki	2018	2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00170	real-time computing;packet aggregation;network architecture;computer network;propagation delay;computer science;router;packet forwarding;network packet;content centric networking	Networks	-3.359057107993378	90.67693941733725	16880

Nevertheless, these models do have computational and analytical difficulties. Motivated by this context, we propose a mixture gamma (MG) distribution for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of wireless channels. Not only is it a more accurate model for composite fading, but is also a versatile approximation for any fading SNR. As this distribution consists of N (≥ 1) component gamma distributions, we show how its parameters can be determined by using probability density function (PDF) or moment generating function (MGF) matching. We demonstrate the accuracy of the MG model by computing the mean square error (MSE) or the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or by comparing the moments. With this model, performance metrics such as the average channel capacity, the outage probability, the symbol error rate (SER), and the detection capability of an energy detector are readily derived.	approximation;channel capacity;computation;kullback–leibler divergence;mean squared error;mg (editor);multipath propagation;portable document format;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage	Saman Atapattu;Chintha Tellambura;Hai Jiang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.111210.102115	fading distribution;pattern recognition;mathematics;channel state information;kullback–leibler divergence;fading;statistics	Mobile	38.72770093786586	77.13986709306666	16902

Although more sophisticated digital communication techniques can be used to combat ISI, the lack of available multibit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) has primarily limited their use. A promising approach to relax the ADC requirements so as to enable Nyquist-rate digitization is to channelize the received signal into multiple frequency subbands and then sample using a bank of low-frequency ADCs. In this brief, the digital processing required in such a channelized receiver is presented. The use of single-carrier cyclic prefixed communication is also proposed to reduce the computational complexity in channels with moderate-to-large ISI.	analog-to-digital converter;catastrophic interference;channelization (telecommunications);computational complexity theory;digital data;information sciences institute;interference (communication);nyquist rate;requirement;serial communication	Won Namgoong;Lei Feng	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2010.2047314	frequency modulation;serial communication;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;equalization;telecommunications;computer science;noise;electrical engineering;adaptive behavior;filter bank;low frequency;radio receiver;computational complexity theory;intersymbol interference	Visualization	53.65456227227513	77.0979672299395	16922

In addition to capacity and coverage gains, the usage of Relay Stations (RSs) minimizes the networks Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operating Expense (OpEx). In this paper, a comparison is made, from an economical perspective, between a LTE network composed entirely by evolved NodeBs (eNBs) and other scenarios which use additional RSs. The aim of the paper is to determine the conditions for a suitable eNB to RSs replacement, and the associated economical benefits.	compaq lte;internet relay chat;social capital;software deployment;user experience	André Martins;António Rodrigues;Pedro Vieira	2013	2013 16th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)		telecommunications;lte advanced;computer network	Mobile	23.584764336634528	89.51890947985602	16923
c419f4dc2dd0538b90bc9235f5698022b4828774	multi-robot enhanced manet intelligent routing at uncertain and vulnerable tactical edge		This paper investigates the problem of intelligent resilient routing in a multi-autonomous robot enhanced network at uncertain and vulnerable tactical edge. To further increase the network interoperability, many emerging network protocols, such as opportunistic mobile network routing protocols, integrated social network into communication network through utilizing social mobility and opportunistic carry and forward routing algorithms. However, in practical harsh environment such as a battlefield, the uncertainty of social mobility and complexity of vulnerable environment due to unpredictable physical and cyber attacks from enemy, would seriously affect the effectiveness and practicality of these emerging network protocols. This paper proposes a GT-SaRE-MANET (Game Theoretic Situation-aware Robot Enhanced Mobile Ad-hoc Network)routing protocol that adopt the online game theoretic reinforcement learning technique to design the mobility of multi-robot as well as handle the uncertainty and potential physical and cyber attack at tactical edge. Firstly, a set of game theoretic mission oriented metrics has been introduced to describe the interrelation among network quality, multi-robot mobility as well as potential attacking activities. Then, a distributed multi-agent game theoretic reinforcement learning algorithm has been developed. It will not only optimize GT-SaRE-MANET routing protocol and the mobility of multi-robots online, but also effectively avoid the physical and/or cyber attacks from enemy by using the game theoretic mission oriented metrics. The effectiveness of proposed design has been demonstrated through computer aided simulation and hardware experiments.

Load balanced clustering effectively organize the network into a connected hierarchy. Clustering is a discrete problem that can have more than one solution under different operating constraints. In this scenario, meta-heuristic algorithms are found suitable because they give set of solutions in acceptable time constraints. In the literature, several analytical and meta-heuristic approaches have been developed for load balanced clustering. In this paper, a novel harmony search based energy efficient load balanced clustering algorithm is presented and it is tested on a large sample network. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach has faster convergence and gives reliable and efficient load balanced clustering as compared to conventional harmony search algorithm (HSA) and several other methods in the literature. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed approach is also verified for different cases of fixed and variable parameters of HSA.	cluster analysis;harmony search	Surjit Singh;Rajeev Mohan Sharma	2018	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-017-0365-5	correlation clustering;constrained clustering;network topology;computer science;cluster analysis;data stream clustering;mathematical optimization;load balancing (computing);distributed computing;convergence (routing);cure data clustering algorithm	ML	8.424374355883131	80.18788643866583	16964

Primary signals are typically detected with uncalibrated receivers at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) well below decodability levels. Multiantenna detectors exploit spatial independence of receiver thermal noise to boost detection performance and robustness. We study the problem of detecting a Gaussian signal with rank-P unknown spatial covariance matrix in spatially uncorrelated Gaussian noise with unknown covariance using multiple antennas. The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is derived for two scenarios. In the first one, the noises at all antennas are assumed to have the same (unknown) variance, whereas in the second, a generic diagonal noise covariance matrix is allowed in order to accommodate calibration uncertainties in the different antenna frontends. In the latter case, the GLRT statistic must be obtained numerically, for which an efficient method is presented. Furthermore, for asymptotically low SNR, it is shown that the GLRT does admit a closed form, and the resulting detector performs well in practice. Extensions are presented in order to account for unknown temporal correlation in both signal and noise, as well as frequency-selective channels.	cognitive radio;johnson–nyquist noise;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	David Ramírez;Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar;Roberto López-Valcarce;Javier Vía;Ignacio Santamaría	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2146779	econometrics;cognitive radio;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	ML	49.684881287476074	86.48097781544702	16987

Then we propose an adaptive cooperative downlink transmission scheme to enhance system capacity. In this proposed scheme, large-scale fading information between MS and RAUs is employed to decide the most appropriate mode from three available modes named CT-1, CT-2, CT-3. Selection criterion is the ergodic capacity corresponding three transmission modes.

However, the high cost of implementation and high decomposing latency of the SVD restricts its usage in current wireless communication applications. In this paper, we present a complete adaptive SVD algorithm and a reconfigurable architecture for high-throughput MIMO-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. There are several proposed architectural design techniques: reconfigurable scheme, division-free adaptive step size scheme, early termination scheme, and data interleaving scheme. The reconfigurable scheme can support all antenna configurations in a MIMO system. The division-free adaptive step size and early termination schemes are used to effectively reduce the decomposing latency and improve hardware utilization. The data interleaving scheme helps to deal with several channel matrices concurrently. Besides, we propose an orthogonal reconstruction scheme to obtain more accurate SVD outputs, and then the system performance will be greatly enhanced. We apply our SVD design to the IEEE 802.11 n applications. This design is implemented and fabricated in UMC 90 nm 1P9M CMOS technology. The maximum operating frequency is measured to be at 101.2 MHz, and the corresponding power dissipation is at 125 mW. The core size is 2.17 mm2 and the die size occupies 4.93 mm2. The chip result shows that the average latency is only 0.33% of the wireless local area network coherence time. Hence, the proposed reconfigurable adaptive SVD engine design is very suitable for high-throughput wireless communication applications.	adaptive stepsize;algorithm;cmos;cpu power dissipation;clock rate;die (integrated circuit);forward error correction;frequency divider;high-throughput computing;mimo;mimo-ofdm;singular value decomposition;spatial multiplexing gain;throughput;umc (computer)	Yen-Liang Chen;Cheng-Zhou Zhan;Ting-Jyun Jheng;An-Yeu Wu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2195040	adaptive filter;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;singular value decomposition	Arch	46.932550153904394	64.4645202347854	17046

However, since the spatial-temporal resonances highly depend on the location-specific multipath profile, there exists a strong-weak spatial-temporal resonances effect. In the TR uplink system, different users at different locations enjoy different strengths of spatial-temporal resonances, i.e., the received signal-to-interference-noise ratios (SINRs) for different users vary, and the weak ones can be blocked from correct detection in the presence of strong ones. In this paper, we formulate the strong-weak spatial-temporal resonances in the multiuser TR uplink system as a max-min weighted SINR balancing problem by joint power control and signature design. Then, a novel two-stage adaptive algorithm that can guarantee the convergence is proposed. In stage I, the original nonconvex problem is relaxed into a Perron Frobenius eigenvalue optimization problem and an iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimum efficiently. In stage II, the gradient search method is applied to update the relaxed feasible set until the global optimum for the original optimization problem is obtained. Numerical results show that our algorithm converges quickly, achieves a high energy-efficiency, and provides a performance guarantee to all users.	adaptive algorithm;feasible region;global optimization;gradient;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;maxima and minima;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical method;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;t-symmetry;telecommunications link;transistor	Qinyi Xu;Yan Chen;K.

The basic idea comes from minimum interference routing: select a feasible path that puts the least possible restriction on the available transmission capacity of other communicating parties. This is achieved by circumventing some critical bottleneck links. The main contribution of the paper is a novel characterization of link criticality, the criticality threshold, which can be readily precompiled for routing dozens of subsequent calls. Based on this finding we define a generic precomputation framework for minimum interference routing, the least-critical-path-first routing algorithm. We show by means of extensive simulations that efficient route precomputation is possible even in the case, when accurate resource availability information is not immediately available.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;interference (communication);precomputation;routing;self-organized criticality;simulation	Gábor Rétvári;József Bíró;Tibor Cinkler;Tamás Henk	2005	Proceedings IEEE 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.	10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1497897	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;graph theory;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;critical path method;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Embedded	-2.9850790340130633	86.94841520057288	17073

The user scheduling, time slot allocation, and power control are jointly optimized in order to maximize the system α -fair utility under transmit power constraint and minimum rate constraint. The optimization problem is nonconvex because of the fractional objective function and the nonconvex constraints. To deal with the original problem, we firstly convert the objective function in the optimization problem into a difference of two convex functions (D.C.) form, and then propose a NOMA-TDMA-DC algorithm to exploit the global optimum. Numerical results show that the NOMA-TDMA scheme significantly outperforms the traditional orthogonal multiple access scheme in terms of both spectral efficiency and user fairness.	allocation;converge;convex function;convex optimization;fairness measure;global optimization;internet of things;iteration;manuscripts;mathematical optimization;noma;oma;optimization problem;resource identifier:uri:pt:clinical document:nom;revision procedure;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;tridiagonal matrix algorithm;sensor (device)	Yanjing Sun;Yiyu Guo;Song Li;Dapeng Wu;Bin Wang	2018		10.3390/s18051572	power control;electronic engineering;scheduling (computing);engineering;exploit;mathematical optimization;time division multiple access;convex function;resource allocation;spectral efficiency;optimization problem	AI	34.621716822989576	90.98569313327715	17092

The base station serves multiple mobile users via a multi-hop backhaul relay link by sharing out access link channel resources with maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scheduling. We analyze the performance of the system by deriving closed-form expressions for outage probability, outage capacity, ergodic capacity, average end-to-end SNR and amount of fading (AoF). These measures show that maximum SNR scheduling of multiple users in a cellular relay link offers significant diversity, capacity and SNR improvement over single-user transmission and round robin scheduling. We also relate performance of the relay link to that of a distributed antenna system (DAS), and show that the noisy wireless backhaul relay link induces tolerable performance deterioration compared to deploying a cable-connected distributed antenna.	anisotropic filtering;backhaul (telecommunications);binary logarithm;call stack;downtime;exptime;emoticon;end-to-end principle;ergodic hypothesis;ergodicity;multi-user;portable document format;potential method;profiling (computer programming);relay;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage;telecommunications link;time complexity;variable-gain amplifier	Taneli Riihonen;Risto Wichman;Jyri Hämäläinen	2011	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-009-9832-y	mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	30.445222624867284	84.28599071051917	17102

e55d254070f8f1ed96a464c24e79836a7e6f65a5	mimo radar and cellular coexistence: a power-efficient approach enabled by interference exploitation		We propose a novel approach to enable the coexistence between Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) radar and downlink multiuser multi-input single-output communication system. By exploiting the constructive multiuser interference (MUI), the proposed approach tradeoff useful MUI power for reducing the transmit power, to obtain a power efficient transmission. This paper focuses on two optimization problems: a) Transmit power minimization at the base station (BS), while guaranteeing the receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) level of downlink users and the interference-to-noise ratio level to radar; b) Minimization of the interference from BS to radar for a given requirement of downlink SINR and transmit power budget. To reduce the computational overhead of the proposed scheme in practice, an algorithm based on gradient projection is designed to solve the power minimization problem. In addition, we investigate the tradeoff between the performance of radar and communication, and analytically derive the key metrics for MIMO radar in the presence of the interference from the BS. Finally, a robust power minimization problem is formulated to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed method in the case of imperfect channel state information. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a significant power saving compared to conventional approaches, while obtaining a favorable performance-complexity tradeoff.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;coexist (image);emoticon;gradient;interference (communication);level of measurement;mimo;magic user interface;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical method;overhead (computing);radar;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Fan Liu;Christos Masouros;Ang Li;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah;JianMing Zhou	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2833813	overhead (computing);channel state information;mimo;transmitter power output;communications system;mathematical optimization;telecommunications link;radar;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	38.36643697562075	90.25319483866292	17143

However, when joint coding among all subcarriers is considered during the multiple-access (MAC) phase, the complicated multi-user detection (MUD) operation at the relay node has to be performed to approach the rate region. In this paper, the frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) constraint is involved to simplify the MUD operation, while the corresponding optimal power allocation for achievable rate region is not convex any more. Then a duality-based proximal optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this non-convex problem efficiently. Simulation results show that our simplified scheme with the FDMA constraint has only a little rate loss compared with the original optimal one, while obtaining even a minor sum rate improvement than the scheme in [6]. Therefore, by our FDMA-constraint low complexity power allocation scheme, a good tradeoff between the complexity and performance for the practical system implementation is achieved.	algorithm;convex optimization;direction finding;mud;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multiplexing;relay;simulation;subcarrier	Fei He;Xiang Chen;Limin Xiao;Shidong Zhou	2016	2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636718	real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	37.36569581500505	87.86638985484406	17158

Our proposal offers three key features: reduces the number of breaks in data submission, guarantees the QoS for the different connections of each user and finally provides load balancing between base stations and WiMAX Femtocell Access Point (WFAP).

Among main LTE characteristics, flexibility and efficiency can be guaranteed by resorting to suitable resource allocation schemes, in particular by adopting adaptive OFDM schemes. This paper proposes a novel solution to the sub-carrier allocation problem for the LTE downlink that takes into account the queues length, the QoS constraints and the channel conditions. Each user has different queues, one for each QoS class, and can transmit with a different data rate depending on the propagation conditions. The proposed algorithm defines a value of each possible sub-carrier assignment as a linear combination of all the inputs following a cross-layer approach. The problem is formulated as a Multidimensional Multiple-choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP) whose optimal solution is not feasible for our purposes due to the too long computing time required to find it. Hence, a novel efficient heuristic has been proposed to solve the problem. Results shows good performance of the proposed resource allocation scheme both in terms of throughput and delay while guarantees fairness among the users. Performance has been compared also with fixed allocation scheme and round robin.	compaq lte;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;heuristic;internet access;knapsack problem;quality of service;round-robin scheduling;software propagation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput;uncompressed video	Giulio Bartoli;Andrea Tassi;Dania Marabissi;Daniele Tarchi;Romano Fantacci	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962916	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Embedded	27.8220570116049	93.17544470625752	17201

However, the computational effort required to find the joint ML solution to the symbol detection and channel estimation problem increases exponentially with the dimension of the problem. To significantly reduce this computational effort, we formulate the aforementioned problem in a way that makes it possible to solve it via the use of sphere decoding, an algorithm that has polynomial expected complexity.

We demonstrate that the diversity order of the code can be increased, without lowering the code rate, by simply increasing the coupling parameter (memory) of a SC-LDPC code. For a (3,6)-regular SC-LDPC code with rate R = 1=2 and memory mcc = 4 a remarkable diversity of d = 10 is achieved without the need for any specific code structure. The memory of the SC-LDPC codes makes them robust against a non-stationary mobile-radio environment.

The proposed scheme minimizes a simple function relevant to the mean-square error (MSE) of the least squares (LS) channel estimate instead of minimizing the MSE itself. As a result, the suboptimal pilot subcarriers can be obtained efficiently by sequentially solving several one-dimensional optimization problems. Comparing with the partially equispaced pilot design which is commonly used in many protocols, the proposed scheme is more robust to the system parameters and can provide much more accurate channel estimate for large channel lengths.	frequency divider;least squares;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multiplexing;subcarrier	Die Hu;Xiaolin Zhou	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security	10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541761	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory	Robotics	49.827027045059545	78.68321828771832	17230

These coefficients remain constant for a coherence interval of T symbol periods after which they change to another independent realization according to the spatial correlation model. For this system we characterize the structure of the input signal that achieves capacity. The capacity achieving transmit signal is expressed as the product of an isotropically distributed unitary matrix, an independent nonnegative diagonal matrix and a unitary matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of the transmit fade covariance matrix. For the case where the number of transmit antennas M is larger than the channel coherence interval T, we show that the channel capacity is independent of the smallest M-T eigenvalues of the transmit fade covariance matrix. In contrast to the previously reported results for the spatially white fading model where adding more transmit antennas beyond the coherence interval length (M>T) does not increase capacity, we find that additional transmit antennas always increase capacity as long as their channel fading coefficients are spatially correlated with the other antennas. We show that for fast hopping or fast fading systems (T=1) with only channel covariance information available to the transmitter and receiver, transmit fade correlations are beneficial. Mathematically, we prove this by showing that capacity is a Schur-convex function of the vector of eigenvalues of the transmit fade correlation matrix. We also show that the maximum possible capacity gain due to transmitter fade correlations is 10logM dB.	channel capacity;coefficient;column (database);convex function;fast fourier transform;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;schur-convex function;transmitter	Syed Ali Jafar;Andrea J.

One problem that makes the traditional broadcast protocol inefficient is the broadcast storm problem. To alleviate the broadcast storm problem, the number of re-transmissions for a broadcast needs to be reduced. One possible solution is to use the node's geometric location information to obtain a smaller subset of neighbors (called local cover set) for re-transmissions. In this paper, we investigate the unique existence of the optimal local cover set. Based on the proof, we construct a location-based algorithm to compute the local cover set. We prove the correctness of our algorithm and discuss the time complexity of the algorithm. The simulation shows that the local cover set generated by our algorithm is significantly smaller than the graph-based broadcast protocol of Wu and Li (see Proc. DIAL M, Aug. 1999, p.7-14).

The currently deployed wireless networks like Wi-Fi, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), and Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems have different characteristics that make them complementary in terms of performance, coverage, and cost. This network variety presents an opportunity to provide better services to end users, given the advances in mobile terminals (MTs). To reach this goal, an appropriate automatic network selection (ANS) mechanism, which is able to always select the best access network, is needed. This consists of constantly monitoring any type of available access network, i.e., automatically selecting and switching to the best one, as the network that maximizes the users quality of experience, taking into account their preferences and the terminal and network conditions. ANS is a multidimensional decision-making problem that can be solved by finding an appropriate complex tradeoff between possibly conflicting criteria. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to capture the preferences of end users. Based on this model, we design an ANS mechanism that takes into account all aspects of the tradeoff between the quality of the connections, the preferences of the end users, and the cost. To highlight the benefits of our approach from the perspectives of both end users and network operators, we have implemented and tested the solution in a multitechnology simulator. Results show that the proposed solution outperforms mainstream approaches.	access network;anytime algorithm;compaq lte;interoperability;microwave;numerical analysis;phy (chip);program optimization;radio resource management;simulation;smartphone;software deployment;user (computing);utility	Quoc-Thinh Nguyen-Vuong;Nazim Agoulmine;El Hadi Cherkaoui;Laura Toni	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2234772	wimax;radio access network;cellular network;wi-fi;3g;wireless wan;channel access method;imt advanced;public land mobile network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;operating system;wireless network;municipal wireless network;access network discovery and selection function;computer security;utility;computer network;network access device	Mobile	23.023318640023057	91.23355065885667	17298

At such high switching speeds, space-division switch architectures are more competitive than currently implemented shared-memory switch architectures. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of a new switch architecture, named Stacked-Banyan (SB), which utilizes parallel Banyan planes and supports  K  QoS levels with output queuing. The Banyans are composed of 2 × 4 switching elements (SEs). The SE is implemented by         CMOS logic gates. Circuit simulations of the SE show satisfactory performance at 1 Gbps. The non-blocking behavior of the SB fabric is verified by VHDL. The proposed fabric uses output queuing to resolve contention. In general, the output buffer handles  K  QoS levels by  K  virtual queues. Focusing on the case  K =2, we propose a buffer management and channel allocation strategy that can be adjusted to meet the delay and loss requirements of the two types of traffic. The output buffer is managed as two virtual queues, each handling a different traffic type. To meet the delay QoS of one traffic type, the channel is allocated to the respective queue with a probability that depends on the congestion level in that queue. We present a model and analysis of the output queues and calculate the waiting time and loss performance under two specific allocation strategies. The results indicate that the proposed channel allocation strategy is quite effective in maintaining a balance between the QoS objectives of the two traffic types.	atm turbo	Belka Kraimeche	2000	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(99)00129-2	shared memory;real-time computing;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network;broadband networks	Arch	-0.17299265562123384	94.84627492664602	17323

This algorithm provides multiple shortest paths between any source and destination node of a multicomputer using only a constant number of virtual channels for every physical channel, and with little added overhead at the router. Consequently, it is able to improve network throughput and reduce latency while maintaining the deadlock-free property that is critical for circuit-switched routing mechanisms. MECA also allows multiple broadcast trees to be used concurrently without incurring deadlock. Simulation results highlight the advantages of MECA over other circuit-switched routing techniques.	algorithm;circuit switching;cubes;deadlock;fault tolerance;itk;multipath propagation;olap cube;overhead (computing);parallel computing;router (computing);routing;shortest path problem;simulation;throughput;wormhole switching	Jeffrey T.

When a twin-bus architecture is used for voiceldata integration, voice and data are transmitted on two separate channels and two different access protocols can be used to handle these two types of traffic. However, the efficiency of the voiceldata integration still depends on the possibility of capacity sharing between these two types of traffic. In this paper, we first discuss the twin-bus architecture for voiceldata integration. Then a new hybrid protocol for data bus which combines CSMA/CD and announcement reservation schemes is proposed. This protocol has been shown to be efficient for various traffic loads.

Since it is a dynamic multihop wireless network and established by a cluster of mobile nodes on a shared wireless channel. The transitive closure of the neighborhood of all the hosts or nodes in the set of mobiles under consideration forms network. Each node is potentially a router and it is possible to dynamically establish routes by changing together a sequence of neighboring hosts from a source to destination in the adhoc network. In this paper study compares the relative performance of existing protocols and evaluates them. It has been determined that under similar conditions AODV outperforms the other protocols. In this work we have proposed an algorithm to overcome flooding problem in the network. The proposed algorithm is selective flooding in place of broadcasting. It is proposed to lessen the number of packets within the network. This reduces the routing Packet overhead. The algorithm was incorporated in the AODV algorithm and simulated in the identical environment it has improved throughput in the network.	ansi escape code;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);graph bandwidth;hoc (programming language);organizing (structure);overhead (computing);router (computing);routing;self-organization;throughput;transitive closure	G.

In this research work, we introduce a novel design of clustered network architecture. The proposed design technique is innovative in its idea. The general trend in this scene is either centralized decision at base station for cluster head selection and its members or distributed decision by exchanging information between neighboring nodes until the cluster head and its members are selected. Both the techniques drastically create mess in energy consumption due to too much broadcasting, especially in large networks as well as message exchange until some final decision is made. Our novel layer-based hybrid algorithm for cluster head and cluster member selection comes up to novel communication architecture. Since its substantial constituent is cluster designing, we named it Multilayer Cluster Designing Algorithm (MCDA). The proposed design not only has effect on lessening blind broadcasting, but also on decreasing the message exchange in a passionate way. It also encapsulates the beauty of efficient centralized decision making for cluster designing and energy-aware distributed cluster head selection and cluster member allocation process. Comprehensive experimentations have been performed on the comparative analysis of MCDA with state-of-the-art centralized and distributed cluster designing approaches present in published literature. Calculation of energy consumption in various operational parametric values, number of clusters designed and the number of packets broadcasted during cluster designing are the main performance evaluation parameters. It has been found that MCDA outperforms compared to its three competing algorithms with respect to the aforementioned parameters due to its multilayered synergistic mating approach.	blind signature;centralized computing;charge-coupled device;cluster analysis;computer cluster;experiment;global positioning system;graphical user interface;hybrid algorithm;lucid;mathematical model;network architecture;network planning and design;performance evaluation;qualitative comparative analysis;routing;simulation;synergy;transmitter;yet another	Sohail Jabbar;Abid Ali Minhas;Anand Paul;Seungmin Rho	2014	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-014-1108-y	simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;data mining;distributed computing;computer security	HPC	7.274872392132357	79.76332728686108	17439

The power allocation scheme employs a codebook of quantized power allocation vectors designed offline equipped on the source, relay, and destination. The destination, who has full knowledge of channel state information (CSI), chooses the best power allocation vector and sends back its index to the source and relay nodes, which results in a dramatic reduced overhead over conventional resource allocation. First we achieve the optimal power allocation solution as the function of channel realizations with maximum capacity. Then we present an adaptation of the Lloyd algorithm to construct a codebook to quantize the optimal power allocation vectors subject to the amount of feedback. Simulations show that a negligible performance loss could be achieved with just a few feedback bits at different levels of SNRs.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;channel capacity;channel state information;codebook;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;frequency divider;ibm notes;international relations and security network;internet relay chat;modulation;multiplexing;online and offline;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;single event upset	Yong Liu;Wen Chen;Xiaopeng Huang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962465	algorithm design;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management	Mobile	37.69507954920425	87.07487907067	17482

In OR2, the active path adapts dynamically t o node mobility without any link failures based on the local link quality. Most conventional routing protocols accommodate the change of network topology only when the link fails. Unless the movement of intermediate nodes leads to any link failures, they cannot adapt to the network topology even if other routes with less hop count become available. In contrast to these protocols, OR2 reduces the hop count of an active route while d a t a packets are sent without link disconnection. Specifically, by introducing the notion of proximity that indicates the nearness of two communicating nodes, OR2 skips the upstream node in a proximity area and continues t o shorten an active route as possible. For d e l a y sensitive T C P flows, reducing the number of hops and path delay significantly improves the performance of TCP. We have implemented OR2 as an exiension to DSR on FreeBSD. The experimental results have shown that OR2 is effective an enhancing T C P throughput a n d reducing end-to-end delay f o r all relevant flows.	ansi escape code;algorithm;end-to-end principle;freebsd;hoc (programming language);network topology;routing;throughput	Masato Saito;Hiroto Aida;Yosuke Tamura;Yoshito Tobe;Hideyuki Tokuda	2001		10.1109/LCN.2001.990836	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	1.915861011143418	83.74340510160542	17512

In a time-varying channel, due to the relative motion between the transmitters and the receiver, the development of a scheme that guarantees such alignment is very challenging. In this paper, considering a distributed transmit beamforming scenario, an algorithm to achieve such phase alignment of signals in a time-varying channel is proposed. A simple formula is derived, which can be adopted by each transmitter to compute its beamforming weight's phase, and it is shown that the use of this perturbation results in a significant improvement in terms of speed of convergence at the receiver. With simulation it is shown that, using the proposed scheme, the transmitted signals' phase aligned at the receiver 33% faster than the one-bit feedback scheme. The average theoretical bit error rate is achieved 50% faster relative to the one-bit feedback scheme with on average 18% less number of antennas at the transmitter.	algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;rate of convergence;simulation;transmitter	Wayes Tushar;David B.

However, we have very little understanding of network connectivity in such networks. Therefore, in this paper, we consider hybrid networks denoted by $H(\alpha,\beta)$ with ad hoc nodes and base stations and prove how base stations can improve the connectivity of ad hoc nodes in {\em subcritical phase}, that is, the ad hoc node density, $\lambda_{\alpha}$ is lower than the critical density $\lambda_{\alpha}^c$. We first study the impact of density of base stations, $\lambda_{\beta}$ on the connectivity, and find that with the existence of a positive density of base stations which have the same transmission range as ad hoc nodes, i.e., $\lambda_{\beta}>0$, the number of connected ad hoc nodes is $\Theta(n)$ with probability nearly 1, where $n$ is the number of ad hoc nodes. However, the size of connected ad hoc component scales linearly with $\lambda_{\beta}$ with probability nearly 1 when $\lambda_{\beta}$ is lower than $c_1(\lambda_{\alpha})$. We then study the impact of transmission range of base stations, $r_{\beta}$ on the connectivity, and find the additional benefit of enlarging $r_{\beta}$ to enhance the connectivity of ad hoc nodes.	hoc (programming language);mesh networking;relay;transmission (bittorrent client)	Chi Yi;Wenye Wang	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502706	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;base station;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	13.870426915483051	87.50189645001818	17521

The performances of query processing with these tasks are greatly varied according to different routing protocols. Most existing data query systems usually use one routing protocol to deal with all kinds of queries. This work demonstrates that proper selection of routing protocols can improve the performance of query processing. We propose a dynamic routing layer that makes protocol selection on the basis of query tasks and can automatically switch between different routing protocols. Simulation results show that dynamic routing scheme is more energy efficient than single routing protocol. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		Zusheng Zhang;Liang Chen;Fengqi Yu	2013	Int. J.

One joint network and channel coding (JNCC) scheme (based on iterative soft information exchange between channel and network decoder) and one separate network and channel coding scheme based on turbo codes are proposed. The outage behavior of the presented systems are compared with two reference systems, where no network coding (NC) is applied. It is shown that the network coding approaches allow the system to gain diversity for higher rates than the schemes without NC. Moreover, JNCC outperforms the separate approach by exploiting the redundancy provided by the network code.	2.5d;code rate;downtime;forward error correction;information exchange;iteration;linear network coding;relay;turbo code	Onurcan Iscan;Imran Latif;Christoph Hausl	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671900	turbo code;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	Mobile	34.71326355839809	75.40914295371448	17552

The IEEE 802.11e draft specification aims to extend the original IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol to support QoS. One of the mechanisms for prioritizing traffic is the assignment of different AIFS times to each priority level. Nevertheless, the AIFSs employed are separated by values that are multiples of the slot time. Therefore, due to the fact that the backoff time counter is slotted, the different priority levels can attempt for transmission simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.11e when its working procedure is desynchronized: we avoid that stations belonging to different priority levels attempt for transmission at the same time. We assign AIFS times that are separated by values that are not multiples of the slot time, in order to avoid collisions between the different priority levels. We present a mathematical model and simulation results for analyzing the performance of the differentiation mechanism proposed. The results show that it solves the strangulation of low priority traffic, fact that occurs in IEEE 802.11e EDCA. Moreover, this proposal leads to a significant increase in the performance of the system as a whole	algorithm;backoff;mathematical model;priority queue;simulation;throughput	Elena López-Aguilera;Jordi Casademont;Josep Cotrina Navau;Alfonso Rojas	2005	2005 14th IEEE Workshop on Local & Metropolitan Area Networks	10.1109/LANMAN.2005.1541534	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003;computer network	Visualization	2.8575600054711243	95.68632559405143	17559
79ce6a5d09e5534123bd356fa018af60bb868bcd	a study on the effect of traffic patterns in mobile ad hoc network		The multimedia application through mobile Ad-hoc network is gradually becoming very popular. The traffic patterns of multimedia applications are quite different from the traditional data applications. The constant bit rate (CBR) traffic does not accommodate the specific features of multimedia applications. To characterize, the multimedia application, Exponential or Pareto traffic sources have been explored. The popular routing protocols for mobile ad hoc network were developed considering the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic only. In case of multimedia traffic they do not work as expected. In this article, we have tried to study the behavior of mobile ad hoc network routing protocols considering Exponential and Pareto traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze the effect of traffic patterns on mobile ad hoc network routing. We have chosen the Normalized routing load and Packet Delivery Fraction as our figure of merit to compare various protocols. The Normalized Routing Load is high for both Exponential and Pareto traffic in Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. The Packet Delivery Fraction is very high for Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in all types of traffic patterns whereas it is less in Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) for both Exponential and Pareto traffic.	hoc (programming language)	Arindarjit Pal;Jyoti Prakash Singh;Paramartha Dutta	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22709-7_9	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing	Mobile	1.388980187867804	86.12422457474254	17560

The minimum time rather than total delay cost functional is employed. The problem is solved through an iterative link-by-link optimization. Each link capacity is optimally partitioned by examining the upper bounds for the evacuation time imposed through different capacity allocations for each origin/destination pair traffic. The computational complexity per iteration is polynomial in the number of network nodes. This is due to the examination of origin/destination pairs rather then destinations alone as in previous work where a similar approach led to exponential complexity. Sufficient conditions for the convergence of the iterative algorithm to the optimum are given. If these are not satisfied supplementary steps are described which conduct the algorithm to the desired solution. These involve exponential computational complexity. >	algorithmic efficiency;iterative method;routing	George I. Stassinopoulos;Michael G. Kazantzakis	1991	IEEE Trans.

The work focused on the performance evaluation of data packet transmission over ATM UBR service. With the introduction of ABR service, source regulation based on closed-loop control becomes increasingly important. In this work we attempt to analyze the performance of early packet discarding when the source transmission rates are governed by the feedback information from a congested ATM bottleneck node. Numerical study shows that the steady-state performance are largely affected by slow time scales of the feedback system. Nonetheless, the design of control threshold in early packet discarding is not significantly sensitive to the system time scales.	atm turbo;buffer overflow;cell (microprocessor);control theory;epd;feedback;goodput;network packet;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;priority queue;profiling (computer programming);steady state;stochastic modelling (insurance);system time;viz: the computer game	Yonghwan Kim;San-qi Li	1998		10.1109/INFCOM.1998.665069	transmission time;real-time computing;fast packet switching;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;stochastic modelling;asynchronous transfer mode;end-to-end delay;feedback;transmission delay;steady state;computer network;satisfiability	Metrics	-1.4779662076422222	98.1676588525919	17574

30a54a11e56b2c13cab52f5cfbf5ac8a51f9f8fa	power control for coordinated noma downlink with cell-edge users		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an effective means to improve the spectral efficiency of a wireless communication system. When applied to cellular networks, cell edge users may suffer from low bit rate, or the associated base stations may need to use excessively high power to serve those users. In order to alleviate the problem, this paper considers the integration of NOMA with coordinated transmission techniques. A two-cell system is considered, in which there are two users near their associated base stations and a cell edge user served by both base stations. It is assumed that each user has a data rate requirement, and the system objective is to minimize the total transmit power. With a formal problem formulation, the feasibility of the problem is characterized by using Helly's theorem. When the problem is feasible, we design both centralized and distributed algorithms to solve it. Numerical results show that NOMA can significantly outperform an orthogonal multiple access scheme in terms of power consumption and outage probability.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;data rate units;distributed algorithm;downtime;heuristic (computer science);linear programming;numerical method;oma;spectral efficiency;sun outage;telecommunications link	Qianyun Guo;Chi Wan Sung;Yi Chen;Chung Shue Chen	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377121	power control;computer network;real-time computing;transmitter power output;single antenna interference cancellation;distributed algorithm;telecommunications link;spectral efficiency;computer science;base station;cellular network	Mobile	31.06673386806837	91.6076473291244	17588

TI isone of the countermeasures against Differential Power Analysis(DPA) on cryptographic hardware. The security order of TIdepends on the number of shares. The minimum number ofshares to be resistant dth-order DPA is said to be (d+1). Whilethe construction of GF arithmetic circuits of quadratic functionbased on TI with (d + 1) shares is known, it is not known howto construct other types of circuits based on it. In this paper, wepresent a generalization and systematic method of constructingthe TI with (d + 1) input shares for any kind of GF arithmeticcircuit in order to design a larger variety of tamper-resistantGF arithmetic circuits.

22c5a62d2fd0cfdccc2921f8f6119076dc41b23f	on classical teleportation and classical nonlocality	density matrix;probability distribution;quantum physics;information processing;quantum nonlocality	An interesting protocol for classical teleportation of an unknown classical state was recently suggested by Cohen, and by Gour and Meyer. In that protocol, Bob can sample from a probability distribution P that is given to Alice, even if Alice has absolutely no knowledge about P . Pursuing a similar line of thought, we suggest here a limited form of nonlocality — “classical nonlocality”. Our nonlocality is the (somewhat limited) classical analogue of the Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters (HJW) quantum nonlocality. The HJW nonlocality tells us how, for a given density matrix ρ, Alice can generate any ρ-ensemble on the North Star. This is done using surprisingly few resources — one shared entangled state (prepared in advance), one generalized quantum measurement, and no communication. Similarly, our classical nonlocality presents how, for a given probability distribution P , Alice can generate any P-ensemble on the North Star, using only one correlated state (prepared in advance), one (generalized) classical measurement, and no communication. It is important to clarify that while the classical teleportation and the classical non-locality protocols are probably rather insignificant from a classical information processing point of view, they significantly contribute to our understanding of what exactly is quantum in their well established and highly famous quantum analogues.	alice;density matrix;deutsch–jozsa algorithm;information processing;locality of reference;measurement in quantum mechanics;no-communication theorem;physical information;quantum entanglement;quantum nonlocality	Tal Mor	2005	CoRR		atomic physics;no-teleportation theorem;quantum nonlocality;quantum teleportation;information processing;quantum channel;classical capacity;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum sort	Theory	31.00726591807118	64.75565676427259	17627

We use the generalized likelihood ratio test to obtain the decision rule in closed form, independent of the fading distribution. The receiver is developed for M-ary orthogonal signals and multiple relays. The only side information required at the destination is the average noise energy at the receiver; no statistical knowledge of the channel gains is needed. We develop closed-form upper and lower bounds on the probability of error of this receiver for the case of binary signaling with a single relay and show that this receiver achieves near full diversity, with the probability of error decreasing with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as log2(SNR)/ SNR2 for large SNR. Additional results obtained by simulation demonstrate increasing diversity gain with additional relays.	binary logarithm;bit error rate;coherent;rayleigh fading;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Michael R.

Using lossless compression of the quantizer’s output, Gish and Pierce showed that uniform quantizing yields the smallest output entropy in the limit D → 0, resulting in a rate penalty of 0.255 bits/sample above the Shannon Lower Bound (SLB). We present a scalar quantization scheme named lossy-bit entropy-constrained scalar quantization (Lb-ECSQ) that is able to reduce the D → 0 gap to SLB to 0.251 bits/sample by combining both lossless and binary lossy compression of the quantizer’s output. We also study the low-resolution regime and show that Lb-ECSQ significantly outperforms ECSQ in the case of 1-bit quantization.	1-bit architecture;distortion;entropy (information theory);lossless compression;lossy compression;pierce oscillator;quantization (signal processing);shannon (unit)	Melanie F.

In this paper, we present a new adaptive code assignment algorithm, which consists of three steps: reserved-space, improved-crowded-first-space, and multi-code combination to fully use the code space. Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can avoid the code blocking problem and lower its total blocking probability while keeping its computational complexity relatively low. Simulation results show that increasing the free space reduces the average total blocking probability while increasing the blocking probability of high rate users. key words: code assignment, code tree, cost function, DCA, CDMA	algorithm;blocking (computing);code;computational complexity theory;erlang (unit);loss function;multi-user;simulation	Qiyue Yu;Fumiyuki Adachi;Weixiao Meng	2009	IEICE Transactions		code division multiple access;constant-weight code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	EDA	44.34888047304973	79.99468736488734	17668
342d16516220a5e2958b3af314e02b380bcdc180	explicit data caching at mobile edge networks: a cross-layer perspective		To fully exploit the increasingly dense deployments of mobile base station (BS) infrastructure, this paper proposes a novel caching paradigm called explicit caching, which stores selective contents at BSs and exposes such contents to users for volunteer browsing and download. We formulate the explicit caching problem as a joint content recommendation and delivery problem, which aims to maximize the expected quality-of-experience (QoE) per user over the long term. Optimal algorithms are given to solve the problem with varying degrees of cross-layer information. The impacts of user interest profile, cache storage space, BS backhaul capacity, cross-layer information, user mobility, and user mobility prediction on the system performance are analyzed and discussed.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);cache (computing);contextual advertising;download;programming paradigm	Talal Albeladi;Wenbin Luo;Jiping Jiao;Biyu Tang;Xuemin Hong;Jianghong Shi	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227690	mathematical optimization;cache;backhaul (telecommunications);mobile telephony;exploit;computer network;mobile computing;computer science;base station;signal-to-noise ratio;download	Mobile	23.88085524612213	96.51194409032202	17677

However, the increased probability of collision at heavy load caused by the inherent behavior of CSMA/CA degrades the performance of WSN in terms of throughput and energy consumption. This led some to propose other MAC layer solutions to tackle these problems. Most of them are TDMA-based which provides deterministic medium access. This makes them not scalable in general for large scale WSN. Contrary to that trend, we retain CSMA/CA's simplicity and good scalability properties and propose CoSenS, a collecting and sending burst scheme, that is implemented on the top of CSMA/CA. The idea of CoSenS is that a router does not retransmit packets as they arrive. Instead, it collects data from its children and other neighbor routers during a period of time that we call waiting period (WP), queue them until the expiration of that period and then sends them into a burst during a period of time that we call transmission period (TP). Simulation results show that this scheme greatly enhances throughput, end to end delay and transmission success rate (reliability). In addition, the scheme exhibits a nice property of self-adaptability of transmission periods between neighbor routers.	control system;genetic algorithm;network congestion;router (computing);scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Bilel Nefzi;Yeqiong Song	2010	IEEE Local Computer Network Conference	10.1109/LCN.2010.5735693	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	9.28154934903651	84.41044213365032	17710

In this paper, we consider the backhaul interface of FBSs to be home broadband connection (such as ADSL and optical fiber) with capacity lower than the air interface, and propose a novel resource optimization for FBSs to mitigate both the macro-femto and femto-femto interferences. First, the user rate requirements are normalized according to the backhaul capacity. Then, the total spectrum utilized by FBSs is minimized to alleviate the macro-femto interference. To reduce the femto-femto interference, we integrate the Gibbs sampler into the resource optimization to make each FBS select the frequency bands which have lower probability to introduce interference. Via sophisticated simulations based on the 3GPP femtocell evaluation scenario, the resource optimization is demonstrated to be effective and ready for LTE-A.	asymmetric digital subscriber line;backhaul (telecommunications);compaq lte;data rate units;frequency band;function-behaviour-structure ontology;gibbs sampling;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;next-generation network;numerical analysis;optical fiber;requirement;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Feng Seng Chu;Chia-han Lee;Kwang-Cheng Chen	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952409	throughput;next-generation network;gibbs sampling;telecommunications;computer science;base station;lte advanced;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;femtocell;spectral efficiency;computer network	EDA	27.7967698282034	90.96481938150397	17725

Currently they offer only simple wireless communication models that neglect many radio propagation effects. In this paper, we integrate a more realistic physical layer model into a simulation tool. It consists of a radio propagation model and a model of wireless transmission errors. They have been evaluated against real-world measurements. We prove that such more realistic models change simulation results considerably. To the best of our knowledge, no other study of MANETs has been performed so far with such a detailed physical layer model. Hence, this paper also gives new insights on the performance of MANETs in real outdoor environments.

d0ab028756d4ea77ac3e6f27474d3f4dd6e1444d	evaluating physical-layer security for secondary users in cognitive radio systems with attackers		Cognitive radio network (CRN) is regarded as an emerging technology for better spectrum efficiency where unlicensed secondary users (SUs) sense RF spectrum to find idle channels and access them opportunistically without causing any harmful interference to licensed primary users (PUs). However, RF spectrum sensing and sharing along with reconfigurable capabilities of SUs bring severe security vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we analyze physical-layer security (secrecy rates) of SUs in CRN in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PU emulators (PUEs) where SUs compete not only with jammers and eavesdroppers who are trying to reduce SU's secrecy rates but also against PUEs who are trying to compel the SUs from their current channel by imitating the behavior of PUs. In addition, a legitimate SU competes with other SUs with a sharing attitude for dynamic spectrum access to gain a high secrecy rate, however, the malicious users (i.e., attackers) attempt to abuse the channels egotistically. The main contribution of this work is the design of a game theoretic approach to maximize utilities (that is proportional to secrecy rates) of SUs in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PUEs. Furthermore, SUs use signal energy and cyclostationary feature detection along with location verification technique to detect PUEs. As the proposed approach is generic and considers different attackers, it can be particularized to a situation with eavesdroppers only, jammers only or PUEs only while evaluating physical-layer security of SUs in CRN. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using results obtained from simulations. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods.	cognitive radio;cyclostationary process;emulator;expected utility hypothesis;experiment;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);gnu radio;game theory;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);monte carlo method;numerical analysis;one-class classification;peripheral;power usage effectiveness;radio frequency;radio jamming;simulation;spectral efficiency;superuser;vulnerability (computing)	Danda B.

The proposed MUD algorithm is based on a genetic algorithm (GA)-assisted per-carrier MMSE criterion. The GA block works in two successive steps: a training-aided step aimed at computing the optimal receiver weights using a very short training sequence, and a decision-directed step aimed at dynamically updating the weights vector during a channel coherence period. Numerical results evidenced BER performances almost coincident with ones yielded by ideal MMSE-MUD based on the perfect knowledge of channel impulse response. The proposed GA-assisted MMSE-MUD outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive MMSE receivers based on deterministic gradient algorithms, especially for high number of users	genetic algorithm;gradient;mud;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical method;performance;software release life cycle;x.690	Claudio Sacchi;Leandro D'Orazio;Massimo Donelli;Riccardo Fedrizzi;Francesco G.

However, the nodes are typically highly resource-constrained. Since the communication task is a significant power consumer, there are various attempts to introduce energy-awareness at different levels within the communication stack. Clustering is one such attempt to control energy dissipation for sensor data dissemination in a multihop fashion. The Time-Controlled Clustering Algorithm (TCCA) was proposed to realize a network-wide energy reduction. A realistic energy dissipation model is derived probabilistically to quantify the sensor network’s energy consumption using the proposed clustering algorithm. A discrete-event simulator is developed to verify the mathematical model and to further investigate TCCA in other scenarios. The simulator is also extended to include the rest of the communication stack to allow a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;cluster analysis;mathematical model;simulation	Selvakennedy Selvadurai;Suku Sinnappan	2007	IJDSN	10.1080/15501320601067725	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	9.688800397868693	73.49221589003471	17831

As one solution to meet this challenge in cellular mobile networks, a network architecture with hierarchical layers of cells has been widely considered. In this paper, we study the performance of a hierarchical cellular network that allows the queueing of both overflow slow-mobility calls (from the lower layer microcells) and macrocell handover fast-mobility calls that are blocked due to lack of free resources at the macrocell. Further, to accurately represent the wireless user behaviour, the impact of call repeat phenomenon is considered in the analysis of new call blocking probability. Performance analysis of the hierarchical cellular structure with queueing and call repeat phenomenon is performed using both analytical and simulation techniques. Numerical results show that queueing of calls reduces forced call termination probability and increases resource utilization with minimal call queueing delay. It is also shown that ignoring repeat calls leads to optimistic estimates of new call blocking probability especially at high offered traffic.

Thus, how to stimulate cooperation among nodes in cognitive networks is very important. However, most of existing game-theoretic cooperation stimulation approaches rely on the assumption that the interactions between any pair of players are long-lasting. When this assumption is not true, according to the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and the backward induction principle, the unique Nash equilibrium (NE) is to always play non-cooperatively. In this paper, we propose a cooperation stimulation scheme for the scenario where the number of interactions between any pair of players are finite. The proposed algorithm is based on indirect reciprocity game modelling where the key concept is ``I help you not because you have helped me but because you have helped others''. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal action rule as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the packet forwarding game as an example, we show that with an appropriate cost-to-gain ratio, the strategy of forwarding the number of packets that is equal to the reputation level of the receiver is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Finally, simulations are shown to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;backward induction;cognitive network;game theory;interaction;markov chain;markov decision process;nash equilibrium;network packet;prisoner's dilemma;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yan Chen;K.

Despite the enormous amount of academic and industrial research in the past 20 years on interference-aware receivers and the large performance improvements promised by these multi-user techniques, today's receivers still generally treat interference as background noise. In this article, we enumerate the reasons for this widespread scepticism, and discuss how current and future trends increases the need for and viability of multi-user receivers for both the uplink, where many asynchronous users are simultaneously detected, and the downlink, where users are scheduled and largely orthogonalized; but the mobile handset still needs to cope with a few dominant interfering base stations. New results for interference cancelling receivers that use conventional front-ends are shown to alleviate many of the shortcomings of prior techniques, particularly for the challenging uplink. This article gives an overview of key recent research breakthroughs on interference cancellation and highlights system-level considerations for future multi-user receivers.	enumerated type;interference (communication);mobile phone;multi-user;telecommunications link	Jeffrey G.

Mobility of nodes often leads to link failures and hence requires route reconstruction to resume the communication between the nodes. The stability factor of a route can reduce the number of times the route is changed or reconstructed. This paper presents a novel idea for discovering a stable set of routes using the metrics from multiple layers rather than depending on network layer along with a finite set of parameters to qualify a link or connecting to a node. The link stability factor and link received signal strength are considered as the main metrics to qualify the stability of a route, derived from the physical and data link layer based on bit or packet error rate, retrieved from the soft output decoder. The simulation results based on the analysis of the proposed algorithm prove to be more efficient in terms of discovering stable routes, reducing frequent reconstruction of routes and hence improving the overall performance of the network.	ansi escape code;algorithm;bit error rate;computation;hoc (programming language);hyperlink;network packet;network performance;routing;simulation;source routing	S.

Based on the assumption that the wireless channels undergo correlated Rayleigh fading, we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the intended users. Then, by using the fact that channel uncertainty is norm-bounded and imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the BS, we transform the optimization problem to a support vector machine (SVM) regression one, and obtain the robust solution for the BF weight vectors by means of quadratic programming (QP) technique or iterative reweighted least squares (IRWLS) procedure. The computational cost of the proposed robust BF scheme depends on the number of channel vector samples rather than that of the antennas, thus it is suitable for the wireless systems with large-scale antennas.

More specifically, we consider the case where an unmanned vehicle is not connected in its current location and needs to incur motion energy to find a connected spot. We are then interested in designing robot paths that are energy efficient (minimum traveled distance) and can result in guaranteed connectivity in realistic channel environments that can experience multipath, shadowing, and path loss. In this paper, we show how this problem can be optimally and efficiently solved, under mild conditions on the paths, using tools from stochastic dynamic programming. Our extensive simulations, with real channel parameters, then confirm that our approach can significantly reduce the traveled distance to connectivity, thus minimizing the total energy consumption.	baseline (configuration management);dynamic programming;graph theory;heuristic;motion planning;multipath propagation;robot;simulation;stochastic programming;uncrewed vehicle;unmanned aerial vehicle	Arjun Muralidharan;Yasamin Mostofi	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269061	multipath propagation;real-time computing;robot;energy consumption;path loss;efficient energy use;stochastic programming;computer science;motion planning;communication channel	Robotics	13.269070627652312	78.95574463730631	17894

Raptor codes are a class of concatenated codes composed of a fixed-rate precode and a Luby-Transform (LT) code that can be used as rate-less error-correcting codes over communication channels. In the proposed approach, the decoding procedure is mapped to row processing of a regular matrix, which adapts effectively to the code's randomness and degree-irregularity. This is achieved by 1) developing reconfigurable check node processors that attain a constant throughput while processing LT- and LDPC-nodes of varying degrees and numbers, 2) applying pseudo-random permutation on the communicated messages, and 3) computing bit-to-check messages in a serial, temporally distributed manner. A serial decoder for a rate-0.4 code implementing the proposed approach was synthesized in 65nm CMOS technology. Hardware simulations show that the decoder achieves a throughput of 22Mb/s at BER of 10−6, dissipates an average power of 222mW and occupies an area of 1.77mm2. A range of partially-parallel decoders with desired throughput can be designed by replicating the processing nodes of a serial decoder.	cmos;central processing unit;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;irregular matrix;low-density parity-check code;luby transform code;michael luby;pseudorandom permutation;pseudorandomness;random permutation;randomness;raptor code;simulation;throughput;x.690	Hady Zeineddine;Mohammad M.

The relay is assumed to be honest but curious, i.e., an eavesdropper that conforms to the system rules and applies the intended relaying scheme. We analyze the achievable secrecy rates by applying network coding on the physical layer or the network layer and compare the results in terms of complexity, overhead, and efficiency. Further, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the respective approaches.	computational complexity theory;confidentiality;linear network coding;microsoft outlook for mac;network packet;norm (social);overhead (computing);relay channel;secure communication	Johannes Richter;Elke Franz;Sabrina Engelmann;Stefan Pfennig;Eduard Axel Jorswieck	2013	2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)	10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708110	linear network coding;network architecture;link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;computer security;statistics;computer network	Security	32.67972634311584	69.10685616516069	17929

A set of 9 distinct services is considered with appropriate source models. Four test areas are defined in Lisbon, as an example, and non-uniform geographic users' distributions are generated in each one. Vehicular users are restricted to the city streets. Network performance is assessed by modeling the radio interface at frame level, and implementing power control, load control and admission control mechanisms. Applications' performance is assessed through the analysis of dropped and blocked call rates (for circuit switched services), delays and normalized throughputs (for packet switched ones). Downlink transmitted power is also analyzed for a more complete system characterization. System's response dependency on users* average speed and location is analyzed, trends being identified. Increasing average users* speed (up to 35 km/h) increased, as expected, drop call rate (up to 2 %) and the number of handover per call (up to 3.5)	circuit switching;control system;load management;network packet;network performance;packet switching;telecommunications link	Carlos Rodrigues;Luís M.

The expressions are used to obtain exact integral solutions for the ergodic capacity and the average symbol error probability as well as an exact closed-form solution for the outage probability of dual-hop AF systems operating over mixed links. The results obtained represent the first exact results for the cases of composite Nakagami-m/Rician fading links. The exact performance metrics are compared to performance bounds in the literature, and it is shown that the performance bounds are not tight for medium ranges of SNR. The effects of fading parameters on the system performance are studied. It is shown that the limiting slopes of the average error probability and outage probability curves are not affected by the fading parameters, however, SNR gains are achieved by increasing the fading parameter. Moreover, it is shown also that an increase in the Rician parameter, K, results in a notable SNR gain in the system performance, while an increase in the Nakagami-m parameter, m, has diminishing returns and gives negligible improvement in the system performance in some instances.	anisotropic filtering;downtime;end-to-end principle;ergodicity;portable document format;signal-to-noise ratio	Samy S.

This technique has application to optical monitoring of intersymbol interference distortions, including chromatic and polarization-mode dispersion effects, and thus can provide vector information for input to the control of adaptive optical filters. A method for generating a test signal spanning the spectrum of a modulated data signal without introducing intersymbol interference is discussed. This technique can also be used to characterize an optical pulse source and does not scale in complexity or cost as the bandwidth of the source increases.	all-pass filter;catastrophic interference;distortion;fibre channel;file spanning;interference (communication);modulation;polarization mode dispersion;scalability	Christi K.
