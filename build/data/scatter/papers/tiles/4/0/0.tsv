Not only will the patient’s satisfaction with the medical treatment depend on the cooperation and communication between the nurse and the doctor, but also on the nurse and her way of dealing with and usage of IT technology. Although having become a part of daily routines in the meantime, the question arises if nurses are aware of the importance of IT technology for their work duties. How many of the nurses will have probably ever thought about the importance and sensitivity of the data they daily use? Without doubt, computer-literacy among members of all professional groups within society has increased enormously in the last years. Nevertheless, especially the area of health care service demands some more specific knowledge and awareness by the concerned staff related to topics of possibilities, benefits, possible mistakes and theirs consequences, especially from the security point of view, including the sensitivity of the working area, as well as ethical issues. The aim of this paper is to present, the postgraduate program in general as well as the actual handling of providing lectures on information security for nurses. Furthermore, the paper will focus on (gained) experience, and the formative assessment of the postgraduate program.	informatics;information security	Tatjana Welzer;Marko Hölbl;Ana Habjanic;Bostjan Brumen;Marjan Druzovec	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-72367-9_44	computer literacy;health policy;computer science;information security;hrhis;formative assessment;computer security;health care	HCI	-64.3409327841109	-60.396255159014814	7623
b57b02a949b8e1bf7f61ef0871f3500e4e067750	exploratory multivariate analysis of hospital admissions data in conjunction with workforce data		The prevalence of electronic health data has brought us a step closer to understanding of the dynamics of hospital admissions. However, little research has investigated hospital admission data in conjunction with information about the environment where the patient was admitted, such as staffing level and hospital type. This paper studied this crucial but often neglected issue by investigating hospital admission records together with workforce data. Exploratory multivariate analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), were applied to study important variables associated with admission and workforce data. The exploratory results obtained shed light on the contribution of these variables to the typology of hospital admissions.	20-methylcholanthrene;biological anthropology;exploratory testing;hospital admission;hospitalization;multiple correspondence analysis;patients;principal component analysis;statistical model	Yang Xie;Norm Good;Sankalp Khanna;Justin Boyle	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037396	multivariate analysis;principal component analysis;medical emergency;workforce;staffing level;medicine;typology;multiple correspondence analysis	DB	-64.60885709391954	-61.59312643345784	7716
a256510a92646afff2ed0834ce4cdedb1b55cafe	context-aware online learning for course recommendation of mooc big data		The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) has expanded significantly in recent years. With the widespread of MOOC, the opportunity to study the fascinating courses for free has attracted numerous people of diverse education al backgrounds all over the world. In the big data era, a key research topic for MOOC is how to mine the needed courses in the massive course databases in cloud for each individual (course) learner accurately and rapidly as the number of cou rses is increasing fleetly. In this respect, the key challenge is h ow to realize personalized course recommendation as well as to re duce the computing and storage costs for the tremendous course data. In this paper, we propose a big data-supported, contex taware online learning-based course recommender system tha t could handle the dynamic andinfinitely massive datasets, which recommends courses by using personalized context informat ion and historical statistics. The context-awareness takes th e personal preferences into consideration, making the recommen dation suitable for people with different backgrounds. Besides, t he algorithm achieves the sublinear regret performance, whic h means it can gradually recommend the mostly preferred and matched courses to learners. Unlike other existing algorit hms, ours bounds the time complexity and space complexity linear ly. In addition, our devised storage module is expanded to the distributed-connected clouds, which can handle massive co urse storage problems from heterogenous sources. Our experimen t results verify the superiority of our algorithms when comparing with existing works in the big data setting.	algorithm;big data;context awareness;dspace;database;massive open online course;personalization;recommender system;regret (decision theory);time complexity	Yifan Hou;Pan Zhou;Ting Wang;Li Yu;Yuchong Hu;Dapeng Wu	2016	CoRR		simulation;computer science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web	AI	-74.61308126087302	-55.68881607288149	8533

Due to the scarcity of neuropsychological tests that assess brain function in congenital blind children in Brazil, Planned Codes provided satisfactory scenery and needed to adapt to the reality of the applicator and children, containing, therefore, features tactile, visual and translated into Portuguese. Moreover, the high-tech offered by Orange Canvas program, favored the possibility of completely automating the entire subtest. The sample consisted of 59 congenital blind children which are students of Specialized School, where 32 realized the whole subtest being 2 of 7 years old and 28 from 8 to 12 years old. To validate this study, was made a clustering of data inherent to the subtest with predictions drawn from behavioral analysis of children, through the Orange Canvas, where it was confirmed the effectiveness of that procedure in clustering the data associated with the predictions suggested. From the children performance, opens itself an intervention and creation field of neuropedagogical strategies computerized to improve the cognitive processing of congenital blind children.	artoolkit;artificial intelligence;canvas element;cluster analysis;cognition;cognitive science;computation;computer monitor;information-based complexity;library (computing);speech synthesis;stanford university centers and institutes;the circle (file system);webcam	Felipe Pulcherio;Carla Verônica M.

Its effective administration can significantly increase the chances of survival for victims of cardiac arrest. LISSA is a serious game designed to complement CPR teaching and also to refresh CPR skills in an enjoyable way. The game presents an emergency situation in a 3D virtual environment and the player has to save the victim applying the CPR actions. In this paper, we describe LISSA and its evaluation in a population composed of 109 nursing undergraduate students enrolled in the Nursing degree of our university. To evaluate LISSA we performed a randomized controlled trial that compares the classical teaching methodology, composed of self-directed learning for theory plus laboratory sessions with a mannequin for practice, with the one that uses LISSA after self-directed learning for theory and before laboratory sessions with a mannequin. From our evaluation we observed that students using LISSA (Group 2 and 3) gave significantly better learning acquisition scores than those following traditional classes (Group 1). To evaluate the differences between students of these groups we performed a paired samples t-test between Group 1 and 2 (μ1=35, 67, μ2=47, 50 and p<0.05) and between students of Group 1 and 3 (μ1=35, 67, μ3=50, 58 and p<0.05). From these tests we observed that there are significant differences in both cases. We also evaluated student performance of main steps of CPR protocol. Students that use LISSA performed better than the ones that did not use it.

58ac2d093c451aa89d41471cb061d13ba271a80d	transfer of systematic computer game training in surgical novices on performance in virtual reality image guided surgical simulators		We report on a pilot study that investigates the transfer effect of systematic computer game training on performance in image guided surgery. In a group of 22 surgical novices, subjects were matched and randomized into one group training with a 3-D first person shooter (FPS) game and one group training with a 2-D non-FPS game. We also included a control group. Subjects were tested pre- and post training in the MIST-VR and GI-Mentor surgical simulators. We found that subjects with past experience specific to FPS games were significantly better in performing the simulated endoscopy task, both regarding time and efficiency of screening, compared to subjects lacking FPS game experience. Furthermore subjects who underwent systematic FPS game training performed better in the MIST-VR than those training with a 2-D game. Our findings indicate a transfer effect and that experience of video games are important for training outcome in simulated surgical procedures. Video game training can become useful when designing future skills training curricula for surgeons.	body dysmorphic disorders;educational curriculum;first person shooter;first-person (video games);floating point systems;mass effect trilogy;microscopy, video;pc game;playstation vr;randomized algorithm;simulators;vr - veterans rand health survey;video games;virtual reality	Marcus Kolga Schlickum;Leif R.

99d2fa3172b258594753e36e3df991e95874e667	a gamified approach to naïve bayes classification: a case study for newswires and systematic medical reviews		Supervised machine learning algorithms require a set of labelled examples to be trained; however, the labelling process is a costly and time consuming task which is carried out by experts of the domain who label the dataset by means of an iterative process to filter out non-relevant objects of the dataset. In this paper, we describe a set of experiments that use gamification techniques to transform this labelling task into an interactive learning process where users can cooperate in order to achieve a common goal. To this end, first we use a geometrical interpretation of Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers in order to create an intuitive visualization of the current state of the system and let the user change some of the parameters directly as part of a game. We apply this visualization technique to the classification of newswire and we report the results of the experiments conducted with different groups of people: PhD students, Master Degree students and general public. Then, we present a preliminary experiment of query rewriting for systematic reviews in a medical scenario, which makes use of gamification techniques to collect different formulation of the same query. Both the experiments show how the exploitation of gamification approaches help to engage the users in abstract tasks that might be hard to understand and/or boring to perform.	gamification;naive bayes classifier	Giorgio Maria Di Nunzio;Maria Maistro;Federica Vezzani	2018		10.1145/3184558.3191547	naive bayes classifier;visualization;ehealth;systematic review;query rewriting;machine learning;artificial intelligence;iterative and incremental development;computer science;interactive learning;crowdsourcing	NLP	-74.19811902477642	-53.98808247589844	17649

However, they often lack the knowledge needed to correctly transfer image accessibility across different website language versions. In this paper, we provide insight into translators' performance as regards their accessibility achievements during text alternatives adaptation from English into French. While our work does not yet return conclusive results, preliminary findings suggest that the combination of both specialized and general web accessibility evaluation tools can help web localizers bridge the knowledge gap and potentially produce text alternatives of higher quality.	web accessibility;web development	Silvia Rodríguez Vázquez	2015		10.1145/2745555.2746662	web design;web accessibility initiative;web standards;engineering;web accessibility;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-67.36828304675048	-57.10741607158392	18538

A stroke neurologist has been conducting stroke education lessons for teens. However, efficiently conveying the information is difficult because the lesson has some limitations, including a shortage of physicians who can present the information. In this study, we have developed an online support system that enables schoolteachers to provide stroke education. This is a new approach. By using our system, schoolteachers can lecture to students on stroke signs, risk factors, symptoms and the FAST message (Facial droop, Arm weakness, Speech disturbance and Time of emergency call) for identifying typical symptoms of TIA. Additionally, we provide a web-based questionnaire survey for checking students' knowledge level. As a trial run of the system, we conducted a test lesson involving 78 students and a schoolteacher in a public junior high school. It was confirmed that the lesson could be conducted without trouble. On average, 70% of all students answered a question about the FAST message correctly. It was suggested that the function of the management side needs to be improved to increase the accuracy of the answer data. Our system could be used as a support tool for stroke education.	knowledge level;television interface adaptor;web application	Shoko Tani;Hiroshi Narazaki;Hiroshi Inada;Takahiro Todo;Michiaki Iwata;Toshinari Nakao;Yuya Shigehatake;Yuki Sakamoto;Fumio Mivashita;Chiaki Yokota;Kazuo Minematsu;Kazuo Nakazawa	2013	2013 7th International Symposium on Medical Information and Communication Technology (ISMICT)	10.1109/ISMICT.2013.6521737	simulation;medicine;physical therapy	HCI	-66.94978413748825	-53.13942734336438	18958
cb24fc3e39dd277c0d9909ef87ef088610a1674b	a quest for the structure of intra- and postoperative surgical team networks: does the small world property evolve over time?		Objective: We examined the structure of intraand postoperative case-collaboration networks among the surgical service providers in a quaternary-care academic medical center, using retrospective electronic medical record (EMR) data. We also analyzed the evolution of the network properties over time, as changes in nodes and edges can affect the network structure. Materials and Methods: We used de-identified intraand postoperative data for adult patients, ages ≥ 21, who received nonambulatory/nonobstetric surgery at Shands at the University of Florida between June 1, 2011 and November 1, 2014. The intraoperative segment contained 30,245 surgical cases, and the postoperative segment considered 30,202 hospitalizations. Results: Our results confirmed the existence of strict small world structure in both intraand postoperative surgical team networks. The U-shape trend of the small world property indicates a decreasing trend in the small world property after an increasing period over time. Therefore, a sudden declining trend is expected in the future in both intraand postoperative networks, since the small world property is currently at its peak. In addition, high network density was observed in the intraoperative segment and partially in postoperative one, representing the existence of cohesive clusters of providers. We also observed that the small world property is exhibited more in the intraoperative compared to the postoperative network. Analyzing the temporal aspects of the networks revealed the postoperative segment tends to lose its cohesiveness as the time passes. Finally, we observed the small-world structure is negatively related to the patients' outcome in both intraand postoperative networks whereas the relation between the outcome and network density is positive. Conclusion: Small changes in graph-theoretic properties of the intraand postoperative networks cause changes in the intensity of the structural properties. However, due to the special characteristics of the examined networks (e.g. high interconnectivity, team-oriented), the network is less likely to lose its structural properties unless the central hubs are removed. Our results highlight the importance of stability of personnel in key positions. This highlights the important role of the central players in the network that offers change-leaders the opportunity to quantify and target those nodes as mediators of process change.	excalibur: morgana's revenge;graph theory;group cohesiveness;interconnectedness;semantic network;small-world experiment	Ashkan Ebadi;Patrick James Tighe;Lei Zheng;Parisa Rashidi	2018	CoRR		service provider;operations management;medical record;group cohesiveness;medicine	ML	-64.75787316589881	-64.86991998359525	19621

The case method aims at discussing problems and solutions in a target case. However, the learners miss discussing some of problems and solutions. Design/methodology/approach – Because opinions about problems and solutions on the same case are similar to each other, the proposed method uses opinions that are correctly annotated in past discussions for annotating an appropriate attribute on each opinion in discussions of the same case. The annotation on each opinion is identified by Support Vector Machine learned with opinions and annotations in the past discussion. Findings – Compared to a simple method that uses decision tree classification, this proposed method improves the recall rate and the precision rate of annotating the attribute by over 10 per cent. The proposed method is effective for automatic annotation. Originality/value – Because the recall rate and the precision rate of annotating an attribute of a problem are over 80 per cent, it is possible to make learners aware of problems that they should discuss. On the other hand, the recall rate and the precision rate of annotating an attribute of a solution are still low. The authors discuss the research issue to improve the rates for automatic annotation.	decision tree;feature vector;nl (complexity);redundancy (engineering);sensitivity and specificity;support vector machine	Masaki Samejima;Daichi Hisakane;Norihisa Komoda	2015	Interact.

a9cbea5be019a431614e5ae19208f930ff4a8ab0	is salience robust? a heterogeneity analysis of survey ratings		Differing weights for salience subdimensions (e.g. visual or structural salience) have been suggested since the early days of salience models in GIScience. Up until now, however, it remains unclear whether weights found in studies are robust across environments, objects and observers. In this study we examine the robustness of a survey-based salience model. Based on ratings of No = 720 objects by Np = 250 different participants collected in-situ in two different European cities (Regensburg and Augsburg) we conduct a heterogeneity analysis taking into account environment and sense of direction stratified by gender. We find, first, empirical evidence that our model is invariant across environments, i.e. the strength of the relationships between the subdimensions of salience does not differ significantly. The structural model coefficients found can, hence, be used to calculate values for overall salience across different environments. Second, we provide empirical evidence that invariance of our measurement model is partly not given with respect to both, gender and sense of direction. These compositional invariance problems are a strong indicator for personal aspects playing an important role. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Mathematics of computing→Multivariate statistics, Humancentered computing→ Personal digital assistants, Human-centered computing→ Empirical studies in ubiquitous and mobile computing	coefficient;geographic information science;human-centered computing;mobile computing;personal digital assistant	Markus Kattenbeck;Eva Nuhn;Sabine Timpf	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.GISCIENCE.2018.7	social psychology;salience (language);psychology	SE	-72.50122183431301	-57.79339410175457	25795

BACKGROUND Medical errors are thought to be a leading cause of death among adults in the United States. However, no review exists summarizing what is known about the barriers and facilitators for successful reporting systems, and no integrated model exists to guide further research into and development of medical error reporting systems.   METHOD Relevant literature was identified using online databases; references in relevant articles were searched for additional relevant articles.   RESULTS The literature review identified components of medical error reporting systems, error reporting system design choices, barriers and incentives for reporting, and suggestions for successful reporting system design. Little theory was found to guide the published research. An integrative cross-level model of medical error reporting system design was developed and is proposed as a framework for understanding the medical error reporting literature, addressing existing limitations, and guiding future design and research.   CONCLUSION The medical error reporting research provides some guidance for designing and implementing successful reporting systems. The proposed cross-level systems model provides a way to understand this existing research. However, additional research is needed on reporting and related safety actions. The proposed model provides a framework for such future research.   APPLICATION This work can be used to guide the design, implementation, and study of medical error reporting systems.		Richard J.

b31e8045336f324232439c21d46681d8bd4a987c	prescriptive analytics system for scholar research performance enhancement		We introduce a prescriptive analytics system, InSciTe Advisory, to provide researchers with advice for their future research direction and strategy. It consists of two main parts: descriptive analytics and prescriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics provides results from research activity history as well as the research power index for the designated researcher. Prescriptive analytics suggests a group of role model researchers to the researcher, as well as methods to adopt their best practices. The prescription for the researcher is provided according to 5W1H questions and their corresponding answers. All of the ana- lytical results and their explanations related to the given researcher are automat- ically generated and saved to a report. This researcher-centric prescriptive analytics framework is expected to be a useful tool to understand the designated researcher from the perspective of prescriptive and descriptive analytics. We evaluated user satisfaction results for InSciTe Advisory and Elsvier Scival by five test users. The result of the evaluation demonstrated that user satisfaction of InSciTe Advisory is 126.5% higher than Scival.

The qualitative analyses are carried out in terms of the basic reproduction number  R  0 . The global analytical results are then obtained by employing novel techniques and methods: the disease-free equilibrium is of global asymptotic stability when a threshold  R  0  ≤ 1 is satisfied; otherwise, a unique endemic equilibrium exists and it is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and extend analytical results. It is shown that diagnosis, treatment and education have positive effect on the control of HIV transmission, but senior male clients can burden the HIV epidemic and prolong the duration of the disease outbreak.

df196369e53918867c1bf743c547eb9b9d4570c3	assessing text-based writing of low-skilled college students		The problem of poor writing skills at the postsecondary level is a large and troubling one. This study investigated the writing skills of low-skilled adults attending college developmental education courses by determining whether variables from an automated scoring system were predictive of human scores on writing quality rubrics. The human-scored measures were a holistic quality rating for a persuasive essay and an analytic quality score for a written summary. Both writing samples were based on text on psychology and sociology topics related to content taught at the introductory undergraduate level. The study is a modified replication of McNamara et al. (Written Communication, 27(1), 57–86 2010), who identified several Coh-Metrix variables from five linguistic classes that reliably predicted group membership (high versus low proficiency) using human quality scores on persuasive essays written by average-achieving college students. When discriminant analyses and ANOVAs failed to replicate the McNamara et al. (Written Communication, 27(1), 57–86 2010) findings, the current study proceeded to analyze all of the variables in the five Coh-Metrix classes. This larger analysis identified 10 variables that predicted human-scored writing proficiency. Essay and summary scores were predicted by different automated variables.

BACKGROUND Many claim that researchers in certain fields do not replicate prior research. This is troubling because replications allow science to self-correct. A successful replication corroborates the original finding, whereas an unsuccessful replication falsifies it. To date, no one has assessed whether this issue affects the field of human factors.   METHOD In the first study, eight articles (parent articles) were selected from the 1991 issues of the journal Human Factors. Each article that had referenced one of the eight parent articles between 1991 and September 2006 (child articles) were also retrieved. Two investigators coded and compared each child article against its 1991 parent article to determine whether the child article replicated its parent article. The second study replicated these procedures.   RESULTS Half or more of the parent articles in Study I and Study 2 (75% and 50%, respectively) were replicated at least once. Furthermore, human factors researchers conducted replications of their own work as well as the work of others. However, many researchers did not state that they replicated previous research.   CONCLUSION Replications seem to be common in the human factors literature. However, readers may not realize that a study replicated prior research. Thus, they may incorrectly assess the evidence concerning a given finding.   APPLICATION Human factors professionals should be taught how to identify replications and to be cautious of research that has not been replicated.	dna replication;holography;human factors and ergonomics;objective-c;replication (computing);self-replication	Keith S.

Regulation activities are beginning to make the accessibility of software a mandatory requirement in some countries. One such activity is the European Mandate M 376, which will result in a European standard (EN 301 549) defining functional accessibility requirements for information and communication technology products and services. This paper provides an overview of Mandate M 376 and EN 301 549, and describes the requirements for software accessibility defined in EN 301 549, according to a feature-based approach.	accessibility;requirement	Loïc Martínez;Michael Pluke	2013		10.1016/j.procs.2014.02.030	computer science;software requirements	SE	-64.30781835707626	-55.80083643582622	28672

Pictograms are culturally sensitive thus need to be rigorously validated to ensure they convey the intended meaning correctly to the targeted population. The infeasibility of manually creating pictograms and the lack of robust means to store and validate pictograms are potential barriers to the wider adoption of pictograms in health communication. To address these challenges, we created an open access web-based tool, PEACE (Pictogram Evaluation and Authoring Collaboration Environment) as a part of SHINE (Sustainable Health Informatics and Networking Environment) initiatives. We report the development process and the preliminary evaluation results of PEACE in this paper.

Hence, if we find physicians that share patients with each other probably they configure an informal care team. Thus, the objective of this work is to explore the possibility of finding care teams using Social Network Analysis techniques in physician-physician networks where the physicians have patients in common. For this, we used healthcare insurance claims to build the network. There was the agreement on the metrics of degree and eigenvalue and of betweenness and closeness, also physicians with the 5 highest eigenvalues are highly interconnected. We discuss that the analysis of the physician-physician network with metrics of centrality is promising to reveal informal care teams. The high potential in calculating these metrics is verified from the results to evaluate member's performance and with that how to take actions to improve the work of the team.

The purpose of this research is to obtain the ranking of infant health in Java based on five indicators and three indicators. These indicators or variables are number of infant deaths (infd), number of people in poverty (pov), number of infants with low birth weight (lbw), number of deliveries in absence of health personnel (abhp), and average education shortfall of women (avedsf). All variables are district level aggregates. Besides ranking, hotspots based on those indicators are also detected by ULS hotspot detection method, while rankings are computed based on ORDIT, implemented in R software. Rankings of the districts based on 5 (all) indicators and 3 indicators (infd, pov, lbw) are obtained. Also, ranking is obtained based on salient scaling of 5 indicators and salient scaling of 3 indicators. According to those results, the most severe districts are districts 87 and 90, while the least severe districts are districts 73, 31, and 35. There are many districts in the hotspot area as the results of the ULS hotspot detection. Districts 87, 90, 47, 58, 83, 44, and 45 are the worst areas of infant health. This result is important information for the government, especially the Health Department to make decisions for the improvement of health programs. The methods can be used as a micro tool to extend the function and understanding of e-governance.	e-governance;ecology;hotspot (wi-fi);image scaling;java hotspot virtual machine;stochastic process;ultra-large-scale systems	Yekti Widyaningsih;Wayne L.

Previous research suggests that IM users often multitask while conversing online. To date, no one has yet examined the cognitive effect of concurrent IM use. Participants in the present study (N = 69) completed a reading comprehension task uninterrupted or while concurrently holding an IM conversation. Participants who IMed while performing the reading task took significantly longer to complete the task, indicating that concurrent IM use negatively affects efficiency. Concurrent IM use did not affect reading comprehension scores. Additional analyses revealed that the more time participants reported spending on IM, the lower their reading comprehension scores. Finally, we found that the more time participants reported spending on IM, the lower their self-reported GPA.

When the determinants are aptitude and training time or time on the job, an isoperformance curve allows one to identify individuals who have sufficient aptitude for the work that they can be expected to reach a specified standard of performance in a specified length of time. This paper discusses isoperformance in the personnel selection and classification literature and then develops and illustrates the uses of isoperformance curves in personnel decisions. The idea of aptitude sensitivity is introduced, and the relationship between this idea and predictive validity is explained. The paper also indicates how isoperformance can be used to detail trade-offs among training time, the minimum qualifying score, attrition rate, quotas, and the specified level of criterion performance, Isoperformance finds direct application in the multiple-job assignment problem, exemplified by the choice of which recruit to send to which training school in the military services.	assignment problem;attrition (website);contour line;personnel selection;tooth attrition;aptitude	Marshall B.

818ca410e7a1d9f8012729f472f67801086a4057	effect of attitude towards sms technology and its applications on blood donation behaviour		This paper assesses the effect of attitude towards SMS technology and SMS based reminders on blood donation behaviour through a survey using a self-administered questionnaire. Specifically, the study assesses the attitude towards SMS technology and content of SMS based reminders among blood donors of the Malawi Blood Transfusion Service. Furthermore, the paper assesses the relationship between attitude towards SMS technology and SMS based reminders on one hand and blood donation behaviour on the other. The paper has shown that blood donors at the Malawi Blood Transfusion Service have positive attitude towards the SMS technology and SMS message content on all dimensions. Although the results have shown that blood donors attitude towards SMS technology was positive irrespective demographic variations, the results have also shown that level of education of the donors moderates their attitude towards the content of SMS message with donors without formal education qualification exhibiting relatively negative attitude compared with those with formal qualification. However, the survey was limited to effects of overall attitude towards SMS technology on intention to donate blood. Since intention to donate blood is a socially accepted behaviour, the results may have been biased by respondents who may have given socially acceptable responses while their actual position may have been different. Furthermore, dimensions that significantly contribute to these relationships were not examined.		Harry Sam Harrison Gombachika;Maganizo D.

Automatic tools for analyzing online discussions are highly desirable for better information management and assistance. For example, a summary of student Q&A discussions or unresolved questions can help the instructor assess student dialogue efficiently, which can lead to better instructor guidance for student learning by discussion. This paper presents an approach for classifying student discussions according to a set of discourse structures, and identifying discussions with confusion or unanswered questions. Inspired by the existing spoken dialogue analysis approaches, we first define a set of forum “speech acts” (F-SAs) that represent roles that individual messages play in threaded Q&A discussions, such as questions, raising issues, and answers. We then model discourse structures in discussion threads using the F-SAs, such as whether a question was replied to with an answer. Finally, we use such discourse structures in classifying and identifying discussions with unanswered questions or unresolved issues. We performed an analysis of the discussion thread classifiers and the system showed accuracies from 0.79 to 0.87 on several discussion classification problems. This analysis of human conversation via online discussions provides a basis for development of future information extraction and intelligent assistance techniques for online discussions.	computer-mediated communication;conversation threading;customer support;information extraction;information management;interaction;web application	Jihie Kim;Jeon-Hyung Kang	2010	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-013-0481-1	computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	NLP	-75.79179300841413	-52.325860055757474	37967
6f0f88764b2d9dc1063c0c847a1a7c53c926ad42	designing an acoustic feedback system for on-water rowing training		Analysis of measured kinematic parameters is commonly used in competitive sports to optimize athletes’ performance. The progress in technology offers new ways for displaying feedback information to athletes. In rowing, synchronous visual feedback is regularly used, but the presentation of acoustic information is a new and promising application for technique training and monitoring. This paper describes the prototype Sofirow as an online acoustic feedback system for onwater rowing training, developed in cooperation between the University of Hamburg and BeSB GmbH Berlin. Sofirow measures propulsive boat acceleration (MEMS sensor, up to 125Hz) and velocity (4Hz-GPS). Technical requirements concerned with the acoustic transformation (sonification) and its presentation. The associated software Regatta provides an analysis of the measured data. An intracyclic analysis of the boat’s acceleration-time-trace investigated potential benefits for the time structure of the acceleration trace. Effects on boat motion were explored in an empirical investigation with the German junior national rowing team in 2009. The first significant results were encouraging and support the implementation of acoustic information regularly into training processes for elite athletes. Sofirow represents the rhythmic acceleration trace distinctly and audibly and thus, offers systematic monitoring and control of the boat motion in on-water technique training.	acoustic cryptanalysis;audio feedback;global positioning system;microelectromechanical systems;prototype;requirement;sonification;velocity (software development)	Nina Schaffert;Klaus Mattes	2010	Int.

Over the past few years, several studies have evaluated the potential of spatial models for robot navigation and ubiquitous computing. In this paper we take a slightly different perspective, considering not only the underlying properties of those spatial models, but also to which degree the notion of context can be taken into account when delivering services in indoor environments. Some preliminary recommendations for the development of indoor spatial models are introduced from a context-aware perspective. A taxonomy of models is then presented and assessed with the aim of providing a flexible spatial data model for navigation purposes, and by taking into account the context dimensions.

Based on the knowledge of several human sport experts, various motoric skills tests, morphologic characteristics measurements and functional tests are quantized according to their importance for a chosen set of sports. Obtained values are entered into the knowledge database along with the grades of the measured results for each test. Fuzzy logic is implemented in order to make the system more flexible and robust. The whole system is web-oriented, i.e. developed ASP.NET application is available to the internet users with a proper login and password. The developed expert system gives acceptability prediction and proposal of the most suitable sports for the person being tested. The output results of the system were evaluated by 4 experts, using real data collected during several years. Comparison is done between the sport proposed by our expert system and the actual outcome of the person's sports career. Also, the comparison of the expert system output and the human expert suggestions were done. All tests showed high reliability and accuracy of the developed system.

In the last five years (2012–17) these strategies have evolved to include a range of technology enhanced learning resources (TEL) in a blended learning setting to assess the performance progression of students’ learning cavity preparation skills. Every students’ performance outcomes were retrieved from the hapTEL simulator log files for each task including the percentage of caries, healthy tissue and pulp removed. The use of a blend of video recorded short lectures followed by face to face teaching, pair working, haptic, visual images and sound feedback, and individual student assessment record keeping showed an improved reliability in performance of the work-stations and a consistently higher rate of student’s log files records compared with previous years. Records of students’ performance collected over two years showed that the HapTEL system enabled students to perform better at cavity preparation after practising over two sessions.	haptic technology	Margaret J.

However, great challenges must be faced with the development of CAPTCHA identification. In order to improve the safety of the professional system, the CAPTCHA online identification based on the knowledge base, which has high security and bases on semantic questions and the professionalization of professional system, is put forward combining with the recessive CAPTCHA. The specific implementation course of the new online identification method is worked out according to the example of animal identification. The application of the verification code is suitable for people who have the corresponding professional knowledge. Because the computer has great difficulty to answer semantic information questions, which are also professional issues, so the new online identification method based on the verification of knowledge has very high security.	captcha;knowledge base	Yu'e Song;Chengguo Wang;Ling Zhu;Xiaofeng Chen;Qiyu Zhang	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-48354-2_9	knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	NLP	-76.23963681572243	-54.187282191436175	44660
1b2278122373e3945b85f437804bcfb6a98500ef	what words do we use to lie?: word choice in deceptive messages		Text messaging is the most widely used form of computermediated communication (CMC). Previous findings have shown that linguistic factors can reliably indicate messages as deceptive. For example, users take longer and use more words to craft deceptive messages than they do truthful messages. Existing research has also examined how factors, such as student status and gender, affect rates of deception and word choice in deceptive messages. However, this research has been limited by small sample sizes and has returned contradicting findings. This paper aims to address these issues by using a dataset of text messages collected from a large and varied set of participants using an Android messaging application. The results of this paper show significant differences in word choice and frequency of deceptive messages between male and female participants, as well as between students and non-students.

More specifically, an original method to assess an algorithm with end-users is described.  First, a work system analysis was performed through observations and interviews of physicians and nurses from the pediatric emergency department from a French 2965-bed academic hospital. Then, the work system was modeled with a focus on how the patients are arranged and on which criteria the arrangement is based. Those results allowed developing a patients arrangement algorithm along with recommendations to develop a patient scheduling system automatically fed by the existing electronic patient record system. A mock-up of the patient scheduling system has been developed in order to test upstream in the design process the proposed algorithm and a set of icons with healthcare professionals through user testing.  Overall, results showed the end-users validated the patients arrangement algorithm and most of the icons. Next steps will be to develop and to implement the patient scheduling system in the pediatric emergency department in order to assess its impact.	algorithm;human factors and ergonomics;mock object;scheduling (computing);system analysis;usability testing;work systems	Jessica Schiro;Nicolas Leroy;Romaric Marcilly	2015		10.1145/2820619.2820635	simulation;medicine;operations management;pediatrics	HCI	-63.79325503521347	-65.15716709034291	48023

METHODS Large-scale qualitative data were obtained from Dailystrength.org. Based on a hand-coded training dataset, all posts were classified into informational or emotional using a Bayesian classification algorithm to generalize the findings. Posts that could not be classified with a probability of at least 75% were excluded.   RESULTS The overall tendency toward emotional posts differs by condition: mental health (depression, schizophrenia) and Alzheimer's disease consist of more emotional posts, while informational posts relate more to nonterminal physical conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, asthma). There is no gender difference across conditions, although prostate cancer forums are oriented toward informational support, whereas breast cancer forums rather feature emotional support. Across diseases, the best predictors for emotional content are lower age and a higher number of overall posts by the support group member.   DISCUSSION The results are in line with previous empirical research and unify empirical findings from single/2-condition research. Limitations include the analytical restriction to predefined categories (informational, emotional) through the chosen machine-learning approach.   CONCLUSION Our findings provide an empirical foundation for building theory on informational versus emotional support across conditions, give insights for practitioners to better understand the role of online support groups for different patients, and show the usefulness of machine-learning approaches to analyze large-scale qualitative health data from online settings.

65b38dd0e80cfb30634017ed59607de5cfa77f12	like trainer, like bot? inheritance of bias in algorithmic content moderation		The internet has become a central medium through which ‘networked publics’ express their opinions and engage in debate. Offensive comments and personal attacks can inhibit participation in these spaces. Automated content moderation aims to overcome this problem using machine learning classifiers trained on large corpora of texts manually annotated for offence. While such systems could help encourage more civil debate, they must navigate inherently normatively contestable boundaries, and are subject to the idiosyncratic norms of the human raters who provide the training data. An important objective for platforms implementing such measures might be to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offence. This paper provides some exploratory methods by which the normative biases of algorithmic content moderation systems can be measured, by way of a case study using an existing dataset of comments labelled for offence. We train classifiers on comments labelled by different demographic subsets (men and women) to understand how differences in conceptions of offence between these groups might affect the performance of the resulting models on various test sets. We conclude by discussing some of the ethical choices facing the implementers of algorithmic moderation systems, given various desired levels of diversity of viewpoints amongst discussion participants.	comment (computer programming);internet;machine learning;text corpus;video game bot	Reuben Binns;Michael Veale;Max Van Kleek;Nigel Shadbolt	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67256-4_32	computer science;normative;publics;moderation;viewpoints;the internet;training set;social psychology;trainer	HCI	-71.09813976108674	-56.92090111922116	53638

The purpose of this literature synthesis is to build a repository of the metrics being used to evaluate nursing and healthcare provider simulation. Additionally, the level of fidelity and desired learning domains that the matrices purport to evaluate is examined. A secondary purpose of the literature synthesis is to determine if a suitable metric is available that can be used universally to evaluate nursing and healthcare related simulations. Finally, conceptual frameworks suitable for serving as the bases of instrument development related to nursing and health care simulation are explored. Primary studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews that discussed or evaluated metrics used to measure outcomes of simulation were analyzed. Recent articles, published within the last five years, which discussed the evaluation of nursing and or healthcare simulation, were eligible for inclusion. Additionally, descriptive, inferential, qualitative, and quantitative studies were eligible for inclusion.

Many educators do not have an in-depth understanding of the metrics available to assess the use of simulation.

A secondary purpose of the literature synthesis is to determine if there is a suitable metric available that can be used universally to evaluate nursing and healthcare related simulations. Finally, conceptual frameworks suitable for serving as the bases of instrument development related to nursing and or health care simulation will be explored. Simulation is defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary (“Simulation”, 2012) as the imitative representation of the functioning of one system or process by means of the functioning of another. Types of simulation that are commonly used in nursing and healthcare education include case studies, role playing, low fidelity, medium fidelity, and high fidelity simulations. For this literature synthesis the author included articles that discussed low fidelity simulators, medium fidelity simulators, and high fidelity simulators. Low fidelity simulators include simple task trainers that replicate human anatomy, which also provide physiological or behavioral feedback to intervention. A common example of a low fidelity simulator is Seymour Butts, a wound care simulator. Medium fidelity simulators replicate the whole human body and give limited physiological or behavioral feedback. Common examples of a medium fidelity simulator include Vital Anne a vital sign simulator manufactured by Laerdal. Vital Anne has adjustable heart sounds, lungs sounds, vital signs, and limited verbal response to interventions such as gagging or coughing. High fidelity simulators mimic real humans from an anatomical perspective and a physiological and behavioral perspective. Well know high fidelity simulators include METI Man and Sim Man. Both of these Human Patient Simulators (HPS) respond to interventions as human would respond (Grady, 2009). The use of simulation, as a teaching strategy, is rapidly expanding and recognized as a method to improve outcomes in a complex health environment. Simulation allows students and healthcare providers’ opportunities to explore and develop skills, knowledge, understanding, and clinical judgments. Simulated settings provide a safe environment for the practice of situations that occur in unique and rare instances. The Standards for Best Practice in Simulation (INASCL, 2011) note that use of simulation experiences can provide meaningful evaluation of the three domains of learning—cognitive, affective and psychomotor. The cognitive domain is further delineated into content knowledge and clinical reasoning. Since simulation is often used in conjunction with or in substitution of clinical experiences, instruments are needed that are reliable and valid in measuring all three domains. According to Kardong-Edgren, Adamson, and Fitzgerald (2010, p. e28), “evaluative instruments ideally should include some measures for each of the three domains of student performance: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. An instrument, measuring any one of these alone will not be accurate in evaluating overall performance”.	best practice;cognitive science;computer simulation;dictionary;inferential programming;self-replicating machine;software repository;systematic review	Timothy W.

This project aimed to evaluate the impact of an innovative virtual reality (VR) learning environment on the development of technical proficiency by students. The study assessed the technical skills of first year medical imaging students. The learning experience by each student was either via traditional laboratory-based simulation or VR simulation, for two specified anatomical protocols. Following the learning experience, the students performed role-plays and were assessed on their technical proficiency. The type of learning environment, laboratory-based or VR simulation, was recorded for each radiographic procedure, as well as demographic data. Data demonstrated an improved total role-play skill score for those students trained using VR software simulation compared with the total role-play skills score traditional laboratory simulation...	medical imaging;simulated reality;simulation;virtual reality	Therese Gunn;Lee Jones;Pete Bridge;Pam Rowntree;Lisa Nissen	2018	Interactive Learning Environments	10.1080/10494820.2017.1374981	knowledge level;educational technology;multimedia;simulation;computer science;virtual reality;software;forecast skill;health care;medical imaging;learning environment	Visualization	-68.04089097118613	-54.61376898462987	55425

This was a controlled, randomized study of 120 medical students. Students were randomly assigned to either of 2 intubation groups, which used (1) DL (n=64) or (2) VL (n=56) with the Karl Storz C-MAC® video laryngoscope. Each student attempted 1 endotracheal intubation on a Laerdal® Airway Management Trainer. The primary outcome measure was the time for successful endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of esophageal intubation (EI), excess application of pressure on the maxillary incisor teeth (EMP), and first-time success rate. Mean time for endotracheal intubation was significantly faster in the VL group than in the DL group (101 ± 83 seconds vs. 180 ± 102.5 seconds; P˂0.001). In the VL group, 3.6% of the students committed an EI versus 56.3% in the DL group (P˂0.001). No significant difference was found in the incidence of EMP: 51.8% in the VL group versus 57.8% in the DL group (P=0.508). For medical students with little or no endotracheal intubation experience, VL facilitates success and decreases the number of EIs, at least in a simulated environment.	binary prefix;c-mac;experience;incidence matrix;karl wiegers;offset binary;randomized algorithm;randomness;simulation;virtual reality	Hannes Prescher;David E.

They enhance and consolidate the knowledge and practical skills of nurses by identification of training and career development plans as well as improvement in health care quality services, increase in job satisfaction and use of cost-effective resources. In this paper, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is proposed for the appraisal and relative performance evaluation of nurses. The model is validated on thirty-two nurses working at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at one of the most recognized hospitals in Lebanon. The DEA was able to classify nurses into efficient and inefficient ones. The set of efficient nurses was used to establish an internal best practice benchmark to project career development plans for improving the performance of other inefficient nurses. The DEA result confirmed the ranking of some nurses and highlighted injustice in other cases that were produced by the currently practiced appraisal system. Further, the DEA model is shown to be an effective talent management and motivational tool as it can provide clear managerial plans related to promoting, training and development activities from the perspective of nurses, hence increasing their satisfaction, motivation and acceptance of appraisal results. Due to such features, the model is currently being considered for implementation at ICU. Finally, the ratio of the number DEA units to the number of input/output measures is revisited with new suggested values on its upper and lower limits depending on the type of DEA models and the desired number of efficient units from a managerial perspective.	benchmark (computing);best practice;clinical governance;data envelopment analysis;division of extramural activities;health services;input/output;job syndrome;performance evaluation;promotion (action);quality of health care;intensive care unit;standards characteristics	Ibrahim H.

The digital ecosystem may consist of various computerized systems that provide assisted support, relevant mandatory services, opportunistic pro-active offers, reviews and ratings, and insights from the social web. While addressing a customeru0027s situation the customer and/or the digital ecosystem has to choose the appropriate systems/services with suitable options to be activated in order to deliver effective customer care. This aspect can get quite complicated and some customers tend to get lost in the process and are unable to get their situation addressed to their satisfaction. We propose an intermediary chatbot between a customer and digital ecosystem that can act as a catalyst to diagnose a customeru0027s situation and provision the appropriate services in the ecosystem. The intermediary chatbot engages in a dialog with a customer for identifying his/her situation and extract the set of latent beliefs that the customer holds. It then helps contextualize the systems in the digital ecosystem to offer suitable services, leading to a richer user experience.	digital ecosystem;social media;user experience;dialog	Amit Sangroya;Pratik Saini;C.

In recent research, gamification learning material design is often applied to reinforce learning performance, while the prediction of gamification learning performance is seldom discussed. This study therefore applies Rough set theory to extract Core Set and generating rule, ANFIS for learning achievement predication. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed model, the VCCSEGLS dataset are collected as experimental dataset and compared with other models. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the listing models in accuracy. The three key factors are extract, (G7) Time spent on game-based learning, (L1) Examination, normal drugs and treatment, and (L2) Integration ability (time scoring, stability scoring, strain capacity, completeness scoring).The proposed model also can offer accurate predictions and provide some simple decision rules, which can be accurately used by decision-makers and game designers.	gamification	Chung-Ho Su	2017	International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making	10.1142/S0219622017500092	simulation;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	-76.8913469021221	-52.08985408661954	63151

Furthermore, they do not explain to users what is wrong with their password or how to improve it. We describe the development and evaluation of a data-driven password meter that provides accurate strength measurement and actionable, detailed feedback to users. This meter combines neural networks and numerous carefully combined heuristics to score passwords and generate data-driven text feedback about the user's password. We describe the meter's iterative development and final design. We detail the security and usability impact of the meter's design dimensions, examined through a 4,509-participant online study. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we found that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback led users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator.	artificial neural network;heuristic (computer science);iterative and incremental development;iterative method;password;usability	Blase Ur;Felicia Alfieri;Maung Aung;Lujo Bauer;Nicolas Christin;Jessica Colnago;Lorrie Faith Cranor;Henry Dixon;Pardis Emami Naeini;Hana Habib;Noah Johnson;William Melicher	2017		10.1145/3025453.3026050	cognitive password;password;human–computer interaction;real-time computing;heuristics;usability;artificial neural network;iterative and incremental development;password strength;computer security;computer science;data-driven	HCI	-64.31972175338699	-52.51650500531781	67203

The USEFIL system enhances social care and medical service provision by exploiting “frugal” ICT solutions such as low cost “off-the-shelf” technology and unobtrusive monitoring technologies to develop services that will assist the elderly in maintaining their independence throughout their daily activities. The project adopted the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to design and develop the USEFIL system because this methodology incorporates all those principles, practices, and procedures to help us meet USEFIL systems’ objectives. Aim of the paper is to demonstrate the use of the DSRM process to design an ICT solution for the case study of ICT technologies for assistive living environments for elderly people. More specifically using the theoretical lens of the Design Science Research Methodology theory the paper presents the necessary steps that have been conducted to design the USEFIL system. The USEFIL system was implemented and validated over a three year period with elderly people, their unofficial carers and doctors. Results demonstrate that the technology readily succeeds in meeting the study’s initial objectives. Although the project is still running and the design specification of the USEFIL system is under continuous update, the main modules that have been designed and realized will be presented in the paper.

f67b503fd48642bff818f1a134c3365fa1f443e9	exploring the influence of captcha types to the users response time by statistical analysis		CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. It is a test program that solves a given task for preventing the attacks made by automatic programs. If the response to CAPTCHA is correct, then the program classifies the user as a human. This paper introduces a new analysis of the impact of different CAPTCHAs to the Internet user’s response time. It overcomes the limitations of the previous approaches in the state-of-the-art. In this sense, different types of CAPTCHAs are presented and described. Furthermore, an experiment is conducted, which is based on two populations of Internet users for text and image-based CAPTCHA types, differentiated by demographic features, such as age, gender, education level and Internet experience. Each user is required to solve the different types of CAPTCHA, and the response time to solve the CAPTCHAs is registered. The obtained results are statistically processed by Mann-Whitney U and Pearson’s correlation coefficient tests.

93f40c9bc2b80cb0fcfdfc831d51526c9c248915	using interactive fiction to teach pediatricians-in-training about child abuse		Electronic learning is used extensively in medical education. Though some interventions have incorporated elements of gamification and narrative, interactive fiction is a novel approach to educating medical trainees. Diagnosis and management of child abuse requires competencies in patient care, systems-based practice, communication, and professionalism. This complexity, along with the emotional significance of caring for abused children, makes child abuse pediatrics an ideal topic for an initial implementation of an interactive-fiction-based learning module. This module will be compared to a standard e-learning module in the education of physicians training to become pediatricians.		Grant P. Christman;Sheree M.

Current systems and approaches help in finding similar papers for a given paper, even though researchers tend to additionally search using a set of papers. This paper aims to focus on conceptualizing and developing recommendation techniques for key literature review and manuscript preparatory tasks that are interconnected. In this paper, the user evaluation results of the task where seed basket-based discovery of papers is performed are presented.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnA user evaluation study was conducted on a corpus of papers extracted from the ACM Digital Library. Participants in the study included 121 researchers who had experience in authoring research papers. Participants, split into students and staff groups, had to select one of the provided 43 topics and run the tasks offered by the developed assistive system. A questionnaire was provided at the end of each task for evaluating the task performance.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe results show that the student group evaluated the task more favourably than the staff group, even though the difference was statistically significant for only 5 of the 16 measures. The measures topical relevance, interdisciplinarity, familiarity and usefulness were found to be significant predictors for user satisfaction in this task. A majority of the participants, who explicitly stated the need for assistance in finding similar papers, were satisfied with the recommended papers in the study.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThe current research helps in bridging the gap between novices and experts in terms of literature review skills. The hybrid recommendation technique evaluated in this study highlights the effectiveness of combining the results of different approaches in finding similar papers.

ea8d45c8155e0088b1dde1b24ffa588400a40b70	cover your cough! quantifying the benefits of a localized healthy behavior intervention on flu epidemics in washington dc		We use a synthetic population model of Washington DC, including residents and transients such as tourists and business travelers, to simulate epidemics of influenza-like illnesses. Assuming that the population is vaccinated at the compliance levels reported by the CDC, we show that additionally implementing a policy that encourages healthy behaviors (such as covering your cough and using hand sanitizers) at four major museum locations around the National Mall can lead to very significant reductions in the epidemic. These locations are chosen because there is a high level of mixing between residents and transients. We show that this localized healthy behavior intervention is approximately equivalent to a 46.14% increase in vaccination compliance levels.	high-level programming language;population model;simulation;synthetic intelligence;transient (computer programming)	Nidhi Kiranbhai Parikh;Mina Youssef;Samarth Swarup;Stephen Eubank;Youngyun Chungbaek	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-05579-4_17	gerontology;simulation	HCI	-63.777619618673	-65.92200645757346	74523

Participants carried out a visual pattern-matching task on a computer while communicating with a confederate either via instant messaging (IM) or online voice chat. Communicating with a confederate led to a 50% drop in visual pattern-matching performance in the IM condition and a 30% drop in the voice condition. Visual fixations on pattern-matching were fewer and shorter during the communication task and a greater loss of fixations was found in the IM condition than the voice condition. The results, examined within a threaded cognition framework, suggest that distributing the work between the audio and visual channels reduces performance degradation.

Several researchers and companies have developed software to help individuals with ASD developing those skills; however, there is a lack of applications in Portuguese that are tailored to the individual needs of each child. In this context, we present VITHEA-Kids, a platform where caregivers can create exercises and customize the interaction between each child and the platform. We also developed a module for the automatic generation of multiple choice exercises, meant to be integrated in VITHEA-Kids. We evaluated this work with caregivers (which provided promising indicators), with a child (ongoing upon thesis delivery) and we also evaluated the generation of incorrect answers in multiple choice exercises (achieving acceptance rates between 61.11 % and 92.22 %).	computation	João Paulo Teixeira da Silva;Ricardo Ribeiro;Paulo Quaresma;André Adami;António Branco	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-41552-9		HCI	-66.86797830084076	-52.76985225291669	79364

Our goal is to find out how the complex information sharing processes during nurses' brief shift change unfold in a hospital setting. Our study shows the multitude of information media that nurses access during the parallel processes of information assembly and disassembly: digital, paper-based, displayed and verbal media. An initial analysis reveals how the common information spaces, where information media are positioned and accessible by all participants, are actively used and how they interact with the personal information spaces ephemerally constructed by the participants. Several types of information are consistently transposed from the common information spaces to the personal information space including: demographics, historical data, reminders and to-dos, alerts, prompts, scheduling and reporting information. Information types are often enhanced with a variety of visual cues to help nurses carry out their tasks.	digital paper;disassembler;information flow;personally identifiable information;scheduling (computing)	Charlotte Tang;M.

It includes interactive lessons that focus on particular communicative skills and interactive games that apply those skills. Heavy emphasis is placed on spoken communication: learners must learn to speak the foreign language to complete the lessons and play the games. It focuses on the language and cultural skills needed to accomplish particular types of tasks and gives learners rich, realistic opportunities to practice achieving those tasks. Several TLCTS courses have been developed so far. Tactical Iraqi, Tactical Pashto, and Tactical French are in widespread use by U.S. marines and soldiers, and increasingly by military service members in other countries. Additional courses are being developed for use by business executives, workers for nongovernmental organizations, and high school and college students. While precise numbers are impossible to obtain (we do not control copies made by the U.S. government), over 40,000 and as many as 60,000 people have trained so far with TLCTS courses. More than 1000 people download copies of TLCTS courses each month, either for their own use or to set up computer language labs and redistribute copies to students. Just one training site, the military advisor training center at Fort Riley, Kansas, trains approximately 10,000 people annually. Artificial intelligence technologies play multiple essential functions in TLCTS. Speech is the primary input modality, so automated speech recognition tailored to foreign language learners is essential. TLCTS courses are populated with “virtual humans” that engage in dialogue with learners. AI techniques are used to model the decision processes of the virtual humans and to support the generation of their behavior. This makes it possible to give learners extensive conversational practice. Learner modeling software continually monitors each learner’s application of communication skills to estimate the learner’s	artificial intelligence;computer language;download;modality (human–computer interaction);naval tactical data system;population;speech recognition	W.

Yet, this knowledge is not readily disseminated to other practitioners and translated into practice guidelines. We argue that a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing mechanism can serve as a key change agent to improve the attitudes, beliefs and methods for pediatric pain management. We are using collaborative technologies, in the realm of Web 2.0, to develop a web-based knowledge sharing medium for fostering a community of pediatric pain practitioners that engages in collaborative learning and problem solving. We present the design and use of a web portal featuring a discussion forum to facilitate experiential knowledge sharing based on our LINKS knowledge sharing model.	attitude;pain management;peer-to-peer;practice guidelines as topic;problem solving (mental process);web 2.0;web application	Syed Sibte Raza Abidi;Salah Hussini;Wimorat Sriraj;Somboon Thienthong;G.

A quali-quantitative research was carried out in Italy to provide an overview on information seeking behavior and information needs of doctors, in particular of infectious disease specialists, and to suggest an action plan for improving relevance, quality and usability of scientific information.   METHODS We did a quantitative survey and three focus groups. Two hundred infectious disease specialists answered a 24-item questionnaire aimed at investigating features of scientific information they receive and their ratings about its completeness, quality and usability. Subsequent focus groups, each involving eight specialists, investigated their opinions on information sources and materials, and their suggestions on how these could better support their information needs.   RESULTS The quantitative survey indicated doctors' appreciation of traditional channels (especially drug representatives) and information materials (brochures), but also their attitude to autonomous search of information and their wish to have more digital channels available. Focus groups provided more depth and, not surprisingly, revealed that physicians consider critical to get complete, comparative and specific information quickly, but also that they would like to discuss their doubts with expert colleagues. Quite strikingly, limited concerns were expressed on information validity, potential biases and conflicts of interests, as scientific validity seems to be related to the perceived authoritativeness of information sources rather than to the availability of a transparent evaluation framework. Although this research investigated views of infectious disease specialists, we believe that their opinions and perceived needs should not substantially differ from those of other clinicians, either in primary or in secondary care.   CONCLUSIONS In participants' view, the ideal information framework should provide quick and tailored answers through available evidence and favor the exchange of information between practitioners and trusted experts. The general consensus existing within the scientific and medical community on the need for integrating available evidence and experience is confirmed, although the issues of information validity and conflicts of interests seem definitely overlooked.	about your medicines;autonomous robot;communicable diseases;conflict (psychology);dosage forms;focus groups;focus group;information framework;information needs;information seeking behavior;information source;relevance;secondary care;usability;interest	Giulio Formoso;Paolo Rizzini;Maurizio Bassi;Paolo Bonfanti;Giuliano Rizzardini;Annalisa Campomori;Paola Mosconi	2016		10.1186/s12911-016-0355-7	health informatics;information needs;medicine;information processes and technology;knowledge management;information mapping;nursing;personal information management;management information systems;data mining;group information management;management science;information quality;information system	AI	-63.4517236930687	-63.56506033184089	87222

This research study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the researchers evaluated the HIS of 13 hospitals in Iran using ISO 9241 part 10, and in the second stage, they compared the evaluation results with the following softwares: a) IS-H*med (evaluated by Hamborg et al. 2004) b) SAP-HR (evaluated by Gruber 2000) c) Microsoft Word for Windows, Version 2 (evaluated by Gediga et al. 1999). For first stage used usability questionnaire called IsoMetrics which is based on the international standard ISO 9241 Part 10. This questionnaire is including 75 items based on the seven principles. Data analyzed using SPSS and Excel. The comparison between HIS and IS-H*med reveal that the former is significantly more usable than the latter in terms of all IsoMetrics sales. The HIS also proved to be significantly more applicable than SAP-HR in terms of such IsoMetrics scales as “suitability for task,” “suitability for learning”, “Error tolerance” and “learning ability”. However, HIS was found to be significantly less usable than Microsoft Word. The results of the study show that compared with the mentioned three softwares, Iran’s hospital information system enjoys an average ergonomic quality. Therefore, it is recommended that the users’ comments and expectations be considered more when information systems are designed and developed.	emoticon;exercise, isometric;hospital information systems;human factors and ergonomics;information system;iso;isometric projection;isoproterenol;microsoft windows;microsoft word for mac;spss;stage level 1;stage level 2;tom gruber;usability;heart rate	Reza Safdari;Hussein Dargahi;Leila Shahmoradi;Ahmadreza Farzaneh Nejad	2011		10.1007/s10916-011-9755-5	questionnaire;simulation;computer science;evaluation;multimedia;information system;software quality;statistics	HCI	-66.93067286982927	-58.9447716557706	87807
32af432ae7df05c341146559a1cec78e2e06d24c	a fundamental study on differences in heart rates during creative work and non-creative work		We sought to clarify how creative and non-creative work influence R-R intervals. Clearly different patterns of R-R intervals were found between creative and non-creative work, with heart rate quickening during creative work and recovering during subsequent rest periods. The differences between median R-R intervals during creative work were significantly and positively related to feelings of stress, with most coefficients of greater than 0.7 (reaching as high as 0.840; P u003c 0.001). In contrast, the differences between R-R intervals during non-creative work were not significantly correlated with feelings of stress, and the maximum coefficient did not exceed 0.3. Therefore, it appears that variability of median R-R intervals can be used to effectively predict feelings of stress when people engage in creative work but not when they engage in non-creative work.

The computerised GraphoGame training program aims to improve reading acquisition for children with a high risk for developing reading and spelling problems. GraphoGame® is a learning platform developed at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland to support poor reading children during reading acquisition. Here, we present the concept and design of the new Swiss GraphoGame, which at a linguistic level has been developed to especially suit the needs of children speaking an orthographically semi-transparent language (German). The efficacy of this computerised intervention is currently being evaluated with (Swiss) German speaking children at risk for reading and spelling disabilities in the middle and the end of first grade.

0b551e3e1d6c8d405c7628d09a3ba3940f798d03	human scoring versus automatic scoring of computer programs: does algo+ score as well as instructors? an experimental study		The most frequently used method of validating automated graders scores has been to compare them with scores awarded by instructors. While this is theoretically possible, research suggests that it is difficult to obtain a constant assessment as there are common problems in human scoring such as inattentiveness, halo effects, sequence effects, etc. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of an automated scoring tool called Algo+ by comparing it with human scoring. Specifically, a correlational research design was used to examine the correlations between Algo+ and human ratersu0027 performance. We found that automated scores awarded by Algo+ exhibited different positive correlations with scores awarded by instructors that came from two different countries. Furthermore, better correlation was noticed with teachersu0027 overall average scores. In most cases Algo+u0027 behavior was similar to human instructors in awarding scores and it was indistinguishable from teachers. The Wardu0027s hierarchical clustering methods were employed to classify types of teachersu0027 behavior while they scored studentsu0027 responses. Three types of teachers were classified - lenient, severe, and middle teachers. Algo+ was classified middle in the two exercises.	ambiguous name resolution;cluster analysis;computer program;heart rate variability;hierarchical clustering	Anis Bey;Denis Bouhineau;Ronan Champagnat	2018	2018 IEEE 18th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2018.00089	knowledge management;machine learning;research design;hierarchical clustering;computer science;artificial intelligence	SE	-71.17712737651946	-52.81465459357974	92905

MEASUREMENTS The stories of these experts were analyzed using a constant comparison method and partially ordered display.   RESULTS Each participant told a success and a failure story. Definitions of success and failure, as well as variables contributing to the success and failure of CPOE implementations, were extracted from the transcripts.   CONCLUSION Analysis reveals that what is considered a failure is context dependent and that it often is an antecedent to success.		P. Zoë Stavri;Joan S.

Our new system incorporates a user-generated mnemonic picture displayed during login, definition tooltips, error correction to reduce typographical errors, a decoy-based input masking technique, and random passphrase generation using either a specialized wordlist or a sentence template.   BACKGROUND Passphrases exhibit a greater level of security than traditional passwords, but their wider adoption has been hindered by human factors issues. Our assertion is that the added features of our system work particularly well with passphrases and help address these shortcomings.   METHOD We conducted a study to evaluate our new system with a customized 1,450-word list and our new system with a 6-word sentence structure against the control conditions of a user-created passphrase of at least 24 characters and a system-generated passphrase using a 10,326-word list. Fifty participants completed two sessions so that we could measure the usability and security of the authentication schemes.   RESULTS With the new system conditions, memorability was improved, and security was equivalent to or better than the control conditions. Usability and overall ratings also favored the new system conditions over the control conditions.   CONCLUSION Our research presents a new authentication system using innovative techniques that improve on the usability and security of existing password and passphrase authentication systems.   APPLICATION In computer security, drastic changes should never happen overnight, but we recommend that our contributions be incorporated into current authentication systems to help facilitate a transition from passwords to usable passphrases.	acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;amazon mechanical turk;amazona;assertion (software development);authentication;best practice;bin;clinical use template;computer systems;computer security;customize;human factors and ergonomics;login;mnemonics (keyboard);passphrase;password;password cracking;personality character;picture;qr code;quantity;the turk;tooltip;usability;user experience;user-generated content;benefit;error correction	Kevin A.

Many obesity therapy cases need efficient management in order to be shared and utilized. Prescription management has been proved to be successful strategy in obesity management. Since a case usually contains incomplete information, this article examines probabilistic case-based reasoning (CBR) by integrating Bayesian networks (BN) with CBR and proposes a probabilistic CBR framework for obesity prescription management (PCOPM) to assist health professionals to share their experiences of obesity exercise prescription online. The PCOPM ties together CBR and BN into a unified framework that includes both obesity experience and intelligent embodiment of decision making for obesity management. The proposed approach will facilitate the research and development of intelligent web-based obesity management.	bayesian network;case-based reasoning;prototype;unified framework;web application	Dong Dong;Zhaohao Sun;Feng Gao	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14932-0_12	computer science;knowledge management;data science;machine learning;ontology;bayesian network;data mining;complete information	AI	-63.31332916518519	-59.37955310372617	97960

The properties generalize some common intuitions for comparing test items, and provide principled foundations for designing item-selection heuristics for student assessments in computer-assisted educational systems. We compare performance profiles achieved by systems that adopt mutual information and the Mahalanobis distance in the assessment task. Experimental results reveal that, all else being equal, the mutual information based methods offer better performance profiles. In addition, experimental results suggest that, when computing mutual information online is considered computationally costly, heuristics that are designed based on our theoretical findings serve as a good delegate for exact mutual information.	mutual information	Chao-Lin Liu	2005		10.1007/11425274_54	education;simulation;computer science;multivariate mutual information;artificial intelligence;mahalanobis distance;machine learning;mutual information;interaction information;information system;algorithm;statistics	Robotics	-74.21884688180961	-52.16861081932693	100606

We propose to justify the notions of prisms and facets on which our model rely through the description of material selection in the task of planing a language class as an adaptation of Yinger’s model of planing. This interpretation of Yinger’s model is closely intertwined with the elaboration of the notion of pedagogical context. The latter provides sounder bases on which to build our model on. This resulted in improvements in the potentialities of the model compared to its first published version.	pedagogical agent;planning	Mathieu Loiseau;Georges Antoniadis;Claude Ponton	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-29578-2_16	multimedia	NLP	-74.7652983121563	-53.314935719065275	102080

f1c3155334149f025936bca8837ad704e2d5a488	micromovement behavior as an intention detection measurement for preventing insider threats		Behavioral measurements have provided insightful information in many research areas, including insider threats; however, none of the previous research investigated the use of head micromovement patterns while presenting visual stimuli that represent possible malicious intentions to detect insiders’ intentions; hence, to detect insider threats. In this paper, we hypothesize that involuntary head micromovement patterns toward visual stimuli allow for detecting intentions of access. Because detecting intentions does not state the probability of an intention to be executed, we hypothesize that the motivation toward an intention is inversely correlated with the number of micromovements. This paper also investigates the potential of substituting the physiological measurements of the intent-based access control (IBAC) model, which is a risk-based access control model that assesses risk based on involuntary physiological signals, electroencephalogram data, with the proposed behavioral measurements and compares the results. We assessed the IBAC model with the proposed behavioral measurement using experiments on 30 participants and it suggests the potential of the proposed behavioral measurement with 100% intention detection accuracy, similar to the physiological measurement results; however, the behavioral measurement showed 100% correctly accepted, but 70% correctly rejected users when compared with the physiological measurement, which showed 100% correctly accepted and rejected users. Further, the behavioral measurement showed 80% user acceptance when compared with the physiological measurement, which showed only 10% user acceptance.	access control;electroencephalography;experiment;insider threat;sensor	Abdulaziz Almehmadi	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2857450	access control;social psychology;insider;distributed computing;computer science;visual perception	Security	-68.86030944942132	-56.195734161930176	105860
833fa45f8ca81c9279af403cb657ae4cbd4fbf20	"""study for establishing design guidelines for manuals using augmented reality technology - verification and expansion of the basic model describing """"effective complexity"""""""		Augmented reality (AR), a technology that enables users to see an overlay of digital information on the real view, is expected to be applied more and more to human factor innovation. It has been suggested that a manual using AR (AR manual) improves accuracy and efficiency in actual work situations. To make an AR manual practical, hardware such as see-through display or retinal scanning display has been actively developed. However, software, i.e., information provided by the AR manual, has not been sufficiently examined. In a recent study, the authors built a mathematical model that describes the “effective complexity” of an AR manual according to the complexity of the real view. In this study, the basic model is verified by applying it to the AR manual for a realistic task. Furthermore, the applicability of the basic model is examined by assuming two different situations where either accuracy or efficiency has high priority. The objective of this study is to establish rough but practical guidelines for designing an AR manual.	augmented reality;computer-generated holography;digital data;effective complexity;futures studies;human factors and ergonomics;mathematical model;see-through display;virtual retinal display	Miwa Nakanishi;Shun-ichro Tamamushi;Yusaku Okada	2009				HCI	-63.998130656331526	-52.76283069806092	108304

Medical students ( $$n=71$$ n = 71 ) and neurosurgery residents ( $$n=12$$ n = 12 ) completed four simulated Glioblastoma multiforme resections. Simulated surgeries took place over four days with intermittent spacing in between (average time between surgeries of 4.77  $$\pm $$ ±  0.73 days). The volume of tumor removed (cc), volume of healthy brain removed (cc), and instrument path length (mm) were recorded. Additionally, surgical effectiveness (% tumor removed divided by % healthy brain removed) and efficiency (% tumor removed divided by instrument movement in mm) were calculated. Performance was compared (1) between groups, and (2) for each participant over time to assess the learning curve. In addition, the effect of real-time instruction (“coaching”) was assessed with a randomly selected group of medical students. Neurosurgery residents removed less healthy brain, were more effective in removing tumor and sparing healthy brain tissue, required less instrument movement, and were more efficient in removing tumor tissue than medical students. Medical students approached the resident level of performance over serial sessions. Coached medical students showed more conservative surgical behavior, removing both less tumor and less healthy brain. In sum, neurosurgery residents removed more tumor, removed less healthy brain, and required less instrument movement than medical students. Coaching modified medical student performance. Virtual Reality brain surgery can differentiate operators based on both recent and long-term experience and may be useful in the acquisition and assessment of neurosurgical skills. Coaching alters the learning curve of naïve inexperienced individuals.	brain neoplasms;brain simulation;excision;experience;glioblastoma multiforme;learning disorders;naivety;occur (action);operative surgical procedures;randomness;real-time transcription;science of neurosurgery;simulators;surgery simulator;virtual reality;tumor tissue	Terrell Holloway;Zachary S.

The provision of awareness information is a key factor for keeping users up-to-date with what happens around them; e.g., with the operations performed by their collaborators. However, the delivery of notifications describing the occurred events can interrupt the users’ activities, with a possible disruptive effect on their emotional and attentional states. As a possible solution to the trade-off between informing and interrupting users, we defined two context-dependent notification management policies which support the selection of the notifications to be delivered on the basis of the user’s current activities, at different granularity levels: general collaboration context versus task carried out. These policies are offered by the COntext depeNdent awaReness informAtion Delivery (CONRAD) framework. We tested such policies with users by applying them in a collaboration environment that includes a set of largely used Web 2.0 services. The experiments show that our policies reduce the levels of workload on users while supporting an up-to-the-moment understanding of the interaction with their shared contexts. The present paper presents the CONRAD framework and the techniques underlying the proposed notification policies.	anna-brita stenström;baseline (configuration management);case preservation;context-sensitive language;e-services;experiment;holistic management (agriculture);internet;interrupt;notification system;open collaboration;peripheral;personal cloud;personally identifiable information;privacy;software propagation;software release life cycle;usability;web 2.0;workspace	Liliana Ardissono;Gianni Bosio	2011	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction	10.1007/s11257-011-9100-1	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;web 2.0;world wide web	HCI	-63.730300121224246	-54.56417682744709	112004

The overall purposes of this exploratory study were to: (1) validate the seven IT/S innovation readiness sub-dimensions of a heuristic organizational information technology/systems innovation model (OITIM) developed in phase one of the research program, and (2) identify indicators to assess the validated sub-dimensions. The study was conducted with an expert panel using a two-round modified Delphi technique. In Round #1, panelists supported retention of the OITIMs' seven theoretical IT/S innovation readiness sub-dimensions with an interrater agreement level range of 82-100%. Their sub-dimension importance ratings ranged from 3.27 to 3.72 (1=not important to 4=critically important) with the resources sub-dimension receiving the highest rating of 3.72. Panelists recommended that two sub-dimensions, 'Staffing and Skills' and 'Operations', be renamed to 'End-Users' and 'Management Structures', respectively, and that one sub-dimension, 'Administrative Support' be added. In Round #2, panelists identified a total of 316 indicators to assess the eight sub-dimensions. A two-step thematic analysis process was done with these indicators to reduce duplication and overlap. In Step 1, the investigator created ten preliminary theme categories per sub-dimension. In Step 2, a coding team categorized 279 (88%) of the 316 indicators into preliminary sub-dimension themes to create an organizational IT/S innovation readiness assessment taxonomy. This preliminary taxonomy was used to develop an organizational information technology/systems innovation readiness scale that is currently being pilot tested in phase three of the research program.

Austin Fossey, Doctor of Philosophy, 2017 Dissertation directed by: Professor Laura Stapleton and Professor Tracy Sweet, Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Game-based assessments (GBAs) use game design elements to make assessments more engaging for students and capture response data about work processes. GBA response data are often too complex to plan for every potential response pattern, so some researchers have turned to exploratory cluster analysis to classify students’ work processes. This paper identifies the design elements specific to GBAs and investigates how well k-means, self-organizing maps (SOM), and robust clustering using links (ROCK) clustering algorithms group response patterns in prototypical GBA response data. Results from a simulation study are discussed, and a tutorial is provided with recommendations of general considerations and best practices for analyzing GBA data with clustering algorithms.

9840069e5891b14337fc6f49d876d4e2b385b8bf	the effects of author identity on dialogue for virtual human communication skills training		Because human-produced language is often still considered the golden standard in the natural language generation field, many virtual humans (VHs) used in communication-skills training simulations continue to be accompanied by human-authored dialogue instead of computer-generated dialogue. The human author used for writing such dialogue, however, has yet to be investigated. Dialogue authors can have a variety of identities - gender, culture, profession, etc. - which may or may not have an effect on the VH dialogue they produce. An identity incongruency between an author and the VH itself could have unexpected effects on VH interviewers' interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the effect of an author's identity on VH dialogue produced in the context of a virtual patient (VP) interview. We evaluated writing samples from speech-language pathology (SLP) students and Chinese and Chinese Americans when creating a Chinese VP suffering from trouble swallowing. We also conducted a user study in which SLP students interviewed VPs created with dialogue from these different author identities. Our results indicate that there are some content differences in the dialogue produced by different author identities and that VH interviewers are able to recognize these differences.	computer-generated holography;interaction;natural language generation;simulation;successive linear programming;superword level parallelism;usability testing;virtual actor	Stephanie Carnell;Benjamin Lok	2018		10.1145/3267851.3267856	communication skills training;social psychology;virtual actor;natural language generation;virtual patient;computer science;linguistics	NLP	-68.75575552212459	-52.4080512041247	114099

The evaluation instrument was derived from the Guidelines for the Design of Educational Software developed by the ANSI-accredited Standards Committee for Dental Informatics. Eleven judges were calibrated in a conference call and rated a total of 30 submissions using a 66-question instrument. The maximum score was 204 points. The mean score of WWW-based programs was 106.7 points, and of CD-ROM-based programs 109.5 points. The summative review of the judging process identified several potential improvements, such as distinguishing between standalone programs and educational support material; increasing the number of answer choices on rating scales; differential weighting of criteria; and a more discriminative approach to judging formative and summative evaluations. We plan to improve the protocol by supporting the process through a Web-based application; calibrating judges with an online handbook; improving and adapting the rating instrument itself; using at least three judges for each program; and conducting a measurement study.

We would like to point out that every visit to the medical doctor nowadays requests the cooperation of IT. But are medical doctors and nurses really sufficiently equipped with knowledge about IT - which is in part their working environment? Without doubt, more knowledge about the possibilities, benefits, possible mistakes and their consequences related to IT is needed for being used adequately in the health services. In the paper we will present experiences which aim at moving those possible obstacles and targets in this field. In general, we will shortly present the health care and nursing study program. Additionally, we will focus on different for health care important IT areas. The paper will also discuss the experiences and assessments which are acquired during the last years by students.	book;cinema 4d;experience	Tatjana Welzer;Peter Kokol;Ana Habjanic;Bostjan Brumen;Marjan Druzovec;Aida Kamisalic	2007	Twentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07)	10.1109/CBMS.2007.106	family medicine;medicine;computer science;nursing;information technology;cultural diversity;health care	Visualization	-64.45615889832615	-60.34221538090423	116443

Many information behaviour frameworks already exist, however; although they share some features, they tend to focus on different aspects of the person and their interaction with information. It was proposed that a synthesis of these frameworks could lead to a comprehensive framework. Previous research was analysed and an initial framework defined. This was piloted and adapted and then applied to data on informal carers. This led to further adaptation. Informal carers are people who care for another person, generally a relative, for more than fourteen hours per week and are not paid for this.

It has been utilized to reduce costs in the public sector and increase consumer satisfaction in the private sector. Technology may also be instrumental in improving individuals' healthy behaviors. For instance, statistics suggest that technology-based interventions may promote healthy sexual behaviors, however, few studies have explored willingness to participate in technology mediated interventions. This study uses Diffusion of Innovation Theory to identify factors that influence one's intention to use a text-message service to receive sexual health information. The results indicate that technology adoption factors rather than risk beliefs and privacy concerns impacted participant's intention to use a text-message intervention. The findings of this study have significant implications for innovative uses of technology to promote health.	privacy	Maya Corneille;Lemuria Carter;Naomi M.

To better understand the underlying differentiating factors, we conducted a systematic review of Human-Computer Interaction for Development and Security & Privacy publications in 15 proceedings, such as CHI, SOUPS, ICTD, and DEV, from the past ten years. Through an in-depth analysis of 114 publications that discuss security and privacy needs of people in developing regions, we identified five key factors---culture, knowledge gaps, unintended technology use, context, and usability and cost considerations---that shape security and privacy preferences of people in developing regions. We discuss how these factors influence their security and privacy considerations using case studies on phone sharing and surveillance. We then present a set of design recommendations and research directions for addressing security and privacy needs of people in resource-constrained settings.	chi;confidentiality;human–computer interaction;privacy;systematic review;usability	Aditya Vashistha;Richard J.

As tablets become increasingly adopted in work environments, it is important to explore ways to support privacy that are appropriate for tablet use in dynamic, mobile workflows. In this research we consider how spatial information can be utilized to support both individual and collaborative work in a natural way while respecting data privacy. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of a proximity-aware tablet, and a range of privacy notification and control mechanisms designed for such a tablet. Results from a user study support the idea that interpersonal distance and orientation can be used to mediate privacy management for tablet interfaces. Selecting a specific design for privacy threat notification and response is highly context-dependent-for example, in health care the first priority is to not impede the fluid exchange of information.

Models of sampling for coordination and scheduling must consider resohing missing or ambiguous data points. Human behavior involving this type of sampling balances the need for specific inforniation with the effort required to attain the information. The effort exerted is inversely proportional to the projected uncertainty of the information obtained.

Methods We used 18 months of data from audit log files, which recorded IPP user actions, of 2815 patient admissions. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was executed to group patient admissions on the basis of proportion of use for each of 10 IPP features. Post-hoc analyses were conducted to further understand IPP use.   Results Five cluster solutions were developed for the study sample. Our taxonomy included users with high levels of accessing features that were linked to reviewing schedules, results, tutorials, and ordering food. Patients tended to stay within their clusters over multiple admissions, and the clusters had differences based on patient and clinical characteristics.   Discussion Distinct groups of users exist among IPP users, suggesting that training on IPP use to enhance patient engagement could be tailored to patients. More exploration is also needed to understand why certain features were not used across all clusters.   Conclusions It is important to understand the specifics about how patients use IPPs to help them better engage with their healthcare. Our taxonomy enabled characterization of 5 groups of IPP users who demonstrated distinct preferences. These results may inform targeted improvements to IPP tools, could provide insights to improve patient training around portal use, and may help care team members effectively engage patients in the use of IPPs. We also discuss the implications of our findings for future research.		Naleef Fareed;Daniel Walker;Cynthia J Sieck;Robert Taylor;Seth Scarborough;Timothy R.

Based on this analysis the paper presents an application framework that comprises various components to accommodate user preferences and to adapt system interventions to individual users. Among these components is a goal hierarchy which can be set up to represent the goals a user wants to achieve. The higher-level goals can be broken down into more specific goals that can be measured and associated with appropriate activities. Furthermore, our BCSS framework includes components for adapting its interactions according to a user’s observed behavioural preferences as well as his or her previous reactions to system interventions. User adaptation also takes into account the preferences of similar users by employing a collaborative filtering approach. Thus, overall user acceptance should be improved and motivation for behavioural change sustained. The framework is currently being implemented and will subsequently be evaluated.	application framework;collaborative filtering;interaction;user (computing)	Ulrich Reimer;Edith Maier	2016		10.5220/0005900201520159	computer science	Web+IR	-63.73002272329583	-54.395665246571276	131061

An experiment was carried out on test subjects who are assumed to have adequate expertise and mental qualifications and signing skills on scanning devices and the motivation to achieve the best possible result. The subjects had at their disposal throughout the experiment a static display of the signature and of its dynamic in the form of repeated display of a progressively-created signature. Moreover, each subject knew the name of the person providing the signature. Each subject was able to repeat attempts to provide a forgery with no time limit until such time as he/she considered the forged signature to be as similar to the original as possible. The results showed that the level of success among the forgers was very low and was reduced according to the required degree of conformity of signatures for acceptance by audit software. It was shown that DBS is highly resistant to forgery by another person under standard conditions. In addition to having an undoubted ability to forge, this also requires that the conditions be in place in which it is possible to analyse the dynamic of the signature provided. It was also shown that success in forging the DBS of another person does not depend on the number of attempts and is rather a matter of the individual abilities of the forgers.

Based on the high job responsibility and the variety of healthcare professionals with regards to different job roles, tasks etc., the assurance of positive learning outcomes can be a challenge. Prior research shows that motivation to learn is a predictor for positive learning outcomes. Therefore, a literature review is done to show the current state of the art. In the next step and to identify the healthcare professionals’ predictors for motivation to learn, an exploratory study is done. 18 French healthcare professionals are interviewed by using semi-structured interviews. Based on the results, several propositions are concluded which suggest that self-efficacy, personal and professional development and learner characteristics are predictors for motivation to learn as well as the environment for learning and working environment conditions.	exploratory testing;kerrison predictor;semiconductor industry	Diana Renner	2017			blended learning;knowledge management;exploratory research;health care;computer science	HCI	-63.19509387767963	-62.49613077693974	132360

Existing findings on cancer patients' use of information sources were synthesized to 1) rank the most and least used information sources and the most helpful information sources and to 2) find the impact of patient demographics and situations on use of information sources. Methods. To synthesize results found across studies, a systematic review was conducted. Medline and CINAHL were searched to retrieve literature on cancer patients' information source use. The retrieved articles were carefully selected according to predetermined criteria, and several articles were eliminated in a systematic approach. Analysis. The twelve articles that met the criteria were systematically analysed by extracting data from articles and summarizing data for the purpose of synthesis to determine the meaning of findings on most used information sources, least used information sources, most helpful information sources, effect of patient characteristics on preference for an information source, and effect of patient situations on preference for an information source. Results. In descending order of use, health care professionals, medical pamphlets, and family and friends were most used information sources. Internet and support groups were least used. In descending order of helpfulness, books, health care professionals and medical pamphlets were found to be most helpful information sources. Younger patients used health care professionals and certain forms of written information sources more than older patients. Conclusions. The systematic review shows that many areas of cancer patients' information source use have been either neglected or barely analysed. An in-depth understanding of cancer patients' use of information sources and the characteristics in information sources they consider to be helpful is important for developing successful interventions to better inform patients.	book;cinahl;information source;internet;medline;scientific literature;sorting;systematic review	Kalyani Ankem	2005	Inf.

Yet current user acceptance models treat user goals as static and not changeable. If different users have different goals for the same system, this may lead to inconsistent and unreliable assessments of perceived usefulness and information system acceptance. In our research, we demonstrate by an empirical study that perceived usefulness varies depending on the goals users have with the same system. We contribute with our work to the enrichment of user acceptance models by introducing the concept of layered user goals and an increasingly consistent measure of perceived usefulness.	acceptance testing;gene ontology term enrichment;information system;utility	Sabine Zumpe;Hans van der Heijden	2007			simulation;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-63.80836795356822	-54.33321586774507	135560

The dimension-reducing quality of such classifiers provides a simple and effective means of characterising population through a manageable set of categories, but inevitably hides heterogeneity, which varies within and between the demographic categories and geographical areas, sometimes systematically. This may have implications for their use, which is widespread in government and commerce for planning, marketing and related activities. We use novel interactive graphics to delve into OAC - a free and open geodemographic classifier that classifies the UK population in over 200,000 small geographical areas into 7 super-groups, 21 groups and 52 sub-groups. Our graphics provide access to the original 41 demographic variables used in the classification and the uncertainty associated with the classification of each geographical area on-demand. It also supports comparison geographically and by category. This serves the dual purpose of helping understand the classifier itself leading to its more informed use and providing a more comprehensive view of population in a comprehensible manner. We assess the impact of these interactive graphics on experienced OAC users who explored the details of the classification, its uncertainty and the nature of between - and within - class variation and then reflect on their experiences. Visualization of the complexities and subtleties of the classification proved to be a thought-provoking exercise both confirming and challenging users' understanding of population, the OAC classifier and the way it is used in their organisations. Users identified three contexts for which the techniques were deemed useful in the context of local government, confirming the validity of the proposed methods.	categories;dual;experience;geographic coordinate system;graphics;local government;object action complex;population;statistical classification	Aidan Slingsby;Jason Dykes;Jo Wood	2011	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2011.197	computer vision;parallel coordinates;visualization;index term;uncertainty;biological classification;computer science;data science;data mining;mathematics;multimedia;data visualization;standardization;statistics	Visualization	-69.4359535204187	-61.350659491886255	139098

This study also aims at providing suggestions on the popularization of cloud medical services. This study was established in a way that the model constructs in Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were adapted to the context of cloud sphygmomanometer application in health management. Scale items on the survey include those measuring perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm and the user's behavioral intention to use. Feedbacks from a total of 521 users of the Health+ cloud sphygmomanometer were got. Results of this study include: 1. In the social influence part, behavioral intention can be improved with more subjective norm, and perceived usefulness can be improved with more result demonstrability. Additionally, subjective norm can be improved with more image. 2. In the anchor part, perceived ease of use can be improved with more computer self-efficacy and perceptions of external control. 3. In the adjustment part, perceived ease of use can be improved with more perceived enjoyment. The result has stranded most of the hypothesized relationships and the results complement prior research on TAM.	ibm tivoli access manager;img;one-class classification;organizational unit (computing);usability	Ming-Shu Chen;Shu-Wen Chang;Yi-Horng Lai	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7853017	simulation;mathematical model;reliability;mathematics;advertising;computational model;correlation;statistics	HCI	-63.30683438342011	-62.93564952637923	139668

METHODS A two-group, repeated measures quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a breastfeeding intervention. Forty six rural Hispanic women between ages 18 and 38 years were enrolled at the Regional West Medical Center in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Study participants were randomized into intervention and control groups, with the intervention group (n=23) receiving bi-lingual (English and Spanish) breastfeeding education on a touch screen computer program, while the control group received printed educational material. Study participants were enrolled during their last six weeks of pregnancy, with follow up assessments conducted post-partum at days 3 and 7, weeks 2 and 6, and months 3 and 6. The study protocol was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol #430-12-EP) and City University of New York Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol # 642980-1).   RESULTS A significant improvement in the breastfeeding knowledge and intent to breastfeed scores was seen over a 6 month period among all the study participants (p<0.05). There was a gradual increase in the breastfeeding self-efficacy scores till week 6 followed by a decrease in self-efficacy scores at month 3 (p=0.46), and month 6 (P=0.54). Breastfeeding knowledge scores differed significantly between the study participants in the control and intervention groups at week 6 (p=0.03). There were no significant differences in the breastfeeding knowledge between the control and intervention groups at other time points. The control group showed gradual decline in their self-efficacy scores at month 3 and month 6 compared to the intervention group that showed a gradual increase in their self-efficacy scores at different time points during their follow up period. However, there were no significant differences in the self-efficacy scores between the intervention and control groups at different points. The control group showed significantly higher negative breastfeeding sentiment scores compared to the intervention group at days 3 (p=0.02) and 7 (p=0.03) indicating a lower intent to breastfeed.   CONCLUSION Hispanic women living in rural settings showed improvement in breastfeeding knowledge, self-efficacy and intent to breastfeed using the computer based bi-lingual educational program. Results show week 6 and month 3 to be the critical time points of intervention so that women continue to breastfeed.

The significance of KCA is in the context of online assessments and examinations used in eLearning environments and MOOCs, which are becoming increasingly popular. The process is fully described and analysed, including comparison with established feature vector approaches. Our proposed method outperforms these other approaches to KCA (with a detection accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.53%), a clear indicator that the proposed time series analysis based KCA has significant potential.	authentication;basic stamp;bespoke;event (computing);experiment;feature vector;massive open online course;time series;web application	Abdullah Alshehri;Frans Coenen;Danushka Bollegala	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47175-4_24	computer science;data science;internet privacy;world wide web	SE	-78.67634506103431	-54.849424496610794	142993
b330c833673593e9c1038a3e2484236cdb341e94	online recommender system for personalized nutrition advice		The general recommendations for addressing non-communicable diseases, which are responsible for two thirds of deaths globally, are mainly related to lifestyle changes, such as diet and physical activity. Challenges with encouraging healthy diets include gathering accurate information about dietary intake and delivering interventions that can influence behavior. Internet technologies offer excellent potential for addressing these challenges. Furthermore, personalized recommendations are more effective than general population-based recommendations at modifying health-related behavior in nutrition interventions.  The overall aim of this project is to design, develop and evaluate a recommender system able to assess dietary intake, using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and propose valid personalized nutrition advice for adults. It is investigating an effective way of providing personalized online dietary recommendations to increase diet quality at population-level and of considering an individual user's preferences, population data and experts' knowledge in the recommendation. The system is envisaged to be a web-based service, built with commercially available technologies, scalable, replicable, inexpensive and independent of any bespoke device (e.g. proprietary activity trackers).  Different levels of personalized advice will be evaluated via an online Randomised Control Trial (RCT) and surveys with nutrition professionals will be used for rating the advice proposed by the recommender system.	activity tracker;bespoke;internet;personalization;recommender system;scalability;web application	Rodrigo Zenun Franco	2017		10.1145/3109859.3109862	bespoke;recommender system;personalization;computer science;the internet;behavior change;psychological intervention;activity tracker;population;knowledge management	HCI	-63.06751608562304	-56.927672606409004	144197
017e815ed939e02499c57777c7d969c9ff7fc543	modeling patients' acceptance of e-health		Due to the emerging importance of e-health and the possibility that it can reduce health care costs, we try to explain patients’ behavioral intention to use their provider’s e-health system. Using the survey method to collect data from patients newly registered with an e-health site, we test three models of user acceptance: two well-known models (TAM and the Motivational model) and one that has recently been proposed that integrates the other two. We also include several antecedents to the models including satisfaction with medical care, health knowledge, information-seeking preference, health care need, and Internet dependence. We find that all three models produce similar results from our data and that several of the antecedents have significant effects on the model constructs. For example, satisfaction with medical care positively influences intrinsic motivation, information-seeking preference positively influences perceived ease of use, and Internet dependence positively influences both intrinsic motivation and perceived usefulness.	acceptance testing;americas conference on information systems;email;function overloading;hk2;ibm system i;ibm tivoli access manager;id3 algorithm;internet;randomized algorithm;theory;usability	E.

It uses a survey questionnaire for data collection, and some data-mining tools for their analysis. We have applied it on two biometric systems developed in our research laboratory. The results from this survey show the necessity of taking users’ point of view when designing and evaluating biometric systems. A panel of 100 volunteers was more satisfied from the keystroke system than the face one. Users surprisingly considered that its perceived performance was also better, even if the used face system has a better performance with an EER of 8.76% than the keystroke one with an EER of 17.51%. The robustness of a system against attacks, computation time required during the verification phase and its easiness to use have been identified as important factors influencing their opinions regarding the tested systems.	authentication;authorization;bayesian network;biometrics;computation;dvd region code;data mining;decision tree;enhanced entity–relationship model;event (computing);fingerprint;keystroke dynamics;kruskal's algorithm;modality (human–computer interaction);perceived performance;physical access;population;rejection sampling;threat (computer);time complexity;usability testing;user error;web application	Mohamad El-Abed;Romain Giot;Baptiste Hemery;Christophe Rosenberger	2012	IJBM	10.1504/IJBM.2012.047644	simulation;computer science;evaluation;archaeology;machine learning;decision tree;bayesian network;data mining;computer security;kruskal–wallis one-way analysis of variance;biometrics	HCI	-65.6485531535715	-55.08060705697436	145644

We intended to conduct an experiment on this topic with Phishy, a game based phishing awareness training, and thus find answers to the following questions: a) Do enterprise, tech-savvy users benefit from having a game based training so that this methodology could be widely used for training important topics on a large scale? b) Will such a game be engaging to the associates and will they come back to play it more than once? c) Will the game be capable of helping them? Phishy game was successfully completed by 8071 associates within a month. From their game data, it was found that the associates who completed the game showed a significant improvement in identifying phishing links. This paper explains the design, development and analysis of Phishy, an online serious game that we developed for providing phishing awareness training to enterprise users.	computer security;emoticon;phishing;technical support	Herbert Pina Freire;Ljiljana Palangetic;George Fili s;Harshal Tupsamudre;Vijayanand Banahatti;Sachin Lodha	2018		10.1145/3270316.3273042	computer security;multimedia;phishing;computer science	HCI	-76.41761443954334	-52.90348298257743	147855

One could say that compliance is how most societies with advanced research programs operationalize many ethical obligations. This paper reports on the development of the How I Think about Research (HIT-Res) questionnaire, which is an adaptation of the How I Think (HIT) questionnaire that examines the use of cognitive distortions to justify antisocial behaviors. Such an adaptation was justified based on a review of the literature on mechanisms of moral disengagement and self-serving biases, which are used by individuals with normal personalities in a variety of contexts, including research. The HIT-Res adapts all items to refer to matters of research compliance and integrity rather than antisocial behaviors. The HIT-Res was administered as part of a battery of tests to 300 researchers and trainees funded by the US National Institutes of Health. The HIT-Res demonstrated excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .92). Construct validity was established by the correlation of the HIT-Res with measures of moral disengagement (r = .75), cynicism (r = .51), and professional decision-making in research (r = -.36). The HIT-Res will enrich the set of assessment tools available to instructors in the responsible conduct of research and to researchers who seek to understand the factors that influence research integrity.	acclimatization;antisocial behavior;decision making;distortion;personality;regulation;societies;thrombocytopenia	James M.

Providing medication information to consumers and supporting selfmanagement would help to reduce medication errors and to increase medication adherence. This paper reviews the persuasive systems design features used in current medication management applications for consumers. A database search was conducted to identify relevant articles, which were then reviewed using the Persuasive Systems Design model as a framework for analysis. The results highlighted the applicability of these features for the medication management information systems available to consumers. Primary task support and Dialogue support categories were highly cited in the articles. System credibility support category was moderately cited and the Social support category was cited least in the reviewed articles. Tailoring, monitoring and reminder features have been considered more than the other features in previous studies.

f57ae652f452ab38a7fa907f7d70a236ea05744c	children's reasoning about data sets		When reasoning about several numbers, past work has shown that adults mentally summarize data sets and reason based on set characteristics such as the mean and variance (Morris & Masnick, 2015). In the current study, we asked 10and 12-year-old children to look at two columns of numbers (framed as the distances two golfers drove a golf ball, when doing so repeatedly), and to choose which golfer hit the ball farther. We examined reaction time, accuracy, and eye movements, in addition to self-reported strategy use. We found children reasoned using some of the same summary characteristics as adults, though less consistently, and had more varied strategy uses. For example, some children focused only on one number in each set, a pattern not seen in adults. These findings suggest that instruction building on these intuitions may help develop children’s numerical cognition skills.	cognition;column (database);numerical analysis	Amy M. Masnick;Bradley J.

A data interaction enactment model is proposed to better understand how a logical structure is enacted when data stakeholders interact with data. The proposed model expands a technologies-in-practice view to also provide for the embodied structures of data objects. This extended technology-in-practice view provides designers with an approach that focuses on the interaction between data stakeholders and data objects. Although the proposed model is a generic model it is applied in the healthcare context for this study. An interpretive approach was used for a private healthcare centre as the case to investigate how healthcare professionals interact with patient records. The findings indicate the design of patient records based on the perceived anticipated use may not sufficiently provide for their actual use where different stakeholders need to interact with the patient records. An understanding of the relationships between designers, data stakeholders, the patient record structure enacted during interaction and its physical components is important. This may be one of the reasons why patient records are still mostly paper-based in spite of efforts to develop and adopt electronic patient record systems.	constraint (mathematics);interaction;interpreter (computing);jones calculus;sociotechnical system;the circle (file system)	Retha de la Harpe	2009			stakeholder;computer science;management;data	HCI	-63.21177736832972	-60.80972714511193	152913

The main health problems are visual discomfort, repetitive strain injuries (RSI) and stress-related disorders. Some important risk factors are poor workstation design, constrained work postures, repetitive work and long hours of computer use every day. Others are high demands, poor control over workload and work pace and poor relations to management and colleagues. There is also evidence that poor design and usability of the computer systems as well as technical problems with the computer add to the pressure perceived by the user, which may in its turn cause stress-related disorders. Systems (software) development is often technology-driven and the design and contents of the resulting system shapes the work situation, including factors affecting the users’ health and well-being. There are numerous examples in the literature describing how poorly designed systems fail to support the real work practices, introducing new ones that are inadequate and more time-consuming. Thus these, supposedly supporting, computer systems get in the way of efficient and effective work, adding a burden on the workers rather than helping them out. This thesis tries to describe some of the relations between the systems development process and users’ health complaints, in a work context. I also discuss whether or not the concepts of usability and user experience can be used to address users’ health issues in the systems development process. The main results indicate that although usability must be addressed, it is not sufficient. Occupational health issues must be explicitly integrated in systems development, and be given priority. This thesis also describes some potential methods and techniques for doing that.	computer;repetitive strain;software development process;usability;user experience;workstation;x86	Åsa Cajander;Inger Boivie;Jan Gulliksen	2008		10.1007/978-1-84628-941-5_11	pluralistic walkthrough;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-63.19159618097265	-58.08242660684597	153726

The resulting set included smoking status, smoking cessation success estimate, self-efficacy, BMI and diet status. Prediction of smoking cessation choice was the most accurate (73%) followed by weight management choice (67%). Physical activity and diet choices were much better identified in a combined cluster (76%-87%) indicating that the decision about these two behaviors was affected by the same variables and the variables that could separate them may have been missing from the dataset. Presence of variables related to individual risks and levels of success in accepting certain health behaviors in the final set of predictors confirmed significance of the computer-mediated decision aid which presented these very variables for the user consideration.

Twelve healthy righthanded male adults were asked to read a story twice and their brain activities were recorded using an EEG: (i) focusing on meaning of the content only (M) and (ii) focusing on both meaning and form or grammar (M+F). The results demonstrated significant differences in upper alpha and upper beta bands according to reading instructions, which indicates different degrees of cognitive load. The findings make a significant contribution to language acquisition in that they offer valuable information regarding memory and cognitive load in language processing. Thus, they help language researchers and educators in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) develop more effective ways of instructional design and in turn lead their students to better learning outcomes.

This decision is to alleviate reliance on increasing volumes of paper based evidence documentation, harness the value of streamlining evidence presentation, reduce the time of trials and consequently increase courtroom availability. This paper discusses the findings of two ethnographic studies of court trial simulation activities held in the County Courts of both NSW and Victoria, where members of the Australian judiciary, including judges, barristers, lawyers, court administrators and law academics participated in criminal trial simulations where all of the evidence was presented with the use of tablet technology. This required the professional members of the judiciary to role-play as jury members, plaintiff, judge, the witness and courtroom administration. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the capability of tablet technologies in the courtroom to the members of the judiciary community while identifying the requirements and wants of the participants, in order to produce a series of design recommendations for future development. It was found that there were substantially more advantages than just paper saving and reduced time produced from the introduction of technology as well as areas of concern for the judiciary.	documentation;requirement;simulation;tablet computer;the australian;the witness;victoria (3d figure)	Graham Farrell;Robert T.

Usability incorporates the ease of use, learnability, efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of a system by the end user. When an EHR incorporates principles of usability, the system does a better job of meeting the needs of the end users intuitively, resulting in fewer errors and better quality outcomes for patients. Health systems and governments have been urging the widespread adoption of EHR systems to help lower costs and increase efficiency, putting themselves and vendors under pressure to develop and implement the best solution quickly. Too often stakeholders rely on future releases and enhancements to fix issues not originally planned for in the initial release of the product. Hospital system end users and vendors need better strategies for improving usability in EHR solutions. Poor usability can result in frustrated end-users, inefficient and more costly processes, and, at worst, compromises to patient safety.

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)-based assessment system for Taiwan’s ASAP is constructed by National University of Tainan (NUTN) from 2007 to 2011. The basic process of the assessment systems is as follows. First, domain experts provide item descriptions to construct the item fuzzy ontology repository. Second, a T − score scale item map is constructed for each item bank by applying the calibration procedures for the 3-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Third, student responses stored in the response data repository are processed, analyzed, and then summarized to obtain the semantic descriptions of student performance level. The item-map representation then summarizes the performance of each student. Next, the results are stored in the diagnosis report repository so that users such as the involved students, teachers, officers, or the ASAP administrator can retrieve the reports through the provided ASAP web platform. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is feasible for large-scale implementation of automatically generated diagnostic reports for the CMMI-based ASAP assessment system.	fuzzy markup language	Chang-Shing Lee;Mei-Hui Wang;Pi-Hsia Hung;Yi-Ling Kuo;Hui-Min David Wang;Bort-Hung Lin	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5_5	computer science;data mining;database	NLP	-67.1124346882827	-61.96931228901024	167114

Studies describe observed therapeutic outcomes such as increased speech, social interaction, joint and directed attention, but few detail a robot-inclusive protocol which evaluates a set of robot tasks using widely-accepted, clinical assessments to evaluate the efficacy of the approach. In this study, we employed a low-cost, toy-like robot prototype with safety features such as a snap-off head and two snap-off arms, a camera for face, hand detection and session recording, two autonomous games and a teleoperated mode. We then developed and tested a new, robot-assisted intervention. Eight study participants and three controls diagnosed with ASDand a speech deficiencywere recruited. The study group received pre-, post-intervention measures with the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale II (VABS-II), mean length spontaneous utterance determination (MLSUD), motor imitation scale (MIS), unstructured imitation assessment (UIA) and Expressive Vocabulary Test 2 (EVT-2) and participated in twelve 30 min interventions.

This unintentionally leaves characteristics of individuals and communities, which are often difficult to be collected in traditional studies. Individuals with autism are such a case, in which the Internet could facilitate even more communication given its social-spatial distance being a characteristic preference for individuals with autism. Previous studies examined the traces left in the posts of online autism communities (Autism) in comparison with other online communities (Control). This work further investigates these online populations through the contents of not only their posts but also their comments. We first compare the Autism and Control blogs based on three features: topics, language styles and affective information. The autism groups are then further examined, based on the same three features, by looking at their personal (Personal) and community (Community) blogs separately. Machine learning and statistical methods are used to discriminate blog contents in both cases. All three features are found to be significantly different between Autism and Control, and between autism Personal and Community. These features also show good indicative power in prediction of autism blogs in both personal and community settings.	blog;comment (computer programming);internet;machine learning;new media;online community;population;tracing (software)	Thin Nguyen;Thi V.

Therefore, how to enhance the cyber-security literacy education to prevent or mitigate Internet crimes becomes a very important and challenging issue. In this paper, the frame structure of the knowledge base for the card game called iMonsters has been designed to help students to easily understand the attack or defense strategies and concepts in cyber-security domain, and the ontology crystallization method will be applied to refine the existing ontology. We then propose a rule generation algorithm to generate new rules based upon learning from examples approach, and the generated new rules can be used as the scaffoldings to help the users to learn the knowledge obtained from the real cases. 53 children have participated in the iMonster card game playing in 2015. Based upon the experimental results, we can find that the card game playing can assist students to learn the cyber-security knowledge.	computer security	Yuh-Jye Wang;Shian-Shyong Tseng;Tsung-Yu Yang;Jui-Feng Weng	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-7850-7_4	ontology;knowledge base;the internet;literacy;mobile phone;computer security;computer science	ECom	-76.2658567774058	-53.9580717061804	170628
d3ec07e4f235178d9ea3b917b8ed55ce59119ca3	mining association - correlations among demographic health indicators	health indicator	Demographic health indicators such as crude birth rate, crude death rate, maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate (IMR), Adult literacy rate and many others are usually considered measures of a country’s health status. These health indicators are often seen in an isolated manner rather than as a group of associated events. Conventional statistical techniques often fail to mine inter-relations among these indicators. This paper focuses on mining association-correlations among various demographic health indicators under child immunization program, skilled obstetric practice, and IMR using both statistical and Quantitative Association Rule (QAR) mining techniques. Relevant archived data from 10 countries located in the Asia-Pacific region are used for this study. Finally the paper concludes that association mining with QAR is more informative than that of statistical techniques. The reason may lie in its capability to generate the association rules using a 2-D grid-based flexible approach. Finally it is concluded that such an approach could be pioneering for engineering the hidden knowledge among various other health indicators.	archive;association rule learning;information	Subhagata Chattopadhyay;Pradeep Kumar Ray;Lesley Pek Wee Land	2008			computer science;health indicator	HCI	-69.00257694099841	-61.38631671036641	173272

The questions of errors and costs in the health care system still persist. In this paper, we take a data and information quality perspective to redirect the question and the focus. This paper focuses on the errors, the data underlying these errors, and potential sources of these errors. We provide new concepts derived from integrating the areas of healthcare, cognitive science, behavioral science, and data quality.

d8227f8ae4ea1f67008890863c0a1fc19459312e	artificial intelligence assisted infrastructure assessment using mixed reality systems		Conventional methods for visual assessment of civil infrastructures have certain limitations, such as subjectivity of the collected data, long inspection time, and high cost of labor. Although some new technologies i.e. robotic techniques that are currently in practice can collect objective, quantified data, the inspectors own expertise is still critical in many instances since these technologies are not designed to work interactively with human inspector. This study aims to create a smart, human centered method that offers significant contributions to infrastructure inspection, maintenance, management practice, and safety for the bridge owners. By developing a smart Mixed Reality framework, which can be integrated into a wearable holographic headset device, a bridge inspector, for example, can automatically analyze a certain defect such as a crack that he or she sees on an element, display its dimension information in real-time along with the condition state. Such systems can potentially decrease the time and cost of infrastructure inspections by accelerating essential tasks of the inspector such as defect measurement, condition assessment and data processing to management systems. The human centered artificial intelligence will help the inspector collect more quantified and objective data while incorporating inspectors professional judgement. This study explains in detail the described system and related methodologies of implementing attention guided semi supervised deep learning into mixed reality technology, which interacts with the human inspector during assessment. Thereby, the inspector and the AI will collaborate or communicate for improved visual inspection.

One of the main constraints of such an approach is the difficulty in interpretability of the limited field of view of the image, a problem that has recently been addressed using mixed reality, such as augmented reality and augmented virtuality. The growing popularity and maturity of mixed reality has led to a series of informal guidelines to direct development of new systems and to facilitate regulatory approval. However, the goals of mixed reality image guidance systems and the guidelines for their development have not been thoroughly discussed. The purpose of this paper is to identify and critically examine development guidelines in the context of a mixed reality ultrasound guidance system through a case study. A mixed reality ultrasound guidance system tailored to central line insertions was developed in close collaboration with an expert user. This system outperformed ultrasound-only guidance in a novice user study and has obtained clearance for clinical use in humans. A phantom study with 25 experienced physicians was carried out to compare the performance of the mixed reality ultrasound system against conventional ultrasound-only guidance. Despite the previous promising results, there was no statistically significant difference between the two systems. Guidelines for developing mixed reality image guidance systems cannot be applied indiscriminately. Each design decision, no matter how well justified, should be the subject of scientific and technical investigation. Iterative and small-scale evaluation can readily unearth issues and previously unknown or implicit system requirements. We recommend a wary eye in development of mixed reality ultrasound image guidance systems emphasizing small-scale iterative evaluation alongside system development. Ultimately, we recommend that the image-guided intervention community furthers and deepens this discussion into best practices in developing image-guided interventions.	amendment;augmented reality;baxter (robot);best practice;capability maturity model;cautionary warning;clinical act of insertion;consent forms;consultation;declaration (computer programming);dental intrusion;equilibrium;guidance system;increment;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;mixed reality;natural science disciplines;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;real-time transcription;requirement;system requirements;usability testing;virtuality (gaming);standards characteristics	Golafsoun Ameri;John S.

This makes it difficult to increase the time each student spends at the laboratory. We consider that it would be possible to improve the effectiveness of the laboratory time by providing the students with computer-based simulations for prior rehearsal. However, this approach still presents issues in terms of development costs and distribution to the students.   OBJECTIVE This study investigates the employment of low-cost simulation to allow medical students to rehearse practical exercises through a web-based e-learning environment. The aim is to maximize the efficiency of laboratory time and resources allocated by letting students become familiarized with the equipment and the procedures before they attend a laboratory session, but without requiring large-scale investment. Moreover, students can access the simulation via the Internet and rehearse at their own pace. We have studied the effects of such a simulation in terms of impact on the laboratory session, learning outcomes and student satisfaction.   METHODS We created a simulation that covers the steps of a practical exercise in a Physiology course (measuring hematocrit in a blood sample). An experimental group (EG, n=66) played the simulation 1 week before the laboratory session. A control group (CG, n=77) attended the laboratory session without playing the simulation. After the session, all students completed a survey about their perception of the difficulty of the exercise on a scale of 1-10 and the HCT final value that they obtained. The students in the EG also completed a survey about their satisfaction with the experience.   RESULTS After the laboratory session, the perceived difficulty of the procedure was lower on average in the EG compared to the CG (3.52 vs. 4.39, 95% CI: 0.16-1.57, P=.016). There was no significant difference in terms of perceived difficulty using the equipment. The HCT measures reported by the EG group also presented a much lower dispersion, meaning a higher reliability, in determining the HCT value (3.10 vs. 26.94, SD; variances significantly different, P<.001, F: 75.25, Dfd: 68.19 for EG and CG). In the satisfaction test, the majority of the students in the EG reported that the experience was positive or very positive (80.7%) and reported that it had helped them to identify and use the equipment (78%) and to perform the exercise (66%).   CONCLUSIONS The simulation was well received by students in the EG, who felt more comfortable during the laboratory session, and it helped them to perform the exercise better, obtaining more accurate results, which indicates more effective training. EG students perceived the procedure as easier to perform, but did not report an improvement in the perceived difficulty in using the equipment. The increased reliability demonstrates that low-cost simulations are a good complement to the laboratory sessions.	blood specimen;complement system proteins;education, medical;education, medical, undergraduate;eurographics;experiment;hematological disease;hemopoietic stem cell transplant;internet;physical therapy exercises;physiological sexual disorders;web application;web-based simulation;windows hardware certification kit	Pablo Moreno-Ger;Javier Torrente;Julián Bustamante;Carmen Fernández-Galaz;Baltasar Fernández-Manjón;María Dolores Comas-Rengifo	2010	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.01.017	computer simulation;medical education;simulation;web-based simulation;medicine;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-68.21275633604809	-55.20435148003176	182143

d43f6691fdf7f21551842ac573f542ccb0570ac8	data protection impact assessment: a hands-on tour of the gdpr's most practical tool		This workshop introduced participants to the process of Data Protection Impact Assessment. This new tool of the GDPR is highly relevant for any processing of personal data, as it helps to structure the process, be aware of data protection issues and the relevant legislation and implement proper safeguards to protect data subjects. For processing operations posing a high risk for data subjects, a DPIA is mandatory from May 2018. The interactive workshop provided a framework for DPIA and guidance on specific questions such as when a high risk is likely to occur or how specific risks can be evaluated, which was assessed by participants in an interactive session with two different scenarios.	general data protection regulation;hands-on computing;privacy	Felix Bieker;Nicholas Martin;Michael Friedewald;Marit Hansen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-92925-5_13	risk analysis (engineering);general data protection regulation;impact assessment;data protection act 1998;business;legislation	Crypto	-63.3449972916609	-58.50863520378729	189533

The Scenario Authoring, Characterization, and Debriefing Application (SACADA) database was developed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to address this data need. An agreement between NRC and the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) was established to support the SACADA development with aims to make the SACADA tool suitable for implementation in the nuclear power plants' operator training program to collect operator performance information. The collected data would support the STPNOC's operator training program and be shared with the NRC for improving HRA quality. This paper discusses the SACADA data taxonomy, the theoretical foundation, the prospective data to be generated from the SACADA raw data to inform human reliability and human performance, and the considerations on the use of simulator data for HRA. Each SACADA data point consists of two information segments: context and performance results. Context is a characterization of the performance challenges to task success. The performance results are the results of performing the task. The data taxonomy uses a macrocognitive functions model for the framework. At a high level, information is classified according to the macrocognitive functions of detecting the plant abnormality, understanding the abnormality, deciding the response plan, executing the response plan, and team related aspects (i.e., communication, teamwork, and supervision). The data are expected to be useful for analyzing the relations between context, error modes and error causes in human performance.

ad4e1f27bcfd696cc58ed182392f7e7fb9a9ac39	school age children's cognition identification by mining integrated computer games data		National statistics confirm that nowadays about 20% of school children have some type of mental health issue, about 70% of adult mental health disorders originated in adolescence, while about 40% have unidentified learning differences that affect their learning abilities. Starting early enough with proper screening of a child’s cognitive skills is critical for improved learning and mental wellbeing. Unfortunately, assessments and treatment can be costly, elusive or conflicting. This paper describes an approach to identifying child’s cognitive skill level that is adopted by an online product called “Think2Learn” developed by OTEP Inc. (Online Training & Education Portal). OTEP uses ubiquitousness of the Internet and attractive features of online computer games to give parents automated opportunity to screen and follow their children’s cognitive development. OTEP presently uses a collection of approximately 100 video games for children to play and while doing so, it records their score to continuously assess and monitor their cognitive strengths and weaknesses. The Webbased tool for identifying cognitive skill level is developed as an integration or data warehouse of a number of relevant data sources such as the cognitive skills categories data, games data, player inventory data and so on. The integrated data are continuously mined, analyzed and queried for proper and quick assessment or	categorization;cognition;cognitive science;computer;emoticon;identifier;internet;mined;pc game;unique key;world wide web	Rob Whent;Dragana Martinovic;Christie I.

We discuss strategies to reduce attrition, and present SilverCloud, a platform designed to provide more engaging online experiences. The paper presents the results of a practice-based clinical study in which 45 clients and 6 therapists used an online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programme for depression. Pre and post-treatment assessments, using the Beck Depression Inventory, indicate a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms, with a large effect size, for the moderate-to-severe clinical sub-sample receiving standalone online treatment (n=18). This group was the primary target for the intervention. A high level of engagement was also observed compared to a prior online intervention used within the same service. We discuss strategies for design in this area and consider how the quantitative and qualitative results contribute towards our understanding of engagement.	air traffic control radar beacon system;attrition (website);high-level programming language;inventory	Gavin J.

Our results indicate that i) no students were fully compliant in their participation, ii) the number of texts encountered by participants was highly skewed, iii) the reading difficulty of texts was about 7th grade, M = 7.24, CI95[7.04, 7.43], though difficulty varied by participant, and iv) the increasing use of encryption is likely a limiting factor for using kernel-level packet capture to measure online reading in the future.	e-book;encryption;kernel (operating system);network packet;packet analyzer;web page	Andrew Olney;Eric Hosman;Arthur C.

Some failures can be found in such systems especially when the mined knowledge is unconfident, or if the system is hardly usable. The objective of this study is to define a quality model (QM) which ensures a global evaluation of DSS/KDD that generates association rules. The proposed QM evaluates the DSS/KDD regarding three dimensions: utility, usability and interestingness. It defines a set of criteria and allows the measurement of a DSS/KDD quality evaluation. To validate the proposed approach, a prototype has been developed. Weka and a DSS/KDD in the healthcare domain were assessed drawing on 20 users who participated in the evaluation process. Results have shown that a user-centred QM leads to a better quality of such systems.	decision support system	Emna Ben Ayed;Mounir Ben Ayed	2016	Journal of Decision Systems	10.1080/12460125.2016.1156999	decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data science;evaluation;data mining;management	ML	-65.2038376343057	-54.12905897092589	193069

Previous studies have examined the disease's rate and heredity. This study analyzed beta-thalassemia's socioeconomic geography and how it affects the afflicted population. We processed survey data and performed data mining using self-organizing maps to identify underlying data structure. We hypothesized that certain variables mark subgroups within the affected population and we aimed at identifying these subgroups and used a correlation-based measure to assess the variable's importance to the subgroup's distinction. The population's education level was one of the major factors that divided it into different subgroups. Our study showed that recurring patterns of specific variables separated the affected population into disparate subgroups based on their response to questionnaires. Future studies can use such tools to delve deeper into how other variables (e.g. socioeconomic and genomic) can identify subgroups within larger affected populations.	data mining;data structure;geography;global health;hereditary diseases;heredity;knowledge acquisition;large;organizing (structure);population;self-organization;self-organizing map;beta thalassemia	Altug Akay;Andrei Dragomir;Ahmet Yardimci;Duran Canatan;Akif Yesilipek;Brian W.

610ca43043956d47315345fabf9e42f8afc51cdd	spot the phish by checking the pruned url		Purpose – Phishing is still a very popular and effective security threat, and it takes, on average, more than a day to detect new phish websites. Protection by purely technical means is hampered by this vulnerability window. During this window, users need to act to protect themselves. To support users in doing so, the paper aims to propose to first make users aware of the need to consult the address bar. Moreover, the authors propose to prune URL displayed in the address bar. The authors report on an evaluation of this proposal. Design/methodology/approach – The paper opted for an online study with 411 participants, judging 16 websites – all with authentic design: half with legitimate and half with phish URLs. The authors applied four popular widely used types of URL manipulation techniques. The authors conducted a within-subject and between-subject study with participants randomly assigned to one of two groups (domain highlighting or pruning). The authors then tested both proposals using a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance. Findings – The analysis shows a significant improvement in terms of phish detection after providing the hint to check the address bar. Furthermore, the analysis shows a significant improvement in terms of phish detection after the hint to check the address bar for uninitiated participants in the pruning group, as compared to those in the highlighting group. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications – This paper confirms the efficacy of URL pruning and of prompting users to consult the address bar for phish detection. Originality/value – This paper introduces a classification for URL manipulation techniques used by phishers. We also provide evidence that drawing people’s attention to the address bar makes them more likely to spot phish websites, but does not impair their ability to identify authentic websites.	phishing;randomness;url redirection;vulnerability (computing)	Melanie Volkamer;Karen Renaud;Paul Gerber	2016	Inf. & Comput.

In order to tap the full potential of the computer, it should do more than simply administer and score psychological tests, generate interpretations and graph the results. Psycho-metricians should tap the decision-making capacity of the computer, so that the most information can be generated from the fewest questions necessary accurately to assess, diagnose and treat the patient. This exploratory study explores the feasibility of converting the full-length Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (566 items) into a shorter form using a computer to individualize the number of items needed to reproduce a full-scale MMPI. 499 subjects from Kaiser Permanente (Southern California Region) who had taken the MMPI-566 in the paper and pencil format were used for the norming group, and 489 subjects from the same population were used for the comparison group. Multiple regression equations were produced for each step, and the computer generated a new equation for each item until criterion (matching two consecutive predictions, accurate to the first decimal place) was reached. The mean of the correlations comparing the predicted raw scores against the actual raw scores (scales across subjects) was r = 0-95, with a range of 0·88 to 0·98. The mean of the correlations comparing the predicted profiles (subjects across scales) was  r =0·98 for the norming group and  r =0·97 for the comparison group. The mean number of items needed for the comparison group was 187 (after adjusting for item overlap), and the profile correlation by subject for number of items needed was  r =0·20. It was concluded that (1) psychological tests can be developed that will allow for individualized computer administration and (2) scores on these tests can accurately predict the scores on tests from which they were derived. Implications for use of computers in psychometrics are discussed.		Richard L.
