0f70e594d34960aaf75585f410c62a1d80e73e4e	sustaining continuous collaborative learning flows in moocs: orchestration agent approach		Collaborative learning spaces deployed in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide productive social learning opportunities. However, sustaining collaboration in these spaces is challenging. This paper provides a classification of MOOCs participants based on their behavior in a structured collaborative learning space. This analysis leads to requirements for new technological interventions to orchestrate collaborative learning flows in MOOCs. The paper proposes the design of an intelligent agent to address these requirements and reports a study which shows that the intervention of the proposed orchestration agent in a MOOC facilitates to maintain continuous yet meaningful collaboration learning flows.	integrated woz machine;intelligent agent;interaction;massive open online course;open collaboration;requirement;software deployment	Ishari Amarasinghe;Davinia Hernández Leo;Kalpani Manatunga;Anders Jonsson	2018	J.

The excellence of a researcher can be measured by his or her ability to publish in the scientific outlets with the highest reputation. In contrast, the academic impact of the content of an article can be measured by the number of citations to the article. In some areas, it is easier to get citations than in other areas. However, when comparing two articles from the same area, one article with many citations and one article with few, the former can generally be considered as the more interesting, relevant, important, and/or impactful one. The academic impact of a researcher can then be measured by the number of citations to their articles. However, although impact as measured by citations then differs from excellence, citations are still used for the rating of journals. Notably, journals are rated according to their citation-based impact factors, and a number of publishers advertise these statistics of their journals. Further, in some countries, the impact factors of a journal play an important role when different institutions assess the excellence of the journal. If a journal is not rated highly by funding agencies then researchers who rely on funding from those agencies are effectively encouraged to publish in other journals. Likewise, if a journal is not rated highly by hiring or promotion committees then candidates are effectively encouraged to publish in other journals. Because of reasons such as these, I find that it is not advisable to simply ignore citations. A journal's two-year impact factor for a particular year n is calculated as the sum of the number of citations given during year n to each article published in the journal during years n-1 and n-2, divided by the count of articles published during years n-1 and n-2. Thus, an impact factor of 2.5 for year 2015 means that articles published in that journal during 2013 and 2014 received an average of 2.5 citations during 2015. This definition does not state explicitly which citations are counted. When considering the two-year impact factor computed by Thomson Reuters, it is not entirely clear which citations are counted. Thomson Reuters maintains a master journal list. If citations are counted only from articles published in journals on …	acm transactions on database systems;computer science;relevance;scientific literature	Christian S. Jensen	2016	ACM Trans.

In e-learning products, a variety of assessment approaches are being used for such diverse purposes as adaptive delivery of content, individualizing learning materials, dynamic feedback, cognitive diagnosis, score reporting, and course placement (Gifford, 2001). A recent paper at the General Teaching Council Conference in London, England, on teaching, learning, and accountability described assessment for personalized learning through e-learning products as a “quiet revolution” taking place in education (Hopkins, 2004). In our study, we examine approaches for the use of assessment evidence in e-learning in four case studies. The products in the case studies were selected for exhibiting at least one exemplary aspect regarding assessment and measurement. The principles of the Berkeley Evaluation & Assessment Research Center Assessment System (Wilson & Sloane, 2000) are used as a framework of analysis for these products with respect to key measurement principles.	assistive technology;cognitive tutor;personalization	Kathleen Scalise;Diana J.

To successfully perform their tasks, systems engineers need a systems view or, in other words, a high capacity for engineering systems thinking (CEST). This paper summarizes the findings of three studies aimed at identifying the knowledge, abilities, cognitive characteristics (thinking skills) and personal traits (behavioral competences) of systems engineers with high capacity for engineering systems thinking (or, in other words, successful systems engineers). The findings suggest that successful systems engineers possess interdisciplinary knowledge. They are expert in at least one main field but have general knowledge in additional fields and disciplines. They become familiar with the jargon and professional language of the other disciplines and are able to communicate with people or experts from different fields and disciplines. Overall, 10 cognitive characteristics, 11 abilities, and 10 behavioral competences were identified. In addition, nine additional roles of systems engineering were identified. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Based on interviews and a theoretical consideration of online community, it finds that the metaphor of ‘community’ in cyberspace is one of convenient togetherness without real responsibility.This study suggests a symbolic interactionist approach to the examination of online social relationships that is free of the controversy and structural-functional baggage of the term ‘community’. It suggests that community is an evolving process, and that commitment is the truly desired social ideal in social interaction, whether online or offline.	authorization;centrality;cyberspace;geographical distance;immutable object;internet studies;kullback–leibler divergence;new media;online advertising;online and offline;online community;programming paradigm;social structure;spatial file manager;virtual community;yousef saad	Jan Fernback	2007	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444807072417	psychology;public relations;social relation;community organization;community;the internet;social science;knowledge management;community building;sociology;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-83.004323990586	-16.283322598289644	5184

In this paper, we want to critically elaborate on the “user as producer and consumer”concept for content production and consumption. We address the subject by using the notion of content collaboration as example for the “Prisoner’s Dilemma”, in which the sensible way out (from a macroperspective) is sensibly not pursued by an individual (from a microperspective). We will use this micro-perspective of a user as prisoner to analyze what the recently very successful Social Tagging processes can teach us about the user taking action as a producer and/or consumer.	folksonomy;knowledge management;prisoner's dilemma	Andrea Kohlhase	2006			superrationality;knowledge management;political science;communication;social psychology	HCI	-68.618841679049	-34.63126619638672	5192

Scores were used to rank journals and authors across the discipline. The results of centrality rankings reveal that Journal of Communication, Communication Research, Communication Research Reports, Human Communication Research, and Communication Studies are the central most journals in the citation network. Across these 24 journals, the top 1 % of central most scholars are presented in rank based on the placement of their publications. An additional list ranks the 14 central most (1 %) of scholars who published in the five central most journals. These centrality rankings for the journals and authors are discussed in comparison to previous ranking methods. The results for the central most journals mirror the findings of other network analysis research relying on various citation data. However, the findings for author centrality rankings revealed that traditional methods (e.g., summing total publications) for ranking communication scholars yield drastically different results when compared to centrality rankings (incorporating breadth of publications across journals). Future attempts to situate prolific authors should consider the conceptual utility of relying on network analysis methods to analyze citation data. The limitations of this study are also discussed.	centrality;citation network;social network analysis	Darrin J. Griffin;San Bolkan;Jennifer L.

Yet, it is unclear in what circumstances either of these settings can result in higher new product performance. In this study, we show that the choice of the level of centralization of product design decisions should be made contingent to the product complexity and behavioral factors of project managers involved in the decisions. In particular, we examine the influence of the cognitive ability, resistance to change, and cognitive effort of the project managers on the choice of the level of centralization of product design decisions. A methodology coming from complexity science is adopted and a simulation analysis is carried out. Results confirm that product complexity affects the relationship between the level of centralization of the product design decisions and product performance. Furthermore, we show that the benefit of centralized product design decisions is influenced by the level of cognitive effort, cognitive ability, and resistance to change of project managers. The analysis is performed in two different contexts characterized by varying levels of trust between the buyer and supplier. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.	centralized computing;cognition;complex system;complex systems;contingency (philosophy);simulation	Ilaria Giannoccaro;Anand Nair	2016	IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management	10.1109/TEM.2015.2510031	economics;service product management;systems engineering;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;product management;product design;management;new product development	SE	-80.36020439598664	3.823228245544219	5196

However, a disproportionate number of the nonusers tend to be those over the age of 50, and the young are most likely to go online eventually. Therefore, the most appropriate people to survey with regard to Internet use are adolescents and young adults who are likely to be the Internet users or nonusers of the future. This survey was conducted to find out more about the activities and opinions of secondary-school aged children who do, and do not, use the Internet. Mobile phone use was also examined in this survey as this has also shown a meteoric rise in adults and more particularly in young people. Generally, the survey revealed that children aged between 11 and 16 years old are quite comfortable with the Internet, use it a moderate amount and for a variety of purposes. However, boys were more likely to use the Internet than girls and sometimes for slightly different purposes. Reasons for not using the Internet generally revolved around a lack of access to equipment. Furthermore, a higher percentage of adolescents have mobile phones than adults and girls are more likely to own a mobile phone than boys. Mobile phones were also used for a variety of purposes, most notably making and receiving calls and text-messaging. The most common reasons for children not owning a mobile phone was because they had no need for one. Finally, a significant positive relationship between the use of emails and text messaging suggests that the mobile phone may supplement some of the previous functions of the Internet.

6bb0f71d085195142ed0721efce10d1bba290b1d	factors influencing interoperability level required for the implementation of t-government in saudi arabia		Governments around the world have invested significant sums of money on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services being provided to their citizens. However, they have not achieved the desired results because of the lack of interoperability between different government entities. Therefore, many governments have started shifting away from the original concept of e-Government towards a much more transformational approach that encompasses the entire relationship between different government departments and users of public services, which can be termed as transformational government (tGovernment). This implementation of t-Government requires a high level of interoperability between government organisations. In this paper, a model is proposed to explore and investigates the key factors that influence interoperability required for the implementation of t-Government in Saudi Arabian context from four key areas, namely, organisational, technological, political and social using institutional theory as a lens. This model was developed comprising the effect of six main constructs: technological compatibility, organizational compatibility, governance readiness, citizen centricity and e-Government program on interoperability required for the implementation of t-Government. The model factors, relationships, and hypotheses stemmed from the literature on Information Sharing, Information Integration, G2G, interoperability and t-Government models. The results show that technological compatibility, organizational compatibility, and governance readiness have a positive impact on the interoperability required for the implementation of t-Government in this particular context. Unexpectedly, it indicates that citizen centricity has negative impact on the interoperability required for the implementation of t-Government. It also shows that there is a direct and positive impact from e-Government program (Yesser) to technological compatibility and governance readiness. Moreover, it shows that there is a direct and positive impact from citizen centricity to e-Government program (Yesser). Unexpectedly, the results indicate that e-Government program (Yesser) has no impact on the interoperability required for the implementation of tGovernment. It also indicates that the e-Government program (Yesser) doesn’t affect organizational compatibility. This paper provides a model for creating interoperability between government organisations to help e-Government officials and policy makers to identify the key factors that can affect the interoperability level required for the implementation of t-Government, and examines how these issues could be treated in practice. It also provides a guideline to researchers with regard to the impact of these identified factors on interoperability required for tGovernment implementation.

The history of the academic library as a building type is examined, and the move from the collection-dominated library buildings of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the service-rich, user-focused ones of the twenty-first century is explored. Recent trends are identified, drawing on a number of mainly UK and other European examples. The effect of increasing availability of e-resources, new technology, and changing methods of teaching, learning, and research on design is also considered. Other issues covered in the paper include the importance of the design brief or program, interior space, fittings and fixtures, and finally the need to reflect on the success or failure of building projects through postoccupancy evaluation. Introduction The function of a library as a center for resources and ideas is to provide information to its users. The library as a gateway to knowledge remains as true for the building that welcomes in readers to peruse books and journals as for the one that guides its users to electronic resources throughout the world. Although this function has changed little in the history of the university library, the form in which information is provided and the way it is delivered to the end user have developed in new directions. The pairing of books and architecture is a long-standing one that has had a significant impact on the design of academic libraries, and in many ways the relationship of books, architecture, and now electronic resources has sparked off a new interest in library building design. 113 collections and connections/latimer The design process for any building type is essentially a problem-solving activity, and the designing of libraries is no exception to this. The bringing together of reader and knowledge has always been a challenge throughout the history of academic, or indeed any, libraries. Brawne (1970), in the introduction to his guide to library building design, written at the height of university expansion in the UK, takes the fifteenth-century painting of St. Jerome in his study by Antonella da Messina as the quintessential expression of both the problem and solution. It is a painting that is frequently used in lectures and publications on library design as it encapsulates the relationship between the scholar and the tools of the trade. It is that relationship that dominates the thinking of library planners and designers (clients and architects) throughout history, perhaps most famously in relatively recent times in Louis Kahn’s 1960s library for Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where meticulous attention to detail in the use of materials and natural lighting provides high quality user spaces. The scale of course has changed, but, interestingly, after a period of growth in both collections and the number of people using them, came the concept of the self-renewing library with the withdrawal of old stock making room for the new, off-site or shared storage, and the digital revolution. These trends tipped the balance in the twentieth century back in favor of users and their spaces rather than the domination of collection space. The modern university library is all about making connections—connections between different groups of library users, connections between library users and library staff, connections between library users and resources. Historical Background Edwards (2009) points out that a “critique of the history of libraries helps clarify the issues designers and libraries face to-day.” He and others such as Bahr (2000) and Graham (1998) have dealt with this subject in some depth, and only a brief overview is included here. The academic library has its origins in the ecclesiastical collections of the pre-Gutenberg era, and books such as The Most Beautiful Libraries of the of the World (Bosser, 2003) showcase the forerunners of today’s libraries with lavish illustrations of great monastic libraries, special libraries, national libraries, and academic libraries. Libraries such as Jacopo Sansovino’s masterpiece in Venice, the Library of San Marco, housed famous manuscript collections and contained generously proportioned reading rooms and sumptuous wall and ceiling decorations by the great artists of the day; there are many such examples. The combination of great libraries, great architecture, and great art is one that, albeit in a different form, we should strive to cultivate today. In the United Kingdom, university libraries were founded in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge in the thirteenth century followed by those of the Scottish universities in St. Andrews, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and 114 library trends/summer 2011 Edinburgh in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and then by Trinity College in Dublin in 1591. In this period readers still had their individual enclosures, not unlike the monks of earlier times. Collections were still on the whole small enough for readers to have immediate access to them, and the only consideration was the security of the books since they were items of great rarity. Hence the development of chained libraries and closed access stacks, which seems such an anachronism today. Many fine architects, such as Sir Christopher Wren at Cambridge, are associated with library buildings throughout the centuries. The Wren Library (1684), with its magnificent arched windows and carved bookcases, cleverly solved the problem of masking the fact that, in order to accommodate the bookcases, the upper story had to be taller than the lower. This was done by making the elevations appear as if the stories within were of equal proportions. The rotunda form enjoyed some popularity in the eighteenth century as seen at James Gibbs’ Radcliffe Camera in Oxford as well as in the former Reading Room in the British Museum in London. Echoes of this can be seen in Gunnar Asplund’s splendid cylinder within a box structure for Stockholm Public Library of 1928. This iconic building was recently the subject of a hotly contested design competition for its extension, although the project is currently on hold due to funding issues. The relationship between pure geometry and intellectualism is a recurrent theme in many more recent library designs such as Mecanoo’s work at Delft and Snøhetta at Alexandria. The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the United Kingdom saw further university growth with Durham opening in 1832, Queen’s College, Belfast, in 1849 (achieving university status in 1908), and big city universities such as London and Manchester in 1836 and 1880, respectively. These were closely followed by Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and many more, with the concomitant growth in books and readers. Libraries became more open and no longer the haunt of the privileged few. At this stage, libraries were zoned into reading rooms, service areas, and book stacks, with much material still on closed access. However, the emphasis was beginning to shift from books to readers. The next wave of university growth in the UK, and hence of academic library buildings, came in the 1960s with the establishment of the new universities at York, Sussex, Stirling, Lancaster, Essex, East Anglia, Kent, and elsewhere. Architects, such as Basil Spence at Sussex; Denis Lasdun at East Anglia; and Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall & Partners at York, were employed to design libraries as part of the master plans for these universities. This had the advantage that the libraries for the new universities usually occupied prime sites at the center of the campus. The entrance halls were welcoming and spacious, designed to draw in students hurrying from campus halls of residence to lecture rooms, and they were dominated by circulation desks and catalog cabinets. There was much 115 collections and connections/latimer debate about the relative merits of open and closed access stacks in the 1960s. Although space could be saved by using compact shelving in storage areas, most of the libraries designed at this time favored open access with reading spaces placed adjacent to, or even interspersed with, the stack areas. Library programs increasingly asked for flexibility between stack and reading areas, which in turn had implications for floor loading and lighting arrangements. The 1960s also saw the design of a number of major library buildings at the older universities. The Cambridge University History Faculty Building, of which the library was a key component, was the subject of a limited competition in 1964. The building married high-tech architecture with contextual sensitivity through the use of glass and steel detailing alongside brick walls and platforms. As a library it owed more to the great reading rooms of the nineteenth century with their emphasis on security and supervision than to the more liberal approach of the new universities. The glazed corridors running round the upper parts of the library ensured that people moving around the building were always in visual contact with the library. The building is much beloved of architects but was not without its critics, as Stirling was big enough to concede by including a vitriolic piece published in the Cambridge Review of 1968 in his account of the project in James Stirling Buildings & Projects (Stirling, 1975, p. 91). Cambridge University also has a plethora of impressive recent college libraries, as has been documented by Wilson (2006), in addition to the Wren Library referred to above. Another competition-winning library of the 1960s that sparked off much debate at the time and has also recently been carefully integrated into a new library complex, is the Ahrends Burton and Koralek (ABK) Berkeley Library at Trinity College, Dublin. An examination of the three libraries at Trinity tells us much about the history of libraries and the development of library 		Karen Latimer	2011	Library Trends	10.1353/lib.2011.0035	library science;computer science;engineering;civil engineering;management;world wide web	HCI	-66.66425395723012	-20.942607211063365	5304
ff5b0cf66770ca2d8e1f271e31812239896f7c2a	a course dedicated to developing algorithmic problem solving skills - design and experiment		Undergraduate students often start their academic course of studies with inadequate learning and thinking skills. Our college has a policy of setting high standards and demands, while supporting students' learning in a variety of ways. In this paper we present a distinctive course designed to aid students develop algorithmic problem-solving skills. The course is taught in parallel to a CS1 course and elaborates on activities such as analogical reasoning, prototyping problems, comparison between alternative solutions and reflection on problem-solving processes. It is one of the courses offered at our institution aimed at strengthening general learning and thinking skills, in addition to the regular disciplinary curriculum. Feedback from participants in the course demonstrates a developed awareness and appreciation of abstract ideas beyond programming knowledge. Students report on acquiring problem-solving skills that enable them to cope with compound problems. Additionally, students claimed that they had broadened their repertoire of algorithmic ideas leading to more efficient and elegant solutions.	algorithm;problem solving	Orna Muller;Bruria Haberman	2009				HCI	-79.20116491253319	-36.35054551477104	5310
3bcbd2a1e08fe532d502b720b3fb182f2404325a	no pain, no gain: rethinking the telecoms crash	government policy;decision making under uncertainty;bounded rationality	Abstract This paper reflects upon the boom and bust of the telecommunications industry from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. Unlike the conspicuous burst of the dotcom bubble, the telecoms crash came quietly, but turned out to be bigger and more catastrophic. This paper argues that bounded rationality, decision making under uncertainty and the focus on short-term individual interest all played a significant role in the telecoms crash. However, this painful crash also had its positive effects. Executives, specialists, regulators and government policy makers should pay more attention to the fundamentals and balance the need for both short-term and long-term interests in approaching the coming challenges in the fast-changing telecoms industry.	pain	Jacqueline Kam	2006	Techn.

44037c4b0a06029a672343e504bd667def6573b0	towards a bio-inspired aco approach for building collaborative learning teams		Collaborative learning is an educational method used by teachers to impact learning in a positive way and enhance the learners’ performances. It can occur within a group of two or more students. Therefore, the learners’ grouping is an essential task for establishing collaboration and cooperation among them to achieve a common goal. However, with the increasing number of students as well as their different settings (academic, cognitive, emotional, social, etc.), the students grouping task becomes harder and more complex to build a good collaborative learn- ing environment. Hence, several researchers proposed different approaches for obtaining approximate solutions to handle this diversity and take advantages from it. In this context, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to pinpoint the relevant research works that address the students grouping problem. We also we focus on the ACO bio-inspired approach to discuss its advantages and how students group formation can be initially constructed by ACO method. In accordance with this, we adapt and simulate an existing ACO algorithm with randomly generated data. The obtained results show an interesting starting point for further works in order to develop a new approach based on real educational data.	ant colony optimization algorithms;approximation algorithm;british informatics olympiad;cluster analysis;matlab;performance;procedural generation;simulation;systematic review	Malak Chniter;Abir Abid;Ilhem Kallel	2018	2018 17th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)	10.1109/ITHET.2018.8424779	genetic algorithm;knowledge management;management science;systematic review;collaborative learning;cognition;cluster analysis;computer science	Robotics	-79.8287512407236	-51.43898760677553	5337

6a280d4197118c58531957b38eaee891edfce9b6	introduction to big data and analytics: concepts, methods, techniques, and application minitrack		The Big Data minitrack features a number of papers addressing methods and techniques, issues and challenges, and organizational approaches to processing and managing Big Data within an organizational environment. This year ... The Big Data minitrack has been offered at HICSS for the past four years. This will be the fifth year in which interesting papers are being presented that address key and critical issues in Big Data and Analytics. This minitrack resulted from keynote speaker presentations at HICSS-44 and HICSS-45 which described the impact that Big Data was having and would continue to have on information systems and computer science. The co-chairs have given tutorials on Big Data at HICSS-46 through HICSS-49 and are presenting two distinct topic tutorials at HICSS-50. Attendance at these tutorials (approximately 50-90 people) and at the minitrack sessions (approximately 20-40 people) has reinforced our belief that HICSS is a major venue for the presentation of Big Data and Analytics research. The co-chairs have been heavily involved in planning degree programs as well as teaching courses in Big Data at their respective universities. Two papers on issues and challenges by the co-chairs which have been published at HICSS-46 and HICSS-47 have received numerous citations according to ResearchGate.		Stephen H. Kaisler;Frank Armour;J.

Starting with these, the purpose of this study was to modify or develop an EIS user taxonomy by querying 98 of the Corporate 1000 CEOs on the ways in which they used their EIS. These were then grouped and compared with the proposed EIS functions. The findings indicated three EIS user types whom we have termed: (1) ‘converts,’ (2) ‘pacesetters,’ and (3) ‘analyzers.’ Further investigation revealed three dimensions underlying these types: (1) organizational monitoring; (2) information access; and (3) organizational understanding.	executive information system	Kent A.

b52654af9cb08b5a2b6c4f144aab001191be659f	on research data publishing		Data publishing is a practice where data are made public so that they can be reused by others, in accordance with associated policies, while guaranteeing that data provenance and attribution are tracked. There is not yet a general agreement on the importance of, and on the solutions for, data publishing [8–10]. While in some communities it has already solidified into codified policies, procedures and workflows, in others its motivations and realization shapes are still controversial [3]. In the reality, it is a multifaceted process that can occur at different stages of the scientific process, involves different levels of openness and controlled sharing and concerns data products at various levels of manipulation and maturity. There are two major schools of thought governing the approaches supporting data publishing, those aiming at exploiting scholarly communication practices (e.g., data journals [4]) and those proposing services and infrastructures for the dissemination of these artefacts (e.g., data reposito-	capability maturity model;mechatronics;openness	Leonardo Candela;Donatella Castelli;Paolo Manghi;Sarah Callaghan	2017	International Journal on Digital Libraries	10.1007/s00799-017-0213-y	data publishing;computer science;data mining	DB	-72.73881025073423	-14.490193742629252	5433

4041fd887da979e9bbfe1b7f43d9130d48943a8a	interpreting overlaps in business process mapping via organisational soft knowledge flows		Knowledge Management (KM) as the term implies, is broadly about improving knowledge use within an organisation. At a lower level, Business Process Management (BPM) is the set of management activities related to business processes that can ideally be arranged in a life cycle. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a technique enabling the researcher to better understand interactions between people. Relatively little research has been conducted with regard to the crossover of social networks and workflows, with the aim of examining workflows as management views them, as opposed to the actual social interactions of staff. Improvements in the overlay of management interpretations of work and real social networks could potentially lead to improvements in business process efficacy. In this study SNA diagrams are examined in order to implement executable models and potentially enable automated analysis of workflows. A means of converting SNA data to Business Process workflows is presented and an example provided.

In recent years, academic literature has started to investigate its related conception, symptoms, characteristics and outcomes in various contexts, describing it with different terms. Considering the popularity and addictive attributes of microblogging, in contrast with the limited published research on the addiction of such applications, we believe that it is meaningful to fill in this research gap. In this paper, we argue that Internet addiction is a psychological status resulting from cumulated Internet usage, and should be able to be interpreted by investigating the continued usage behavior. Based on a thorough discussion on previous studies, in this paper, we analyze the characteristics of microblogging usage and addiction, identify corresponding constructs, and propose a research model for understanding the relationships between usage types and user addiction. The model is empirically tested by using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis. The results indicate that not all micro-blogging usages will induce addiction, and addiction would emerge and grow asynchronously along four dimensions.	blog;internet addiction disorder;structural equation modeling	Qian Li;Xunhua Guo;Caihong Sun	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.610	multimedia;world wide web;information system	SE	-81.79595260952628	-19.073155397193524	5498

2ac05f2facf2c653bd66c6375a43542e06929e56	identity use and misuse of public persona on twitter	conferenceobject	Social media sites have appeared during the last 10 years and their use has exploded all over the world. Twitter is a microblogging service that has currently 320 million user profiles and over 100 million daily active users. Many celebrities and leading politicians have a verified profile on Twitter, including Justin Bieber, president Obama, and the Pope. In this paper we investigate the '‘hundreds of Putins and Obamas phenomenon’ on Twitter. We collected two data sets in 2015 containing 582 and 6477 profiles that are related to the G20 leaders’ profiles on Twitter. The number of namesakes varied from 5 to 1000 per leader. We analysed in detail various aspects of the Putin and Erdogan related profiles. For the first ones we looked into the language of the profiles, their follower sets, the address in the profile and where the tweets were really sent from. For both profile sets we investigated why the accounts were created. For this, we deduced 12 categories based on the information in the profile and the contents of the sent tweets. The research is exploratory in nature, but we tentatively looked into online identity, communication and political theories that might explain emergence of these kinds of Twitter profiles.	daily active users;emergence;justin (robot);online identity;social media;theory;user profile	Dicle Berfin Köse;Jari Veijalainen;Alexander Semenov	2016		10.5220/0005859001640175	computer science;internet privacy;computer security	NLP	-82.49999552640833	-17.465698088074546	5504

The sample was 340 teacher candidates reached through purposeful sampling. The study lasted a semester; students were involved in a blended learning environment where classroom lessons supported by self-regulatory e-tests as a part of an online course management system, called MOODLE. It was possible for students to take 10-item online quizzes and 20-item practice tests as many as they wanted. In the analysis, a factorial ANOVA design was applied. Findings indicated a moderate correlation between the number of formative e-tests taken and the perceived self-regulation levels, indicating higher perceived self-regulation levels as the number of formative e-tests increased. By using perceived self-regulation levels as a covariate, the gender differences in the number of e-tests taken were also investigated. According to finding, gender variable did not explain the differences in the compound variable “the number of formative e-tests”. However, after controlling for the effect of perceived self-regulation, the findings were significant. Hence, we can conclude that self-regulated behavior is independent of students' gender; therefore, e-assessments is a self-regulated, technology-based instructional aid in higher education. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to arrive at a tool for designers to improve learnability from this perspective. To study embodied learning, we use the concept of breakdown, which happens when our experience fails to aid our everyday actions and decision-making. We conducted a study to investigate learning in games from which we constructed a framework of 17 patterns of breakdown and a set of guidelines to aid heuristic evaluation of video games and to help designers support breakdown in interactions, which support players’ learning, so that they do not become breakdowns in illusion, which break players’ immersion [19].

Against the backdrop of this """"crisis in journalism"""", this research seeks to understand how journalists are actually participating in the spread and correction of online rumors. We compare the engagement behaviors of journalists to non-journalists- and specifically other high visibility users-within five false rumors that spread on Twitter during three crisis events. Our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non-journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors. However, compared to other users, journalists are (proportionally) more likely to deny false rumors. Journalists are also more likely to author original tweets and to be retweeted-underscoring their continued role in shaping the news.

The economic environment of companies developed more and more complex over the last years. Technological innovations, especially in the field of e-business, have reinforced the globalization process and have threatened the domestic market with a strong competition by competitors from abroad. Actually the e-business strategies provide the most promising solutions to survive in global competition, but companies show resistance against the necessary restructuring processes and strategies. This problem has been identified as inertia and it is often discussed in research papers nowadays. The authors have thought about a solution how to manage this problem by a solution that is suitable especially for SME. In the worldwide economic crisis SME do not have the necessary resources (money) and the time to do a restructuring that can therefore fail or they catapult themselves out of the market. So the e-business perspective is a chance to be used as an interim step on the way to digital economy and complexity management by innovations and new media.	electronic business;money;new media	Susanna Mandorf;Michal Gregus	2014	2014 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCoS.2014.45	change management;complexity management;management	Robotics	-74.81731002503481	3.837379702926149	5703

As a case study, we investigate group fitness swimming. The design challenge is to coordinate a large group of people by considering trade-offs between social awareness and information overload. Our resulting group fitness swimming game, SwimTrain, allows a group of people to have localized synchronous interactions over a virtual space. The game uses competitive and cooperative phases to help group members acquire group-wide awareness. The results of our user study showed that SwimTrain provides socially-enriched swimming experiences, motivates swimmers to follow a training regimen and exert more intensely, and allows strategic game play dealing with skill differences among swimmers. Consequently, we propose several practical considerations for designing group fitness exergames.	experience;information overload;interaction;usability testing;virtual reality	Woohyeok Choi;Jeungmin Oh;Darren Edge;Joohyun Kim;Uichin Lee	2016		10.1145/2858036.2858579	simulation	HCI	-63.206995152587055	-41.55886667584316	5707

b5f8083f2ca997ffd3018f67d57fd78d371eb037	the influence of cultural dimensions and website quality on m-banking services adoption in bangladesh: applying the utaut2 model using pls	m banking;website quality;utaut2 and pls sem and bangladesh;cultural dimension	The proliferation of the ICT ,smart phone, mobile technologies and other devices such as tab, note pad has encourage the users, financial organization and banks to use more m-banking services than before. The adoption of ICT varies on country to country according to the nature or characteristics of the people. And now a days, m-banking is considered to be an inseparable factor for financial firms for developing and developed country. Since the prior studies has limited focus on cultural dimensions and very few study considered the importance of website quality on m-banking adoption .Therefore, we proposed a model in this study that extended the original UTAUT2 model with cultural dimensions and website quality to know the influences on the m-banking services adoption of Bangladeshi consumer. As a developing country like Bangladesh m-banking services adoption can play an important role and also motivate people to use m-banking services. This paper analyzed by applied partial least squares (PLS) with 220 samples. The study found that performance expectancy, facilitating condition and price value influences on behaviour intention but effort expectancy had no influence on m-banking adoption in this research. This study also revealed that power distance had influence on m-banking adoption and masculinity and uncertainty avoidance had no influence on behavioral intention to adopt m-banking services. The paper offers valuable insights to decision-makers involved in the implementation and deployment of m-Banking services. Moreover, the results endorse the relative significance of websites quality and culture to the adoption of m-banking services adoption. It will help the banking sectors to regulate their strategies and future plans to advance successful adoption and diffusion of m-banking services in Bangladesh.

In this setting, it is arguably difficult to consider the individual interests of each participant. This may result in students not being motivated, decreased learning outcomes as well as an overall low effectiveness of IS lectures. Self-determination theory suggests that perceived autonomy increases intrinsic motivation, which may in turn lead to improved learning outcomes. We therefore propose to foster perceived autonomy among students by introducing elected elements (e.g., practical examples and topics) that students can vote for with an audience response system. To investigate this instructional approach and to provide an instrument for its evaluation, we conducted a preliminary study that shows positive associations between perceived autonomy, intrinsic motivation, as well as acceptance among students. Based on these findings, we derive several avenues for future research regarding the use of elected elements in large-scale IS lectures.	autonomy;information system	Christian Karl Grund;Maria Tulis	2017			self-determination theory;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-74.68509907170404	-40.9678235246061	5813

ab76fbc491ac414507c24ea9395c9a06cfc3cb38	contributing to the oer movement: a practical experience: the case of the informatics school, una		Open educational resources (OER) propose a culture of sharing to make knowledge a good for humanity. The educational field recognizes the potential of OER to expand access to education and the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide the context for sharing, using and reusing this knowledge. In addition, the OER movement offers scholars the opportunity to rethink their educational practice. Although the literature has shown that academics in general have the practice of sharing their educational resources with close colleagues, it is also true that open and large-scale exchange through appropriate licensing and institutional repositories is an emergent move in many universities. This paper presents an exploratory study to promote, among academics and students, their participation in the OER movement. The experience allowed to generate knowledge on the subject, to develop and validate a set of educational resources to later create in the institutional repository the first OER community.

This is of particular importance to areas within the medical imaging practice which have lagged in innovation; perhaps, the most notable of which is reporting which has remained relatively stagnant for over a century. While the theoretical advantages of structured reporting have been well documented throughout the medical imaging community, adoption to date has been tepid and largely relegated to the academic and breast imaging communities. Widespread adoption will likely require an alternative approach to innovation, which addresses the heterogeneity and diversity of the practicing radiologist community along with the ever-changing expectations in service delivery. The challenges and strategies for reporting innovation and adoption are discussed, with the goal of adapting and customizing new technology to the preferences and needs of individual end-users.	community;diffusion of innovation;diffusion weighted imaging;gain;itil;medical imaging;numerous;optimizing compiler;radiology	Bruce I.

Despite the growing interest, given the vastness of the area, there is little understanding of the topics and issues with respect to SMA that should be investigated by IS researchers. In an effort to contribute to this understanding, this paper in progress analyses SMA trends in research and practice. After searching within nineteen leading academic, practitioner and crossover outlets, we used an inductive approach to categorize the resulting articles. Preliminary results indicate that future IS studies should approach SMA as systems, and adopt a critical stance towards the existing claims that SMA only positively impacts organizations. Results also indicate that ethical-legal implications of SMA should receive more attention. Limitations of the study and plans for the future are highlighted.

Personal care at nursing homes tends to (quite reasonably) have high priority at the expense of social activities, thus creating situations where a number of elderly people experience loneliness. This paper presents ongoing work that focuses on developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for nursing homes that brings together professional care activities and family initiated care. We discuss challenges and opportunities for welfare or assistive technology design to support articulation work in a care setting, where both care professionals and family members (of the elderly inhabitants) co-exists. Furthermore, the care sector at hand suffers from economical limitations that challenge a successful implementation of more costly technologies. We present a concept named Care to Share? that seeks to bring together professional and family initiated care and that assists in the articulation work of social activities in a nursing home.	assistive technology;biconnected component	Mark Asboe;Erik Grönvall;Henry Michael Lassen	2011	2011 5th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth) and Workshops		robot;information and communications technology;digital enhanced cordless telecommunications;service level;interview;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;geriatrics;unlicensed assistive personnel;health care	HCI	-79.73083062110292	-9.672499307506264	5922

The author has previously proposed a model of users' privacy concerns encompassing: a) general, or inherent, privacy concern, b) environmental influences, and c) organization- and technology-specific attributes. As part of the development of this model, this paper describes a pilot survey study using an online survey instrument (N = 353) and structural equation modeling, to develop a measure of inherent privacy concern: Dispositional Privacy Concern (DPC). Two constructs within DPC were extracted from the survey data: 1) Concern about the Privacy Behavior of Organizations and Governments (CPBOG), and 2) Desire for Privacy (DFP). The study found the two personality metatraits of the Big Five - Stability and Plasticity - were negatively related to CPBOG and DFP, respectively. In turn, CPBOG and DFP were found to be positively related to the Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns (Malhotra et al., 2004). The paper concludes with a discussion of the study's identification of the CPBOG and DFP constructs, the influence of personality traits on privacy concern, and the implications of the study's findings for research of general privacy concern.	deferred procedure call;emoticon;information privacy;information processing;internet privacy;personally identifiable information;structural equation modeling	Anthony Morton	2013	2013 International Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/SocialCom.2013.73	privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;data mining;personality;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;statistics	SE	-86.55406674869074	-8.072337122226054	6004
800db3ac74171ca26993a125f371ba68abc1f4d2	literature review: the vaccine supply chain		Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent the outbreak of an infectious disease. This medical intervention also brings about many logistical questions. In recent years, in the Operations Research/Operations Management community there is growing interest in the logistical aspects of vaccination. However, publications on this topic are somewhat scattered: most papers focus on particular logistical aspects only and a broad overview is missing. This potentially leads to contributions being overlooked and makes it difficult to identify open research questions. In this literature review we use a supply chain perspective and propose a classification for the literature on vaccine logistics in order to structure this relatively new field and highlight promising research directions. Thereto we distinguish between the following four components: (1) composition, (2) production, (3) allocation and (4) distribution. We use this classification to derive the unique characteristics of the vaccine supply chain. We find that the vaccine supply chain can among others be characterized by high uncertainty in both supply and demand; asymmetry between supplier, public health organization and end customer; complex political decisions concerning allocation and the crucial importance of deciding and acting in time. Our review yields a framework for Operations Research/Operations Management research in vaccine logistics. Based on this framework we discuss for each component in the vaccine supply chain the related decision problems, the current status and future research possibilities.

Panelists will argue that our understanding of digital services and products is radically transformed if we consider all exchanges to be service-for-service exchanges in which customers and suppliers co-create value in exchange networks. Innovation can then be understood as the continual process of breaking down knowledge (information) and reintegrating it to create new knowledge-based resources. Pervasive digitalization and generative digital platforms are revolutionizing service exchange possibilities. Value exchanges nonetheless occur within contexts that are material and social, tangible and tacit. The dynamics of these dimensions of service exchange challenge our concepts and methods for designing for service. Representing different approaches and disciplines, panelists will share their views on how the IS field might rethink service innovation, design and digitalization.	information;pervasive informatics;service innovation	Michael I.

Students were provided with computers facilities, required to complete two compulsory generic courses in information technology, and the lecturers actively encouraged the use of information technology, in particular, the Internet in the teaching and learning processes. Results from the study indicated that students had positive attitudes toward using the Internet as a learning tool, adequate basic knowledge of the Internet, and viewed the learning environment as supportive of using the Internet for learning. Students with better basic Internet skills and who viewed the learning environment as promoting the use of the Internet favored using the Internet for learning. The university achieved its objectives of promoting the use of the Internet for teachin g and learning purposes. As the university begins to offer Webbased courses, the generic courses in information technology should likewise be redesigned to introduce the concepts of Web-based learning environments.

Most such courses are simply """"art-oriented"""", that is they focus on getting students to use modern commercial software, so as to prepare them for a corresponding career, or concentrate on the basic concepts of graphics theory and merely provide a theoretical foundation, such as simple translations and projections; in this case, they usually fail to motivate the class by producing practical interesting examples. The curriculum that we propose combines theoretical knowledge of introductory computer graphics concepts and techniques with laboratory work in programming or modelling and animation exercises. This set of applied laboratory exercises is relevant to the material taught in class, but also extends to familiarising students with the modern uses of computer generated imagery, such as films, virtual worlds or medical imaging. The feedback from the students, combined with their success in the course, shows that this coupled teaching and immersion material is by far more interesting and challenging, while still providing them with the essential academic background."""	commercial software;computer graphics;graphics pipeline;immersion (virtual reality);medical imaging;virtual world	Kostas Karpouzis;Stefanos D.

It proposes the use of in itinere formative evaluation as a tool to better understand complex programs that involve various constituencies and to provide feedback on the design, adoption and use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems. Moving the evaluation process from summative to formative elevates it to a cognitive tool that can steer policy outcomes in the desired direction. The preliminary findings of applying this model to an antipollution e-government initiative confirm the relevance and potential of such an approach.	e-government;heuristic;relevance;stemming	Maddalena Sorrentino;Katia Passerini	2012	EG	10.1504/EG.2012.046265	knowledge survey;information and communications technology;computer science;knowledge management;online assessment;management science;formative assessment;world wide web	SE	-79.26359292711683	-5.035372095331111	6116
377bdd5df6591aff1e7cec7fb396e1062044bf35	the core enabling technologies of big data analytics and context-aware computing for smart sustainable cities: a review and synthesis	smart sustainable cities;urban sustainability;big data analytics;context-aware computing;sensors;models;data processing;cloud computing;middleware;big data and context-aware applications	Data sensing, information processing, and networking technologies are being fast embedded into the very fabric of the contemporary city to enable the use of innovative solutions to overcome the challenges of sustainability and urbanization. This has been boosted by the new digital transition in ICT. Driving such transition predominantly are big data analytics and context-aware computing and their increasing amalgamation within a number of urban domains, especially as their functionality involve more or less the same core enabling technologies, namely sensing devices, cloud computing infrastructures, data processing platforms, middleware architectures, and wireless networks. Topical studies tend to only pass reference to such technologies or to largely focus on one particular technology as part of big data and context-aware ecosystems in the realm of smart cities. Moreover, empirical research on the topic, with some exceptions, is generally limited to case studies without the use of any common conceptual frameworks. In addition, relatively little attention has been given to the integration of big data analytics and context-aware computing as advanced forms of ICT in the context of smart sustainable cities. This endeavor is a first attempt to address these two major strands of ICT of the new wave of computing in relation to the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and distilling the core enabling technologies of big data analytics and context-aware computing as ecosystems in relevance to smart sustainable cities, as well as to illustrate the key computational and analytical techniques and processes associated with the functioning of such ecosystems. In doing so, we develop, elucidate, and evaluate the most relevant frameworks pertaining to big data analytics and context-aware computing in the context of smart sustainable cities, bringing together research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level to stimulate new ways of investigating their role in advancing urban sustainability. In terms of originality, a review and synthesis of the technical literature has not been undertaken to date in the urban literature, and in doing so, we provide a basis for urban researchers to draw on a set of conceptual frameworks in future research. The proposed frameworks, which can be replicated and tested in empirical research, will add additional depth and rigor to studies in the field. In addition to reviewing the important works, we highlight important applications as well as challenges and open issues. We argue that big data analytics and context-aware computing are prerequisite technologies for the functioning of smart sustainable cities of the future, as their effects reinforce one another as to their efforts for bringing a whole new dimension to the operating and organizing processes of urban life in terms of employing a wide variety of big data and context-aware applications for advancing sustainability.	big data;cloud computing;computation;context awareness;ecosystem;embedded system;information processing;middleware;organizing (structure);relevance;smart city;software framework	Simon Elias Bibri;John Krogstie	2017	Journal of Big Data	10.1186/s40537-017-0091-6	data science;data mining;computer science;peer review;management science;big data;cloud computing;conceptual framework;sustainability;analytics;middleware;information and communications technology	HCI	-63.424618882599304	2.8302634419694743	6127

Thus, there exists growing demand to explore appropriate evaluation methodologies that evaluate the usability of mobile phones quickly as well as comprehensively. This study aims to develop a task-based usability checklist based on heuristic evaluations in views of mobile phone user interface (UI) practitioners. A hierarchical structure of UI design elements and usability principles related to mobile phones were developed and then utilized to develop the checklist. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed checklist, comparative experiments were conducted on the usability checklist and usability testing. The majority of usability problems found by usability testing and additional problems were discovered by the proposed checklist. It is expected that the usability checklist proposed in this study could be used quickly and efficiently by usability practitioners to evaluate the mobile phone UI in the middle of the mobile phone development process.	experiment;heuristic;mobile phone;usability testing;user interface design	Yong Gu Ji;Jun Ho Park;Cheol Lee;Myung Hwan Yun	2006	Int.

Knowledge management enables organizations to organize stored knowledge and garner knowledge from vast amount of unstructured data. Knowledge management is the combination of activities involved in gathering, organizing and sharing, analyzing and disseminating knowledge to improve an organizations performance. Expert systems are an intelligent technique for capturing tacit knowledge in a very specific and limited domain of human expertise. This article outlines the basic concepts of knowledge management and expert systems as it is applied in the corporate world, considers how it might be applied in education for enhancing the academic performance of the organization. Paper emphasizes that expert systems need to be an integral part of knowledge repository if knowledge management has to succeed.

In this case, students critically evaluate the appropriateness of popular accounting software applications and application service provider (ASP) solutions for a rapidly growing small business. To complete the case requirements, students must possess a basic understanding of business processes, transaction cycles, and accounting reporting systems. Students must also use the Internet to research and familiarize themselves with the functionality and features of the accounting software options, study readings from the professional literature, construct a written system requirements analysis and a comparative software options evaluation, and justify a final recommendation.

While the user-to-user interactions in these networks have received substantial attention, the consumption of user generated content has not been studied extensively. In this work, we use data gathered from digg.com to present novel findings and draw important sociological conclusions regarding the intimate relationship between consumption and social networking. We first demonstrate that individuals’ consumption habits influence their friend networks, consistent with the concept of homophily. We then show that one’s social network can also influence the consumption of a submission through the activation of an extended friend network. Finally, we investigate the level of reciprocity, or balance, in the network and uncover relationships that are significantly less balanced than expected.	interaction;network formation;pervasive informatics;social network;user-generated content	Jake T.

309aea68a2290901c24503df5bf1c680f45e09be	manipulation of mathematical expressions in collaborative environments		Recent decades have seen phenomenal growth in the use of communication and collaborative technologies in many academic disciplines. There has, however, been little adoption of tools for online collaboration in post-secondary mathematics education. In this paper, we argue both that this may be due to limitations of mathematical interfaces and that the adoption of collaborative tools may provide significant pedagogical benefits. To date, mathematical user-interface research has focused primarily on mathematical expression input, and mostly from a perceptive of document creation or computer algebra system use by expert users. Little work has been done on the specific needs of novice users, including students, and even less work has considered the manipulation of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we outline some userinterface challenges of current input systems with respect to entry and manipulation of mathematical expressions by novice users, and we introduce a model that makes entry and manipulation easier for those users.	collaborative software;computer algebra system;mathematical model;user interface	Marco Pollanen;Sohee Kang;Bruce Cater	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58515-4_6	management science;symbolic computation;discipline;expression (mathematics);computer science;mathematical software	HCI	-62.96795405358587	-33.43254077167139	6304

At the University of Toronto at Scarborough, we provide enhanced flexibility to our students using a blended-learning approach (i.e., the webOption) whereby students can attend lectures live, watch them online at their convenience, or both. The current research examines the use of pause and seeks features afforded by the webOption interface and how these features are related to students’ learning approaches and their performance in calculus courses. These courses emphasize the teaching of mathematical proofs; cognitive skills that are enhanced with practice (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977). Access to online lectures allows students to re-experience the professor as they teach these skills. Given this, it was predicted that use of the webOption might be especially potent in these learning contexts. The results we report here do not confirm that prediction. Students do use and appreciate the features of the webOption, however, those students who augmented their class attendance with online viewing, and those who used the lecture-control features the most, were actually the students who performed most poorly. We interpreted the results to be due to different learning strategies and the manner in which these strategies interact with course content. Our results suggest that using the pause feature is related to a surface strategy of learning, which is in turn related to poorer performance in the course. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

SMIRP was used to rapidly construct a collaborative space where students could work on their assignment, request assistance and view their grades. The pedagogical construct was based on a question-answer-reference model where students were required to answer a series of questions based only on the material present in references they selected from the open literature. The answers and grades of all students were visible to all students in real time, although pseudonyms were used to respect student privacy. Email alerts were provided to the teacher, teaching assistants and in the second class also to the students and a librarian. Based on the analysis of log files, overall student performance in the class was found to correlate positively with curiosity and negatively with procrastination. Student expectations of turnaround times for grades and general queries were also analyzed and compared to actual performance. At the end of both classes a questionnaire module was created and an analysis of student satisfaction and preferences is reported. The successful implementation of SMIRP in these two classes supports the contention that this collaborative tool is flexible enough for the rapid design and implementation of relatively complex pedagogical constructs, with the possibility of obtaining detailed metrics.	british undergraduate degree classification;collaborative software;data logger;email;ibm notes;librarian;pseudonymity;reference model;web application	Jean-Claude Bradley;Donald McEachron;David Dorsey;Benjamin Samuel;Sundar Babu;Jeremy Boecker;Mohammad Haghkar;Jay Bhatt	2003	Educational Technology & Society		simulation;reference model;question answering;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-78.31516903945865	-40.44534789246282	6329

The research and development of modern products and systems is coined by the increasingly important requirement to create sustainable innova-tion. Innovation is intimately linked with entrepreneurship. Ideas, Innovation and Entrepreneurship are considered the keys to a wealthy and sustainable economy. The best way to turn ideas into innovations is to consider key innova-tion factors from the earliest phases of research all along the way to products and services. Existing entrepreneurship education and training programs, how-ever, do not take into account these early phases, but rather focus on the process of creating a new enterprise. This paper presents “From Idea to Enterprise”, a European Project that transfers the innovative “ECQA Certified EU Researcher-Entrepreneur” certified program from academic to VET level. Keywords: Innovation, Innovation Transfer, Entrepreneurship, Lifelong Learning. 1 Introduction At a time when entire economies and industries are reeling from the financial crisis, business leaders are struggling to balance the near-term needs of survival with the long-term demand to find new sources of growth. Never has the need to innovate and be entrepreneurial been more urgent. If it is to make a success of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment, Europe needs to stimulate the entrepreneurial mindsets of young people, encourage innovative business start-ups, and foster a culture that is friendlier to entrepreneurship and to the growth of small and medium-sized enter-prises (SMEs).

Motivated by our use of place-based collaborative environments for analysis and ecision support [3], we created Expert Finder and XperNet, two software programs that automatically profile topics of interest and expertise associated with employees based on employees’ tool use, publications, project roles, and written communication with others. Figure 1 illustrates Expert Finder in action. In this case a user types in the keywords “data mining” and Expert Finder replies with a rank-ordered list of employees whose expertise profile, inferred from a variety of evidence sources, best matches this query. Evidence includes the frequency of documents published by an employee on this topic, contents of any published resume, and documents that mention employees in conjunction with a particular topic (for example, corporate newsletters). In the latter case, informatio extraction technology is used to detect names within unstructured documents. These names are then correlated with topic areas in the documents.

This paper describes the knowledge management (KM) approach adopted for CAMRA’s community of scientists. The approach includes knowledge facilitators, a weband repository-based KM system, and use-centered design. The approach relies on a KM methodology that addresses the most common causes of failures in KM approaches that was complemented with a use-centered design methodology. The resulting combined methodology represents a unique way of implementing KM to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration. We describe the principles in our design and the initial steps undertaken to implement it for CAMRA. We conclude by laying out our future steps.	knowledge management;risk assessment;use-centered design	Rosina O. Weber;Marcia L. Morelli;Michael E. Atwood;Jason M.

By providing in-situ step instructions and progress tracking, generating dynamic feedback on technique, and adapting tutorial content to a user's specific context and preferences, an ecosystem of smart tools can guide users through complete project tutorials. We demonstrate how such techniques can be enabled by augmenting common workshop tools (drill/driver, saw, router) with measurement, state sensing and interactive feedback; and by sequencing instructions across multiple tools. We validate the benefits of a smart tool ecosystem through reflections on a series of author-created design examples and informal feedback from four fab lab users.	device driver;ecosystem;fab lab;reflection (computer graphics);router (computing);semiconductor fabrication plant	Eldon Schoop;Michelle Nguyen;Daniel Lim;Valkyrie Savage;Sean Follmer;Björn Hartmann	2016		10.1145/2851581.2892429	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-66.06621600653499	-40.85142879405196	6376

While these text entry methods are useful in situations when a full-sized keyboard is impractical or unavailable, they also require substantial training investment from users. We hypothesize that intelligent text entry tutors may reduce this time and effort. However, before we set out to design these tutors we need to consider their design space. This paper contributes to this understanding by proposing and analyzing five design dimensions: automaticity, error correction, coverage, feedback and engagement.	artificial intelligence;computer keyboard;error detection and correction;intelligent agent	Per Ola Kristensson	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21869-9_80	speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-71.27823842977482	-47.680033800288456	6381

The structuration perspective on the adoption of technology has focused mainly on the organizational process, relatively ignoring the society-wide structuration that is more relevant to public organizations. In this paper, we focus on the structuration process of an e-government innovation, particularly the society-wide structuration through which enabled technical features are given meaning and legal institutionalization of use. Through the case, we found that an e-government system adopted for efficiency may suffer from the lack of an appropriate supporting legal structure, pushing the system into instability. We also found that the sophistication of an e-government system is based not only on its technological features but also on the evolution of social discourse. Finally, we discussed theoretical issues to further the knowledge of the structuration process of e-government innovations.	e-government;instability;organizational behavior;relevance;theory	Taehyon Choi;Deok-Soo Kim;Jungyun Ha	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.378	public relations;innovation;stakeholder;e-government;knowledge management;marketing;management;law	Robotics	-78.63909936192367	-0.1251706856017662	6448

These principles are based on a study on international large-scale assessments (ILSA) and the relations of their findings with culture. In order to achieve this, we correlate ILSA data with Cultural Dimension data for 81 countries and examine the implications for designing student-centred systems based on cultural dimensions. Cultural dimensions such as long-term orientation are good predictors for achievement and can guide design decisions around adaptation.	council for educational technology	Evangelos Kapros	2017		10.1145/3099023.3099054	educational technology;hofstede's cultural dimensions theory;management science;political science;knowledge management;educational assessment	HCI	-75.14002480198222	-35.59124727340347	6494

The recent PV case illustrates a huge lost opportunity by the government in Japan's termination of the residential subsidy program. Of course, we cannot ascribe all failed cases to the government sector. Other factors, such as industry strategies and consumer preferences may also have influenced the success of SEETs. In this article, however, we will focus on the role of the Japanese government's policy in promoting SEETs. Technology policy is important for engineers, corporate executives, and environmental advocates in promoting sustainable technologies. Because SEETsaddress environmental issues, public policies and regulations can have a significant impact on how these technologies are adopted.	failure;promoting adversaries	Masahiro Matsuura;Hideaki Shiroyama;Tatsujiro Suzuki	2010	IEEE Technology and Society Magazine	10.1109/MTS.2010.938105	public policy;economics;environmental resource management;law;economic growth;sustainable development;government;commerce	HCI	-75.23556720387757	-9.218255806438226	6501

We look at an interdisciplinary research project with goals and funding, but no clearly defined beneficiary group at start, and how amorphousness contributed to impact. The reported project researched a bridging tool to connect producers with consumers across global contexts and show players in the supply chain and their circumstances. We explore how both the nature of the research and the tool’s function became contested as work progressed. To tell this tale, we invoke the idea of boundary objects and the value of tacking back and forth between elastic meanings of the project’s artefacts and processes. We examine the project’s role in India, Chile and other arenas to draw out ways that it functioned as a catalyst and how absence of committed design choices acted as an unexpected strength in reaching its goals.	bridging (networking);dos	Ann Light;Theresa Dirndorfer Anderson	2009			social science;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;management science;sociology;communication;management;anthropology	HCI	-77.46595227298484	-3.7932189806811363	6512

However, inconsistency due to con°ict in content shared and content updates not propagated in languages between countries poses a problem. Towards addressing inconsistency, this research qualitatively studied traits for information sharing among countries inside global brands as depicted by content shared in their country-speci ̄c websites. First, inconsistency in content shared is illustrated among websites highlighting the problem in information sharing among countries. Second, content propagation among countries that vary in scales and coupling for speci ̄c content categories are revealed. Scales suggested that corporate and customer support related information tend to be shared globally and locally respectively while product related information is both locally and regionally suitable for sharing. Higher occurrences of propagation when sharing corporate related information also showed tendency for high coupling between websites suggesting the suitability for rigid consistency policy compared to other categories. This study also proposed a simplistic approach with pattern of sharing to enable consistent information sharing.	1:1 pixel mapping;business domain;customer support;emoticon;internationalization and localization;nl-complete;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical aperture;software propagation;wikipedia	Amit Pariyar;Yohei Murakami;Donghui Lin;Toru Ishida	2016	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649216500131	public relations;knowledge management;marketing;commerce	HCI	-82.39881508837283	-14.652274071117796	6637

We used different database like Medline, Inspec, Biosis Citation Index, SciELO Citation Index, Web of science, current contents connect that allowed us to obtain a study sample of 3452 papers distributed across 574 journals. The results show a gradual increase of scientific production over the last 12 years, which is larger amongst English-speaking countries. The topic under analysis was covered to a greater extent from the Behavioral Science, rather than on educational intervention.

The committee also provided the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and Open GIS Consortium, Inc. (OGC) with advice and guidance regarding the findings, conclusions, and recommendations contained in this report. The world of geographical spatial data was once the exclusive domain of the mapping community. Color-coded maps, which summarized a wide variety of information in the context of geographic location, were updated every few years. Today, however, we live in a world described by data generated at rates of terabytes per dayimage and sensor data from satellites, ground sensors, field studies, surveys, and census activities. Through huge federal programs these data are collected by planning offices in small towns as well as by government research and regulatory agencies, academic research programs, and the private sector. Time has become an important variable as we begin to understand the rapid rate at which our world is changing. The purpose behind the large investment by federal, state, and local governments in geographical and geospatial data is increasingly clear. Through the past 50 years' revolution in information and computing technology, transportation, and engineering, rapid change can be initiated by public or private interests and can have a significant impact on national and global politics, economics, and the environment. Change needs to be understood and managed effectively for the nation and world to accommodate growth and sustain prosperity. The worlds of computer and information sciences, statistics, geography, ecology, and cognitive science all converge in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to provide glimpses into the world we live in. The ultimate application of any particular GIS view of the world can be as diverse as building a dam, planning a city, combating terrorism, or charting the destruction of a rain forest. While specific applications of GIS are diverse, the essential need is to share data across sources. In effect, any data from any source could be required for any GIS application regardless of whether the analysis is sponsored by government agency or private interest.

To do so, the study analyzes both the statements of Crowdlaw practitioners gathered at the third “online global conference on #CrowdLaw” and the design and performance of the CrowdLaw platforms for which the author could find a sufficiently complete online presence. Findings about the democratizing potential of CrowdLaw are mixed: on the one hand, the analysis of practitioners’ statements reveals an intention to create broad participation, and discussion forums that encourage deliberation. On the other, a look at the platforms’ design and performance reveals an uneven and incomplete implementation of these intentions.	crowdsourcing	Helene Langlamet	2018			open government;knowledge management;computer science;democracy;online deliberation;crowdsourcing	HCI	-82.32278565773856	-14.893308667972589	6724

It has been developed rapidly, which realizes the sharing of English teaching information and intelligent teaching management. But algorithm optimization for improving students’ English achievement has not yet appeared. This paper constructs a LCAM model based on neural network, and the original “full intelligence” algorithm is used to achieve students’ English achievement and optimization of English Teaching Strategies. So teachers can make more targeted English teaching activities according to the optimization results of the system algorithm. At the same time, it realizes the depth mining of students’ characteristics information, and provides more solutions for the optimization of English teaching strategies.	algorithm	Xingyu Wei	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-5175-2	computer science;the internet;artificial neural network;algorithm	Mobile	-77.67502988214854	-42.36613207633947	6754
4a90eaa3bb60e0ac00f141beea0e8c1b763a025a	scanpath comparison in medical image reading skills of dental students: distinguishing stages of expertise development		A popular topic in eye tracking is the difference between novices and experts and their domain-specific eye movement behaviors. However, very little is researched regarding how expertise develops, and more specifically, the developmental stages of eye movement behaviors. Our work compares the scanpaths of five semesters of dental students viewing orthopantomograms (OPTs) with classifiers to distinguish sixth semester through tenth semester students. We used the analysis algorithm SubsMatch 2.0 and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Overall, both classifiers were able distinguish the stages of expertise in medical image reading above chance level. Specifically, it was able to accurately determine sixth semester students with no prior training as well as sixth semester students after training. Ultimately, using scanpath models to recognize gaze patterns characteristic of learning stages, we can provide more adaptive, gaze-based training for students.

The paper’s contribution is that this evolvement is inadequate without an evolutionary telos. It is argued that without the presence of self-destruction in multiple levels of our existence and surroundings, our survival would have been impossible. This paper recognises an appreciation of auto-catastrophe at the cell level, in human attitudes (both as an individual and in societies), and extended to Earth and out to galaxies. Auto-Catastrophic Theory combines evolution with auto-catastrophic behaviours and innovative machinery by offering new themes of understanding their merging such as (a) protogenic and deuterogenic auto-catastrophic processes, (b) protogenic and deuterogenic survival processes, and (c) ‘alive’, partially ‘alive’, and non-‘alive’ systems. The value of self-destruction relies on a numerical stability within a system and correlational relationships between systems. Auto-Catastrophic Theory provides novel justifications why artificial intelligence: (a) is crucial to overcome the extinction of humanity (via H+), (b) is crucial to offer indirect survival of humanity (by saving its history), and (c) is at the same time a threat for humanity. These novel justifications and themes, developed by combining evolution with catastrophe as well as innovative machinery, expand our knowledge of how best to handle fresh challenges ahead.	artificial intelligence;catastrophe theory;darwin;emoticon;evolution;galaxy;h+: the digital series;living systems;numerical stability;programming language;self-destruct;terminate (software)	Marilena Kyriakidou	2015	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/s00146-015-0598-3	artificial intelligence;evolution;sociology;social psychology;operations research;law	AI	-75.6190469239706	-13.16531611675481	6780

Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 28 historical star catalogues (eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries) from the Royal Institute and Observatory of the Spanish Navy was selected in order to analyse their structure and to identify information patterns. Findings – The analysis shows that there are a number of technical parameters which are not present in the cataloguing standards and which should be taken into account in the bibliographic descriptions of these specialised documents since they are of great interest to astronomers and astrophysicists. On the other hand, star catalogues provide some cartographic information which can be described by these standards but whose corresponding fields are not widely used by cataloguers. Originality/value – A proposal of new technical parameters is given in order to try to improve the bibliographic records of these astronomical resources. Some directions are also given in order to identify the sections of the catalogues where these parameters may be found, making the task of locating them easier.	bibliographic record;cartography;information theory;star catalogue	M.

An agile coach focuses on developing the potential of people and its application to obtain valuable results faster. This paper analyzes the influence of the practices adopted by an agile consultant for enhancing overall interactions and knowledge sharing, such as Open Space and Lightning Talks sessions. We analyze the influence of these practices in organizational practices, as a way to foster organizational learning. We found significant associations between practices and purposes, and also crossed the level of adoption and barriers for adoption of the practices by company experience on agile methods. Results show that the participants recognize the positive impacts of the practices, but they are not sufficient to change the organizational practices. Few participants continue to adopt them in their organizations. Most of them report obstacles regarding organizational conditions, such as culture and top management/leadership support.	agile software development;interaction	Viviane A.

The present study was designed to explore how learning magnitude knowledge and learning procedural knowledge, with respect to both whole numbers and fractions, might be causally related. Neither magnitude knowledge nor procedural knowledge is necessary or sufficient for learning the other, and yet, correlations between the two are ubiquitous (e.g., Siegler & Pyke, 2013). Using correlational data (Structural Equation Models) and accuracy data (Knowledge Space Theory), potential causal models to describe the data were tested. Structural equation models did not differentiate between learning magnitude knowledge helping to learn procedural knowledge or vice versa. However, knowledge space model testing models of accuracy data provides support for the notion that learning procedural knowledge helps learning magnitude knowledge, and evidence against the reverse notion that learning magnitude knowledge helps learning procedural knowledge.	causal filter;knowledge space	Rony Patel;Kenneth R.

The evaluation shows that the students interacted with the devices in the ways intended in design 64% of the time. The contribution is an approach for translating learning goals to interaction design goals in mobile learning research. We conclude that this approach can be of value in designing and evaluating interaction with mobile devices for an entire mobile learning activity.	interaction design;mobile device	Johan Eliasson;Ola Knutsson;Jalal Nouri;Olov Karlsson;Robert Ramberg;Teresa Inés Cerratto	2012	2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Wireless, Mobile and Ubiquitous Technology in Education	10.1109/WMUTE.2012.23	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia;context model;mobile computing	HCI	-69.56786979476867	-40.901960362654776	6827

Design/methodology Using journal logs and diary-interviews as methods of data collection, the study analyzes the use of the Kindle over a one-week period by a pool of 20 LIS students at Pratt Institute’s School of Information and Library Science. Findings The findings reveal four key areas that provide a framework for data interpretation: usage patterns, user interaction, effect on reading habits, and future applications. One major finding is that the portability of the device and its convenience of use anywhere and anytime is pivotal for enhancing the students’ reading experience and outweighs the limitations of the device’s usability. Research limitations/implications Results may not be generalizable due to the small size and homogeneity of the sample. Originality/value The social and cultural impacts of e-book readers in everyday life have received little attention so far. In particular, questions about the effects of ereaders on individual reading practices and the potential applications for library delivery systems have yet to be examined. This study is one of the first to investigate the use of portable e-book readers.	amazon kindle;anytime algorithm;e-book;e-reader;knuth–morris–pratt algorithm;library and information science;library science;usability	Maria Cristina Pattuelli;Debbie L.

Since 1995, this university has focused primarily on multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary graduate education for working professionals. Most programs are offered in a blended online and face-to-face format, which enables adult learners to continue in their professions while they pursue their studies. While one might not expect a primarily distance education degree to be transformative, feedback from learners consistently points to the experience of transformative learning. This article explores the Master’s of Arts in Leadership Studies (MA-L) program. It is proposed that there are at least three elements of the design of this program that contribute to experiences of transformation. First, the RRU Learning and Teaching Model creates a framework that can allow many learners to learn how to learn in a new way. Second, the MA-L program itself has its own competency framework that begins by priming learners to look inward before they seek to lead others. Third and finally, the first year two-week residency, completed after one month of online preparation, provides an embodied experience in what, for many, is a new way of being. This embodied experience creates an awareness of what is possible for human relationship and communication, not only in the context of their particular graduate learning cohort, but also with colleagues, family members, and friends. Taken together, these create an often unexpectedly, and somewhat paradoxically, transformative experience for mid-career professionals.

However, without teachers’ genuine efforts, it does not seem possible to effectively integrate technology in classroom practice. Teachers’ positive attitude towards educational technologies is considered to be essential for the integration of technology into teaching and learning. Research has also shown that principals’ technology leadership could be correlated with teachers’ integration of educational technology into classroom teaching. This study aims to explore the effect of secondary school principals’ technological leadership on teachers’ attitude towards educational technology. Data regarding principals’ technology leadership were collected using the “Technology Leadership Scale” developed by Sincar in 2009, and data regarding teachers’ attitudes towards educational technology were collected using the “Attitude Towards Educational Technology Scale” developed by Pala in 2006. The statistical analysis has revealed that principals’ technological leadership had little effect on teachers’ positive attitude towards the use of educational technologies and did not have a significant effect on their negative attitude.

The datasets for the analysis have been extracted from the web sites that record the players’ ratings and a number of empirical metrics. Results suggest that the HoN’s Matchmaking rating algorithm, while generally capturing the skill level of the player well, also has weaknesses, which have been exploited by players to achieve a higher placement on the ranking ladder than deserved by actual skill. In addition, we also illustrate the effects of the choice of the business model (from pay-to-play to free-to-play) on player population.	algorithm;microsoft lumia;sports rating system;virtual world	Neven Caplar;Mirko Suznjevic;Maja Matijasevic	2013			simulation;multimedia;advertising	Web+IR	-90.82516212022908	-19.512414678430165	6884

While e-learning has many advantages such as users being able to study everywhere and at any time until they understand the study contents, it also has disadvantages such as users easily becoming bored of just reading computer displays without being able to communicate with teachers or to ask questions. This paper presents the results of learning experiments on maintaining users' will to learn. Functions to display images for praising and scolding users during learning are added to a web-based e-learning system constructed for learning English words. Previous research has showed that an e-leaning system displaying praising and scolding images is effective for maintaining learning will, and images of actors and friends are better than those of a teacher for maintaining learning will. In this study, the system is extended to display favorable images for praising and disgusting images for scolding, and images of anime characters and animals are added to those of actors. Experiments displaying favorable images for scolding as well as praising are conducted to determine if the system can maintain learning will better. After the experiments, a questionnaire is administered to determine the feelings of users themselves.	cloud computing;computer monitor;experiment;smartphone;tablet computer;web application	Kenichi Takahashi;Masakazu Takeue;Michimasa Inaba	2017		10.1145/3022227.3022238	simulation;computer science;machine learning;interface;multimedia;programming language;world wide web	HCI	-69.64240286572146	-45.25876722495834	6911

An enduring belief is that when expanding by replication, organizations can and should strive to adapt to fit the salient characteristics of new environments. Yet some have argued that the exploitation of an established template for doing business by replication can be more successful when the template is copied precisely. Using unique longitudinal data, we report a large-sample empirical investigation of the survival consequences of accurate replication versus local adaptation by examining the effect that deviation from the template has on the survival chances of franchise units within a large franchise organization.	replication (computing)	Sidney G.

be8f9b5b1a68005f05cf08cdd56cffd66d4d3e85	curriculum for accelerated learning through mindfulness (calm)		The military training community is faced with the daunting task of providing each and every warfighter with basic, journeyman and advanced training courses – using media and methodologies that permit rapid, efficient learning and transfer of the learning to a wide range of operational tasks. There is a need for a methodology and metrics to assess the best combinations of learning techniques that can be applied across various types of military training systems and a training testbed with which to assess individual and group characteristics that can accelerate the speed of learning, increase comprehension and retention, and improve transfer of training to performance on operational tasks. Accelerated learning is comprised of two primary components: accelerating the learning pathway and accelerating the learning process. The Curriculum for Accelerated Learning through Mindfulness (CALM) theoretical model seeks to combine these two components and to close the loop between the two, providing real-time correlation of training performance to cognitive state metrics and subsequent adaptation of training content (e.g., complexity/difficulty, modality, scaffolding) in order to maintain an optimal and accelerated state of learning.	gene regulatory network;learning pathway;modality (human–computer interaction);real-time clock;testbed;theory	Anna Skinner;Cali M.

eb0ba988863627472b9081e552b5004e487903a8	a two-staged capstone project to foster university-business dialogue		Capstone projects improve the endowments of knowledge, ability and skills earned by higher-education students, and help intensify the university-business dialogue. While not solely suited for BSc curricula, capstones raise the employability of BSc graduates, whose market value is intrinsically inferior to their MSc correspondents, yet highly attractive thanks to shorter turn-around time. Designing a BSc curriculum in Computer Science after those premises requires balancing two forces. One is traditional content-centered teaching, which has many adepts and exerts higher pressure on the shorter duration of the study path. The other is learner-centered teaching, which promotes active teaching strategies, and makes room for capstone inserts. This paper discusses how the University of Padua went around that challenge designing its BSc curriculum in Computer Science in 2002, and critically assesses its outcome to date. 27 credit hours of the total 180 in the novel curriculum were devolved to a capstone project comprising an internship in business, whose critical review feeds the final exam. The capstone was organized as a two-staged progression: (a) the first leg being a preparatory, learning-for-work collaborative laboratory aimed at the acquisition of soft skills, and exposure to technology innovation challenges; and (b) the second leg promoting a learning-through-work individual internship. Evaluation of field data from 14 cohorts of graduates, from 07/2004 to 12/2017, shows that the BSc curriculum has met with the appreciation of students and employers, and it has served well the purpose of boosting the university-business dialogue.	capstone (cryptography);color gradient;computer science;emoticon;final exam	Tullio Vardanega;Monica Fedeli	2018		10.1145/3197091.3197130	computer science;curriculum;capstone;employability;knowledge management;engineering management;internship;higher education;cooperative learning;curriculum development;soft skills	HCI	-78.5978636603358	-30.95363536731881	6952

These start-ups operate on two-sided platforms and enable sharing of physical products or services based on physical assets. Interestingly, they are subject to both the dynamics of the digital world (i.e., network effects), and the constraints of the physical world (i.e., issues of accountability when physical property is destroyed). We investigate how Airbnb, a sharing platform, evolve into a sustainable business with an in-depth case analysis based on data retrieved from a number of blogs providing information about Airbnb's actions. Our analysis with insights from platform economics and information infrastructures depicts two phases in the evolution process: creating the user base and augmenting the platform. With the two complementary theoretical perspectives we can offer a deeper understanding of the evolution of sharing platforms into sustainable and competitive businesses.	blog;evolution;sharing economy	Ioanna D.

20f009eceedf4b5c733dd6ac375ed466820488b6	knowledge communication on social media: a case study of biomedical science on baidu baike	online encyclopedia;social media;altmetrics;citation analysis;co-occurrence analysis;heterogeneous coupling;knowledge communication and sharing	Social media are considered perfect examples of Web 2.0 applications, which people use to communicate and collaborate together. Baidu Baike, a wiki-like online encyclopedia, is analysed as a typical example in which experts and lay Internet users collaborate. Entries in Biomedical Science section are analysed to reveal communication activities behind the construction of such scholarly entries. The composition of the related entries, references of each entry, cooperation among contributors of entries, and common interests of contributors are analysed with Altmetrics, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and heterogeneous coupling. Altmetrics is used to analyse scholarly communication during the construction of entries. Citation analysis based on references in entries provides a way to establish indirect communication between citing and cited authors, namely the contributors of entries and authors of references. Co-occurrence analysis is used for the analysis of cooperation both among experts and lay Internet users and the distribution of tags of entries. Heterogeneous coupling is used to reveal the relationship among entries based on common references as well as common experts. The results show that literature is referred to during people’s online communication. The citations and tags of entries reflect the interdisciplinary specializations within Biomedical Science. The majority of experts cooperated with someone in the same affiliation but cross-unit cooperation also existed. The common interests of experts indicate that the specialists only master their own field. Moreover, as a typical general public, lay Internet users have a wide range of interests and remain enthusiastic about entry contribution.	altmetrics;citation analysis;computer-mediated communication;internet;social media;tag (metadata);web 2.0;wiki	Ni Cheng;Ke Dong	2018	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2828-1	scholarly communication;knowledge management;computer science;online encyclopedia;citation analysis;data mining;the internet;social media;altmetrics	HCI	-79.05901005980776	-18.39332684560245	6972

The paper first reviews several techniques for web page level content adaptation. Most of these techniques have been used in existing applications but they are very generic and lack the guidelines for deployment of educational pedagogy needed in learning environments. The Multiple Representation approach fills this gap by providing guidelines for content adaptation in e-learning and mobile learning environments. We further formulate, extend and apply MR approach in a prototype of a mobile quiz module to illustrate the synergy between mobile adaptation and MR approach.	anytime algorithm;content adaptation;mobile device;prototype;requirement;software deployment;synergy;user requirements document;web content;web page	Kinshuk;Tiong-Thye Goh	2003			simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;web page;mobile device;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-80.61177263599396	-45.170782669671695	7001

The challenge for programs comes in translating this research into useful practices for their specific context. This study describes the development and pilot testing of a web-based self-report program classification and assessment tool. The RNR Program Tool was designed to identify programs’ ideal target behavior, and to assess the degree to which program operations are consistent with the best available evidence on practices in the areas of risk, need, responsivity, dosage, implementation, and restrictiveness. The current study used data from 53 programs in 7 jurisdictions to test the internal consistency of the RNR Program Tool. Pilot testing of the RNR Program Tool for Adults found that programs had an average score of 58.7%. This finding is consistent with the research conducted by Lowenkamp, Latessa, and Smith (2006) using the CPAI in which they found that halfway house programs scored 45.5%. Findings also suggest that the RNR Program Tool has respectable internal reliability (α = 0.703 for the Program Tool Total Score). Additionally, exploratory factor analysis suggests that the RNR Program Tool includes two factors reflecting a treatment-matching or individual component, and a program operations or system’s level component.

The situation is exacerbated by the continuing decline in the number of women undertaking IT related degrees. However, there are an increasing number of students taking business degrees that have a small information systems component, although few students choose to major in IS. Using a qualitative reflective approach we identify the perceptions and experiences of female undergraduates taking introductory IS courses in two universities, one in Australia and one in New Zealand. We discuss ways of improving the delivery of introductory IS courses in order to make information systems more interesting to women undergraduates, thus enhancing their learning experiences and encouraging further uptake of IS majors. The paper concludes with some reflections on other influences that impact on the ability of IS departments to deliver appropriate introductory courses.	amiga reflections;experience;gender hci;information system	Rosemary Stockdale;Susan Stoney	2007	Australasian J. of Inf.

Currently under development at The Graduate Center, CUNY, and funded by generous assistance from an NEH Startup Grant, DH Box is designed with particular attention to digital humanities pedagogy. Because teaching DH requires infrastructure of various kinds, including computing resources, IT support, and teachers with specialized training, student access to the digital humanities is unevenly distributed and highly dependent on local institutional conditions. Faculty with DH skills are often called upon to teach classes and workshops in adverse circumstances, contending with limited access to labs or other computing resources, restrictive IT policies that prevent new software from being installed, and platform fragmentation on student-owned machines. As a cloud-based platform, DH Box was conceived to address some of these concerns by providing a set of digital humanities tools through a unified computing environment accessed through the browser. DH Box is not a service, nor is it a standalone application that runs on local computers. Rather, it is software that can be set up by teachers or institutions on cloud-based infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services or DigitalOcean. DH Box is an open-source project developed by and for teachers and researchers in the humanities, and as such is intended to provide an alternative to proprietary services that prevent access to user data. DH Box also makes an intervention in terms of design, UX, and usability. The platform uses a virtualization technology called Docker to quickly create and remove digital working environments, providing students with access to either shared work spaces or individualized virtual machines. Each of these environments contains a set of tools and utilities frequently used in the digital humanities, including IPython Notebooks, the Natural Language Toolkit, MALLET, Omeka, and WordPress. DH Box’s tab-based browsing interface makes it possible to easily switch between these utilities, the command line, and a text editor. In addition to providing DH tools in a unified computing environment, the platform offers resources in partnership with institutions like the British Library, making digitized texts available for student exploration. By integrating Git Lit, a tool for downloading text corpora developed in partnership with Columbia University, DH Box provides access not only to digital humanities tools, but also to materials for analysis and experimentation. Even as it aims to circumvent institutional barriers to DH scholarship, DH Box addresses broader questions of access to DH tools. The necessity for specialized knowledge--use of the command line, importing packages and modules, configuring a working environment--may deter students from pursuing research questions using these novel methods. Making these tools more accessible, on the other hand, should help encourage a new generation of DH scholars. By allowing teachers and students to bypass the difficult process of installation and configuration, the DH Box team hopes to give them room to focus on exploration and experimentation. During the DH Box poster presentation, team members will be available to discuss decisions of design as well as future use cases.	a/ux;amazon web services;cloud computing;columbia (supercomputer);command-line interface;computer;digital humanities;docker;download;fabric computing;fork (software development);ipython;mallet;natural language toolkit;open-source software;text corpus;text editor;usability;virtual machine;web application;wordpress;x86 virtualization	Jojo Karlin;Patrick Smyth;Stephen Zweibel;Matthew K.

294fdb95834d8f5d8e2a5023a9c60db647b439b9	where to place trust	decision analysis;mode of presentation;tabgraph	T wo questions are addressed here. On one hand, under what circumstances is it reasonable to trust computers and related technologies, part icularly in critical applications? On the o ther hand, under what circumstances is it reasonable to trust people in the development , operation, and use of such computerrelated systems? RISKS archives give us an oppor tuni ty to explore a diverse range of computer re la ted risks through actual incidents. Under s tanding the causes can help a little to reduce the chances of the same types o f problems recurr ing repeatedly in the future. However, we see that there are still enormous gaps between theory and practice, and between research and development. Fur the rmore , we see that similar problems do continue to recur. T h e r e are some intrinsic limitations of technology and of the people who use it (or do not use it). The re are also o ther limitations that can be ove rcome-a l t hough in some cases only with significant effort. In any event, we must strive to promote the deve lopment and systematic use o f techniques that can help identify the intrinsic limitations and help reduce those that are not intr insic--e .g . , th rough bet ter systems and bet ter operat ional practices. But we must also be keenly aware of the limitations. Examples of trust in people and in computers being improper ly matched to one another and to a part icular situation are provided by the roles computers have played in various recent events (many of which have been discussed in previous issues), such as the shootdown of the I ranian Airbus by the U.S.S. Vincennes; the fly-by-wire Airbus A320 crashes; the Exxon Valdez oil spill; the British Midland Airways 737 crash; faulty automobile cruisecontrol computer systems; deaths caused by the Therac 25 linear accelerator; concerns about the subvertibility of computer ized elections; and numerous violations of Peter G.

Never before have authors from the developing and developed worlds come together to explore the intersection of records management, public administration and international development. The book covers Thurston’s work, the importance of records management for effective governance and digital records management and preservation in developing countries. Case studies from across Africa enhance the theoretical and practical perspectives taken by the authors. This book is essential reading for scholars and students interested in records management and good governance around the world.	archive	Eric Boamah	2015	Online Information Review	10.1108/OIR-05-2015-0159	social science;sociology	DB	-72.15197046310888	-15.390993307100896	7168
2942fbfa2e0db614a616de2b9279db65c048fca0	a computing metaphor approach to customer experience based alliance partner recommendation	computing metaphor;alliance partner recommendation;customer experience;colour psychology	Purpose – In the service economy era, service value is created from the evaluation of customer experience and it is important to study alliance partner selection for improving service provision. Nevertheless, most of the existing alliance partner selection approaches concentrate on the functional aspects. The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel approach that is customer-centric and emphasizes the emotional aspect of service value. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a metaphor-based alliance partner recommendation mechanism (MAPRM) that employs the computing metaphor approach to recommend alliance partners for companies in an innovative way. The main ideas of metaphors are the comparison made between two unlike things that actually have something in common so as to attain innovative thinking. Findings – This study uses the scenario of regional tourism innovation to demonstrate the attempted contributions of MAPRM. The simulation evaluation results show that MAPRM can utilize knowledge and resources from companies to achieve specific alliance goals of satisfying desired customer experiences represented by images that can be analyzed and created based on customers’ feedback and their interactions with companies. Originality/value – MAPRM aims to assist companies to find appropriate alliance partners which offer potential innovation opportunities for service value provision. It is capable of facilitating the alliance partner selection process and assessing customers’ needs at the same time.	business ecosystem;emoticon;experience;experiment;interaction;nl (complexity);niche blogging;service innovation;simulation	Soe-Tsyr Yuan;Pei-Hung Hsieh;Yu-Chen Yeh	2015	Kybernetes	10.1108/K-01-2015-0004	knowledge management;color psychology	Web+IR	-76.6881680453585	4.149751193993774	7187

Following these overviews, the authors turn to a consideration of the primary policy considerations related to the diffusion of computer technology. The report concludes with the suggestion that through technology traditional boundaries between home and school, between formal- and informal-learning contexts, can be overcome. This process of extending learning experiences beyond the traditional classroom would expand opportunities for workforce development and provide alternatives for an educational system stretched to its limits.

The Thinking Style Inventory was used to establish the thinking style profile. The grades of the collaborative design team members were collected. The correlation coefficient of team members’ thinking styles profiles was calculated, and the Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between project grades and team members’ thinking style. The results demonstrated that the team members with difference thinking style could have better performance in the collaborative design team.

The resulting cocitation maps identified specific areas of research and their knowledge bases. We inferred the degree of consolidation of the discipline of library and information science, and of the subdisciplines informetrics, librarianship and university affiliation, from the research activities revealed. In this respect, the conclusions from the study show the existence of several research fronts in Spanish literature the contents of which are in most cases difficult to compare with those in other countries.

Reflecting on connectedness, it looks at the politics of participation through the lens of people's interdependence, using feminist concepts of 'care' to explore the ethical commitments of designing. In particular, it speaks to Greenbaum's claim, 20 years ago, that 'we have the obligation to provide people with the opportunity to influence their own lives' (1993:47). We explore the questions this raises now, as we design in an increasingly distributed and heterogeneous socio-technical context, to give a contemporary take on long-term commitments to political and ethical outcomes in participatory design. Three contrasting case studies are interrogated to discuss how structuring of social relations was enabled, offering insights into what the politics of care might mean.	futures and promises;interdependence;sociotechnical system	Ann Light;Yoko Akama	2014		10.1145/2661435.2661438	politics;structure;social science;ethics;socioeconomics;sociology;becoming;management;law;economic growth	HCI	-77.06322731917804	-10.769663038382584	7323

The experiments are based on typical programming tasks such as problem solving, construction and interpretation. They employed a number of experimental languages, including both implicit pictorial representations and explicitly verbal metaphorical explanations. The results of these experiments indicate that special design considerations apply to visual languages. Direct application of Graphical User Interface metaphors does not result in automatic improvements in usability of visual languages for typical programming tasks. Visual languages can benefit from pictorial mnemonics, but systematic explanatory metaphors (whether visual or verbal) are less useful than consistent presentation of language abstractions.		Alan F.

Knowledge of cell biochemistry is advancing at a fast pace and the most pressing objectives are for rapid and cost-effective progress in Medicine, Public Health, and Environmental Science. And opportunities for cost-effective advances are possible in the interdisciplinary direction but this requires educating computer scientists about Biology and vice-versa as pre-requisite for this cost-effective progress to take place. So this interaction is important because the costs of research in drug discovery can be very high.	bioinformatics;computation;computational intelligence;computer scientist;thrust	Daniel Howard	2005		10.1145/1167350.1167365	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science	Comp.	-69.69901412160611	-17.178123533837944	7394

Unfortunately, this type of communication is not accessible to blind people. Currently these people need assistance to be able to access their email in reading and writing. This paper presents an application for the reading, writing and sending of emails using voice as a mean of communication between the computer and the person, in the Spanish language. This application was evaluated by five people with visual impairment at the special education school Baltazar Maldonado Olvera, in the community of San Andres, in the municipality of Tzompantepec, Tlaxcala, Mexico; obtaining very good results.

Data sharing presents great opportunities as well as significant ethical and legal concerns, such as privacy, consent, governance, access, and communication. Respectful data governance calls for stakeholder engagement during platform development. This stakeholder-engagement study used a web-based survey to capture the views of research participants about governance strategies for secondary data use. Survey response rate was 60.8% (n = 346). Parents’ primary concern was ensuring appropriate data re-use of data, even over privacy. Appropriate re-use included project-specific access and limiting access to researchers with more-trusted affiliations like academia. Other affiliations (e.g. industry, government and not-for-profit) were less palatable. Parents considered pediatric data more sensitive than adult data and expressed more reluctance towards sharing child identifiers compared to their own (p-value<0.001). This study stresses the importance of repository governance strategies to sustain long-term access to valuable data assets via large-scale repository.	biobank;data governance;identifier;privacy;web application	Shawn X.

Through a questionnaire respondents were asked how frequently they engage in specific behaviors, including hacking, using pirated software, music and movies in addition to use of gambling and pornography sites. The aim was to investigate which individual characteristics including age, gender, religion, citizenship, level of education, ego strength and locus of control are among determinants of these behaviors. The results of these questions were used to report the ratio of frequent users of these materials based on different categories. Logistic regression was used to see what the influential factors in the investigated behaviors are. The results suggest that males are more engaged with almost all of the investigated behaviors. In addition, citizenship, ego strength, age and religion reflected a statistically significant difference among people in certain activities. Level of education and locus of control did not reflect any significance in engaging in aforementioned behaviors.

79592e54a3e2cf474b35ca848037005b887af1fb	actualization of electronic health records affordances: an empirical investigation of users' personal and behavioral antecedents		The healthcare industry is shifting from motivating use of electronic health record (EHR) systems to promoting effective use of EHR systems as measured by patient care outcomes. This underpins the importance of understanding the process of actualizing the EHR affordances and learning how to motivate healthcare providers’ use of EHR systems toward improving patient care. This study conceptualizes the process of perception and actualization of EHR affordances by drawing on the theory of affordances. We hypothesize and empirically investigate the role of user characteristics and patterns of use of EHR toward actualization of EHR affordances. To that end, we analyzed two-wave data collected from 91 healthcare professionals in an outpatient primary care clinic. Our findings support all the hypotheses. Our post-hoc analysis further shows the impact of different job roles on patterns of use of the EHR system. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.	hoc (programming language)	Hamed Qahri Saremi;Georgia Mueller-Luckey;Robert Robinson;Rassule Hadidi;Stacy Sattovia	2018				HCI	-84.9278402407554	-2.0369205136712343	7508

Users of the social network chat, discuss, entertain and watch personal contents in their favorite sites. Most of the users who use the social network are learners and they are very high in numbers. So, it will be an added advantage for the learners to learn from large community where the pool of content is available for learning. The content is available as a blog. Blogs are available in plenty. It becomes a tedious task for the learner to search and find the required content from the large collection of blogs. This work proposes a novel idea to use the social network for creation of blog content for group learning. It uses ontology for a specific subject to relate one blog with another blog. Blog posted for a particular title is related to the blogs of the same blogger or another blogger and it should be linked to the relevant blog. Blogger can also call for online discussion on a posted article which gives the clear picture about the understanding of the topic. Over and above the traditional learning system, a semantic blog based supportive learning system is introduced in this paper. The system yield high result if the user accepts the new learning method. High percentage of interest shown to discuss the topic and easy access and the availability of content is the added advantage.	blog	Godfrey Winster Sathianesan;Swamynathan Sankaranarayanan	2012		10.1109/T4E.2012.40	computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	AI	-82.56893002624035	-47.13821571169795	7512

As a part of a treatment doctors often recommend steam baths with essential oils. A system in which those baths are in the mobility form as a part of a clothing is described in this paper. That clothing consists of an underwear and 4 layers with different properties and it is described in that paper. The aim of the study is determining some basic parameters which are necessary for the design and construction of electric heating elements in the clothing structure. The measurements determine the value of these parameters of the electroconductive textiles. In the article there are described the test methods and a comprehensive study of different electroconductive materials which can be used as the textile heating elements. The system is patented in Poland (P. 408106) and it was awarded with the first prize in „Innovation is a woman‟ competition in Poland and three gold medals at international exhibitions of inventions.	e-textiles;tract (literature)	Emilia Frydrysiak;Michal Frydrysiak	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2018.8438645	clothing;commerce;engineering	Arch	-67.0044135652832	-27.964022465015184	7565

Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted in February 2010. Participants were recruited via the homepage of the smoking cessation program Dit Digitale Stopprogram (Your Digital Quit Program) operated by the Danish Cancer Society. The main result was that participants established a relationship to the program which influenced their smoking cessation process. Participants perceived the program as caring and found it supportive. However, the program also created feelings of frustration, disappointment and anger. Some participants in the last phase of cessation experienced text messages from the program as smoking cues. The study concluded that individual interpretations of the different elements in an Internet-based smoking cessation intervention can have both positive and negative impact on the smoking cessation process of participants.	cessation of smoking;internet;interpretation process;neoplasms;semiconductor industry;message	Caroline L.

These ICTs are often viewed as vehicles that can bridge the digital divide between rural and urban healthcare centres. They hold the promise of bringing resolution to the shortages facing the rural healthcare sector by introducing e-health solutions such as electronic health records, telemedicine and e-education. Furthermore, e-health solutions promise to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve the quality of health service delivery. Therefore, ICTs have proved to be increasingly fundamental to the socio-economic development of nations. However, these e-health solutions are currently under-realised in developing countries, especially in rural areas due to various challenges. Developing countries face barriers to reach significant levels of e-health adoption. Existing research, in identifying these barriers, has grouped a variety of contributing factors into several categories. This study, in viewing these categories, highlights an overlooked factor which impacts e-health development and other ICT4D activities in the rural areas of South Africa. Community awareness and involvement, at an appropriate level, is presented as an important control that may reduce or even eliminate the prevalence of e-health solutions vandalism and theft in rural areas. The literature case reviews and main author experiences are mainly based in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa.	itil;security controls	Nkqubela Ruxwana;Marlien Herselman;Dalenca Pottas	2010			environmental resource management;security controls;knowledge management;political science	HCI	-78.9915214076783	-8.13260578523218	7585

One method of understanding this influence is through an assessment of multiple levels of analysis. Although many scholars have called for such analyses, few have heeded that call. This research addresses the relevance of “context” to the study of media effects on perceptions of public opinion. Survey data from the American National Election Studies are combined with a content analysis of campaign news in 24 regional newspapers, as well as advertising data, in order to parse out contextual media effects. Results show that perceived public opinion varies significantly across media markets. Newspaper use and personal candidate preference had a significant effect on the likelihood of perceiving Kerry to be the state-winning candidate. There was also a significant cross-level interaction between media context and political discussion on perceptions of public opinion.		Lindsay H.

The introduction of dynamic geometry environments, DGE (e.g. Cabri-Géomètre, Geometer's Sketchpad), into classrooms in the past decade has posed a challenge to this praxis. Students can experiment through different dragging modalities on geometrical objects that they construct, and consequently infer properties (generalities, theorems) about the geometrical artifacts. Because of the inductive nature of the DGE, the experimentaltheoretical gap that exists in the acquisition and justification of geometrical knowledge becomes an important pedagogical and epistemological concern. In this paper, we will describe and study a ‘Cabri proof by contradiction’ of a theorem on cyclic quadrilaterals given by a pair of 16 year-old students in a Hong Kong secondary school. We will discuss how their construction motivates a visual-cognitive scheme on ‘seeing’ proof in DGE, and how this scheme could fit into the theoretical construct of cognitive unity of theorems proposed by Boero, Garuti and Mariotti (1996). The issue of a cognitive duality and its relation to visualization will be raised and discussed. Finally, we propose a possible perspective to bridge the experimental-theoretical gap in DGE by introducing the idea of a dynamic template as a visualizer to geometrical theorem justification and acquisition.

We walk participants through an outcome driven design process using the award winning Developmentally Situated Design (DSD) card set -- focusing on cognitive, emotional, physical, and social skills specific to children at different ages. Small groups create solutions for the same design challenge, but focus on the skills and abilities of a specific age group. We facilitate a compare and contrast exercise of their solutions to help synthesize the complexities of, and showcase skills for, designing child-centric tangibles. While not necessary for participation, we encourage participants who have them to bring iPads (v2 or higher) or iPad minis. Participants are also encouraged to review the DSD II cards in advance, available at http://www.antle.iat.sfu.ca/DSD.	hands-on computing	Alissa Nicole Antle;Jillian L.

However, the exploration and development of these structures is central to the creative process. This paper summarizes research on the role of constraint in creative tasks, defines the role of constraint development in a model of the creative process, and classifies types of constraint in order to inform the design of environments for creative tasks. Links between constraint development and end user development in software environments are explored through analysis of the design and use of Music Builder, a prototype for the user development of musical instruments in a collaborative composition environment. Conclusions include the value of scaffolding as a metaphor in design, the utility of collaborative constraint development to negotiation, and coordination and the value of sharing structures in collaborative development.	end-user development	Tim Coughlan;Peter Johnson	2008	Int.

Journals were selected from the Journal Citation Report® from the category Agricultural Economics and Policy. Only research articles published between 2012 and 2016 were included in our analysis. We focused on the indicators concerning the share of board members publishing in their own journals, the share of articles authored by board members and on the share of board members’ articles published in their own journals and the citation response of their articles.

e0262a570aa7844fc243d8f5854f4735aea18cfd	the impact of gamification - recommending education scenarios	definition	Many students play (computer) games in their leisure time, thus acquiring skills which can easily be utilized when it comes to teaching more sophisticated knowledge. Nevertheless many educators today are wasting this opportunity. Some have evaluated gaming scenarios and methods for teaching students and have created the term “gamification”. This paper describes the history of this new term and explains the possible impact on teaching. It will take well-researched facts into consideration to discuss the potential of games. Moreover, scenarios will be illustrated and evaluated for educators to adopt and use on their own.	gamification	Kai Erenli	2013	iJET		simulation;definition;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-77.92559199254913	-38.27973957423888	7728

By our students' constant need for hardware/software repair and replacement, we were able to utilize the student technology fee in order to provide them with three repairs on personal laptops and desktops per semester free of charge. In addition, tablet and smartphone repairs are available for a flat fee of $50. By choosing the repair shop over local competitors, students have saved over $200,000 over the past 18 months. Due to promotion, successful repairs, and student feedback via social media, we noticed an increase in the demand of repairs over the past few years which has led us to improve our methods and increase efficiency internally. This paper intends to examine our repair shop from the beginning until now and inform other university-based help desks on the benefits of providing this service to their students.	align (company);desktop computer;effective method;flat rate;laptop;mobile device;smartphone;social media;tablet computer	Brandon Lindley;Andrew Turner	2015		10.1145/2815546.2815562	simulation;engineering;operations management;mechanical engineering	HCI	-69.80448106626835	-27.179904446960737	7730

Learning Analytics (LA) is a new assessment technology and should engage with this literature since it has implications for when and why different LA tools might be deployed. This paper discusses these issues, relating them to an example construct, epistemic beliefs -- beliefs about the nature of knowledge -- for which analytics grounded in pragmatic, sociocultural theory might be well placed to explore. This example is particularly interesting given the role of epistemic beliefs in the everyday knowledge judgements students make in their information processing. Traditional psychological approaches to measuring epistemic beliefs have parallels with high stakes testing regimes; this paper outlines an alternative LA for epistemic beliefs which might be readily applied to other areas of interest. Such sociocultural approaches afford opportunity for engaging LA directly in high quality pedagogy.	display resolution;information processing;parallels desktop for mac	Simon Knight;Simon Buckingham Shum;Karen Littleton	2013		10.1145/2460296.2460312	psychology;knowledge management;cultural analytics;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-67.12359343635595	-34.651519007766574	7755

Especially fast-growing economies in emerging countries contribute to this increase. Governments need to promote the expansion of renewable energies in these countries by providing adequate general conditions and suitable support schemes. We provide decision support for the assessment of wind energy projects and their financial conditions. Following design science research (DSR) principles, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model in combination with a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to consider project risks was created. On this basis, a decision support system (DSS) was implemented in MATLAB. The applicability of the DSS is evaluated in the course of an analysis of onshore wind projects in Mexico. Based on the analysis’ results, a concept of a support scheme is designed to promote an expansion of onshore wind energy across Mexico.	ansi escape code;artifact (software development);database;decision support system;design rule for camera file system;matlab;microsoft outlook for mac;monte carlo method;requirement;simulation	André Koukal;Jan-Hendrik Piel	2017				SE	-67.88543398082994	-2.081376473048599	7761

Although recent research findings indicate that learners differ with respect to the amount and type of discourse contributed in virtual settings, little is known about the underlying causes and its consequences explaining differences between participants' contributions to discourse. The present research investigates how motivational orientation of a learner influences the interaction patterns with other learners in a virtual network.#R##N##R##N#Our research among 100 participants in six virtual teams indicates that three sub-groups were formed within each virtual network. These subgroups were generated by a K-means cluster analysis of academic motivation measured by AMS. Extrinsically motivated learners prefer to connect to intrinsically motivated learners. Intrinsically motivated learners prefer to discuss mainly among themselves, implying that extrinsically motivated learners will receive less feedback and discourse possibilities from other members within the virtual network.	computer-mediated communication	Bart Rienties;Bas Giesbers;Dirk T.

Since NCAAB and professional (NBA) basketball have a number of differences, it is not clear to what degree these results can be transferred. We explore a number of different representations, training settings, and classifiers, and contrast their results on NCAAB and NBA data. We find that adjusted efficiencies work well for the NBA, that the NCAAB regular season is not ideal for training to predict its post-season, the two leagues require classifiers with different bias, and Näıve Bayes predicts the outcome of NBA playoff series well.	artificial neural network;best practice;book;closing (morphology);counterfactual conditional;decision boundary;emoticon;gba championship basketball: two-on-two;memory-level parallelism;naive bayes classifier;predictive modelling;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;test set;the times	Albrecht Zimmermann	2016	Statistical Analysis and Data Mining	10.1002/sam.11319	machine learning;naive bayes classifier;artificial intelligence;college athletics;computer science;basketball	ML	-76.36379913649837	-51.68412767666054	7791

This was taken to provide support for the notion that it is possible to provide shorter Flexilevel objective tests that are as efficacious as CBTs. Implications that this finding may have for the use of the Flexilevel Test in mobile learning contexts is discussed.

In response to that trend and to take advantage of digital delivery options while saving paper, printing, and distribution costs, IEEE Computer Society approved the move to digital as the primary delivery mechanism starting in 2015. This change is now re ected in our membership renewal forms, which list digital delivery as the default; the print issue is available only at a considerable additional cost. Also, through the new “Software and Systems” Computer Society membership option (www. computer.org/ portal /web/ membership/ Software -and-Systems-Join), you can get a digital subscription to Software (and 12 more Digital Library articles) without paying extra. Don’t let the two nonpaper versions of the magazines that the Computer Society now offers confuse you. The “digital” format, which is the complete magazine, is available to individual members through an app or as one PDF download. The “electronic” format, which consists of either the entire issue or individual articles in PDF format, is distributed through the Computer Society Digital (yes) Library. I understand that the app is available only to individual subscribers, not to members of institutions that subscribe to the Digital Library. I must admit that, initially, I was skeptical when I heard about the switch to digital. I love printed paper, and I have been slow to adjust to the brave new world of e-reading. I like looking at the books lining my bookshelves, I enjoy the speed with which I can ip a magazine’s pages, I value the serendipity brought by grazing printed material, and I have fond memories of browsing through library stacks. (In the past, when I visited a university, I made a point to spend some time in its library, photocopy articles, and look for new and interesting stuff. I can still remember the neatly bound, typewritten volumes of a USSR journal, which was translated into English at the height of the Cold War, that I once chanced upon at the University of British Columbia library.) Also, I nd it dif cult to read articles on my computer screen, and I can’t stop worrying I might one day lose digital access to the material I enjoy. However, what happens in practice differs a lot from the romanticized picture I’ve presented. My desk is literally crumpling under the load of three stacks of partly read magaFROM THE EDITOR	book;columbia (supercomputer);computer monitor;digital data;digital distribution;digital library;download;membership software;photocopier;portable document format;printing;world wide web	Diomidis Spinellis	2015	IEEE Software	10.1109/MS.2015.5	computing;computer science;engineering;software engineering;software peer review	OS	-63.766763663279214	-23.585549847960266	7917

The conceptual model is based on three important theories of adoption at the firm level (i.e., technology-organization-environment TOE framework, diffusion of innovation DOI theory, and institutional INT theory). Data collected from 265 firms are used to test the conceptual model. Nine determinants are found to be statistically significant. By examining direct and total (direct and indirect) effects of the determinants, the study offers rich insight into the firm's decision to adopt and routinize SaaS.

Usually, access management is conducted using a choice architecture, a behavioral economics concept that describes the way decisions are framed to users. Studies have consistently shown that the design of choice architectures, mainly the selection of default options, has a strong effect on the final decisions users make by nudging them toward certain behaviors. In this article, we propose a method for optimizing access control choice architectures in online social networks. We empirically evaluate the methodology on Facebook, the world's largest online social network, by measuring how well the default options cover the existing user choices and preferences and toward which outcome the choice architecture nudges users. The evaluation includes two parts: (a) collecting access control decisions made by 266 users of Facebook for a period of 3 months; and (b) surveying 533 participants who were asked to express their preferences regarding default options. We demonstrate how optimal defaults can be algorithmically identified from users’ decisions and preferences, and we measure how existing defaults address users’ preferences compared with the optimal ones. We analyze how access control defaults can better serve existing users, and we discuss how our method can be used to establish a common measuring tool when examining the effects of default options.	access control;algorithm;apevia;computer;emoticon;nudge (instant messaging);openness;optimizing compiler;social network	Ron Hirschprung;Eran Toch;Hadas Schwartz-Chassidim;Tamir Mendel;Oded Maimon	2017	ACM TIST	10.1145/3046676	data mining;access control;nudge theory;access management;default;behavioral economics;social network;computer science;choice architecture	Security	-89.94027371337519	-15.01435251076491	7947

The use of Competency based Education as pedagogical model has developed the ITS based on Competences (ITS-C). The architecture of an ITS-C uses a modular structure that optimizes the computational requirements for its implementation. Such modular architecture facilitates its use with ubiquitous devices. Therefore ITS-C or several of its processes may be ubiquitously offered to teachers and students. In this contribution a mobile app for adaptive test in ITS-C is introduced.	artificial intelligence;cat state;computation;domain model;mobile app;mobile operating system;modular programming;requirement;smartphone	Miguel Badaracco;Jun Liu;Luis Martínez-López	2013		10.3233/978-1-61499-286-8-419	computerized adaptive testing;knowledge management;intelligent tutoring system;competence (human resources);computer science	AI	-80.22862262684683	-45.126795131186185	7957

That means you must synthesize information and make decisions such as “Which benefits plan to use?” “What do the regulations say about this course of action?” “How does my job fit into the corporate business plan?” “What should I be careful about when I approach this client?” or even “HOW does this program work?” If the dream of digital libraries is to bring you all material relevant to your task, you may find yourself drowning before long. Reading is harder than talking to people who know the relevant documents and can tell you what you’re interested in. That is what many current knowledge workers do, giving rise to professions such as insurance consultant, lawyer, benefits specialist, and so on. Imagine by contrast that the documents you retrieve could be tailored precisely to your needs. That is, imagine that the document might ask you questions and produce a document filtered and organized according to those you have answered. To choose a concrete example, suppose you are interested in social security. Instead of reading the law or the 200 page Mercer Guide to Social Security to figure out your benefits, you answer the 30 or so questions necessary to determine your benefits (incomes, marital status, ages of kids, etc.), and then receive as output a four page document that is the law as if it were written for you. If you could avoid reading long complicated documents in favor of short ones tailored to your situation, which would you choose? We have been developing software to achieve such tailoring. We call it Thinksheet. Thinksheet documents currently must be created by hand. A very careful reader has to understand the document(s) thoroughly and then program the rules into a thinksheet to generate the tailored document.

Beginning with the initial web pages (1994) via the building of cooperative server structures (1995) and the introduction of interactive lecture halls and seminar rooms (1996) the way continues via the development of high-quality multimedia building blocks (1997) and the administration of distributed multimedia scripts (1998) to learner centered distributed knowledge environments (1999). In the meantime, a media concept with three supporting columns becomes discernible: Learning supportive infrastructures, educational multimedia modules and distributed knowledge organization. These rest on a theoretical foundation that underlines the utilization of media artifacts (thinking tools) in a social connection as a core sector for the use of media in the course of teaching and learning.

The compliance function is now an integral part of corporate policy and practice. This paper presents the findings from a longitudinal qualitative research study on the introduction of an IT-based investment management system at four client sites.

This paper presents a pedagogical proposal, based on constructivist ideas, as a means of making the process of learning OS more efficient and interesting. The framework presented here uses the SOsim graphical simulator as a support tool, creating a teaching and learning environment in which practical experiments can be undertaken as each OS topic is introduced and explained.	electronic circuit simulation;experiment;graphical user interface;operating system	Luiz Paulo Maia;Francis Berenger Machado;Ageu C.

There appears to be sufficient (yet rather partial) supply but insufficient demand. In the post dotcom era suppliers tend to look more critically at actual demand and balance their investments with perceived benefits. Decisions to invest in cross-border electronic services are based on the relative number of foreign customers. Due to the relative low number of foreign visitors public organizations put low priority to cross-border services, unless they have specific mandates.

When institutional boundaries are increasingly blurred in a Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government relations, criteria for quality control in the production of scientific knowledge can be expected to change at the interfaces. The categorization in terms of two modes of knowledge production was introduced by Gibbons et al. (1994) in order to describe changes in the networks of scientific communications (funding patterns, research configurations, styles of knowledge management, etc.). These changes were mainly specified as institutional parameters in order to deal with the subjects of R&D management and S&T policies, that is, ex ante (Spiegel-R ing 1973; Van den Daele et al. 1979). We focus on the """"validation boundaries"""" emerging from the differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2; that is, on the criteria for quality control that can analytically and reflexively be brought to the fore ex post. The shift from an institutional frame of reference to a focus on the dynamics of communications enables us to clarify several problems in the discussion of the future of university research."""	categorization;knowledge management	Yuko Fujigaki;Loet Leydesdorff	2003	CoRR		quality control;digital library;epistemology;methodology;mode 2;sociology;triple helix;law;boundary;government	AI	-75.1813869959029	-17.339530133200853	8076

7d7b562b20328403c5e44b006de5d1490a41e4e0	business intelligence in online customer textual reviews: understanding consumer perceptions and influential factors		With the rapid development of information technology, customers not only shop online—they also post reviews on social media. This user-generated content (UGC) can be useful to understand customers’ shopping experiences and influence future customers’ purchase intentions. Therefore, business intelligence and analytics are increasingly being advocated as a way to analyze customers’ UGC in social media and support firms’ marketing activities. However, because of its open structure, UGC such as customer reviews can be difficult to analyze, and firms find it challenging to harness UGC. To fill this gap, this study aims to examine customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward attributes of hotel products and services based on online customer textual reviews. Using a text mining approach, latent semantic analysis (LSA), we identify the key attributes driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward hotel products and service attributes. Additionally, using a regression approach, we examine the effects of travel purposes, hotel types, star level, and editor recommendations on customers’ perceptions of attributes of hotel products and services. This study bridges customer online textual reviews with customers’ perceptions to help business managers better understand customers’ needs through UGC.	latent semantic analysis;social media;text mining;user-generated content	Xun Xu;Xuequn Wang;Yibai Li;Mohammad Haghighi	2017	Int J.

An important goal of this study was not only to measure increased retention, but to provide insight into why retention increased or decreased. The results of the study showed that retention significantly increased for those students already majoring in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer Engineering. In addition, survey results indicated that the students viewed many aspects of pair programming to be very beneficial to their learning experience.	computer engineering;computer science;pair programming;software engineering	Jeffrey C.

It has been accepted for inclusion in Communications of the Association for Information Systems by an authorized administrator of AIS Electronic Library (AISeL). For more information, please contact elibrary@aisnet.org. Unlike technology users in business organizations, users of personal information technologies are usually not bound to specific products and have the freedom to switch from one product to a substitute. As a unique and widespread product level post-adoption behavior, IT user switching has not garnered sufficient attention in the current literature. Prior research has suggested that a consumer's decision to switch follows careful reasoning on three distinct groups of factors: push, pull, and mooring. Given the highly routinized nature of post-adoption IT use, we draw from research on habit in social psychology and post-adoption user behavior literatures, and argue that users' habit plays a critical role in post-adoption IT switching. Specifically, we posit that the habit of using the incumbent product both contributes to the mooring effects during the formation of intention to switch, and moderates the relationship between intention and switching. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 414 users presented with a choice of switching their Web browsers. Our findings confirm the direct influence of potential switchers' habit on switching intention, and the interaction between habit and switching intention on switching. Our overall model explains 55 percent of total variance in users' intention to switch and 23 percent of total variance in user switching. This study advances the theoretical and empirical understanding of post-adoption technology switching, valuable to both researchers and practitioners.	association for information systems;authorization;digital library;personally identifiable information	Chen Ye;Richard Potter	2011	CAIS		simulation;habit;engineering;marketing;advertising;management;social psychology;computer security	HCI	-88.18515305801314	-11.904376566833369	8401

However, it remains to be shown how the effect of risk perception on intention to purchase online differs across gender or across categories of products being purchased. More importantly, it is important to understand whether gender and product category, together, have a moderating role in influencing the relationship between perceived risk and intention to purchase. In this paper, the role of gender and product category, in moderating the impact of perceived risk on intention to purchase, is examined. Analysis from a survey of 183 respondents, based on their interaction with two specific websites, reveals that gender, by itself, does not directly impact the relationship between perceived risk and intention to purchase, indicating the levelling off of the online gender gap. However, the gender effect manifests itself when analysed in association with product category, indicating that males and females do differ in their risk perception based on the category of product being purchased. We provide the implications of this finding for theory and research on internet.	online shopping	Shivraj Kanungo;Vikas Jain	2012	IJBIS	10.1504/IJBIS.2012.047147	public relations;the internet;product category;marketing;product;management information systems;risk perception;advertising;higher education	NLP	-89.4947125697038	-11.510089361091218	8436

The purpose of this report is to review the submission policies of major academic journals in the field of radiology and assess current editorial practices relating to electronic submission of academic works. The authors surveyed 16 radiologic journals that are indexed in the Index Medicus and available in our medical center library. They compared the manuscript submission policies of these journals as outlined in recent issues of the journals and the corresponding worldwide web sites. The authors compared the journals on the following criteria: web site access to instructions; electronic submission of text, both with regard to initial submission and final submission of the approved document; text hardcopy requirements; word processing software restrictions; electronic submission of figures, figure hardcopy requirements; figure file format restrictions; and electronic submission media. Although the trend seems to be toward electronic submission, there currently is no clear-cut standard of practice. Because all of the journals that accept electronic documents also require a hardcopy, many of the advantages gained through electronic submission are nullified. In addition, many publishers only utilize electronic documents after a manuscript has been accepted, thus utilizing the benefits of digital information in the printing process but not in the actual submission and peer-review process.	compiler;computer;dicom;digital data;editorial;gain;index medicus;journal;manuscripts;policy;printing;radiology;regulatory submission;requirement;web site;world wide web;benefit;nullified - managedparticipationstatus	Michael M.

A black swan is an unexpected event that emerges from reality and alters the reality itself. MOOCs have affected supply and demand in higher education. MOOCs distribute knowledge, classes on many areas of expertise for free. Millions of users, from all over the world are enrolling MOOCs courses. Universities are sharing resources and knowledge in the Internet no matter who or why. This paradigm shift has an impact on people's life. So, how can universities survive if they are giving knowledge for free? This paper presents a literature review on MOOCs.

Specifically, this paper uses the decision support system GMCR II to analyse the strategic aspects of a multi-participant nuclear critical infrastructure conflict involving the governments of Turkey and Canada, in addition to environmental parties. Critical infrastructure risks and vulnerabilities are among the most important and controversial issues in this conflict. It is shown that conflict resolution tools are appropriate for use in critical infrastructure negotiation problems.	critical infrastructure protection;decision support system;digital multiplex system	Kevin W.

Why Indian Female CS Representation Is Different I hope Roli Varma's and Deepak Ka-pur's article """" Decoding Femininity in Computer Science in India """" (May 2015) opens a wider discussion on women's participation in CS education and career development, which is generally U.S.-centric. As someone who has worked in the IT industry, been involved in campus recruitment, taught CS undergrads, and counts many relatives pursuing the CS discipline, I would say underrepresentation of women in CS is nation-and society-specific, and certainly not universal. Since 2000, the Indian software industry has grown significantly, and the local need for CS professionals is strong. Large companies (such as In-fosys, TCS, and Wipro) continue to recruit thousands at the entry level. Other sectors of the Indian economy are nowhere near in terms of job opportunities for fresh graduates. At the same time, opportunities for studying medicine, a traditional goal for high-achieving female students in India, remains restricted and costly. Female students who achieve academically at the high school level thus increasingly opt for CS undergraduate programs. Most Indian families do not know what constitutes a CS or IT job but assume it pays well and takes place at a desk in a nice environment and IT professionals get to travel overseas, thus influencing university students' options in case they choose engineering.

While current cloud computing service development focuses on adoption by enterprises and organizations, individual endusers who use cloud services in their everyday lives also constitute an important consumer group. Challenges of trust in cloud computing have gained social and scholarly attention accompanied with the rise of privacy and data security concerns. Studies that investigate individual endusers’ views of trust in cloud services, however, are rare. Using semi-structured interviews and a survey questionnaire, the present study aims to capture how ordinary individuals think about cloud computing and how they form their trust/distrust of cloud services and service providers. In this poster, authors present preliminary results of analysis of interview data.	cloud computing;data security;distrust;privacy;semiconductor industry	Sarah Kim;Ayoung Yoon	2012		10.1002/meet.14504901267	cloud computing security;services computing;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-80.63243912897168	-11.239719778435397	8568

With some exceptions, most computer science majors at the author's university prefer material which is oriented towards what they view as practical applications. At best, they tolerate the theoretical component of their courses. In particular, many who enroll in the database course hope to acquire expertise in particular software.

Despite the profusion of online communities, the abundance of individuals and content do not necessarily lead the community to success. Individual communities commonly face issues related to attracting and maintaining members, a key resource of online communities. The primary focus of this dissertation is to compliment and further develop what we currently understand about participation in online communities, and subsequently its members, diversity, and inter-workings. One key to this is to more fully understand the ways in which individuals can behave within an online community. Towards this end, one goal of this dissertation is to move the view of community participation beyond the generally utilized “frequency of contribution” conceptualization to a broader one that accounts for various types of community behaviors that need to be performed by a community’s member (e.g. community citizenship behavior, audience engagement, and content contribution). With this in mind, this dissertation will adapt three theoretical perspectives that offer complimentary perspectives of the dynamics of community participation: participation as an individual-community relationship (commitment), participation as media use (communication), and participation as social ties (connection).	conceptualization (information science);mind;online community	Patrick J.

ac3cc9f2600d3ccd5643275bad215e6d7d23dbd2	the effects of gender differences on the use of annotatable multimedia e-readers	digital documents;multimedia;electronic books	Purpose – This paper aims to examine how gender differences influence students’ reactions to the use of the annotatable multimedia e-reader (AME). To reach this aim, we develop an AME where various annotation tools are provided to help students learn English in-class and after-class. Design/methodology/approach – An empirical study was conducted with 63 fifth-grade students from an elementary school. A pre-test and post-test were used to identify their prior knowledge and learning achievement, respectively. A questionnaire was applied to identify participants’ perceptions towards the AME. Findings – The results show that students’ post-test scores are significantly related to after-class behaviour, instead of in-class behaviour. Females prefer to use the text annotation and teachers’ voice, but it is voice annotation that is beneficial to improve their learning achievement. Conversely, males prefer to use the text-to-speech only, but it is text annotation that is helpful to improve their learning achievement. Additionally, the ease of use affects males’ intention to use the AME to learn English after-class while it has no effects on females. Originality/value – This study not only shows the importance of gender differences but also demonstrates the essence of after-class learning behaviour. More importantly, a framework is proposed to support designers to develop e-readers that can accommodate the preferences of females and males.	cognitive tutor;division algorithm;e-reader;el-fish;external validity;human factors and ergonomics;library (computing);nl (complexity);personalization;requirement;speech synthesis;usability	Yi-Fan Liu;Wu-Yuin Hwang;Sherry Y.

The broadly used term “e-Health” regularly implicates the use of ICT in health products, services to improve health of citizens, efficiency and productivity in healthcare delivery, and the economic and social value of health, in general. In this end, the LiveCity Project aims at empowering the citizens of a city to interact with each other in a more productive, efficient and socially useful way, by using high quality video-to-video (v2v) over the Internet. In this work, the LiveCity platform for e-Health is presented, along with two use cases for remote patients telemonitoring and emergency cases.

This paper reports on the preliminary findings of a qualitative study investigating the perceptions of Greek academic librarians on the impact of Google and ‘Googling’ on their role as information providers in the digital era. To address the needs of this study a set of semi structured interviews was employed with library managers and librarians. The findings of this study revealed that Greek academic librarians use mainly Google Search for its easy information provision but advise on adequate training on Google sources evaluation before use. It was suggested that libraries need to support life-long learning, and enhance their services quality in order to survive. Additionally, IT and managerial skills acquisition seems to be vital. Research also revealed the essential role of LIS departments in the provision of life-long learning and the organisation of training programmes.	librarian	Emmanouel Garoufallou;Panos Balatsoukas;Rania Siatri;Georgia Zafeiriou;Stella Asderi;Panagiota Ekizoglou	2008	Education for Information		library science;public relations;medicine;knowledge management	NLP	-83.1479399004515	-19.9355063591652	8666

Design/methodology/approach – Written answers to the question “What is Library 2.0?” given by practitioners and researchers (n 1⁄4 29) interested in Library 2.0 issues were analyzed by using co-word analysis to map the underlying elements of the concept. Findings – The study resulted in a model of Library 2.0, containing seven building-blocks of the phenomenon: interactivity, users, participation, libraries and library services, web and web 2.0, social aspects, and technology and tools. Research limitations/implications – The model provides a basis for framing Library 2.0 as a research object and to map central themes of future research. Practical implications – A comprehensive model enables both researchers and practitioners to frame the phenomenon more clearly, evaluate existing and planned services and their proximity to what is Library 2.0. Originality/value – Unlike earlier proposals for a definition of the notion Library 2.0, the present study presents an empirical and consensual crowd-sourcing approach of defining the concept Library 2.0 and provides basis for discussing the future evolution of the notion and its implications for library and information science research and library practices.	crowdsourcing;framing (world wide web);interactivity;library (computing);library and information science;web 2.0	Kim Holmberg;Isto Huvila;Maria Kronqvist-Berg;Gunilla Widén	2009	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220410910970294	library science;the internet;computer science;multimedia;law;world wide web;electronic media	HCI	-77.07875149930716	-17.011440988268948	8701

Looking back, i see a set of activities that has played a significant role on my path to CEr, now my main research area. these include learning pedagogical knowledge, adopting learning technologies, moving from computing education development to computing education research and starting to supervise doctoral projects in CEr. Each phase has introduced new challenges. i graduated as MSc in technology from helsinki university of technology in 1985 with software technology as my major. at that time i thought that my career would involve a great deal of programming, program design, and projects. i had never thought about working as a teacher, until my supervising professor one day asked, whether i would be willing to give an introductory programming course. i gave it some thought, and agreed. Why not try it? it could be interesting. What i did not think (enough) and he wisely did not remind me was that introductory programming classes in my institute are large. So it was quite an experience to give my first lecture ever, when 800 students try to pack into a lecture hall with less than 600 seats. of course, as a young graduate i was more worried that i might make mistakes with the content and reveal that i did not know something than how students would receive my lectures. i solved the problem by reading my slides, which were dense with text. Well, the number of students attending the lectures decreased fast. and the course feedback could be summarized as """" Kick him out! """" this was definitely not an ideal start, but probably it reflects a not so rare experience of how university teachers are recruited in many institutes. Luckily, i was given another chance and someone suggested that i take some pedagogical courses available for the staff. that was, indeed, good advice. i learned interesting things about surface and deep learning, motivation, orientation frameworks, inter-nalization, externalization, and evaluation, most of which i had never encountered during my master's studies. …"""	deep learning;gene regulatory network;pedagogical agent	Lauri Malmi	2013	Inroads	10.1145/2505990.2505997	computational science;computer science;data science;data mining	HCI	-78.70713622634118	-30.354598788101885	8734

It is usually necessary to monitor on-line forums to ensure that conversations and content are appropriate. Disturbing trends are starting to emerge, including cyberbullying, cyber threats, on-line harassment, hate speech, and abuse — referred to collectively as ‘toxicity’. Researchers have already started investigating automatic and semi-automatic monitoring of social networking sites for aspects of toxicity. We are investigating the relationship between on-line toxicity and forum health. Specifically, we provide results of the evaluation of the impact of toxicity on community health as a function of its size, while correcting for community topic.

The focus is on how ubiquitous technologies have been and can be utilised in developing urban infrastructure, including town planning, street and property maintenance, water supply, public transportation and environmental protection. Such an emerging infrastructure is expected to provide everyone with an opportunity to access urban infrastructure and services with the help of ubiquitous technologies. However, in order to become reality, this requires some kind of democratisation of technology, which is a neglected topic in u-city discourse. It is also important to analyse u-city developments from the point of view of production of space with special reference to the potential colonisation of everyday life. Theoretically speaking, one answer to such compelling questions about the rationale of u-city development can be sought from the idea of the ‘right to the city’, a slogan originally coined by Henri Lefebvre. This approach highlights the importance of involving people to envisioning the future of urban form starting from the perspective of their everyday life. Such a dimension should be given more prominent role in current u-city developments.	amiga reflections;design rationale;smart city	Ari-Veikko Anttiroiko	2013	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/s00146-013-0443-5	socioeconomics	HCI	-77.85229826785636	-9.167466618302056	8870

We focus discussion on CAP II (a program that schedules meetings by negotiation via email), and on RAP (a program that makes room reservation via email)."""	automation;dbl-browser;email;knowledge acquisition;programmer;rapid refresh;whole earth 'lectronic link;dialog	Siegfried Bocionek;Tom M.

16b1ad4928b8f450fda92818cd96c93ee7261031	a new interactive computer science textbook in slovenia		Informatics is only a mandatory course in the first year and elective in the remaining three years in Slovene general secondary schools (grades 9–12). The course curriculum lists 100 learning objectives for all four years, but it does not specify the ones for the first (mandatory) year. Although this gives Computer Science teachers the freedom to choose the topics to be covered, they usually choose the ones covering digital literacy. One of the reasons is that this is the most important topic in the eighteen-year-old textbook that is currently used to teach Computer Science. In this paper we discuss a new interactive textbook that was introduced and the areas of knowledge it covers. We also discuss e-textbooks as a technology in general and give some feedback from teachers after the first year of using the new textbook.	computer science;interactivity	Natasa Mori;Matija Lokar	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46747-4_14	mathematics education;computer science;media studies;multimedia	Theory	-80.4834492366702	-35.38343574351494	8889

The success of these initiatives is dependent on government support as well as citizens’ adoption of e-government services. This research identified the attitudes and perceptions of the citizens of Kuwait, a developing country, towards the adoption of e-government services. Based on previous research exploring the determinants of the adoption of e-government services using an amended version of the UTAUT model, the study reported here investigates the factors that influence the take-up of such services. These factors are related to usefulness, ease of use, reforming bureaucracy, cultural and social influences, technology issues and lack of awareness. Conclusions and implication for decision makers are also considered in this paper.	bureaucracy;computer;e-government;e-services;internet access;usability	Suha AlAwadhi;Anne Morris	2009	JSW		attitude;decision-making;service;index term;e-government;usability;developing country;social influence;computer science;knowledge management;perception	HCI	-87.99002336498178	-8.264734811879674	8899

The data is gathered from 21 interviews accomplished during spring 2007 among participants of the Interoperability Programme. The interviewees represent different sectors and levels of the Finnish government and IT companies. On the basis of a qualitative data analysis we discuss the notions that different actors connect to EA work. The key conclusions are that the ongoing EA work is seen as technically oriented and more emphasis should be put to activities and contents. On the basis of the data, it seems easier to develop government EA and interoperability on the level of state administration and ministries than in the agency level.	enterprise architecture;information system;interoperability	Juris Hartmanis;Takeo Kanade	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15172-9	informatics;information system	HCI	-73.91356863162905	-4.54488895341703	8966
b93daf4805f8252e10c3cfd1d7cd64015fa6d834	development of knowledge profiles for international ehealth elearning courses		Professionals working in the multidisciplinary field of eHealth vary in their educational background. However, knowledge in the areas of medicine, engineering and management is required to fulfil the tasks associated with eHealth sufficiently. Based on the results of an analysis of national and international educational offers a survey gathering user requirements for the development of knowledge profiles in eHealth was conducted (n=75) by professionals and students. During a workshop the first results were presented and discussed together with the network partners and the attendees. The resulting knowledge profiles contain knowledge areas of all three thematic content categories including fundamentals of medical terminology, standards and interoperability and usability as well as basics of all three content categories. The knowledge profiles are currently applied in a master's degree programme at the UAS Technikum Wien and will be developed further.	categories;interoperability;master's degree;nomenclature;requirement;usb attached scsi;usability;user requirements document;standards characteristics	Juliane Herzog;Stefan Sauermann;Alexander Mense;Mathias Forjan;Philipp Urbauer	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-512-8-556	medical terminology;knowledge management;ehealth;multidisciplinary approach;usability;interoperability;user requirements document;medicine	Web+IR	-71.36891246975654	-28.464233396043344	8971

This study must address how they use information across the extended enterprise from suppliers to customers. Second, it aims to suggest a simple competitive audit matrix (CAM) that can be used to structure this analysis.Design/methodology/approach – The argument that a formal analysis is necessary to minimize the risk of disappointing ERP results is developed from the literature, and the CAM is adapted from a model presented in the “competitive analysis of the firm” literature. Because, inside data are usually not available, the model is designed to rely on publicly accessible data.Findings – While there are considerable challenges in undertaking a competitive IT analysis, the use of a case study, 7‐Eleven Japan, suggests that there is much to be learned by following a structured approach at ...	competitive analysis (online algorithm);enterprise integration	Warren Briggs;Barry Shore	2007	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635570710816676	organizational structure;supply chain management;economics;systems engineering;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;information management;management	DB	-77.60458786570786	3.885917330305995	8983

In this qualitative study, we examine the problem-solving dynamics of two dyads: a Productive Failure (PF) dyad who initially received a low-structured activity and a Non-Productive Failure (N-PF) dyad who initially received a high-structured activity. Both dyads then received an identical high-structured problem-solving activity. This process was repeated using multiple sets of problems, and this paper will discuss two sets. Interactions of the two dyads were logged. Data for this study included video conversations of the dyads, screen captures of their use of a computer model, and their submitted answers. Results indicated that initial struggle and failed attempts provided an opportunity to the PF dyad to expand their observation space and thus engage deeply with the computer model. Over-scripting proved to be detrimental in creation of a mutual meaning-making space for the N-PF dyad. This paper suggests that the relative success of the PF dyad might be viewed in terms of induction of reflective reasoning practices.		Suneeta Pathak;Beaumie Kim;Michael J.

Results show media use predicts political self efficacy, or respondent reported ability to cope with the political system. First, increases in exposure to informational media presentations, such as newspapers, or national television news programs, correspond to increases in self efficacy, especially for African-Americans. Second, self efficacy decreases with increases in exposure to entertainment television programs, also especially for African-Americans. These relationships remain robust even when the effects of educational level are taken into account. An unexpected finding concerned marked increases in self efficacy in association with listening to political call-in programs. Taking into account the interactive nature of this program genre may be especially important in any discussion of innovations in information technology and user efficacy. © 1994 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.

3fb13e245b9e477ace3108bdec345d7daf91f8aa	a decade of international conference on theory and practice of electronic governance		"""From 2007 until 2017, ten editions of the ICEGOV conference have been held in ten cities, in ten countries and economies, across four continents. A total of 1841 papers have been submitted, a yearly average of 90 submitted papers (58%) have been accepted.  This ongoing experience paper gives a brief overview of the major trends of all past ICEGOV editions, based on keywords sets and other information. As expected, initial findings show a consistent dominance of keywords at the core of ICEGOV including """"e-government"""" and """"e-governance"""". The paper highlights that others have emerged over time, including new phenomena, such as """"social media"""" in 2010, """"open government"""" after 2011, and """"open data"""" or """"open government data"""" from 2012.  To better portray the transition of the relative importance of each keyword, a key research index (KRI) inspired by Kwon & Kwon (2017) is employed. The KRI identifies neither a particular grand theme dominating the discussion nor a transition of particular keywords towards a central theme. By contrast, the KRI shows that specific themes have dominated research in particular geographic regions, e.g. """"e-democracy"""" in Europe, """"interoperability"""" in North America, """"information sharing"""" in Europe and Asia, and """"public administration"""" in Africa and South America."""	e-governance;e-government;interoperability;russian game developers conference;social media;theme (computing)	Nuno Ramos Carvalho;Morten Meyerhoff Nielsen;Ibrahim Kholilul Rohman	2018		10.1145/3209415.3209484	open government;public relations;open data;e-governance;interoperability;computer science;information sharing;social media;information and communications technology;corporate governance	DB	-66.87068543096417	-12.654566108383742	9012

Rather, the digital inclusion of women is facilitated by both the individual's socio-demographic context (age, education and experience) and the citizenship status of her local community in ethnic and religious terms as well as its proximity to the capital. The study compares ICT access and usage among men and women in the ICT telecentres of purposively chosen villages. Field observations were conducted in the first village (Kapasia, Gazipur, Dhaka Division) from June to July 2014 and in the second village (Sharsha, Jessore, Khulna Division) from August to September 2014. Twenty men and women from each village were interviewed in-depth along with opinion and political leaders. Data analysis and interpretation are still ongoing.	telecentre	Jude William Genilo;Marium Akther;Monami Haque	2015		10.1145/2737856.2737857	development economics;economic growth	HCI	-77.99239851182244	-10.55257394316313	9043

In the present study, we investigated the impact of the implementation and use of computers in the public school system, from the elementary grades to high school, in Niterói city, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). This city, with a total population of approximately 500,000, was chosen for this study based on the claim it offers the best educational project in Brazil, and on the fact that it is ranked as the first city in terms of digital inclusion in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the second one in all Brazil, according to IBGE – Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography (Census 2000). This is a rather significant standings and represents an important qualitative and quantitative feature in comparison to other Brazilian municipalities and even to the experience in other countries. In our survey, we found that 82% of the municipal elementary schools (from the 1st to 4th grades, equivalent to the elementary school system in the US, and to the first phase of secondary education in France, and 32% of the state schools, including secondary school (high school system in the US, and the 2nd phase of secondary education in France) have computer laboratories. Difficulties were observed, such as the adequacy of teachers’ training and continuing education, computer laboratory schedule, number of computers available, and equipment maintenance. In this context, this work is useful for the establishment of policies of implementation and use of this technology in Brazil, since as yet there is no established world policy, despite UNESCO initiatives. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1c2906c5010fe0c83007e2af89b82baa7812d7e7	ict and human rights in brazil: the invisible dictatorship of electronic surveillance		"""Since the end of military government in Brazil, civilian governments have sought the accumulation and exercise of power to the detriment of the citizenry. Since the 1990s they have started to implement information technology in the public sector to regulate and run the country in a command-and-control way through technological or bureaucratic dictatorship rather than democratic process. While it is evident that there is a high level of investment in information technology in the public sector (e-government) in Brazil, there are also clear signs of the violation of human rights in terms of privacy. It is alleged that thousands of individual files have been accessed in the public administration, despite the privacy protection offered by the national constitution. This paper shows how information technology (e-government) in Brazil could lead to violations of human rights, including invisible electronic surveillance that affects civil liberties and individual rights.

Besides, how do we make the connection between new assumptions of ICT and human rights and the historical context of each country with regard to its democratic regime? How do we make the connection between the historical context of each country and the agenda of international organizations? Is ICT improving or reducing human rights? By challenging the dominant and mainstream assumptions of ICT, human rights can be examined as the most powerful instrument for human emancipation and participation to improve the condition of people’s lives. Despite the potential of ICT to strengthen human rights, it seems that it is not improving human rights in Brazil as expected. Since the end of military government in Brazil, civilian governments have sought the accumulation and exercise of power to the detriment of the citizenry with a kind of totalitarianism that takes the form of digital or bureaucratic dictatorship. The same critique made of the US government (Gingrich, 2009) seems to be applied to the Brazilian government when the desire for power led the executive branch of the government to mobilize the National Congress to change the national Constitution late in the 1990s and to allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election. By creating a kind of imperial executive branch of government, the National Congress seems to be nullified and no longer serves its purpose of representing the Brazilian people. It was with this kind of totalitarian arrogance that information technology started to be implemented in the public sector to regulate and run the country in a command-and-control way by a technological and bureaucratic dictatorship rather than by democratic process (Gingrich, 2009). While it is evident that there has been a high level of investment in information technology in the public sector (e-government) in Brazil, there are clear signs of violation of human rights in terms of privacy when the public administration exercises the power to engage in a process of electronic surveillance without court-issued warrants. According to the Brazilian press thousands of individual files have been accessed in the public administration in Brazil, despite the privacy protection offered by the national Constitution. In addition, there is a proliferation of biometric identification using faces, eyes, fingerprints and other body parts, especially in the e-voting system. A political scandal arose recently, in the 2010 presidential election, over the alleged creation of a dossier against the daughter of a candidate running for the presidency and members of his political party, who were under covert surveillance. This scandal, named “Receitagate” in reference to the American Watergate case, is described in a later section. In the media/political scandal in Brazil, reported by the Brazilian press (Lima, 2010), it became clear how information technology in the public administration may simply endanger the lives of the population as a whole. In this article an attempt will be made to show how information technology (e-government) in Brazil is violating human rights, especially in terms of the proliferation of biometric identification in the e-voting system, and other sorts of invisible electronic surveillance that is affecting civil liberties and individual rights, including privacy. ICT, Development, and Human Rights If initiatives in information and communication technology for development (ICTD/ICT4D) do not have regard for human rights and basic human needs, there will be a tendency towards a widening of the inequality gap within and between countries, considering that up to now it is unclear what benefits will accrue to less developed countries (LDCs) from these technologies. Along with many other works in this field, I have found the absence of empirical evidence makes it hard to examine the connection between ICT, human rights and socio-economic development, and the utility of ICT in development projects, especially in LDCs where ICT is very much in the hands of the private sector. 11 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/ict-human-rightsbrazil/65756?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

We report on the development and validation of instruments for Internet technical literacy and social awareness. Individual’s privacy concerns are then considered with respect to these two constructs. The relationships are measured and explored through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) followed by linear regression models. We found that all the hypothesized relationships are statistically significant social awareness positively and Internet technical literacy negatively related to the Internet privacy concerns. The contribution of this research is in the attempt to explore psychological antecedents to privacy concerns that could direct IS managers and e-commerce marketers towards strategies of broadening Internet user base and facilitating the interaction and usage of Internet web sites and applications, thus opening more opportunities for growth and competitive advantage.	e-commerce;exploratory factor analysis;exploratory testing;internet privacy	Tamara Dinev;Paul J.

This is an emerging phenomenon and a common form of work structure adopted also in the banking industry. Starting from the theoretical perspective, this work focuses on knowledge as an important factor in the modern economy of hyper-competition, needed not just to win, but also to play. In fact, the structure of economy has shifted from a product-based strategy to a knowledge-based business. Among numerous definitions of knowledge proposed in the literature, we share the hermeneutical one. Successively, this paper studies network phenomenon as a form of collaborative work based on communication and collaboration. We aim to demonstrate why network structure best allows knowledge sharing practices inside a firm. Finally, we propose a study on sixty banks, realized using structured and unstructured questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires try to analyse two main changing dimensions related to knowledge networks implementation: the organizational one and the technological one. We observe that a change toward a knowledge sharing culture and perspective is just in the early stage. Moreover, analysing the empirical results reached examining the sample, we demonstrate that banking industry can face many barriers to knowledge sharing practice through networks.	knowledge-based systems;participatory culture	Vanessa Gemmo;Federico Rajola;Alessia Santuccio	2005			empirical research;knowledge management;knowledge economy;knowledge base;management science;knowledge sharing;personal knowledge management;organizational learning;knowledge value chain;computer science;phenomenon	AI	-78.01521271300842	2.5924909892911567	9135
647ea31ed3b27a4554597cbc55fb5e4184d30c4e	studying muslim stereotyping through microportrait extraction		Research from communication science has shown that stereotypical ideas are often reflected in language use. Media coverage of different groups in society influences the perception people have about these groups and even increases distrust and polarization among different groups. Investigating the forms of (especially subtle) stereotyping can raise awareness to journalists and help prevent reinforcing oppositions between groups in society. Conducting large-scale, deep investigations to determine whether we are faced with stereotyping is time-consuming and costly. We propose to tackle this challenges through the means of microportraits: an impression of a target group or individual conveyed in a single text. We introduce the first system implementation for Dutch and show that microportraits allow social scientists to explore various dimensions of stereotyping. We explore the possibilities provided by microportraits by investigating stereotyping of Muslims in the Dutch media. Our (preliminary) results show that microportraits provide more detailed insights into stereotyping compared to more basic models such as word clouds.	distrust;polarization (waves);stereotype (uml);tag cloud	Antske Fokkens;Nel Ruigrok;Camiel J.

However, extracting the relevant information from such streams poses a number of difficult challenges. In this short paper, we survey emergency management professionals to ascertain how social media is used when responding to incidents, the search strategies that they undertake, and the challenges that they face when using social media streams. This research indicates that emergency management professionals employ two main strategies when searching social media streams: keyword-centric and account-centric search strategies.

ee17d5ab4ed24bfee7e157b03da59f2da0ad39e0	enhancing brics integration: a cloud-based green supply chain concept		Today, BRICS - a five nation active group - represents an emerging power that aims to increase its economic integration in response to new global challenges. While many companies in the BRICS group are opening up new geographical industry clusters, changing their IT landscape, and contributing to global climate change concerns, others are not fully prepared, or ready, to do so. This study explores the applicability of mutually beneficial cloud-based green supply chain system among BRICS nations to help achieve development targets while mitigating the environmental impacts associated with rapid development and industrialisation. Data on the BRICS countries trade potential and patterns is reviewed to get a sense of the movement of goods and services between the BRICS nations. Although regulatory barriers and inter-country coordination pose significant challenges for meeting the promise of BRICS trade cooperation, the adoption of new cloud-based IT technologies, new innovations and new thinking remains an important enabling driver of green supply chain management and needs to be explored.	cloud computing	Saroj Koul;Hari Narayan Perikamana;Uma Kumar;Vinod Kumar	2017	IJITM	10.1504/IJITM.2017.10005698	engineering;supply chain management;goods and services;global warming;economic integration;business cluster;economic growth;cloud computing;supply chain;industrialisation	Robotics	-76.22431001745491	-5.9428209946601624	9191

The approach recognizes that model development engages two groups of people in a mutual learning experience: the model builders, whose initial task is to develop an understanding of the system, and the manufacturing personnel whose initial task is to communicate knowledge of the system. The approach utilizes the fact that a model can be expressed in many forms: narrative, graphical, mathematical, computer code, and user interface. In much of the literature, the term “model” is synonymous with the coded form. However, the narrative and the graphical forms constitute excellent means of facilitating the mutual learning experience. The narrative-graphical model is developed by an iterative means called “Structured Feedback”, wherein the modelers develop a sequence of models, each being subjected to critical review in meetings with manufacturing personnel. The result of the Structured Feedback approach is a system description that all parties agree to and understand. The approach is described in the context of an electronic workcell study. Elements from the sequence of narrative-graphical models are shown. Guidelines for narrative and graphics development are presented.	feedback;graphical model;graphical user interface;graphics;iteration;level of detail;management science;simulation;what if	Patrick J.

Views or opinions expressed herein do not necessarily represent those of the Institute or of its National Member Organizations. Preface The Advanced Computer Applications (ACA) project builds on IIASA's traditional strength in the methodological foundations of operations research and applied systems analysis, and its rich experience in numerous application areas including the environment, technology and risk. The ACA group draws on this infrastructure and combines it with elements of A1 and advanced information and computer technology t o create expert systems that have practical applications. By emphasizing a directly understandable problem representation, based on symbolic simulation and dynamic color graphics, and the user interface as a key element of interactive decision support systems, models of complex processes are made understandable and available t o non-technical users. Several completely externally-funded research and development projects in the field of model-based decision support and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) are currently under way, This paper gives an overview of some of the expert systems that have been considered , compared or assessed during the course of our research, and a brief introduction to some of our related in-house research topics. Acknowledgments We would like to thank Sergei Golovanov for his assistance in obtaining bibliograph-ic material from the Eastern European countries, and our Chinese collaborators for providing us with information on research in this field in the People's Republic of China.	american cryptogram association;apple ii graphics;applied artificial intelligence;bachelor of science in information technology;computer;decision support system;expert system;operations research;sphinx;symbolic simulation;user interface	Michel Joubert;Marius Fieschi;Dominique Fieschi;M.

This paper presents a Generic Advice System Architecture (GASA) to assist in developing such systems. It describes how the architecture was used in developing the SPIRE system, whose aim is to provide advice and information which will assist the integration of students with disabilities into higher education. The paper discusses the way in which the GASA addresses key issues in the development of hypermedia advice systems including the need to make such systems available to users with little training and limited knowledge of the domain; the requirement to support diverse information exploration strategies; the provision of purely ‘point and select access; ’ and the minimisation of user disorientation and cognitive overhead.

By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the a...	mobile app;play store	Charles Zhechao Liu;Yoris A.

The method is designed to encourage problem-solving skills amongst students within a delivery framework that is highly flexible and based around dialogue.In the delivery of the course, we have identified seven topic areas that encompass the HCI curriculum and have introduced the notion of 'topic cycles' in which each curriculum area is introduced, researched and discussed before the students are assessed. The cycle applied to the seven topic areas involves the following steps: An introductory lecture, an assessment briefing, group based research and discussion phase, support sessions with online resources and a final assessed seminar. Student feedback, both formal and informal, regularly expresses satisfaction with the method as participants feel that they are treated fairly and maturely.Through this method, we intend to encourage students to adopt a discursive, problem-solving approach to learning and attempt to address the reactive 'surface learning' strategy demonstrated by many students - a problem identified by many studies in Higher Education.The key benefit of this method is its applicability to courses with large cohorts whilst retaining a high degree of student involvement and satisfaction.	amiga reflections;human computer;human–computer interaction;problem solving;while	Rahat Iqbal;Peter Every	2005		10.1145/1095714.1095775	education;simulation;computer science;engineering;scenario;teaching method;multimedia;higher education;educational assessment;pedagogy	HCI	-79.38220506014409	-36.60184563345859	9258

As a part of supporting instructional assessment of online discussions, we investigate a predictive relation between characteristics of discussion contributions and student performance. Inspired by existing work on dialogue acts, project-based learning, and instructional analysis of student-generated text in generating predictive models, we make use of dialogue roles, linguistic features, and work patterns. In particular, we model the Q&A dialog roles that participants play, emotional features covered by LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), cohesiveness of the dialogue, the coherence captured by Coh-Metrix, and temporal patterns of participation. We use a discussion corpus from eight semesters of a computer science course, covering conversations of 173 student groups (370 students). We first remove various noises in student discussion data and normalize the discussion data. We then apply machine learning techniques and text analysis tools for classifying dialogue features efficiently. The extracted dialogue and participation features are used as predictive variables for project grades. The correlation and regression analyses indicate that the number of answers provided to others, the number of positive emotion expressions, and how early students communicate their problems before the deadline correlate with project grades. This finding confirms the argument that in assessing student online activities, we need to capture how they interact, not just how often they participate.	centrality;coh-metrix;computer science;database normalization;dual total correlation;group cohesiveness;image noise;information seeking;interaction information;kerrison predictor;level of measurement;machine learning;noise reduction;predictive modelling;social network;software design description;telecommunications network;dialog	Jae-Bong Yoo;Jihie Kim	2013	International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education	10.1007/s40593-013-0010-8	psychology;rhetoric;computer science;artificial intelligence;role;machine learning;pattern language;multimedia;social psychology;world wide web;correlation;regression analysis;pedagogy	AI	-73.6543224373032	-42.65315809970954	9270

Although this perspective is obvious to many of us and in danger of becoming hackneyed, important structural changes are indeed occurring. Driven by social, political, economic, and technological factors, these profound changes are having a significant impact on the organization of global society ([3], among others). This article explores briefly the implications of some of these changes. It argues that human-computer interaction (HCI) and user-centered design (UCD) principles are critical to ensuring that both developed and developing countries are able to meet the challenges posed by these changes and harness the opportunities of globalization and the emergence of an information society.	emergence;human–computer interaction;user-centered design	Derrick L.

In this paper we discuss how the managers use knowledge when making ICT investment decisions. The focus of the study is on how the organizational process of knowledge creation affects the individual-level decision making and how knowledge conversions between tacit and explicit knowledge occur in this process. Our data consists of six semi-structured interviews in six small or medium-sized companies. The results show significant differences in how the tacit and explicit dimensions of knowledge act by forming a ‘cognitive model’ of decision maker’s use of knowledge. In ICT investments, there are four contributing factors: problem, product, provider, and solution. The decision processes are described and compared in more detail based on the categorization of these factors.	categorization;cognitive model;organizational behavior;semiconductor industry	Torsti Rantapuska;Outi Ihanainen	2007			open-ended investment company;business;market economy;commerce	AI	-81.12908394282782	3.7879191495796856	9427

1d8b65ce9f7e2f208943ba2b3bb998b5033e7cbb	local surveillance in a global world: zooming in on the proliferation of cctv in catalonia	barcelona;cctv;urban policy;policy transfer	Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems are a growing phenomenon in most Western countries and a fixed item on security agendas in urban environments around the world. But while several authors have studied the proliferation of CCTV from a comparative perspective, in most cases the analysis is focused at the national level, assuming that local processes are no more than the locus of implementation of national agendas. Moreover, issues related to political configurations and reconfigurations, historical factors and internal dynamics of power have seldom been tackled, and some of the assumptions about proliferation patterns in the most widely researched areas have become general assumptions. The new empirical research findings presented in this article offer a detailed and empirically evidenced account of the political and policy environment surrounding the uptake of video surveillance in Catalonia and suggests that zooming in on local processes adds complexity to the understanding of the process of CCTV proliferation at the global level. Specifically, the article addresses: the role of local/global interaction in the emergence of CCTV as a new orthodoxy, the relationship between video surveillance and economic and commercial pressures on urban restructuring, the role of party politics and political ideologies in surveillance policy, and the specific articulation of the interaction between video surveillance and urban disorder. The article ends by exploring both local narratives and global-local policy dynamics, concluding that there is a need to conduct further research on the specific ways in which CCTV policy travels through borders and between the scales of government, and the processes by which it becomes embedded in diverse geographic, political and institutional settings.	closed-circuit television	Gemma Galdon Clavell	2011	Information Polity	10.3233/IP-2011-0251	simulation;geography;advertising	NLP	-78.90748571079281	-12.806646037312039	9438

There has been a near saturation of this social group. Given this situation, it is of interest to know what this can tell us regarding the mechanisms of adoption. Given this focus I look into the work of Rogers’ and that of Silverstone and Haddon and their domestication perspective. The positive and the negative sides of these approaches are examined in the light of the recent experience with the mobile telephone. Rogers’ discussion of the social mechanisms behind diffusion and his work on the critical mass of communication equipment are of interest. On the other hand his basis in the world of marketing and perhaps simplistic diffusion progression are questioned. The alternative approach, that of domestication is seen to be a more of a global analysis of adoptions ex post facto. The approach provides one with an understanding of how innovations change and are changed by their social contexts. Finally, several areas of further research are outlined.	color gradient;mobile phone	Rich Ling	2002	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF02994634	optics;mathematics;performance art	ECom	-78.96781465389033	-13.458102555546766	9457

In this work, we present CSLQT, a new Collaborative System for Learning based on Questionnaires and Tasks. This system is independent of any course structure or content, and provide users with functionalities to create, review, and evaluate new knowledge resources through questions and tasks. The benefits are two-fold: teachers are released from the tedious task of creating all resources, and students are encouraged to gain the necessary knowledge background before creating any new content. Additionally, a Fuzzy controller generates exams satisfying a customized set of objectives, that could be used for evaluation or auto-evaluation purposes. Our experiences with the system in real courses of the University of Granada indicate the tool is actually useful to improve the learning process.

In order to obtain satisfactory forecasting results, constructing of models used for these aims should be grounded on some interactive data mining. Data mining of data stored in the system of the Lithuanian teacher’s database and of data from other sources representing the state of education system and the demographic changes in Lithuania was used. The models cover the estimation of data quality in the databases, the analysis of flow of teachers and pupils, the clustering of schools, the model of dynamics of pedagogical staff and pupils, and the quality analysis of teachers. The main results of forecasting and integrated analysis of the Lithuanian teachers’ database with other data reflecting the state of the education system and demographic changes in Lithuania are presented.	accessibility;cluster analysis;data mining;data quality;database	Gintautas Dzemyda;Vydunas Saltenis;Vytautas Tiesis	2003	Informatics in Education		simulation;geography;data science;data mining	DB	-84.76375132701469	-46.43148342196405	9555

Thus for example, usage of mobile terminals such as smart PDA (personal digital assistant) in a learning system is very common phenomenon. Mobile devices can communicate with wireless mobile terminal and realize the intelligence exchange with its surroundings. Based on this current trend and the need to realize learning in a more dynamic environment, a LOCH (Language Learning Outside the Classroom) system named One Day Trip is developed to assist overseas students to learn Japanese in real life situations with the help of a PDA. This paper proposes the task assignment support function in the system to aid the teacher to give learners appropriate tasks in the learning environment.	handheld game console;mobile operating system;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;real life	Hiroaki Ogata;Li Hui Gan;Makoto Wada;Yoneo Yano	2008	2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2008.80	robot learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;mobile device;database;multimedia;active learning;programming language;mobile computing;world wide web	Robotics	-69.81272753881254	-40.25580585180533	9578
f78b2c2be25de334566ff54dedc01b75a97912a5	applying cognitive learner models for recommender systems in sparse data learning environments		In recent years, various recommendation algorithms have been proposed to support learners in technology-enhanced learning environments. Such algorithms have proven to be quite effective in big-data learning settings (massive open online courses), yet successful applications in other informal and formal learning settings are rare. Common challenges include data sparsity, the lack of sufficiently flexible learner and domain models, and the difficulty of including pedagogical goals into recommendation strategies. Computational models of human cognition and learning are, in principle, well positioned to help meet these challenges, yet the effectiveness of cognitive models in educational recommender systems remains poorly understood to this date. This thesis contributes to this strand of research by investigating i) two cognitive learner models (CbKST and SUSTAIN) for resource recommendations that qualify for sparse user data by following theory-driven top down approaches, and ii) two tag recommendation strategies based on models of human cognition (BLL and MINERVA2) that support the creation of learning content meta-data. The results of four online and offline experiments in different learning contexts indicate that a recommendation approach based on the CbKST, a well-founded structural model of knowledge representation, can improve the users? perceived learning experience in formal learning settings. In informal settings, SUSTAIN, a human category learning model, is shown to succeed in representing dynamic, interest based learning interactions and to improve Collaborative Filtering for resource recommendations. The investigation of the two proposed tag recommender strategies underlined their ability to generate accurate suggestions (BLL) and in collaborative settings, their potential to promote the development of shared vocabulary (MINERVA2). This thesis shows that the application of computational models of human cognition holds promise for the design of recommender mechanisms and, at the same time, for gaining a deeper understanding of interaction dynamics in virtual learning systems.	algorithm;big data;business logic;cognition;cognitive model;collaborative filtering;computation;computational model;concept learning;experiment;interaction;knowledge representation and reasoning;massive open online course;online and offline;recommender system;sparse matrix;strand (programming language);top-down and bottom-up design;vocabulary	Simone Kopeinik	2017	SIGIR Forum	10.1145/3190580.3190608	computer science;recommender system;data mining;sparse matrix;cognition	AI	-77.17188686057253	-45.510983715593994	9588

To this end, we tested the hypotheses that the activity of users on academic social networks is associated with academic output. The quantitative data used for this study was collected from the publicly-accessible scholarly social network HASTAC and complemented with a qualitative survey collected from 123 students and recent alumni of the HASTAC Scholars Program. Our results partially support the hypothesis that activity in scholarly networks is associated with academic output, and show that Scholars who both collaborated online and published their academic work together bridge structural holes in the network. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of our findings and argue that online activity and academic output are both likely driven by networked Scholars devoted to academic research.	bridging (networking);hastac;social network;structural holes	Marco T.

Although there are commonalities among these lists, several aspects of this work frustrate our using it to define a consensus view of HI competencies. This project has involved the documentation and comparison of the competencies produced by key authors and an effort to suggest competency terminology that derives from and harmonizes these efforts, but does not emphasize any one contribution. It is our hope that this will enable us to use what has gone before with a minimum of reinvention.		H. Dominic Covvey;Shirley L.

Several modules have been developed to assist the students to acquire the fundamentals of the basic instrumentation; furthermore, a client-server system has been designed in order to allow the students to operate on a remote laboratory for experimental training. The courseware includes lessons, exercises, and a training on virtual instruments which emulate actual instruments. The students can also carry out several real laboratory experiments without actually being in the laboratory, by using a client-server structure based on the Internet. Since these innovations were only introduced last year, they are in the testing phase and so far only a few results have been obtained on the effectiveness of the learning process. Nevertheless, the students have shown a favorable acceptance and have satisfactorily used the new tools. Demos of both the theoretical and practical part of the courses are available through the Internet.		F. Cambiotti;M. Parvis;U.

This paper explores the socio-technical developments that the next 25 years might bring and the implications of such developments for educators and for educational technology research. The paper begins by outlining the diverse approaches to educational futures that are currently visible in the field, and suggests four principles to underpin future thinking in educational technology. It then describes the methods used to inquire into long-term socio-technical futures in the 2-year Beyond Current Horizons Programme. These included a foresight and scenario development process bringing together evidence reviews and insights from over 100 researchers from disciplines as diverse as computer science, demography and sociology of childhood, as well as consultation with over 130 organizations and individuals from industry, practice and educational beneficiary groups. The outcomes of this programme are then presented, including a set of future scenarios for education and a set of socio-technical developments that might underpin such scenarios. The scenarios emerge from three future worlds (‘Trust Yourself’, ‘Loyalty Points’ and ‘Only Connect’), and from projections including: changing demography, new human–machine relations and a weakening of institutional boundaries. The paper then argues that the next 25 years will challenge our current organization of education around the unit of the individual child, the school and the discourses of the knowledge economy; and will require the development of new approaches to curriculum, cross-institutional relationships, workforce development and decision-making in education. Finally, the paper argues that these developments challenge educational technology research to move beyond pedagogy to curriculum; beyond the school to the community, home and workplace; and beyond social sciences to collaborations with medical and bio-ethics fields.	british informatics olympiad;computer science;futures and promises;sociotechnical system	Keri Facer;Richard Sandford	2010	J.

Therefore, determination of learning scenario is a very important task in a learning process. After a new student is registered in the system, he is classified to the appropriate group. Before he begins to learn an opening scenario is determined based on final scenarios of students who belong to the class of learners similar to the new one. The new student is offered the optimal learning path suitable for his preferences, learning styles and personal features. In this paper new knowledge structure, which involves version of lessons, is proposed. For the defined knowledge structure definitions of learning scenario, distance function and the procedure of the scenario determination are presented.

Many people turn to the offices of SHIL either for help or to volunteer as advisors. This study seeks to examine the information seeking behavior of SHIL volunteers supplying information services to citizens. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical foundations of the study are based on two existing models of information searching related to everyday life problems, Foster’s non-linear model of information seeking behavior and Bates’s berry-picking approach. This research employs a qualitative method. A total of 35 advisors in different SHIL branches were interviewed and the content of the interviews was analyzed, mapped and organized into categories by using concepts and terms revealed in the data. Findings – Findings show that volunteers at SHIL search information in a way that integrates the two models mentioned above, the berry-picking model and the non-linear model. In addition, findings point to difficulties that the advisors face in solving problems of the clients. These difficulties are connected with the different aspects relating to the flow of information both within and outside the organization and with organizational and administrative aspects at SHIL. Originality/value – The information seeking behavior of volunteers acting as providers of information services has yet to be investigated at length and the understanding of their information behavior can be of value, since volunteering carries great importance in a democracy.	accessibility;chat room;freedom of information laws by country;information behavior;information seeking behavior;information source;linear model;nonlinear system;recommender system;user-generated content	Sharon Finzi;Jenny Bronstein;Judit Bar-Ilan;Shifra Baruchson-Arbib;Sheizaf Rafaeli;Gilad Ravid	2012	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012531211244608	public relations;computer science;knowledge management;management;social psychology;world wide web;information retrieval;information system	HCI	-82.7378519664028	-14.11683637287236	9865

The objective of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for the development of methods to evaluate the effectiveness of content preparation in information technology operations. Past studies identify information as the dominant concern of users, and delivery mechanism as a secondary concern [20]. The best presentation of the wrong information results in a design with major usability problems and does not aid the user in accomplishing his task. This paper shifts the focus of existing usability evaluation methods. It attempts to fill the void in usability literaoture by addressing the information aspect of usability evaluation. Combining the strengths of content preparation and usability evaluation yields major implications for a broad range of IT uses.	video synopsis	April Savoy;Gavriel Salvendy	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73105-4_69	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;usability;web design;human–computer interaction;agile usability engineering;computer science;system usability scale;usability engineering;universal usability;multimedia;tree testing;web engineering;information technology;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-63.94186520507443	-45.85690267470508	9894

The amount of information of today‟s websites, the continuous evolution of the medium and the heterogeneity of typical users‟ profiles, make the website design task particularly hard. The presented tools are mainly based on recent models of Web usage behavior, and involve various natural language and semantic similarity modeling methods. Validation studies of the presented tools have shown that they can support effectively various phases of the website design lifecycle including information structuring, hyperlink evaluation and assessment of alternative designs. In this paper, existing techniques are discussed, the aspects of Web design that (should and) could be better supported are identified and suggestions are made on extensions of existing approaches to better support the usability evaluation process.	hyperlink;natural language;semantic similarity;usability;web design	Christos Katsanos;Nikolaos K.

This article examines the influence of microeconomic factors on both individuals' attitude towards and use of cellular telephones. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey from a final sample of 463 cellular phones' users in Guinea. The results obtained tend to corroborate the hypotheses according to which mobility, group characteristics (familiarity), social influence (social pressure and image), and the possession of resources affect the attitude toward and the use of cellular telephones. In contrast, the traditional hypotheses that consider subscription conditions as the main influence to technology use are not verified.	mobile phone	Bangaly Kaba;Koffi N'Da;Victor Wacham A.

In trying to give an answer to this pressing question we do not deal with utopian libraries of the next century, but with the library and the librarian of the next decade. The emphasis is on libraries within educational and research institutions, especially university libraries. We examine the changes confronting the library of the future and identify four key aspects of the library of the future. It will be (1) a gateway to information, whatever format this information comes in and wherever it is located; (2) an expertise centre;(3) a physical entity, not only in the sense of being a social meeting place and place of scholarly interaction, but also as a place where students and other users are provided with modern study facilities and adequate user support; (4) a collection centre of printed material. Such libraries can only take on an appropriate shape and will only survive if the institutions that librarians serve in meet the four criteria outlined above. We look at the demands that will be made on professional library knowledge and skills and the new job responsibilities and job	librarian;library (computing);printing;virtual reality	Alex C.

However, it can expose classroom learners and teachers to a wider community of specialists and interested others, enriching the classroom experience beyond the knowledge of the local teacher. This paper reflects on two practical e-Science projects that utilised mobile hand-held technologies to bring the concepts of collaborative e-Science and the Grid to young scientists. Students engaged in hands-on exploration of their surroundings, and were able to communicate with pollution specialists and with a remote classroom of children who had used similar sensors. Communication and data sharing activities in these sessions exposed a requirement for a suite of tools and technologies not currently accessible to schools. From qualitative analysis of data across these two projects, we present a collection of supporting tools to help achieve this aim and future research direction.	e-science;hands-on computing;mobile device;sensor	Hilary Smith;Joshua Underwood;Geraldine Fitzpatrick;Rosemary Luckin;Danaë Emma Beckford Stanton Fraser	2006	2006 Second IEEE International Conference on e-Science and Grid Computing (e-Science'06)	10.1109/E-SCIENCE.2006.87	simulation;reflection;mobile telephony;pollution;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;carbon dioxide;student engagement;multimedia;data analysis;law;collaboration	Visualization	-69.74873044919262	-39.274351893292405	9975

It investigates the relationship between several explanatory variables and Internet use in a cross-section of scientists from seven European countries and five academic disciplines (astronomy, chemistry, computer science, economics , and psychology). The analysis confirmed some of the results of previous U.S.-based analyses. In particular , it corroborated a positive relationship between research productivity and Internet use. The relationship was found to be nonlinear, with very productive (nonpro-ductive) scientists using the Internet less (more) than would be expected according to their productivity. Also, being involved in collaborative R&D and having large networks of collaborators is associated with increased Internet use. In contrast to older studies, the analysis did not find any equalizing effect whereby higher Internet use rates help to overcome the problems of potentially disadvantaged researchers. Obviously, everybody who wants to stay at the forefront of research and keep up-to-date with developments in their research fields has to use the Internet.	computer science;internet;microsoft forefront;nonlinear system;scientific communication	Franz Barjak	2006	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20454	the internet;scientific method;suicide and the internet;law	HCI	-75.48869911323484	-23.42918204969322	10020

The initial intention of the subproject was to attract members of the subproject to prepare some teaching materials for teaching essentials of the Java programming language. During the last two years, some advanced Java topics have been selected and appropriate teaching materials have been produced. The available pool of common teaching materials can be used in a wide range of university courses in participating countries. In this paper we share some of the results and experiences collected during the subproject that come from intensive use of the prepared teaching materials for a variety of Java topics in different countries and universities.	applet;experience;generic programming;imperative programming;iteration;java;programming language;programming style;smoothing;software engineering	Mirjana Ivanovic;Zoran Budimac;Anastas Mishev;Klaus Bothe;Ioan Jurca	2013	Informatics in Education		curriculum;java programming language;pedagogy;curriculum development;higher education;mathematics education;java;computer science	PL	-80.87494604645312	-34.662688346041506	10021

Meta-assessment is defined as the deliberate examination of the elements, basic conditions, and needs of a thing (service, event, system, and so on) that transcend particular instantiations of that thing. Meta-assessment does not assess particular programs but rather the conditions under which all online reference services must exist. Meta-assessment occupies the conceptual space between the philosophy of reference (i.e., the examination and articulation of first principles) and the assessment of a particular reference service program. The basic conditions for the evaluation and assessment of ORS are articulated and explored. The impact of “rogue” ORS (i.e., ORS that are not affiliated with any particular digital library) on the process of meta-assessment is examined. Several parameters of the basic conditions for reference service in any form and any environment are enumerated. Although the widespread recurring assessment of specific ORS may be a few months off, the window of opportunity for the effective meta-assessment of ORS in general may be closing. Thomas A. Peters, Center for Library Initiatives, Committee on Institutional Cooperation, 302 East John Street, Suite 1705, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820-5698 IJBRARY TRENDS, Vol. 49, No. 2, Fall 2000, pp. 334349 02001 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois PETERS/EFFECTIVE META-ASSESSMENT 335 INTRODUCTION If environments are understood as places and spaces in which human beings pursue their wants and needs, technological developments are interesting because they change existing environments and create entirely new ones. The digital revolution has fostered many new environments that generally fall under the rubric of cyberspace. The digital libraries movement involves both substantial environmental change and the emergence of new service environments. New technologies at least encourage (and perhaps force) humans to re-examine what they think about environments, the horizons visible at the edges of known environments, and what new environments seem to offer and encourage. Technological changes are affecting the environments and environmental conditions related to reference service. The emergence of digital libraries and other online environments force us to re-think the philosophy of reference. If assessment is defined as the deliberate process of comparing the reality of a service against both its stated goals and the realm of the possibilities for such a service, the process of assessment currently faces formidable challenges. It is extremely difficult to assess digital library public services, especially online reference services, in part because we do not really know yet what types of demanded services will emerge from users of digtal libraries as they settle into these new online environments. We should not assume that simply transporting traditional real-world library services into the digital realm will be either necessary or sufficient. One is reminded of the transformational processes of bringing water from the town well into individual homes. Simply delivering the same old water indoors seems at first to be a great leap forward-a triumph of the technological arm of civilization. As the first wave of enthusiasm for the home delivery of water subsides, however, homeowners begin to demand new services. They want their water to be heated, treated, filtered, and fluoridated. Although some of these new demands for services may have been predictable, some probably were not even imaginable to people who formerly trudged to the central village well to draw their water. When water was delivered into the home, a new service environment emerged. Similarly, just as the central library served as the font of information for an often geographically defined community of users (civic, educational, or corporate), when digital libraries began to deliver information directly into residences and workplaces, some of the demands for new DL services may have surprised and astounded both librarians and library users. For example, people will queue for services at the town well and the reference desk at the community library, but apparently they are unwilling to queue and wait patiently for similar services when delivered into domiciles, offices, and classrooms. We should not assume that a digital library service must, by definition, be associated directlywith a full-service digital library. It is possible to 336 LIBRARY TRENDS/FALL 2000 conceive of, and implement, a digital service (e.g., reference) without having it be part of a full-blown digital library. In online environments, information services typically associated with robust real-world libraries could float free from their tethered moorings. The economics of online information services may undergo a substantial alteration in the near future. Another reason online reference services may be difficult to assess is that “rogue” reference services have burst onto the scene (e.g., AskJeeves.com and WebHelp.com) that are not affiliated with any specific digital library. Suddenly the field of reference is flooded with a host of players who apparently are attempting to play the same game under various conditions and rules. How can we assess the value and worth of these rogue reference services? How will they affect the development of ORS within full-service digital libraries? Should we use the same criteria and standards that we would use for ORS that are affiliated with some sort of full-serviceDL? In the vast deserts of online environments, there probably is room for both types of ORS. Online reference service may be further subdivided into a wide variety of specialized services. Some of these specialized services may be amendable to commercial for-profit models while others may not. The proliferation of rogue reference services raises an interesting meta-assessment question. What is the relationship between any reference service and the full library that surrounds it? What are the ties that bind a reference service to broader organizational goals? Some core real-world library functions, such as collection development, acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation do not make much sense without a collection. Other services (e.g., document delivery) rely on a collection, but it may not be a locally owned, housed, and controlled collection. Reference service seems to thrive when the human reference providers have ready access to some sort of extra-cranial collection of information, but it may not yet be selfevident what type of reference collection will be needed to optimally support an online reference service. Physical proximity is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition. PHILOSOPHY, AND ASSESSMENT META-ASSESSMENT, For these reasons, it may be difficult to assess current DL service programs (particularly ORS) in the context of the universe of all possible DL services. We simply have not yet discovered the entire online universe and the way humans will comport themselves in it, which in part is a process of self-discovery as one dives into a new pool of information. A philosophy of reference could be described as the examination and explication of the fundamental principles and goals of any and all reference services. Philosophy attempts to get at the essence of the thing, regardless of general and specific environmental conditions. The assessment of a specific reference service program examines how well a particular reference effort in a PETERS/EFFECTIVE META-ASSESSMENT 337 known environment is able to achieve its goals. Assessment certainly draws upon (and relies upon) a philosophy of reference, even if that philosophy is only implied in a pre-reflective fashion. At this moment in the overall development of reference services, a deliberate collaborative attempt at meta-assessment is warranted. Whereas an assessment project attempts to evaluate and assess a particular instantiated reference program, a metaassessment project attempts to evaluate and assess the very preconditions, limitations, and assumptions upon which any online reference service relies. For the purposes of this article, meta-assessment is defined as the deliberate examination of the elements, basic conditions (necessary and sufficient), and needs of a thing (service, event, system, and so on) that transcend particular instantiations of that thing. A meta-assessment of ORS and surrounding online environments should be undertaken as a deliberate conceptual environmental scan and blueprint for future ORS. Assessment and evaluation often are used almost interchangeably. Saracevic and Covi (2000) define evaluation as an appraisal of the performance or functioning of a system, or part thereof, in relation to articulated objectives. They insist that any evaluation must specify clearly what elements are being evaluated because an exhaustive evaluation of anything is impossible. Performance can be evaluated in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, or a combination of cost-effectiveness. This sense of evaluation could be understood as an “intra-system” definition, because the assessment or valuation of the system or service in relation to the broader environment, or in relation to all possible systems or services that could be designed and deployed to meet user needs, is not an integral part of this type of evaluation process. Questions such as “Why does this service have this set of articulated objectives rather than another set?” are difficult to address in an evaluation process so defined and pursued.

Meanwhile, organizational learning has long been considered as one of the measures of organizational performance. This article investigated the impact of enterprise social networking systems (ESNS) usage on knowledge management processes and organizational learning; in particular, we examined the mediating role of knowledge creation and knowledge sharing. Four theories from sociology and strategic management were used to build the hypotheses in the research model. An online survey was conducted to empirically test the model. Our study results showed that ESNS usage directly and indirectly influences organizational learning; and that knowledge management processes (knowledge creation and sharing) mediate the path between the two.

This is likely to result in pedestrians unknowingly engaging in dangerous behavior. To determine the extent to which pedestrians' estimates of their own visibility are influenced by educational interventions, clothing reflectance, and headlamp beam setting, participants in 2 experiments estimated their own nighttime visibility by walking toward a stationary car to the point where they believed they were just recognizable as a pedestrian. In the first experiment 48 university students were tested and in the second experiment 9 high-school driver education students were tested. Overall, participants failed to appreciate the benefits of reflective clothing and of high-beam illumination. However, the participants in Experiment 1 who had heard a relevant lecture several weeks earlier gave estimates that were 10% shorter than did a control group. Participants in Experiment 2 heard a more focused and graphic-intensive lecture and gave estimates that were 56% shorter than did a control group. Potential applications of this research include increasing pedestrian safety by designing and implementing research-based public education campaigns aimed at reducing pedestrians' overestimates of their own nighttime visibility.

Another aim is to understand the specific behavior presented by students bystanders, namely whether they noticed incidents of cyberbullying and interpreted these events as an emergency and which actions they determined as being appropriate in providing assistance. Following a cross-cultural perspective to reach these aims, a total of 788 Portuguese and Brazilian college students answered to the Cyberbullying Inventory for College Students. Moderation analysis revealed that intervening moderated the relationship between being the bystander of cyberbullying and being the victim and/or aggressor. A three-way interaction showed that this relationship was stronger in Brazilian students, revealing that the bystanders who were inactive were more likely to also become a victim or an aggressor themselves, whereas those who intervened were less likely to become a victim or an aggressor. Implications for future research and interventive action are discussed.

Based on this, we propose the method to create a mind map based on iteration and the divide and conquer strategy with a practical example, and comparative learning based on mind map as well. The method does a great help to improve students' knowledge reorganizing and induction skills, and also helps students to understand knowledge better.

38987dcb6929dec651ccf93ade315375c8f18796	xipit: updating the xip dashboard to support educators in essay marking at higher education		Effective written communication is an essential skill which promotes educational success for undergraduates. However, undergraduate students, especially those in their first year at university, are unused to this form of writing. After their long experience with the schoolroom essay, for most undergraduates academic writing development is painstakingly slow. Thus, especially those with poor writing abilities, should write more to be better writers. Yet, the biggest impediment to more writing is that overburdened tutors would ask limited number of drafts from their students. Today, there exist powerful computational language technologies that could evaluate student writing, saving time and providing timely, speedy, reliable feedback which can support educators marking process. This paper motivates an updated visual analytics dashboard, XIPIt, to introduce a set of visual and writing analytics features embedded in a marking environment built on XIP output.	dashboard;embedded system;execute in place;existential quantification;item unique identification;language technology;prototype;requirement;system requirements;visual analytics	Duygu Bektik	2018		10.1145/3231644.3231696	dashboard (business);knowledge management;multimedia;higher education;visual analytics;academic writing;computer science;learning analytics;analytics	HCI	-78.95517773324053	-35.92330657612627	10143

It can help achieve effective team knowledge management by modeling, optimizing, monitoring, and controlling the operation of knowledge flow processes. This paper proposes the notion of knowledge energy as the driving force behind the formation of an autonomous knowledge flow network, and explores the underlying principles. Knowing these principles helps teams and the support systems improve cooperation by monitoring the knowledge energy of nodes, by evaluating and adjusting knowledge flows, and by adopting appropriate strategies. A knowledge flow network management mechanism can help improve the efficiency of knowledge-intensive distributed teamwork.

b54279592f9b9f252449e86df5abd2ee01382502	on the teaching and evaluation of experiential learning in a conventional university setting	experiential learning;higher education;process education;psychology;evaluation methods;feedback;foreign countries;summative evaluation;teacher role;communication thought transfer;instructional effectiveness;teacher attitudes;cooperative learning;formative evaluation	The notion of experiential learning emphasises the personal experience of the learner. In this article, I describe my approach to making learning a more personal experience for students on a conventional unversity course. I focus on modelling of behaviour and attitudes by the teacher, clear communication, attention to process, and collaboration in learning. Evaluation can be formative (to facilitate learning) or summative (for assessment). I describe a number of methods which I have used in the formative evaluation of experiential learning. In general, I try to maximise feedback to all participants (including myself) having first created an atmosphere where defences can be lowered and the feedback heard. Finally, I consider summative evaluation, which presents considerable, but not insuperable, difficulties. In Plato’s Phaedrus, a conversation is reported in which the Egyptian god Theuth claims that his invention of writing will make people wiser. Thamus, god-king of Thebes, disagrees: ‘This discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls because they will . . . trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves. . . They will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing’ (Brennan and Brennan 1989, 1). The positions of these two protagonists represent two poles of learning. One is characterised by distancing and abstract understanding, the other by raw experiencing. Unfortunately, much formal learning gets stuck in the distanced pole as students are taught to ignore or deny their own concrete experience. Exponents of experiential learning would like to restore personal experience to education (Weil and McGill 1989). I am particularly interested in those aspects of experiential learning which have to do with the personal growth and development of students-for example, fuller understanding of their feelings, and how they relate to others. Such learning has obvious applications in the personal sphere, but it is equally relevant for professional development: at least in psychology, there are repeated calls that graduates should possess interpersonal skills (eg Miller 1984). Experiential learning in a university setting 5 I agree with Rogers ( 198 3) that teachers should pay more attention than has been customary to their students' personal development, and that this can be done naturally in the course of teaching the subject matter. particularly in small discussion classes (Swain 1984). Likely benefits include enhanced self steem. creativity and academic performance (Rogers 198 3, 197-224) and a reducti&n student drop-out and failure (Bramley 1979). Elements of the approach My approach to experientiat learning emphasises the following elements: the teacher as model, clear communication, an emphasis on process and collaborative learning. I expand on each of these below, then cite an example of this approach in action. The teacher as model Adelson suggests that students unconsciously identify with the style of their teacher. For example, teachers who espouse the naturalist model are impersonal, task-oriented and see themselves primarily as subject matter experts. Their students learn to be detached and analytical. The riystic healer. in contrast, attends to the person: 'He concentrates neither on himself, nor the subject matter, nor the discipline, but on the student, saying: 'I will help you become what you are' (Adelson 1962. 400). I aspire to being a 'mystic healer' in that I try to model not only the traditional academic virtues, but also a respect for students as persons and a willingness to take risks by disclosing myself to them. I believe that by adopting this role, I am offering them a worthwhile style of personal and professional behaviour with which to identify. Clear communication Another of the qualities I strive to model is explicitness. It is important that students should know what is expected of them, so my course handouts give details of aims, format and assessment as well as content. I also find it useful to discuss mutual expectations at the beginning of the year (Habeshaw, Habeshaw and Gibbs 1984. 1 314). Similarly, I insist that students communicate clearly in writing. My attention in reading their written work is directed as much to the form as to the content (Swain 1989). Emphasis on process My focus on clear communication is a specific aspect of a more general interest in process. Miles describes the notion of process as involving 'how things are happening, rather than what is being talked about' (Miles 1981, 4). In teaching, I pay as much attention to process as to content. I believe that by emphasizing the style of learning and communication I am helping the students to come to grips with the content, while at the same time enhancing their personal development. Collaborative learning Students have social needs which can be enlisted in the service of learning: if these are met in the classroom, the students will often learn better. Perry ( 19 70) has presented 6 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 22 No 1 7 991 evidence for the existence of sequential stages of intellectual development, and suggests that the principal stimulus to development is peer interaction. A different line of evidence reviewed by Bligh (1 9 72) shows that a particular form of interaction, group discussion, is more effective than lectures for the achievement of critical thinking and attitude change. It is interesting to note that John Henry Newman recognised the academic benefits of social interaction as long ago as 1852: When a multitude of young men . . . come together and freely mix with each other, they are sure to learn one from another, even if there be no one to teach them: the conversation of all is a series of lectures to each, and they gain for themselves new ideas and views, fresh matter of thought, and distinct principles for judging and acting, day by day' (Newman 1982, 110). Of course, students talk a great deal to each other during their everyday encounters, but for most, their educational history has taught them to compete rather than collaborate when they are in the classroom. Thus, they usually need a great deal of encouragement to share their ideas in this setting. It helps if my attitudes and behaviour demonstrate that 1 too am prepared to share. Aii example of the approach in action As a practical example, one of my courses is a discussion class on different conceptions of the nature of psychology. Recently I realised that while the students were debating the various approaches, they had no consistent viewpoint of their own. My own orientation is well-known to the students and open for discussion and criticism, but I have no desire to force it on them. What I did want, as 'mystic healer', was to challenge them to consider new possibilities for themselves. In Perry's schema (1 970), the most mature people are committed to a well thought out position which accords with their total value system. I kept asking the students which of the approaches to psychology they wished to adopt for themselves. The question was very confronting-these were honours students, yet the notion of commitment in Perry's sense had never occurred to them. It was clear from their reactions that I had made them think in a new way about who they are, and who they might become. Formative and surnmative evaluation Forniative evduation is evaluation for purposes of feedback, improvement or the facilitation of learning; summative evaluation (also called assessment) is evaluation for purposes of decision making eg grading, selection or accreditation. The two purposes are often confused by educators. They should always be conceptually different: it is usually necessary to keep them distinct in practice as well. On formative evaluation The general aim in formative evaluation of experiential learning is to maximise feedback on performance. I will use the term negative feedback to refer to information about weaknesses, and positive feedback for information about strengths (this usage is different from the original meaning of these terms in control engineering). Clearly, negative feedback which is too confronting will lead to defensiveness rather than learning; and positive comments may also, paradoxically, be rejected if they do not accord with the recipient’s poor self-image. For students to be able to listen to my feedback (or for me to hear theirs), I must tirst create a non-threatening atmosphere in which we all feel able to listen to praise and criticism. 1 will illustrate my approach by showing how formative evaluation can be used in a tutorial class-ie a group of between four and twelve students who meet weekly with a tutor to discuss prepared material. Evaluation is a useful way of bringing the year to a formal conclusion. but it is also appropriate at other times, especially if the group is not working well. It can be focused on the tutor’s contribution, on the students’ contribution, or on the class as a learning experience. A common, but coy. way of assessing the tutor’s contrihutiori is to ask the students to fill in a form anonymously. [n the past I have used quantitative questionnaries (Swain 1977), but 1 now tind that a sheet with the headings ‘compliments’, ‘criticisms’ and ‘suggestions’ is quite adequate, and produces a large volume of feedback in which recurring themes are readily discernible. In fact I now use questionnaries only with larger classes. preferring with smaller groups to elicit direct verbal feedback. I do this by proposing to the students that each one in turn give me one compliment and one criticism about my contribution to the class. Where a suitable atmosphere has been established, the feedback is frank. I find it useful to listen in silence, reserving any comments or self-justifications until all students have	am broadcasting;apevia;control engineering;negative feedback;piaget's theory of cognitive development;positive feedback;samuel newman;soul;subject matter expert turing test;value (ethics)	Rony Swain	1991	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.1991.tb00047.x	psychology;cooperative learning;educational technology;knowledge management;experiential learning;evaluation;feedback;multimedia;active learning;higher education;formative assessment;summative assessment;pedagogy	HCI	-74.01366033560637	-36.275568262417586	10153

1a4bf8ed031ae85ab166ea3f7ef246138bef2c4b	an agent-based model for emotion contagion and competition in online social media		Recent studies suggest that human emotions diffuse in not only real-world communities but also online social media. However, a comprehensive model that considers up-to-date findings and multiple online social media mechanisms is still missing. To bridge this vital gap, an agent-based model, which concurrently considers emotion influence and tie strength preferences, is presented to simulate the emotion contagion and competition. Our model well reproduces patterns observed in the empirical data, like anger’s preference on weak ties, anger-dominated users’ high vitalities and angry tweets’ short retweet intervals, and anger’s competitiveness in negative events. The comparison with a previously presented baseline model further demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling online emotion contagion. It is also surprisingly revealed by our model that as the ratio of anger approaches joy with a gap less than 12%, anger will eventually dominate the online social media and arrives the collective outrage in the cyber space. The critical gap disclosed here can be indeed warning signals at early stages for outrage control. Our model would shed lights on the study of multiple issues regarding emotion contagion and competition in terms of computer simulations.	agent-based model;baseline (configuration management);computer simulation;cyberspace;social media	Rui Fan;Ke Xu;Jichang Zhao	2017	CoRR	10.1016/j.physa.2017.12.086	agent-based model;cyber space;emotional contagion;interpersonal ties;social media;complex contagion;anger;social psychology;outrage;sociology	AI	-83.35368270427908	-18.345155712189502	10191

Companies realize the opportunities of diversity and yet for several reasons they are struggling to hire or integrate young female professionals. Although gender study research provides promising frameworks there are still issues in applying them in working environments and practices. For this purpose, we made use of the Living Lab approach in the context of gender and IT. The Living Lab's methodology offers opportunities to reveal new, relevant insights and create social change in a collaborative way. We stretched the existing understanding of this concept and follow a Participatory Action Research approach. In this paper we describe the setup of the Living Lab and present first insights from our research. We found that showing patience, organizing adequate spaces for reflection as well as facilitating motivation and trust is vital in such a sensitive research context.	living lab;organizing (structure);programming paradigm;social system	Michael Ahmadi;Anne Weibert;Corinna Ogonowski;Konstantin Aal;Kristian Gäckle;Nicola Marsden;Volker Wulf	2018		10.1145/3196839.3196878	women in computing;knowledge management;living lab;participatory action research;patience;political science;qualitative research;social change	HCI	-74.4984531938113	-33.67140550706735	10290

Through our study we attempt to understand how individuals communicate in mediated settings in emotion-laden situations. We explore their preferred medium of communication in different situations along with analysis of the content of communication. Spatial arrays, lexical surrogates, vocal spellings and grammatical markers were used as strategies by individuals for communicating non-verbal cues in text based communication. We also look at how messages sent on IMs or posts on social networks are interpreted by readers in terms of the emotional state of the sender. We found that while valence of the sender gets easily and accurately communicated, arousal is misinterpreted in most situations. In this paper, we present findings from our study which can be valuable for technology companies looking to better the current communication experience across different media.	computer-mediated communication;information management system (ims);social network;surrogates;text-based (computing)	Minal Jain;Sarita Seshagiri;Simran Chopra	2016		10.1145/2957265.2961862	emotion;artificial intelligence;communication studies;multimedia	HCI	-83.97455808941746	-19.071427931379805	10293

783833fc5cd17918deef8c74b8080b197f804bee	explaining 'irrationalities' of it-enabled change in a developing country bureaucracy: case of ghana's tradenet		Through a case study of Ghana’s TradeNet, a business-to-government (B2G) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) implemented to automate and integrate customs clearance, this article investigates ‘irrationalities’ of IT-enabled change in the context of a developing country bureaucracy. Our data revealed that despite TradeNet’s potential for full automation and integration, bureaucrats sometimes preferred manual, face-to-face, paper-based practices. We explain such outcome—often depicted in the literature as a kind of ‘irrationality’—by drawing upon the theoretical notion of institutional logics to trace underlying logics of TradeNet-enabled change. We investigate two specific TradeNet-enabled practices—Import Declaration Form (IDF) processing and risk controls—and show that where ‘irrationality’ was present (IDF processing), the managerial logic of TradeNet contradicted existing bureaucratic logics. We therefore interpret ‘irrationality’ as ‘good enough’ or satisficing when new logics of IT and old bureaucratic logics contradicted. Our findings move beyond success or failure interpretations typical in Information Systems in developing countries (ISDC) and ICT for development (ICT4D) research. We also enhance knowledge of IT-enabled change in developing country bureaucracies by moving beyond the organizational milieu to emphasize broader institutional forces in developing countries such as neopatrimonialism. Such theorization advances ISDC/ICT4D research where reconciling micro with macro accounts remains daunting.	bureaucracy;business-to-government;electronic data interchange;information system;milieu intérieur;tf–idf	Atta Addo	2016			bureaucracy;economic growth;developing country;computer science;economic system	HCI	-79.71738711053115	-2.3008300887126154	10306

In this paper, we propose calibrated self-grading as a more efficient alternative to peer grading. For self-grading, students assign themselves a grade that they think they deserve via an incentive-compatible mechanism that elicits maximally truthful judgements of performance. We show that the students’ self-evaluation scores obtained via this mechanism can be used to perform classic item response theory (IRT) analysis. In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the IRT parameters, we show that the self-assigned grades can be calibrated with a minimum amount of input from instructors or domain experts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed calibrated self-grading approach via simulations and experiments on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.	amazon mechanical turk;experiment;item response theory;scalability;simulation;the turk	Igor Labutov;Christoph Studer	2016			engineering management;grading (education);machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;item response theory;self-assessment;incentive	ML	-75.77144783900489	-48.20440982452682	10333

Fuller argues that “[software’s] ostensive neutrality can be taken as its ideological layer, as deserving of critique as any such myth” (Fuller, 2008b: p.3). Indeed, in direct contradiction and critique of this perceived neutrality, it is not difficult to find academic work that describes and discusses the cultural values bound up in software. Fuller’s edited collection abounds with illustrations of this point. Montfort uses the example of a software practice called ‘naming obfuscation’ to argue that “everything about a programmer’s task is not automatic, value-neutral, and disconnected from the meanings of words in the world” (Montfort, 2008). While it is relatively easy to demonstrate the non-neutrality of technologies, the important work comes in understanding how neutrality operates, how it is used to justify certain practices and exclude others. I address this issue in each chapter, with particular focus in chapters four and six. Affordance Ambiguity A key concept that has informed research into human and technology interaction in many academic fields is the idea of ‘affordances’ (Gibson, 1986: chapter 8). Of particular interest is the way that affordances have been used as a materialist corrective to the social constructivist approaches in STS in general and SCOT in particular (see: Lievrouw, 2014	active agenda;cyclomatic complexity;deterministic algorithm;digital electronics;distortion;emergence;emoticon;expanded memory;field research;imaginary time;mobile app;net neutrality;ostensive definition;performance;programmer;requirement;semiotics;situated;social constructivism;tablet computer;tracing (software);ubiquitous computing;value (ethics)	Ryan Patrick Burns	2015			engineering;knowledge management;management science;multimedia	HCI	-63.633438361078255	-31.04868276038758	10335
c53883a5847baf35c7ed212f8668b1957ea5541f	effects of facilitation on collaborative modeling sessions with a multi-touch uml editor		Models are primary artifacts in software development which influence the quality of the process and product. While students are trained to use design and development methodologies few teaching approaches address how they should create and evaluate alternative models to find a good solution. This paper suggests to complement common teaching formats with facilitated modeling sessions where small groups of students collaboratively work on a modeling problem. This experience increases the students' understanding of the importance of a shared understanding of the problem and design space. Students should also understand that they can actively shape their collaboration accordingly. A facilitation method for co-located modeling sessions with a multi-touch editor for UML class diagrams is introduced and its effectiveness is investigated in a comparative empirical study. The results suggest that students in facilitated teams not only developed more ideas than self-directed teams but that they also assessed and discussed them more thoroughly to come to a shared solution. Participants in both conditions considered the modeling session as a useful supplement for learning object-oriented modeling.	class diagram;multi-touch;software development;unified modeling language	Anke Dittmar;Gregor Buchholz;Mathias Kühn	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training Track (ICSE-SEET)	10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2017.14	computer science;software development;object-oriented analysis and design;modeling language;unified modeling language;applications of uml;model-driven architecture;facilitation;class diagram;knowledge management	SE	-83.8276764439018	-35.08057537659364	10339

Chromebooks can be given as an example of laptops that are produced for particular use—they are affordable and useful mobile devices, which are very suitable for classroom settings. Their main distinction from regular laptops is being cloud based. That is, it is dependent on the Internet connection thereby employs cloud services. In other words, it requires an Internet connection in order to be operated with full functionality. Mainly, it uses the Internet connection to run programs or access files. This also makes Chromebook users meet online, share files and communicate mutually with its unique features. Because students are very familiar with web-based environments, Chromebook use may provide students numerous online opportunities for information access. It is important to note that new technologies, such as Chromebooks, require users to practice using new devices with their new features in order to become familiar with them so they can benefit from those for instructional purposes. The focus of the current study on teachers’ use of laptops in educational settings led us to develop these research questions: 1. What is the relationship between teachers’ years of experience, number of technological devices they have and their comfort level in teaching with technology? 2. To what extent did Chromebook integration change teachers’ attitudes towards technology use? 3. What do teachers who used Chromebook laptops think about their instructional use of the laptops?

However, previous studies noted that participants did not value online conferencing as a method for conducting in-depth discussions, and instead considered this method as merely scratching the surface of the issues involved. Therefore, the teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success of CMC. This study presents a methodology that uses knowledge acquisition techniques during online discourses to increase student conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The methodology explains the conceptual frameworks of individuals and the conceptual relationships between student peers. Active database triggers then are applied to automatically monitor the conceptual relationships and to moderate online discourses between student peers. Student reactions demonstrated that discourses mediated by the repertory grid analysis technique helped group members not only promote common conceptual understandings but also to approach the level of conceptual understanding of the teacher. Introduction Web-based learning systems are numerous and allow students to perform various learning activities, including reading, messaging, conferencing, accessing documents, and participating in interactive activities, in a virtual classroom (Hiltz, 1994). An integrated collection of computer-mediated communication (CMC) (Steeples et al , 1996; Wilson & Whitelock, 1998) tools has been designed on the Web to support peer 822 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 36 No 5 2005 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2005. discourses in virtual classrooms. Online discourses conducted using CMC can help researchers and educators to achieve diverse pedagogic goals. For instance, Salmon (2002) successfully developed, moderated, and explored reflect-on-practice activities (Schon, 1983) with an asynchronous text conferencing system. Lazarowitz and Natan (2002) combined CMC with cooperative learning to promote the power of a cooperative learning environment. Moreover, Austin (1997) successfully mediated and resolved conflict among students using a computer conferencing system. Therefore, engaging students in online discourse through CMC has played an important role in developing participant knowledge. Reflectively communicating with peers and teachers enables students to critically question both the ends and the means of solving practical problems based on personal experience (Christie & Menmuir, 1997). However, students may freely participate in online discourse, but have no responsibility and ability to generate meaningful and high-level mentoring messages that are valuable for promoting peer learning experiences. Angeli, Valanides and Bonk (2003) noted a common problem in online discourses, namely that participants did not value online discourses as a means of discussing issues in depth; instead, for each case, participants merely scratched the surface, because most online discourses merely involved social acknowledgement and general advice. Therefore, it is suggested that teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success of online conferences (Salmon, 2002). Researchers and educators typically stress that the goal of education is not only the acquisition of knowledge, but also the acquisition of application, analysis, and evaluation skills (Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill & Krathwohl, 1956). This study presents a methodology for enhancing student conceptual understanding when they apply learning concepts to evaluate and analyse practical applications. Computer-supported tools have been utilised to enhance student high-level skill of analysis, evaluation, and application while using learning concepts. For instance, Davies and Berrow (1998) utilised computer-supported peer review to develop evaluation and analysis skills. Moreover, Howard-Jones and Martin (2002) employed embedded questions in hypertext to promote student skills in applying learned technical concepts. Additionally, Crandall and Phillips (2002) applied a hypertext system to help students link conceptual knowledge to practical case applications. Instead of adopting an individual learning approach, this study engages students in discourses with student peers, moderated with a web-based learning system to improve student conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The web-based learning system is designed to satisfy teacher requirements for performing the tasks of probing and triggering a debate to serve as a moderator of online discourse (Salmon, 2002). Additionally, an individual experiences conceptual conflict when engaged in controversy as ideas and arguments are presented that are incongruent with one’s original position; and the resolution of conflicts may yield high-quality learning and decision-making processes (Johnson & Johnson, 1995). Therefore, the web-based learning system is developed based on knowledge acquisition techniques that probes personal perspectives Knowledge acquisition techniques 823 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2005. on learning concepts and mediates conflict resolution between student peers in an asynchronous discourse. The web-based learning system implements knowledge acquisition techniques (Boose, 1989; Ford, Bradshaw, Webber & Agnew, 1993; Karen & Karen, 1989) to elicit student’ conceptual frameworks and the conceptual relationships between student peers. The system then generates summaries that report conflictive understanding of learning concepts and engage students to discuss the conflicts. Both teachers and the system can automatically detect consensus and conflict between peers, and accordingly mediate the conflict resolution to promote the conceptual understanding of learning concepts and evaluation skills for practical applications. Illustrative example—concept learning of database design and applications This section details a web-based learning system used to help students learn Database Design and Applications. Following instruction in a conventional classroom, the teacher organised an activity to promote student understanding of 11 database design concepts, namely, Reusability , Use Case Grouping , Package , Manageability , Generalisation , Type Safety , Multiple Inheritance , Interface , Complex Data Type , Join Performance , and Concurrency . To link these concepts to practical database design methodologies, students were required to analyse and evaluate various database design models and database management systems using these concepts. The database design models and database management systems included the Entity-Relationship Model (ER), Unified Modelling Language (UML), Extended Entity-Relationship Model (EER), Relational Database (RDB), Object-Oriented Database (OODB), Object-Relational Database (ORDB), and Personal Databases such as Microsoft Access. Additionally, each student must participate in an online discourse in which they discuss with a peer these database design concepts, database design models, and database management systems through the web-based learning system. Student understanding of the database design concepts was expected to be closer to the conceptions of the teacher following the discourse. Jarz, Kainz and Walpoth (1997) indicated the combination of collaborative approaches and case-based learning realises the social negotiation of meaning in communities. This study incorporates repertory grid techniques into the online discourse to facilitate the exchange of perspectives. The repertory grid techniques originate in personal construct psychology (Kelly, 1955). Notably, the repertory grid technique represents a reflective device for raising self-awareness and encouraging understanding of the perspectives of others (Pope & Keen, 1981, p. 114). Using a repertory grid to acquire personal perspectives entailed preparing elements , eliciting personal concepts ( constructs in Kelly’s terminology) with these elements, and evaluating these elements with these elicited concepts. In this study, the teacher chose as elements six database design methodologies, using different database design models and database management systems, and allowed students to evaluate these elements using the specified database design concepts. 824 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 36 No 5 2005 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2005. Student peers were required to participate in an element evaluation activity to evaluate the selected elements before the online discourses. Students could express their understanding of the selected elements by scoring the elements with a number from 1 to 5 in relation to the 11 database design concepts. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates how two students evaluated the six elements based on the 11 database design concepts. Student Tseng rated the ER and RDB highly, with a score of 4, in relation to the construct Reusability , while student Chen rated it with a low score of 2.

It is not easy that teachers want to block access to the Internet for online cheating activities. Therefore, an offline E-testing system is needed. However, existing offline E-testing systems are always developed ad hoc for particular purpose and procedures. This paper presents a general-purpose offline E-testing environment and shows its usefulness, security, and conveniency in a practical application.	general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;hoc (programming language);internet;online and offline	Hongbiao Gao;Zhe Wang;Yuan Zhou;Jingde Cheng	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)	10.1109/CIS.2016.0146	the internet;simulation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;software testing;world wide web;computer security;server	SE	-68.93998380689764	-40.41322841164904	10405

Visualization interfaces to improve SA were developed for SWoRD. Students were provided with opportunities to self-monitor and self-evaluate their writing with the use of multiple peer feedback. The study results show that although all the students did not develop their SA with the interfaces, the students who developed SA drastically improved their writing skills compared to those who did not enhance SA. Finally, the results are discussed and future research topics are suggested.	self-awareness	Kwangsu Cho;Moon-Heum Cho	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73257-0_32	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	Theory	-73.3722589625226	-41.26654992513749	10417

However, in order to teach and learn project management for systems engineering students, a new methodology based on dynamic models and real-time simulation is introduced. A project management course for students in systems engineering included learning how to use the Project Management Trainer (PMT) that simulates a dynamic, stochastic project management environment. The students used the simulator both in single-user mode (simple project management) and in multi-user multi-project mode. A class of 66 students performed repetitive simulation-runs (in single-user mode) with a break period of several weeks between the runs and repetitive simulation-runs in multi-user mode. The students used different history recording mechanisms. For the single-user mode, manual or automatic history recording mechanisms were used by the experimental group, while the control group did not use any history recording mechanism. The findings indicate that for the initial learning phase, the manual mechanism is better than the automatic mechanism. However, for the relearning phase, the break period length influenced the performance after the break. A comparison between the experimental group and the control group for both single-user mode and multi-user mode revealed that using any history recording mechanism reduced forgetting. Based on the findings, some practical implications of using simulators to improve the learning-forgetting process are discussed.	experiment;internet backbone;multi-user;real-time transcription;simulation;single user mode;systems engineering;user space	Lior Davidovitch;Avy Shtub;Avi Parush	2007	2007 International Conference on Systems Engineering and Modeling	10.1109/ICSEM.2007.373329	project management;simulation;systems modeling;engineering education;spine;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;automatic control;scientific control	SE	-81.95591464506461	-35.07093964866306	10444

The intent of our experiment was to test whether the use of a GSS had a positive effect on the quality of the group processes and the quality of group results. We found that process facilitation and time effects have more influence on group processes and outcomes than did the use of a GSS.		Ronald Batenburg;Frank J.

Despite the ambitious goals, ubiquitous music is still unknown territory in schools. In this study, we have tried to identify whether ubiquitous music environments can enable novice music students to participate in meaningful learning activities in a short period of time inside the school classroom. The proposed approach, named ImproviSchool, consists of two basic elements: a) a set of tangible music interfaces, and b) a fairy tale for which the students are asked to compose a soundtrack. The fairy tale is broken down into smaller episodes and for each one, the students are asked to compose a music score and dramatize the narration. At the end, students have to perform their creations in front of an audience. The whole process is aimed to last only two sessions of 2 school hours. ImproviSchool was applied in two 4th grade school classrooms of 15 students each, with the aim of evaluating both the set of the music tangible interfaces and the instructional approach. Data were collected through questionnaires and focus groups with the students as well as an interview with the music teacher. Students found the “music images” for playing and composing music easy, attractive, expressive, and enjoyable, and within a very short time frame, they created their own musical arrangements. Students showed enthusiastic with what they had produced and with their performance while at the same time achieving music learning objectives regarding instrument recognition, rhythm, pitch, volume and execution style. The realization of such a demanding activity in just 2 sessions shows that ubiquitous music can radically change the way in which musical learning evolves in schools.	emoticon;focus group;pitch (music)	George Palaigeorgiou;Christos Pouloulis	2017	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-017-9608-z	psychology;popular music;simulation;multimedia;pop music automation;communication;musicality;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-67.05841633267013	-39.69627840225404	10454

Increasing number of startups and established developers are alike offering their products in different marketplaces such as Android Market and Apple App Store. In this paper, we are studying revenue models used in Android Market. For analysis, we gathered the data of 351,601 applications from their public pages at the marketplace. From these, a random sample of 100 applications was used in a qualitative study of revenue streams. The results indicate that a part of the marketplace can be explained with traditional models but free applications use complex revenue models. Basing on the qualitative analysis, we identified four general business strategy categories for further studies.

It seeks to shed new light on the reasons why the field continues to debate its identity and to voice concerns about its recognition by other disciplines. For that purpose the paper adapts selected concepts from the community of practice literature for improving our understanding of the ways in which the IS research community differentiates itself into diverse constituencies, called communities of practice and knowing (CoP&K), and how these interact in the field’s complex processes of knowledge creation and dissemination. Our second purpose is to derive some tentative, actionable recommendations for the field from applying the concepts presented in the first part of the paper. The recommendations expand three fundamental ideas: (i) why a continuously updated history of the field could be an important contribution to support boundary spanning and identity formation; (ii) what the nature and role of fundamental criticism is for the IS research community and why it is necessary for the field’s future to pay more institutional attention to it; and (iii) how to improve understanding and communication within each paradigm constituency across a broad subset of different CoP&K through building a shared sense of collective historical accomplishments. The conclusions summarize the principal results which follow from our examination of the field’s community structures and insist that the CoP&K perspective concomitantly helps to better appreciate the underlying conditions from where the current IS disciplinary challenges have arisen; it also helps to suggest d.

It provides a sense of larger reality of diverse work than could be seen by a local practitioner. Instructional design can be viewed as a process-based and purposive approach to the design of online learning, whether humanfacilitated or automated, real-time or asynchronous, individualistic or group-oriented. The Instructional Design Open Studio was started in February 2006 to bring together the disparate individuals who work in the design of e-learning in higher education, private industries, the government, and the military to share expertise, evolve ideas and practices, and raise the quality of instructional design work through mediated human connections. With the colloquial interchanges and wide publishing reach, IDOS has served as a fine professional sounding board on a wide range of issues in instructional design: technological, pedagogical, ethical, social, legal, policy-based, and strategic. This has expanded awareness of practices beyond the local to the global. This essay focuses on the development and evolution of the Instructional Design Open Studio blog as a socio-technical space. The author examines the steps of creating this collaborative academic and professional blog, from its early conceptualization to implementation. The article first reviews the pertinent literature on blog use in professional and academic realms. It then dwells on the issues of design and development of the IDOS blog, including technologies, content classification, branding, publicity strategies, audience engagement, and lessons learned.

fb1985c7d67508f162f4de7eb6128e45bbe5e0a2	global fishing watch: bringing transparency to global commercial fisheries		Across all major industrial fishing sectors, overfishing due to overcapacity and lack of compliance in fishery governance has led to a decline in biomass of many global fish stocks. Overfishing threatens ocean biodiversity, global food security, and the livelihoods of law abiding fishermen. To address this issue, Global Fishing Watch (GFW) was created to bring transparency to global fisheries using computer science and big data analytics. A product of a partnership between Oceana, SkyTruth and Google, GFW uses the Automatic Identification System, or AIS, to analyze the movement of vessels at sea. AIS provides vessel location data, and GFW uses this information to track global vessel movement and apply algorithms to classify vessel behavior as “fishing” or “non-fishing” activity. Now publicly available, anyone with an internet connection can monitor when and where trackable commercial fishing appears to be occurring around the world. Hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on our ocean for their livelihoods, and many more rely on it for food. Collectively, the various applications of GFW will help reduce overfishing and illegal fishing, restore the ocean’s abundance, and ensure sustainability through better monitoring and governance of our marine resources.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;big data;computer science;internet access;multi-level governance	Wessley Merten;Adam Reyer;Jackie Savitz;John Amos;Paul Woods;Brian Sullivan	2016	CoRR		environmental resource management	ML	-75.4282248860068	-8.949108592387649	10583

Our findings show that the students' visual scanning behaviours fall into three different types of eye fixation patterns, and the data corresponding to the different types relates to the performance of the students in other related academic modules. We conclude that this method of studying eye fixation patterns can identify different types of learners with respect to cognitive activities and academic potentials, allowing educators to understand how their instructional design using online learning environments can stimulate higher-order cognitive activities.	eb-eye;eye tracking	Benedict The;Manolis Mavrikis	2016		10.1145/2883851.2883871	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-73.87719659475007	-42.66237806280809	10609

Providing such data to a website, when usually users don’t even know where the company is located, has brought concerns about the use of private information by online business. Some countries have started to pass laws and guidelines regarding the use of private information gathered online, and also non government associations have started to certificate websites in the use and management of personal data. This study explores and analyzes the content of 120 privacy statements from online companies established in Mexico to address all privacy dimensions that seems to be important in online environment and to evaluate characteristics and differences in the use of the personal identifiable information among them. When possible, a comparison is made between some of the results of this research for companies operating in Mexico, and the findings made by Pollach (2006) for companies operating in U.S.A. Finally some possible future work is described and some conclusions are made.	e-commerce;electronic business;information exchange;internet privacy;personally identifiable information	Celestino Robles-Estrada;Juan Antonio Vargas-Barraza;Ma.

b2d2acf911dadae22caf80a712fb0713a2c5cc4b	"""perseverance is crucial for learning. """"ok! but can i take a break?"""""""		In a study with 108 10- to 12-year-olds who used a digital educational game targeting history, we addressed the phenomenon of perseverance, that is, the tendency to stick with a task even when it is challenging. The educational game was designed to make all students encounter tasks they did not succeed to solve, at which point they were offered a set of choices corresponding to perseverance and non-perseverance. Methods used were behavioral log data, post-questionnaires, and an in-game questionnaire conducted by a game character, who asked the students about the reason for their choice. Overall, we found no differences between high and low-perseverance students as to their experiences of effort, difficulty, and learning, and neither in their self-reported motives for persevering – when doing so. With respect to performance, however, high-persevering students solved significantly more tasks at higher difficulty levels. Comparing high-perseverance students who tended to take a break directly after a failed test – before they continued with the same task – with those who did not take a break, we found no significant differences, indicating that taking a break is not detrimental to learning and perseverance.

To this end, an instructional dialogue must be seen as a process aimed at making student and teacher learn from each other: the student has to learn the subject matter from the teacher, while the teacher has in turn to learn from the student how to regulate instructional interaction. The process relies on different kinds of expert knowledge: experience of the domain, about the actual student, and of teaching methods and objectives. This means that an instructional dialogue cannot be realised without an explicit representation of all the kinds of knowledge involved. Research has established that Knowledge Based Educational Systems (KBESs) can be the keystone in building effective learning tools, but because of the difficulty in realising a system of this kind, most existing systems are prototypes and are intended only as workbenches for the computational analysis of educational processes. This paper analyses the main problems which underlie the realisation of such systems, with reference to research into knowledge based systems intended for use with teaching/learning mathematics. Introduction Various conceptual factors must be taken into account in order to realise a Knowledge Based Educational System (KBES) 0 epistemological aspects, concerning the nature and the structure of the domain (theories and methods typical of the theories) constituting the object of the instruction; 0 cognitive assumptions, concerning the nature of the learning activity itself and the mental attitude of the specific student: 0 pedagogical problems, concerning the analysis of the student’s mastering of Knowledge based systems for teaching and Zearning math 43 Theories and Epistemological methods organisation COGNITIVE THEORIES Nature of Mental attitude learning activity of students Prerequisites Comprehension Object of Adequacy for of student needs learning students’ needs AnalYSlS of students‘ Methodologies . behaviour I I PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS 1 1 EDUCATIONAL CHOICES Figure 1: Conceptual framework of a KBES pre-requisites, the comprehension of the student’s understanding (and misunderstanding) of the object of learning, the teacher’s capability of learning from interaction with the student: 0 educational choices, regarding the specific topic of the teaching, the general teaching methods to be followed, the changes in teaching method depending on students behaviour; and 0 the instructional dialogue represents the adaptation of the educational choices to the current pedagogical situation. The analysis of epistemological and cognitive aspects constitutes the basis for handling pedagogical and educational problems. An understanding of how the cognitive theory adopted applies to the domain at hand is required to explain (at least to some extent) the causes of a student’s behaviour. Analogously, the teaching method can be adapted to a specific student only when the student’s actions are interpreted on the basis of the cognitive hypothesis and by taking into account the structure of the domain of learning. On the basis of this analysis, the central problem in the design of a knowledge based system able to generate instructional situations involves the realisation of a computational model of the structure outlined in Figure 1. Cognitive theory offers a series of tools to understand the kinds of knowledge and their 44 British Journul of Educational Technology Vol26 No 1 1995 integration into this structure: A1 methods and technology make it possible to analyse this problem by using a computational approach (Ohlsson, 1992). The development of these sciences achieved two important results: the identification of the main features to be embedded in a system aimed at carrying out an educational dialogue and the identification of the general architecture of such systems (Wenger, 1987). Nevertheless, research in the field remains at an experimental stage, and it appears to be quite difficult to devise a standard method that can be followed to engineer the production of instructional systems (Duchastel, 199 1). This paper analyses the main difficulties underlying the computational modelling of educational processes, through discussion of the best known approaches proposed by the literature; with references to research into knowledge based systems intended for use in teaching/learning mathematics. KBESs in mathematics education Several considerations, apart from our own experience in the field, led us to focus on the mathematics domain. From a technical point of view, mathematics is highly structured and its algorithms are well-defined, making it easier to concentrate on the features of the KBES itself, rather than on those of the domain (Nwana, 1990); from a cognitive point of view, mathematics domains involve the acquisition of well-defined skills and we can get hold students when they are just beginning to learn the skill (Anderson et al., 1990). Moreover, learning mathematics problem solving is difficult, due to the abstraction of the domain, and previous experience on computer based learning system has shown that the computer has the potential to revolutionise the teaching of college mathematics. From a curriculum point of view, mathematics is a fundamental topic, as it underlies most of science and engineering; from an educational point of view, mathematics teachers are experienced with computers in classroom, thus facilitating experimentation with such systems. Because of these factor, there have been several KBESs focusing on the maths domain (Nwana, 1993b). Initial research worked on arithmetic: the majority centred on algebra with a few on geometry and calculus and only recently, some authors have focused their attention on KBESs for learning theorem proving concepts in formal systems. As regards level, college is the usual choice while only a few systems target primary and university levels (Forcheri and Molfino, 1993). In almost all cases, thought is given to the learning problem solving in mathematics, with different aims and approaches: 0 aiming to analyse students’ behaviour in order to diagnose their difficulties on a 0 to experiment with cognitive theory in order to monitor and predict student’s 0 to build a system to help students in learning through the examples of an expert’s specific topic;	algorithm;automated theorem proving;bus mastering;cognition;cognitive architecture;cognitive science;computation;computational model;computer;embedded system;experiment;formal system;keystone effect;knowledge-based systems;list comprehension;pedagogical agent;problem solving;subject matter expert turing test;teaching method;theory	Paola Forcheri;Maria Teresa Molfino	1995	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.1995.tb00119.x	psychology;mathematics education;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;knowledge-based systems;teaching method;pedagogy	AI	-78.45983757776186	-48.432685373523626	10808

A two-phase survey was conducted for a range of organisations from different industry sectors to collect empirical data to test the validity and reliability of the measurement model for the multidimensionality of partnership quality. The measurement model for partnership quality was confirmed by the results of the data analyses. This research also aimed to identify the significant relationships between these dimensions using a second generation multivariate analysis technique—partial least squares(PLS). The findings from results of the data analyses show that inter-organisational trust, shared business understanding and to a lesser extent, functional and dysfunctional conflict between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship are the key determinants of partnership quality. The key outcome of high partnership quality between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship is mutual beneficial sharing of risks and benefits. Commitment is confirmed as a multidimensional construct of behaviour and temporal/continuance commitment but is not is influenced by the other dimensions of partnership quality. Trust and shared business understanding are the key drivers in the IT outsourcing relationship ensuring that the sharing of risks and benefits are realised and conflict is minimised leading to a high quality and ultimately successful partnership between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor. Furthermore behavioural commitment to the contractual obligations of an IT outsourcing relationship sustains an ongoing temporal commitment to the partnership between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor.	outsourcing	Michael Steven Lane;Weng Haan Lum	2010	Australasian J. of Inf.

Indeed, several serious games have developed in recent years, and it is often difficult for a teacher, not a computer scientist in particular, to find and choose a game that meets its specific needs. Our aim is to develop models and tools to support teachers/trainers in their choice of serious games through knowledge extraction of educational objectives, considering user feedback and their traces of interaction with the game.	computer scientist;tracing (software)	Afef Ghannem;Karim Sehaba;Raoudha Khchérif;Henda Hajjami Ben Ghézala	2017	2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2017.80	multimedia;knowledge management;knowledge extraction;ontology (information science);computer science;game developer;game mechanics	Robotics	-77.86337909311305	-37.12944979358767	10829
c4ad2b46287241d6d975b70dcdb5be27740866fe	using a robust performance measurement system to illuminate intellectual capital		The central premise of the “fit-as-mediation” view states that knowledge-related factors could determine the usage and design of specific organizational systems, such as management accounting and control systems. This could, in turn, facilitate information processing and bring about positive organizational outcomes. While the influence of knowledge-based assets on measurable performance has been examined extensively in the intellectual capital literature, little is known concerning the role of an organizational control system in fostering the management of intellectual capital as the most strategic asset for organizations. As such, this study primarily aims to explore what role a performance measurement system plays in terms of the diversity of measurement in the relationship between intellectual capital and organizational performance. We incorporate social capital into the general three-dimensional classification of intellectual capital; namely, human capital, structural capital, and relational capital, to provide a more comprehensive measure of intellectual capital. Further, we conceptualize the diversity of measurement by supplementing the original Kaplan and Norton's BSC model with a new perspective, social and environmental measures. Such integration of financial, customer, internal business process, learning, and growth, along with social and environmental measures could result in an overarching and robust conceptualization of performance measurement; a concept that was barely mentioned in previous literature. We conducted a questionnaire survey involving chief financial officers of 128 Iranian public listed companies. Using the partial least squares (PLS), we find that companies with higher levels of intellectual capital emphasize a greater diversity of performance measures. The findings also show that the diversity of measurement mediates the relationship between intellectual capital and organizational performance. This paper may offer guidance to companies concerning the competencies needed for securing positive organizational outcomes from their knowledge resources, such as intellectual capital.	binary symmetric channel;business process;conceptualization (information science);control system;customer relationship management;darknet market;data system;database;feedback;information processing;iranian.com;job stream;kaplan–meier estimator;keneth alden simons;organizational behavior;partial least squares regression;quality of service;region of interest;requirement;response time (technology);simplified instructional computer;small outline integrated circuit;social capital;system of measurement;thinking outside the box;ven (currency)	Kaveh Asiaei;Ruzita Jusoh	2017	Int.

473f8c035d877eb9e4d4100cc9eb311b646a2eb3	instructional frameworks: toolkits and abstractions in introductory computer science	computer science education;introductory computer science	Computer science education has been changing over the past few years. The Denning Report [4] and the ACM-IEEE Curriculum 91 [6] helped trigger a number of new initiatives aimed at improving computer science education, especially at the introductory level. One proposal is the use of closed laboratories to improve programming instruction. A second idea is to add breadth to the introductory curriculum. A third suggestion is to introduce more formal instruction in theoretical computer science. These proposals have merit but their implementation is problematic. Often the projects suggested for closed laboratories are too simple and uninteresting. The breadth component is frequently poorly integrated with the programming component. The theoretical material is often presented before students have sufficient practical and scientific experience to follow what is presented and understand its significance. Furthermore, software engineering is preached rather than practiced since neither demonstration programs nor student projects are large enough for genuine software engineering methods to be illustrated. At Northeastern, we have developed a teaching paradigm which integrates a number of ideas in current science curriculum reform with some approaches that are unique to our institution. Our teaching emphasizes visualization and interaction both in animated demonstrations that we provide and in laboratories and assignments that we ask students to complete. We believe that software design and development is an incremental process so we provide students with substantial bodies of code to read, expand, and modify. In effect, our model is an apprentice based approach in which students make meaningful contributions to interesting software products but are not required to program every detail. Theoretical concepts are taught in the context of practical algorithm and data structure design problems. Software engineering is emphasized throughout as the combination of theoretical ideas, design techniques such as abstraction and the use of tools, and technical knowledge such as programming languages and system expertise.	algorithm;data structure;david gries;dorothy e. denning;douglas comer;emulator;intellect;list of toolkits;programming language;programming paradigm;scientific visualization;software design and development;software engineering;springer (tank);theoretical computer science;tucker decomposition;turtle geometry;wheels	Cynthia A.

However, digital libraries should provide more than advanced collection maintenance and retrieval services since the ultimate goal of any (academic) library is to serve the scholarly needs of its users. This paper begins by presenting a case for digital scholarship in which patrons perform all scholarly work electronically. A proposal is then made for patron-augmented digital libraries (PADLs), a class of digital libraries that supports the digital scholarship of its patrons. Finally, a prototype PADL (called Synchrony) providing access to video segments and associated textual transcripts is described. Synchrony allows patrons to search the library for artifacts, create annotations/original compositions, integrate these artifacts to form synchronized mixed text and video presentations and, after suitable review, publish these presentations into the digital library if desired. A study to evaluate the PADL concept and the usability of Synchrony is also discussed. The study revealed that participants were able to use Synchrony for the authoring and publishing of presentations and that attitudes toward PADLs were generally positive.	digital library;digital scholarship;library (computing);prototype;usability	Dion Hoe-Lian Goh;John J.

cbbf6f71f3bf5e849ab96a47e673c9486f8f91f8	digital activism: a hierarchy of political commitment		Political action has a long history. Information systems provide new affordances for political action that go well beyond sending an email to elected officials or “liking” a political Facebook page. Digital activism -political action enabled by Information Systems (IS) -not only provides citizens with enhanced opportunities for organization and communication, but also allows opportunities to take direct political action and create greater impact with fewer resources.

Specifically, our work considered how university students learning in a knowledge work model---one that is collaborative, project-based, and that relies on consistent peer-to-peer interaction and feedback---might leverage learning analytics as formative assessment to foster metacognition and improve final deliverables. We describe Uatu, a system designed to visualize the real time contribution and edit history of collaboratively written documents. After briefly describing the technical details of this system, we offer initial findings from a fifteen week qualitative case study of 8 computer science students who used Uatu in conjunction with Google Docs while collaborating on a variety of writing and programming tasks. These findings indicate both the challenges and promise of delivering useful metrics for collaborative writing scenarios in academe and industry.	computer science;docs (software);peer-to-peer;prototype	Brian J.

Building on research that suggests that SMOs can influence institutions and the path of emerging industries, we show that the growth of an industry can also influence the diversity of social movements by motivating the participation of specialist SMOs. These new SMOs in turn deploy distinct knowledge, capabilities, goals, and strategies to produce institutional changes that are necessary for the continued growth of the industry. Our study offers a more complete conceptualization of the influence of social movements on industry emergence and growth, and it extends understanding of how SMO diversity is produced.		Desirée F.

Control, power, and culture are thus strongly intertwined in the interaction of people in the municipality. The current situation entails that the management in the municipality approaches IT projects from a linear and reductionist perspective, assuming that the world is controllable, predictable and manageable. Experience has shown that these projects often do not lead to the desired results. This article discuss a good balance between the concepts power, control, and culture that is essential for sustainable change management, but it is important to note that this balance is context dependent and can only be achieved by learning from our own behavior by reflecting on our thoughts and actions. This is a process of lifelong learning. For this reason, this study approaches IT projects from a different perspective, based on complex responsive process theory, in order to understand what happens during change projects, potentially leading to lifelong learning not only in the workplace, but also in the academic classrooms of managers.	change management (engineering);experience;reductionism	Walter Bolwerk;Jan M.

However, paper lists are also shown to be poor at handling the separation, or classification, of these things. In conclusion, both these positive and negative aspects of list making are used to raise broad pointers for CSCW and system design.	centrality;computer-supported cooperative work;organizing (structure);statistical classification;systems design	Alex S.

In order to explore the target values that learners pursue through MOOCs, this study adopted Means-end Chains theory and laddering interview to examine the structure of MOOCs’ ‘‘Platform Attribute–Learning Consequences–Terminal Values’’ through learners’ perspective. The study found that through platform attributes of Rich course contents, Real-time discussion platform, Video instruction and Qualifications, learners were able to benefit from the learning consequences of Enhanced understanding of knowledge, Facilitation of learning exchanges and interactions, Ease of time management and Improve competitiveness, thereby delivering the terminal values of Fun and enjoyment of life, Self-fulfillment and Sense of achievement. The study also took a further step to examine the discrepancies between user groups of different experience and number of courses completed and found that users in different groups emphasized on different attributes. In addition, the study also offered suggestions pertaining to management and education implications. Results of the study should not only enable platform designers to become more effective in the development process but also enable teachers to develop teaching guidelines that will effectively boost learners’ motivations so as to further refine the MOOCs learning environment. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

85aa6c9668aa004f3ddf7412a10bbd2cfd1c0553	de modo operandi: towards the interoperability of workflow information		The research reported in this dissertation deals with work ow management and electronic publishing. Recent developments like the evolvement of international standards, advanced communication services, as well as new delivery platforms, have resulted in a bewildering number of work ow systems, each of them being a proprietary solution. The consequences are noninteroperable systems where work ow information cannot be exchanged, a fact which does back re with the ideas of recent developments. HyTime is an international standard for the exchange of time-dependent, structured information. So-called HyTime architectural forms were developed for representing work ow information. Through this as well as through additional layers in the architecture of our work ow system we enable the interoperability of work ow information between di erent systems. We investigate the publishing process and derive requirements for system support. Existing systems, both research prototypes as well as commercial systems are subject of the following investigation. Based on these investigations we have speci ed an architecture for work ow systems. Speci cation and Implementation of a prototypical system developed in VisualworksnSmalltalk demonstrate the usability of the concept by a running system. The role of work ow within CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) is investigated. Concluding remarks including the signi cance of our approach as well as future work nish the dissertation. 1 Acknowledgements I would like to thank both, Prof. Drs.

9b4fe5c590412014037d7e9e1e952c1d6fbe2e74	theory-driven automated content analysis of suicidal tweets : using typicality-based classification for lda dataset		This study provides a methodological framework to classify tweets according to variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We present a sequential process of automated text analysis which combined supervised approach and unsupervised approach in order to detect one of TPB variables in each tweet. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), Nearest Neighbor, and then assessed “typicality” of newly labeled tweets in order to predict classification boundary. Furthermore, this study reports findings from a content analysis of suicide-related tweets which identify traits of information environment in Twitter. Consistent with extant literature about suicide coverage, the findings demonstrate that tweets often contain information which prompt perceived behavior control of committing suicide, while rarely provided deterring information on suicide. We conclude by highlighting implications for methodological advances and empirical theory studies. THEORY-DRIVEN AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF SUICIDAL TWEETS 3 Introduction Every year an estimated 788,000 people kill themselves worldwide and in South Korea alone more than 10,000 people commit suicide annually (KOSTAT, 2015; WHO, 2015). Many studies suggest that the way media depicts suicide can have an influence on people’s attitude towards suicidal behaviors, which is often represented as suicide contagion or “Werther effect” (Philips, 1974). This risk is thought to depend not only on victim’s personal characteristics but also on the volume of coverage and description of suicidal behaviors (Tatum, Canetto & Slater, 2010). To date, the greater part of evidence for suicide contagion is found in studies on traditional media (Lee et al., 2014; Romer, Jamieson & Jamieson, 2006). However, recent public health studies take into account not only traditional media but also social media as an influential source of suicide contagion (Luxton, June & Fairall, 2012). In Korea, suicide is the leading cause of death among teens to thirties (KOSTAT, 2015) and there are several ways social media can increase risk of suicide, especially to young people. One possible reason for suicide among young people is, large quantities of suicide-related information shared via social media. Considering that 90% of young adults use social media (Perrin, 2015) and they are psychologically more vulnerable with higher risk behaviors (Dobson, 1999), the volume of suicide description and suicidal information on lethal means to kill oneself are highly likely to have an impact on young adults. The other is disinhibition that people reduce preexisting restraints on the specific behavior by watching others commit suicide in media (Romer, Jamieson & Jamieson, 2006). Since a large number of messages including suicidal experiences are spread through social media, it is likely to lead people to a higher risk of suicide by reducing doubts or fears on committing suicide. To deepen our understanding of the potential impact of social media on suicidal THEORY-DRIVEN AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF SUICIDAL TWEETS 4 behaviors, we performed an automated content analysis on suicide-related tweets, grounded on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991). According to the TPB, individual beliefs on certain behavior predict intention to perform that behavior. To identify potentially encouraging or deterring messages that can affect individuals’ beliefs on suicide, we classified suicidal tweets according to TPB variables such as attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavior control(PBC). The specific aims of this article are twofold. First, we seek to analyze what kinds of suicidal messages are distributed on Twitter. Some studies attempted to analyze linguistic features of victims who committed suicide (Gunn & Lester, 2015; Stirmen & Pennenbaker, 2001), while others examined suicide coverage in traditional media (Gould et al., 2014; Schäfer & Quiring, 2015; Tatum, Canetto & Slater, 2010). However, few studies have applied behavior change theories to assess possible effect of suicidal messages. Thus, we look forward to inferring the potential effect of Twitter usage by revealing theory-based components of suicide-related tweets. The second is to develop an automated way to classify large amounts of tweets with minimal amounts of human-annotated data. Although computational text analyses help to scale up the amount of corpus by reducing calculation costs, researchers often face several impediments when attempting to capture latent meanings in complex semantic structures such as metaphors or sarcastic expressions (Shutova et al., 2017). To deal with this problem, many researchers have applied supervised learning algorithms, in which computer learns linguistic patterns from manually annotated documents to classify unlabeled documents. In this process, a large quantity of manually annotated documents is required in order to learn sufficient information for which to classify. This makes supervised learning approach dependent on the coverage or availability of data resources, limiting the application of supervised learning in the context of behavior change THEORY-DRIVEN AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF SUICIDAL TWEETS 5 theories. The lack of annotated corpora for the computer to classify text dataset according to behavior change theories makes this approach difficult to apply. Furthermore, fewer lexical resources are available which can be applied to suicidal issue and even fewer in another language such as Korean. As a solution to that problem, we conducted subsequent automated analyses with a small number of human-annotated documents. In this study, we took steps toward developing automated text analytic models for detecting TPB variables in tweets, using LDA (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) followed by the Nearest Neighbor (Cover & Hart, 1967). Then, researchers engaged to judge the scope of clusters with typicality measurement. The role of theory in content analysis Content analysis is a research method that aims to understand patterns of messages (Krippendorff, 2012; Manganello & Fishbein, 2008). Even though content analysis does not necessarily require theoretical background, the use of theory can be beneficial for two reasons. First of all, it is more efficient because theory offers guidance for selecting both constructs and methodological approaches. In its absence, research designs, variables, measurements and hypotheses are likely to be too arbitrary and fragmented to cumulate in a meaningful way (Steinfield & Fulk, 1987). The second benefit is, theory can provide a basis for combining content analytic findings with media effect studies (Manganello & Blake, 2010; Manganello & Fishbein, 2008). The ability to propose explanations is an important factor in media studies, and theory-based content analysis is likely to make contributions to further research by describing information environment we are exposed to (Steinfield & Fulk, 1987). Content analysis itself provides description of media content and assesses the amount of a particular media type, however, once theory-based variables of media content are identified, then researchers can combine content analytic data with survey data to build an argument for media effects (De Vreese et al., 2017). THEORY-DRIVEN AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF SUICIDAL TWEETS 6 The Theory of planned behavior TPB is applied to this content analysis to investigate the prevalence of persuasive appeals in suicide-related contents. This theory predicts behavior intentions in many different areas such as opinion expression (Neuwirth & Frederick, 2004), anti-smoking (Cohen, Shumate & Gold, 2007) or intention to register as organ donors (Bresnahan et al., 2007). TPB states that an individual’s intention to conduct a specific behavior predicts his or her actual performance of the behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Intention is, in turn, a function of three determinants: attitude toward performing the behavior, subjective norm, and PBC (Ajzen, 1991; Fishbein & Cappella, 2006). Attitudes, subjective norms, and PBC themselves are assumed to be based on underlying beliefs (Fishbein & Cappella, 2006). Attitudes are functions of beliefs about whether performing the behavior will lead to good or bad outcomes. For example, the more one believes that performing the behavior will lead to positive consequences, the more favorable will be the person’s attitude. Subjective norm is a function of beliefs that significant others think one should (or should not) perform the behavior as well as others in his or her social networks are performing (or not performing) the behavior (Cohen, Shumate & Gold, 2007). The more one believes that others think one should perform the behavior and that behavior is perceived as prevalent to them, the stronger will be the subjective norm to perform that behavior. PBC is a function of beliefs that one can perform the behavior even in the face of specific impediments (Ajzen, 1991). Therefore, messages depicting an individual who can carry out such behavior in the face of barriers may increase perceived behavior control, leading to a higher-level behavior intention. In general, TPB aims at explaining cognitive mechanisms of normal behaviors (Hales, Householder, & Greene, 2002). Even though suicidal behavior has long been considered as THEORY-DRIVEN AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF SUICIDAL TWEETS 7 “abnormal” which is merely caused by mental dysfunction, it is revealed that suicidal behavior is not just prompted by irrational impulse of the moment (Van Heeringen, 2001). Rather, suicide is explained in terms of normal psychological constructs since it involves large amounts of cognitive processes such as searching for the method, estimating possible influence on others, and comparing merits and demerits of committing suicide (O’conner & Armitage, 2003). In this regard, committing suicide is within the range of the theory’s application which is carried out at the end of conscious decision making (O’conner	algorithm;armitage;experience;gold-aluminium intermetallic;householder's method;hysterical contagion;latent dirichlet allocation;lester the unlikely;machine learning;perrin number;premier boxing champions;romer;sensor;social media;social network;supervised learning;text corpus;theory;unknown key-share attack;unsupervised learning;word lists by frequency	Joon-Mo Park;Chul-joo Lee;Yunseok Jang	2018	CoRR		computer science;data mining;theory of planned behavior;latent dirichlet allocation;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;content analysis;extant taxon;text mining	AI	-85.25804872338514	-20.012078389387	11140

As a result, modern communities are organized on local, national, and global bases. These communities are sustained and developed by media technologies their members adopt and characteristic media contents they consume. This article explores the relations between technology adoption, content consumption, and modern communities in Chinese television. The results indicate that the space-biased feature of television is enhanced by a combination of space-biased technologies and ritualized contents (i.e., drama and popular entertainment). Meanwhile, the over-emphasized space-biased feature is counterbalanced by a combination of time-biased technologies and instrumental contents (i.e., knowledge/information programs). Of more importance, the study supports three development trajectories of modern communities and media: (1) the larger scale the community has, the more the community relies on media to organize and coordinate; (2) the larger scale the community has, the less the community is tied to the traditional sources; and (3) the larger scale the community has, the less the community has shared cultural practices. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper seeks to evaluate such a model. Design/methodology/approach – Participants for this interpretivist evaluation study were selected by convenience sampling. Experts known to the authors were asked to participate, and 12 took part. Face-to-face interviews were conducted and lasted between 45 to 60 minutes. Member checking was used during the interviews. The data was analysed using the recursive abstraction method. Findings – The study highlighted the complexities of conducting an expert evaluation of a model that was deemed both too high level and too low level by the experts. The study highlighted the challenge of evaluating a model that is theoretically correct, but required acceptance in the knowledge management discipline. The study also showed that the application of autopoiesis to knowledge management has potential, but is still in its infancy. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of this study came from the initial autopoietic model of knowledge: most experts found it too difficult to engage with in the time available. The knowledge management foundation aspired to by applying autopoiesis to the domain is hard to achieve as little value was placed on models by some experts. Originality/value – The evaluation of the autopoietic model of knowledge presented in this paper represents the first expert evaluation of an autopoietic epistemology. The study is an incremental step towards providing a sound conceptual foundation for knowledge management.	autopoiesis;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;knowledge management;recursion;sampling (signal processing)	Paul Parboteeah;Thomas Jackson	2011	J.

19bdb1e2d1be739faeee456b9c3150730538305a	dscaffolding: a tool to support learning and conducting design science research		Learning and conducting Design Science Research (DSR) are complex undertakings, for which there is little assistance other than publications describing how to do them. They include many activities which must be mastered and coordinated, sometimes when doing them for the first time. This paper describes a new tool, DScaffolding, developed to support novice DSR researchers in learning DSR while conducting DSR research projects. DSR activities are supported within an existing mind-mapping tool (MindMeister), through the use of features such as (1) integrating MindMeister with literature management and annotation tools, (2) prompting for needed inputs, (3) tracking incomplete tasks, and (4) automatically piping information from one activity to another activity and ensuring consistency of information. An initial version of DScaffolding was evaluated formatively. The prototype is available as a plugin for Google Chrome at the Chrome’s Web Store.		Jeremías P. Contell;Oscar Díaz;John R.

The public sector bears great potential for business process optimization through ICT. However, these possibilities remain largely unexploited since the effects of ICT on the processes are not clear to decisions makers. To asses this impact all processes of a public administration, the process landscape, have to be taken into account. The PICTURE modeling method has been proposed as a way to efficiently model the whole process landscape. Based on the knowledge captured with those process models, the impact of certain ICT functionalities on the processes can be analyzed. ICT investment decisions become more transparent towards the political leadership. This paper has two research objectives: First, an architecture for an automated evaluation of ICT investment decisions is introduced. Second, the practical feasibility of the architecture is shown based on an investment decision for a document management system.	americas conference on information systems;business process;cobol;domain-specific modeling;information processing;mathematical optimization;pict;picture-in-picture;process modeling;process optimization;refinement (computing)	Jörg Becker;Philipp Bergener;Stefan Kleist;Daniel Pfeiffer;Michael Räckers	2008			e-government;decision support system;computer science;business administration;economic growth	SE	-72.05372318870381	1.842720064606762	11305

Trust, as a phenomenon has strong influence on the perceived level of security and influences the employees' intent for whistleblowing or the readiness for change and learning. Trust as a relation however is defined in variety of ways by the relevant scientific literature. Hence, the primary aim of present paper is to create a thorough understanding of the concept under scrutiny, and determine its relation with organisational safety and security. Secondly, the paper endeavours to explore the trust(ing) behaviour of young adults with at least 6 months' work experience and identify special characteristics of various subgroups' trust. Finally, the implications of the research data are enumerated, with special attention to those connected to organisational safety.

Finally, we produce useful and semi-permanent findings into the usefulness of virtual currencies in general, blockchains as a means of mining currency, and the profundity of Bitcoin as compared with the development of block chain technologies. We conclude that though Bitcoin may be the equivalent of Second Life a decade later, so blockchains may be the equivalent of Web 2.0 social networks, a truly transformative social technology.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;second life;semiconductor industry;social network;virtual currency;web 2.0	Andres Guadamuz;Chris Marsden	2015	First Monday		regulation;digital currency;actuarial science;economics;sociology;economy;law;commerce	HCI	-83.80531645521438	-13.478615256263334	11359

7373b84098b97772e47a99b89b343a89497902d1	personalised electronic programmes guides - enabling technologies for digital tv	information overload;digital tv	With the arrival of new cable and satellite television services, and the next generation of Digital TV systems, we will soon be faced with an unprecedented level of programme choice (upwards of 200 channels and 4000 programmes per day – over the next 12 months). Navigating through this space represents a new variation on the familiar information overload theme, and it will become increasingly difficult for subscribers to find out what relevant programmes are showing on a given day. Of course the Digital TV operators are aware of these issues, and their current solution is the Electronic Programme Guide (EPG), providing users with on-screen access to online TV listings. However, simply providing an electronic equivalent of the paper-based TV guide is not a scalable solution to the problem. For example, a typical EPG might cover a 60-minute timeslot for 5 to 10 channels in a single screen. This means that even a relatively modest line-up of 70 channels will occupy 10 to 15 screens of information for each 60-minute slot, or well over 200 screens for each viewing day.	information overload;internet television;next-generation network;scalability;weatherstar	Paul Cotter;Barry Smyth	2001	KI		multimedia;digital television;internet privacy;information overload;engineering	HCI	-64.42905489736013	-25.393660628835867	11433

Its main contribution consists in the localization of common objectives for the majority of the countries in the region. Although the countries are very heterogeneous from the cultural and geographical perspectives, there are many common factors that can be exploited in order to develop their economies. At first sight, Brazil or Mexico with their huge populations and big economies are giants compared to other countries like Bolivia or Costa Rica. However there are many common problems in all of them that can be addressed with a common strategy. An important question that this presentation tries to answer is the ICT profile of Latin America: consumer or producer. Data from the World Bank on ICT infrastructure and from the academic sector on the actual situation of the R&D activities in the region are analyzed to answer this question.	itil;internationalization and localization;population	Rodrigo Santos	2009	CLEI Electron.

c47836129780c63440a90101c108fb386d9385ea	a study of knowledge management system activation methods based on knowledge market theory		An importance of knowledge management (KM) leads many companies to utilize knowledge management system (KMS) but the users do not make use of KMS frequently. The purpose of our work is to examine how knowledge market-based price mechanism affects the utilization of current KMS and to find out solutions to improve KMS use. For the purposes of this investigation, we analyzed large enterprises and public institutions using KMS in Korea with differentiated groups by the survey. As a result of the analysis, most companies have operated the KMS relying on traditional KM methodology. It is important to develop appropriate knowledge market-based KMS. In this paper, we presented the future of the market-based system by comparing knowledge market-based KMS with traditional KMS. For the future work, it is recommended that knowledge market-based mechanisms be examined with qualitative research.	knowledge management;knowledge market;management system	Soon-Ki Jeong;Jong-Chang Ahn;Byungho Rhee	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32692-9_14	organizational learning;knowledge management;mathematical knowledge management;data mining;management science;knowledge value chain	AI	-81.20172642055896	3.2269885203846194	11496

Salinlahi, an Interactive Learning Environment, was developed to teach these young Filipino heritage learners about basic Filipino vocabulary while Salinlahi II included a support for collaborative learning. With the aim of teaching learners with basic knowledge in Filipino we developed Salinlahi III to teach higher level lessons focusing on Filipino grammar and sentence construction. An internal evaluation of the system has shown that the user interface and feedback of the tutor was appropriate. Moreover, in an external evaluation of the system, experimental and controlled field tests were done and results showed that there is a positive learning gain after using the system.

Across the globe, a host of Certification Authorities (CAs) have emerged to seize the opportunity for issuing digital certificates that constitute the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Yet the take-up of the technology has been bitterly disappointing. The market for digital certificates has failed to reach the critical worldwide mass that was anticipated. Current literature suggests a variety of outstanding technical, legal and policy issues that hinder the adoption of PKI. We argue that another contributing factor in this adverse turn of events is the quality uncertainty surrounding CAs and the certificates they issue. This paper adopts the Lemons principle, an economic theory, to analyse the market situation of quality uncertainty and reviews three countermeasures that remedy this problem: brand names, guarantees and licensing. Applying this economic theory to the PKI market, the paper discusses how these three countermeasures might be used to signal the quality of certificates and hence generate the trust missing between CAs and relying parties in electronic transactions.	certificate authority;countermeasure (computer);e-commerce;electronic funds transfer;image resolution;information security;public key certificate;public key infrastructure	James Backhouse;Carol W.

Based on this insight, the researcher undertook to look further into gender diversity with respect to self-perceived general computer confidence and self-perceived ability to program a computer. An investigation into gender differences in students studying computer programming courses at her university has now been followed by an investigation into students from very similar disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds from two other sub-Saharan universities in Namibia and Tanzania. The results of the survey confirm that there were more gender similarities than differences in these students' general computer self-efficacy and their confidence in their programming ability. However, there were significant differences in the female and male students' perceptions of computing gender stereotyping.	computer programming;general computer corporation;stereotype (uml)	Cecille J.

It can be viewed as a new learning style which has been called context-aware ubiquitous learning. Most context-aware ubiquitous learning systems employ expensive sensing technologies, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), to detect the real-world learning behaviors of students and to provide personalized learning guidance accordingly. In this paper, the authors use QR (Quick Response) code, a low cost technology that is available on smart phones for detecting students’ real-world learning status. Moreover, Web 2.0 technology is employed to enable students to collaboratively build a learning materials database. An experiment was conducted to investigate the relationships between the system quality, personal factors, learning motivation, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use, learning attitude, and behavioral intention of the students. In addition, from the interviews, it was found that most of the students felt interested in learning with the system and considered it as a helpful learning tool.

For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a ‘real’ engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. However, so far, the role of theory is neither fully appreciated nor well understood in SE research. Without a good common understanding of what theory is, what it constitutes in SE research, and the various roles it can play in SE research, it is difficult to appreciate how theory building can help to strengthen SE research. In this paper we discuss the importance of theory and conceptualization, and review the key components that comprise a theory. We then present the Research Path Schema (RPS), which is an adaptation of an analytical framework from the social sciences. The RPS defines a research study as consisting of three components: some phenomenon, system or substance that a researcher is interested in; some technique or method to study that substance; and some form of conceptualization or theory that provides an explanation for, or abstraction of the observations made in a study. Different research studies have a different archetypical ‘architecture,’ depending on the selection of these three components. Consequently, the role of the conceptualization or theory will be different for each archetypical study design, or selected research path. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and argue for a Theory-Oriented Software Engineering research perspective, which can complement the recent focus on Evidence Based Software Engineering.	conceptualization (information science);software engineering;web server	Klaas-Jan Stol;Bob Fitzgerald	2015	Sci.

This study explores sensemaking in one such community following the closure of Olint Corp, a highly successful Jamaican investment club. After Olint’s disbanding, Jamaicans reconnected through online communities to make sense of their financial losses, to make sense of Olint – seen variously as an altruistic endeavour, a global currency trader, or Ponzi scheme – and to make sense of themselves as enterprising investors. This narrative inquiry unveils their rich, multi-voiced, fragmented storying of Olint and its founder, once praised as a ‘financial messiah’.	endeavour (supercomputer);messiah;narrative designer;online community;sensemaking;traders	Clea D.

In the future smarter territories are expected to induce transformations of many aspects of the learning processes, but how their smartness is and will be related to that of the learning ecosystems ? In this paper, by means of Principal Component Analysis, we critically analyse methods presently used to benchmark and produce University rankings, by focusing on the case study of the Italian Universities. The outcomes of such analysis allow us to demonstrate the existence of a strong correlation between smart cities' and universities' rankings, i.e. between learning ecosystems and their territories of reference. Present benchmarking approaches, however, need to take in more consideration people feelings and expectations. Accordingly we suggest an innovative point of view on the benchmarking of learning ecosystems based, also, on the so called flow.	benchmark (computing);ecosystem;principal component analysis;smart city	Carlo Giovannella	2014	IxD&A			ML	-73.30501382880199	-32.28226380067121	11643

In-depth analysis of four rounds of incorporation of new cultural resources led to the development of a robust theoretical model that identifies cultural repertoire enrichment and organizational identity redefinition as two core mechanisms that facilitate the use of new cultural resources for the development of unconventional strategies and strategic versatility. Our model contributes to organizational research novel theoretical understanding regarding the use of cultural resources in strategy formation and change. 3 Early research in cultural sociology conceptualized culture as taken-for-granted values, norms, beliefs, and symbols acquired through socialization (Wrong 1961), which shape action in predictable, culture-reproducing directions (see Peterson 1979, p. 161). A more recent perspective conceives of culture as a flexible toolkit of cultural resources that are used by individuals to develop different strategies of action and to achieve different goals. The view of culture as a toolkit from which individuals draw cultural resources """" in varying configurations to solve different kinds of problems (Swidler 1986, p. 273) """" has become increasingly influential in the sociology of culture (DiMaggio 1997) and has spurred a vibrant body of work. Individuals have been shown to use cultural resources flexibly in political settings to change ideas and practices (Berezin 1997), in law to produce legal sentences that challenge existing ways of thinking (Calavita 2001), in social movements to frame the direction of change and its implementation (Benford and Snow 2000; Weber et al. How individuals use cultural resources depends on their cultural repertoires (Swidler 2001). Cultural repertoires consist of those resources that individuals have selected from the broader societal cultural toolkits """" of symbols, stories, rituals, and worldviews (Swidler 1986, p. 273) and have learned to use. From the societal cultural toolkits, individuals tend to select resources that resonate with their identity, enable them """" to be a certain kind of person (Swidler 2001, p. …"""	gene ontology term enrichment;list of toolkits;organizational behavior;peterson's algorithm;socialization;theory	Violina Rindova;Elena Dalpiaz;Davide Ravasi	2011	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.1100.0537	innovation;social science;cultural analysis;economics;knowledge management;environmental resource management;management science;sociology;product design;management	HCI	-78.12259600522668	-4.7211505094356845	11690

Data, reports and surveys (UNESCO, World Bank, World Economic Forum, etc) were analyzed in detail, to create a clear picture related to research topics.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe role of education and science in solving the problems of sustainable development is critical. The system of education and science fails to meet modern challenges. The authors believe that it is desirable to start working on a different model. For this purpose, they have developed a new approach to connect clusters and alternative design pattern of education and science system for sustainable development.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnFirst, mutually beneficial effective circular system has been improved by offering an alternative design of the educational system to link it to the international educational and scientific programs. Second, the visible and invisible sides of the cluster are presented as a tree-shaped system. Third, invisible and visible connection between branch clusters and an alternative design pattern for educational system have been identified and presented as a system.

A shortcoming however is that these advisors are not continuously available for the students, especially when students are working on exercises independently from the university, e.g. at home using a virtual environment. In order to improve this learning situation we present our concept of an exercise assistant, which is able to provide feedback and guidance to the student while they are working on exercises. This exercise assistant is also able to verify solutions based on expert knowledge modelled using description logic.	description logic;teaching method;telecommuting;virtual reality	Jens Haag;Christian Witte;Stefan Karsch;Harald P.

Additionally, it explored education professionals and parents' attitudes and concerns regarding technology use by children. Data-collection methods included focus groups with nine education professionals, naturalistic observations of fifteen children with autism in therapy sessions, and interviews with parents of four of the children. Results revealed that (1) children are regular users of digital technology and media, (2) there are different patterns of use of technologies with possible correlations to accessibility and behavioural manifestations of autism, (3) education professionals and parents have positive attitude towards the use of technology by the children, but also recognize disadvantages to its use.	accessibility;digital electronics;field research;focus group;requirement	Susana Alarcon-Licona;Lian Loke	2017		10.1145/3078072.3084338	focus group;naturalistic observation;autism;clinical psychology;psychology	HCI	-73.23844341534607	-39.39741635549967	11730

Processes for recruitment and career advancement in universities thus have a critical role. The efficiency of faculty selection processes can be evaluated by comparing the subsequent performance of competition winners against that of the losers and the pre-existing staff of equal academic rank. Our study presents an empirical analysis concerning the recruitment procedures for associate professors in the Italian university system. The results of a bibliometric analysis of the hard science areas reveal that new associate professors are on average more productive than the incumbents. However a number of crucial concerns emerge, in particular concerning occurrence of non-winner candidates that are more productive than the winners over the subsequent triennium, and cases of winners that are completely unproductive. Beyond the implications for the Italian case, the analysis offers considerations for all decision-makers regarding the ex post evaluation of the efficiency of the recruitment process and the desirability of providing selection committees with bibliometric indicators in support of evaluation (i.e. informed peer review).	best, worst and average case;bibliometrics;delegate (cli);distortion;peer-to-peer	Giovanni Abramo;Ciriaco Andrea D'Angelo;Francesco Rosati	2013	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-013-1075-8	social science;economics;bibliometrics;computer science;operations management;data mining;sociology;management;operations research;world wide web;economic growth	AI	-78.23734621074158	-22.678930502859593	11740

In response, organizations may choose to move technical support personnel close to end-users. This can isolate them from each other, and may limit their ability to share knowledge. Thus, the growth of distributed computing calls for increased ability to share knowledge across organizational boundaries. This paper presents the results of a case study investigating how distributed technologists share knowledge through knowledge markets. We argue that knowledge markets are cultural entities shaped by the underlying work culture of their participants, and that the cultural forces that define knowledge markets are powerful, deeply held and difficult to change. Thus, improving the effectiveness of any given knowledge market will have less to do with the installation of information technology than with the ability to create a facilitating work culture. This study’s identification of clique knowledge markets, operating efficiently in parallel to the public knowledge market, may provide a hint of the type of culture that will create fewer knowledge trade barriers.	distributed computing;entity;knowledge market;power supply unit (computer);technical support	Kristin R.

Artefacts generated by students using tools in different devices and localizations are stored in a learning object repository (LOR), enabling search, distribution and reuse of the students' results and products in other tools. As metadata is a key factor for the retrieval task, a framework adaptable to a diversity of tools and capable of auto-metadocumenting the objects in terms of the tools and LOR's context is discussed, as well as wrapping methods for automatically reify data into objects, for those tools with limited or null interoperability with the LOR	interoperability;wrapping (graphics)	M.

Participants were fourteen final year undergraduate students using six views of their learner model data. Results suggest some views of the learner model information may be more likely to encourage learners to inspect information about their level of knowledge, whereas in other views attention is directed more towards scanning the view, resulting in a lower proportion of time focussed on knowledge-related data. In some views there was a difference according to whether the learner model view was one of the participants' preferred formats for accessing their learner model information, while in other views there was little difference. This has implications for the design of open learner model views in systems opening the learner model to the learner for different purposes.	eye tracking;knowledge level	Susan Bull;Neil Cooke;Andrew Mabbott	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73078-1_21	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-72.71035436290117	-44.744286221217685	11917

Essential failure of present agrarian policy of Ukraine is its orientation mostly on subsidizing of agro-producers. The majority of these producers are noncompetitive because of high transactional cost that is connected with their weak knowledge of a number of questions, beginning from the modern technologies up to information about the current market conjuncture. At the same time the government does not give enough support of the infrastructure development for agro-industrial complex (AIC), especially information one due to shortage of finance. The state support of the providing information services for the AIC subjects under market mechanisms is the key factor of effective agricultural policy in transition economies. The creation of efficient information system for AIC based on modern IT requires elaboration of special educational and training programs, especially for rural areas of Ukraine as well as industrial settlements where industry enterprises closure forces people to cultivate their own plots of land. In the paper basics of information system for AIC configuration is recommended and the main steps of its implementation in Ukraine are considered.	information system	Sergey N. Ivanov;Alexander V.

To address this question we develop a framework for modelling graduate competencies linked to tertiary degree programmes in the computing disciplines. While the focus of our work is computing the framework is applicable to education more broadly.   The work presented here draws upon the pioneering curricular document for information technology (IT2017), curricular competency frameworks, other related documents such as the software engineering competency model (SWECOM), the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), current research in competency models, and elicitation workshop results from recent computing conferences.   The aim is to inform the ongoing Computing Curricula (CC2020) project, an endeavour supported by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society. We develop the Competency Learning Framework (CoLeaF), providing an internationally relevant tool for describing competencies. We argue that this competency based approach is well suited for constructing learning environments and assists degree programme architects in dealing with the challenge of developing, describing and including competencies relevant to computer and IT professionals.   In this paper we demonstrate how the CoLeaF competency framework can be applied in practice, and though a series of case studies demonstrate its effectiveness and analytical power as a tool for describing and comparing degree programmes in the international higher education landscape.

Based on this, it is illustrated that information security should be a priority of executive management, including the Board and CEO and should therefore commence as a corporate governance responsibility. This paper, therefore, motivates that there is a need to integrate information security into corporate governance through the development of an information security governance (ISG) framework. This paper further proposes such a framework to aid an organization in its ISG efforts.	conner peripherals;information governance;information security;relevance	Shaun Posthumus;Rossouw von Solms	2004	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2004.10.006	information security audit;corporate governance;standard of good practice;certified information security manager;cloud computing security;security management;security information and event management;security convergence;information governance;asset;computer science;threat;information security;information security standards;corporate security;project governance;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;information security management;factor analysis of information risk	Crypto	-71.31989501010939	-7.051570645031398	11956

The challenge facing researchers working in information access is how to help users easily locate the information needed. Evaluation methodologies and metrics are important tools to assess progress in human information interaction (HII). To properly evaluate these systems, evaluations need to consider the performance of the various components, the usability of the system, and the impact of the system on the end user. Current usability metrics are adequate for evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of such systems. Performance measures for new intelligent technologies will have to be developed. Regardless of how well the systems are and how usable the systems are, it is critical that impact measures are developed. For HII systems to be useful, we need to assess how well information analysts work with the systems. This evaluation needs to go beyond technical performance metrics and usability metrics. What are the metrics for evaluating utility? This paper describes research efforts focused on developing metrics for the intelligence community that measure the impact of new software to facilitate information interaction.

The act of planning for an immersive conference using the software dependent on the conference success strengthens the community of users that participate in the platform. This paper describes three conference events held from 2013–2015 involving an emerging consortium of leading developers and researchers of virtual worlds. The implications of technological success of immersive conferences hold promise for government and military agencies facing training requirements under fiscal restrictions. A workshop was conducted during the writing of this paper establishing the inaugural, immersive workshop for the Federal Consortium of Virtual Worlds sponsored by the US Army and Avacon Incorporated, a non-profit organization producing conference events.	consortium;simulation	Barbara Truman;David Metcalf	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21067-4_53	engineering ethics;human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management	HPC	-68.53542945281201	-29.486391209780198	12086
a7f33ff9f8d90b0dbc76017f398358ebedc74130	effects of learning english maxim through m-learning with different content representation	m learning;learning content representation;english maxim	English maxim is the important elements when it refers to foreign language performance. Learning tools assisted by mobile technology (M-Learning) has been proved to be a great one to learners for self-learning anytime and anywhere. The participants of the study were selected from one large university in the middle of Taiwan. The researchers chose participants from Department of Foreign Language (DFL) and Department of Non-Foreign Language (DNFL). One hundred and twenty-one students were from DFL, and 137 students were from DNFL. In accordance with learner's short-term memory (STM) ability, the researchers divided learners into four quadrants. Quadrants 1(Q1) consists of learners with higher STM ability in verbal and higher STM ability in visual. Quadrants 2(Q2) comprises learners with lower STM ability in verbal and higher STM ability in visual. Quadrants 3(Q3) includes learners with lower STM ability in verbal and lower STM ability in visual. Quadrants 4(Q4) is composed of learners with higher STM ability in verbal and lower STM ability in visual. Besides, Learning Content Representation (LCR) Types are clarified into three types (Type A, B, C) according to two main learning modes (verbal mode and visual mode). The research question is that for learners with different learning preferences (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), how Learning Content Representation Types (LCR type A, B, C) affect the learning outcome of English maxims? Our findings showed providing learning content with pictorial annotation (Type A) could aid learners with lower verbal ability and higher visual ability (Q2) to have better outcomes because these learners find it easier to learn content presented in a visual form rather than in a verbal form. Providing learning content with both written and pictorial annotation (Type C) can assist learners with higher verbal ability and higher visual ability (Q1) in the recognition test. According to the Cognitive Load theory, providing too much information might cause a higher cognitive load and lead to irritation and lack of concentration. It implied that providing basic learning materials (only written annotation, Type B) is notably helpful to learners with lower verbal ability and lower visual ability (Q3). The research results could provide instructors or learners as learning strategies to promote their English ability.

Nevertheless, few relevant studies explicitly distinguished knowledge management performance from knowledge management effectiveness. This paper covers both sides and introduces a new knowledge management measurement index. It establishes a comprehensive evaluation model by measuring three stages of knowledge management behavior: environmental analysis, knowledge management activity planning, and knowledge management implementation decision making. Data were collected through questionnaires from 100 small and medium sized enterprises in China. The statistical results show that the three stages positively and significantly contribute to the index. The environmental analysis influences most, with the knowledge management activity planning less and the knowledge management implementation decision making least. Finally, it proposes some useful suggestions for enterprises to assess, to predict and to guide their knowledge management practice.		Yao Liu;Ahmed N.

As the number of supported computer labs and multimedia rooms grow, the quality of the support may suffer due to the lack of staff needed to properly maintain the equipment. Needed patches, updates and virus definitions can be neglected due to lack of time and resources. Printer, scanner and projector maintenance can also suffer. The Desktop Technical Services department at Webster University had growing concerns that our high standards for quality might not be met as the number of labs continued to grow.In this paper we will describe many of the challenges faced as the desktop support needs of the labs exceeded available resources. We will present examples of obstacles common to other desktop support groups in an academic setting, and will describe the ideas and revised procedures that were put into action. We will outline which changes were deemed as successes and which were not.We will also provide tips, resources and modifications to help others who face the same challenges and obstacles involved with maintaining multiple labs.	antivirus software;computer lab;desktop computer;imperative programming;printing;video projector	Christine Arteaga;Terri Lucas	2005		10.1145/1099435.1099478	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-68.2519984445675	-25.766740672378482	12120

The social Agent is e-learning oriented. The e-society cognitive platform may consider different fields like e-learning, e-health, e-commerce, e-medicine, and e-government. In this paper we will introduce the e-society platform. The e-society platform supports the educational and pedagogical aspects. The e-society is based on the agent technologies. The social agents offer impressive, meaningful and several features as autonomy, manage negotiation, and make decision. The e-society cognitive platform consists of three main layers: social agents, beliefs, and tools for application layer. The goal of the e-society platform is to increase the perceiving of the transportation education in the school.	autonomy;e-commerce;e-government;e-society;software agent	Jamal Raiyn	2011	Adv.

Differences in PHRs can range from key variations in functionality to differences in how they make the experiences of users more akin to personal interactions than to clinical visits or impersonal e-commerce transactions. This study provides analyses of design and communication issues in three PHR Web sites, offering preliminary conclusions about the potential impact of differences in design and functionality, as well as the inclusiveness of these interfaces for populations traditionally underserved by technology design. Additionally, it undergirds its analyses with a theoretical approach rooted in the theory of Information Worlds, which suggests that each PHR interface projects a specific “information world” that both enables and constrains not only user options and activities, but also how users are able to understand the parameters of “health” itself.

However, it seems that both providers and consumers are still hesitating to enter the Cloud spot market. The relevant academic community also has conflicting opinions about Cloud spot pricing in terms of revenue generation. Aim: This work aims to systematically identify, assess, synthesize and report the published evidence in favor of or against spot-price scheme compared with fixed-price scheme of Cloud computing, so as to help relieve the aforementioned conflict. Method: We employed the systematic literature review (SLR) method to collect and investigate the empirical studies of Cloud spot pricing indexed by major electronic libraries. Results: This SLR identified 61 primary studies that either delivered discussions or conducted experiments to perform comparison between spot pricing and fixed pricing in the Cloud domain. The reported benefits and limitations were summarized to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of being a Cloud spot pricing player, while four types of theories were distinguished to help both researchers and practitioners better understand the Cloud spot market. Conclusions: This SLR shows that the academic community strongly advocates the emerging Cloud spot market. Although there is still a lack of practical and easily deployed market-driven mechanisms, the overall findings of our work indicate that spot pricing plays a promising role in the sustainability of Cloud resource exploitation.

a9b115342f19f25bd1c63b0013015c82d802e437	the chemistry between high school students and computer science		Computer science enrollments have started to rise again, but the percentage of women undergraduates in computer science is still low. Some studies indicate this might be due to a lack of awareness of computer science at the high school level. We present our experiences running a 5-year, high school outreach program that introduces information about computer science within the context of required chemistry courses. We developed interactive worksheets using Molecular Workbench that help the students learn chemistry and computer science concepts related to relevant events such as the gulf oil spill. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach indicates that the students do become more aware of computer science as a discipline, but system support issues in the classroom can make the approach difficult for teachers and discouraging for the students.	buncefield fire;computer science;gulf of evaluation;workbench	Timothy T.

In addition, students often approach typical end-of-chapter textbook problems by finding a formula that contains the variables given in the problem statement, rather than first determining a problem's conceptual foundation. We use the technology of Physlets combined with pedagogical techniques such as just-in-time teaching to create alternative problems that we believe help students better develop their problem-solving ability and deepen their conceptual understanding. Physlets-physics applets-are small, flexible Java applets usable in a wide variety of Web applications.

Design/methodology/approach – The digital library facilitates access to medical material produced by laboratories for both research and educational purposes. As the material produced varies (regarding its type and structure) and the search requirements imposed by potential users differ, each laboratory develops its own collection. All collections must be bilingual, supporting both Greek and English. Extended requirements were imposed regarding the services offered by the digital library environment, due to the following reasons: end-users actively participate in the cataloguing workflow; cataloguers should be able to create and manage multiple collections in a simplified manner; and different search requirements must be supported for different user groups. To formulate and then deal with these requirements, the authors introduced the term “dynamic collection management” denoting automated collection definition and unified collection management within an integrated digital library environment. Digital library components providing the desired functionality and the interaction between them are described. System performance, especially during collection search, and bilingual support are also explored. Findings – Finds that Athens Medical School Digital Library facilitates access to medical material to researchers and students for both research and educational purposes. Originality/value – The paper provides useful information on a digital library environment which supports research.	digital library;garbage collection (computer science);requirement	Mara Nikolaidou;Dimosthenis Anagnostopoulos;Michael Hatzopoulos	2005	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640470510592933	design;digital library;collection;stock management;computer science;higher education;world wide web;information system;collections management	HCI	-72.39940857312298	-23.681590310293508	12274

Constructivism study theory indicates that the study will be happened most effectively when learners create physical artifacts or discuss with fellow learners around certain topics or knowledge. In this paper, we address integrating social media with online museum, forming the circle of attracting users, supporting communication, accumulating knowledge, disseminating knowledge via social media and then attracting more users. During this circle, facilitate users’ constructivism study by providing contextual knowledge relevant to a certain collection and make learning be a social activity via social media.	artifact (software development);blog;podcast;social constructivism;social media;the circle (file system);web 2.0	Cui Binyue;Yokoi Shigeki	2011			computer science;multimedia	HCI	-66.18938381009363	-34.479190017789755	12315

In a recent email, the Australian Institute of Criminologyu0027s Chief Librarian, John Myrtle, passed on statistics which showed that internet use and access in Australia has increased about 50% during the last year (Pers. Comm. 14 July 1999). Of greater interest is the fact that almost 20% of Australian households, 1.3 million, have internet access and over one third of the adult population has accessed the internet at some time during the year ending February 1999. To further back these figures, the Sydney Morning Herald of 12 February, 2000, carried statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which showed that 22.6% of Australian families had home internet access (Anon., 2000a, p. 105). These figures firmly place Australians among the worldu0027s most computer literate societies. Of course computers werenu0027t always that popular. The authors of this paper entered law enforcement at a time when computers were owned by Universities and major corporations - not individuals - and a decent calculator cost about a weeku0027s wages. However, things changed quickly and by the 1980s computers were an established part of policing. Today, all major police services are committed to, and reliant on, some form of computerised information system. The two systems which the authors have had contact with are the Crime Reporting and Information System for Police (CRISP) (Queensland Police Service) and the Computerised Operational Policing System (COPS) (New South Wales Police Service). While many aspects of these two systems are different, they, and all the other police information systems in existence, share one major similarity: they store and provide access to personal and confidential information on every individual with whom police come into contact during their duties. Modern police investigation techniques rely on officers being able to access this information routinely to carry out their duties and fight crime. Likewise, the individuals whose personal information is held on law enforcement computer systems are entitled to a reasonable expectation of privacy. This presents the single greatest dilemma to law enforcement officers using computers: when does investigation and intelligence gathering become common curiosity and therefore unlawful?	authorization;right to privacy	Mike Enders;Lily Enders	2001	Australasian J. of Inf.

In considering the potential of novel information and communication technology to enhance the entire visit experience, one scenario envisioned is extending the on-site visit boundaries, to help the visitors access information concerning exhibits that are of primary interest to them during pre-visit planning, provide relevant information to the visitors during the visit, and follow up with post visit memories and reflections. All this can be done by using today’s state of the art mobile and web-based applications, as well as any new foreseeable emerging technology. So far, research on applying novel information and communication technology in the cultural heritage domain has focused primarily on exploring specific aspects of the technology and its capability for supporting the individual visitor mainly during the physical, on-site, visit (and in some cases in additional specific phases such as prior or after the visit). This paper suggests a novel, integrative framework for supporting the pre, during and post visit phases in a personalized manner. It is based on a set of standard, common models: a visitor model, a site model and a visit model, all enable a large variety of services to store, update and reuse data during the three phases of the visit. Our contribution is presenting a framework architecture with its underlying infrastructure, and showing in a case study how this framework supports the various visit phases in an actual museum. The suggested framework is generic; it is not limited to a specific setting or scenario and it is open and can be easily adopted and used by practitioners and researchers to be implemented in different sites and settings. As such, it provides a further step in extending the cultural heritage experience beyond the on-site visit and towards linking individual episodes into complete, memorable personal experiences.

f801e2c61c3feaedc99b053ec696e2d6729099f2	factors affecting knowledge management & knowledge use		Knowledge management (KM) is the process of capturing, storing, organizing, using, and creating Knowledge. Ample attention and insight into such processes result in optimal performance in management approaches. We investigated the level of awareness of mangers about KM programs and the mechanism of creation and usage of knowledge within the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME). After a systematic review, we identified the necessary tools for the measurement, usage, and creation of knowledge in the MOHME. Such tools were reviewed and verified by a subject expert panel. We incorporated such tools to measure the level of awareness, among the MOHME employees, toward knowledge and knowledge management. The results of our study were reviewed by subject matter experts and analysed using IBM SPSS software. The level of awareness toward KM programs and Knowledge usage and knowledge creation are relatively at an acceptable level at the MOHME. Although most of the mangers at the MOHME were aware of the knowledge management tools, knowledge creation and usage were remain relatively at low levels. The lack of active sponsors and transparency programs for supporting knowledge creation and usage within the MOHME are among the main reasons for such low activities.	knowledge management	Leila Shahmoradi;Maryam Zahmatkeshan;Mahtab Karami	2015		10.5220/0005590601520158	data mining;knowledge management;subject-matter expert;software;christian ministry;knowledge engineering;management science;domain knowledge;computer science;knowledge value chain;personal knowledge management;approaches of management	AI	-86.44038229197635	-28.51232929999538	12371

69e0e6be0d1a910e59873fc35ce9a0ab4dfd23fe	beyond free lunch: building sustainable ict4d	ict4d	In developing countries, the realised benefits from information and communication technologies (ICT) projects can contribute to the development of national institutions and economic growth, and thus to human development. Yet, achieving these promised benefits is hindered by high project failure rates and by systems that become unsustainable after deployment. Based on rich data from an exploratory case study of a major E-government project in Timor-Leste, this paper presents important lessons for the planning and execution of large ICT projects in developing countries. The paper identifies and discusses strategies relevant to the implementation of E-government systems that contribute to achieving the delivery of sustainable ICT solutions in socially and technically challenging environments. Achieving sustainability is presented as a social-technical process that enables the effective delivery of the system and the maximisation of the technological and social outcomes. These findings are significant as they increase our understanding of critical contextual and managerial considerations needed to deliver sustainable information systems in developing countries, an area that is lacking on research.	dec alpha;e-government;information system;proactive parallel suite;procurement;software deployment;theory	Abel Pires da Silva;Walter D.

b46a43d7720a396d71762a909091893601759fad	erp post-implementation training program assessment - identifying key factors that improve cognitive outcomes		Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, such as SAP, feature a rich set of integrated business applications. To maximize the long term benefits from ERP implementations, organizations need to support end users with effective training during the post-implementation phase. Training programs that build the end-user’s cognitive skills and business procedural knowledge are particularly important as they allow the users to understand the broader scope of the ERP system implementation and the strong integration of multiple business processes and functions. Given the high cost and variety of ERP training programs, there is a need to create validated models to assess content and benefits of such training programs. Using a field study of a collaborative, team-based training program with the ERPSim simulation tool, this paper develops and validates a fuzzy logic model to assess cognitive outcomes. The study finds that training team characteristics, particularly heterogeneity and cooperation, are most important in achieving higher levels of cognitive outcome. The results of the study imply that for ERP implementation success, the end-users must be given suitable training programs that allow them to share and integrate cross functional knowledge. Moreover, the success of such training programs needs to be periodically measured to assess cognitive	business process;cognition;erp;enterprise resource planning;field research;fuzzy logic;simulation	Biswadip Ghosh;Jason J.

This article presents a descriptive model of competition between providers of interorganizational systems in a mature market. The model emphasizes the competitive role of switching costs in conjunction with user benefit functions which increase with the number of users. Also introduced is a notion of competitive position which aids in describing competitive risks and opportunities in a market. The case of airline computerized reservation systems (CRS) is used throughout the paper to demonstrate the model.		William G.

The fear of lost managerial control is reported to be a significant factor preventing widespread adoption of telework (DeSanctis 1984; Duxbury, Higgins, and Irving 1987; Savage 1988). Managers are also concerned that telework may require them to change their management style since they cannot rely on visual contact for monitoring and control. Researchers suggest that a more results-oriented management style is needed (Duxbury, Higgins, and Irving 1987; Metzger and Von Glinow 1988; Olson 1988) and that a shift in management from being a passer of information to a leader or coach is necessary (Duxbury, Higgins, and Irving 1987; Lallande 1984; Savage 1988). Trust is suggested as being a key ingredient to effectively manage teleworkers (Duxbury, Higgins, and Irving 1987; Savage 1988). Managing perceptions of corporate culture in a remote worker is also seen as a possible obstacle, requiring additional investment from managers (Hendricks and McMains 1989; Olson 1988).	higgins;savage;telecommuting	D.

An organization must leverage its core competencies, which are mostly knowledge-based resources, in order to survive and thrive in the current marketplace. While there are many studies addressing how one should leverage knowledge assets, the work on how we can secure our existing knowledge assets and processes is scant. While private sector organizations have long taken knowledge security for granted, this is not the case in the intelligence and defense sectors of the government, especially those involved with issues of national security. In this case study analysis, we will draw on key insights from investigating knowledge security protocols in five such organizations.

Therefore a lot of potential is seen in distance learning development. Virtual environment interface to E-learning systems have recently appeared on the Internet. With the addition of online laboratories, it is possible that the applications appear to be promising to E-learning tasks more nature and interactive. In this paper a web page with a virtual laboratory about biorefinery and biomass valorization has been developed in order to make closer the world of academic research and the graduate students learning. Biorefinery represents an excellent object of study in many scientific applied disciplines because it integrates many biomass transformation processes of different knowledge areas. The software application supplies both theoretical and practical information on all the fields covering the biorefinery concept, and the possibility of interacting with the instrumentation typical of this subject by means of simulating it ( http://www.uco.es/docencia/grupos/laboratoriovirtualceia3 ).

Positive Technology is an emergent field based on both theoretical 10 and applied research, whose goal is to investigate how Information and Com11 munication Technologies (ICTs) can be used to empower the quality of personal 12 experience. In particular, serious games can influence both individual and inter13 personal experiences by nurturing positive emotions, and promoting engagement, 14 as well as enhancing social integration and connectedness. An in-depth analysis of 15 each of these aspects will be presented in the chapter, with the support of concrete 16 examples.

We show that there is a strong correlation between economic development and an extensive road network. However, the public support for maintaining and expanding the road network is diminishing since these investments mainly rely on taxation. The common approach is to introduce tolls as a revenue generating method for supporting these investments. We argue that virtual billboards could provide an alternative revenue stream and avoid tolls in highways with high volumes of traffic. The key technologies are vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and virtual windshields that already provide enhanced reality for ADAS. The physical billboards would transmit targeted advertising to approaching vehicles that would overlay it on top of the billboard sign. We demonstrate that it is already possible to implement this system with existing technologies. These digital ads would combine the flexibility of Internet advertisement with the high exposure of highway billboards and the willingness to receive them as an alternative to paying tolls. Finally, we show that it is viable to provide advertisement sponsored highway segments with very low cost-per-view values, especially in suburban highways that have a high volume of traffic.	architecture design and assessment system;augmented reality;internet;online advertising;shadow copy	Pedro Emanuel Rodrigues Gomes;Fausto Vieira;Michel Ferreira	2013		10.1145/2482967.2482977	vehicular ad hoc network;embedded system;simulation;computer science;computer security;computer network	HCI	-81.08774641901496	-9.23439411160416	12572

Although some countries have already established models to try to solve the problem of orphan works, others are still discussing possible options. The paper explores the current situation of the schemes in place internationally to deal with the problems associated with orphan works and how these are being applied by cultural institutions regarding the digital dissemination of their collections. The methodology consisted in a systematic review of the research results as an exploratory analytical technique for the collection of relevant information. Results highlighted that global situation is uncertain and none of the formulas studied enables full and effective digitisation and digital dissemination of the world’s cultural heritage. Further advances are necessary for the creation of diligent search procedures.

It further examines if reviews are cited more frequently than are “normal” articles. All research questions are answered affirmatively: The absolute as well as the relative numbers of reviews in these three subfields are indeed increasing. In addition, reviews in these fields are cited more frequently than are normal articles: about 70% more often than are “normal” articles in Infectious Diseases and Oncology and about 50% more often in Tropical Medicine. The article discusses possible reasons for this increase and concludes that medical journals should strive to achieve an optimal balance between review papers and original articles.

This paper describes some of the characteristics of collaborative work that were identified from empirical evidence captured during the COSTART project [4]. We examine the way the information was analyzed and the results of that exercise. An approach to modeling co-creativity based on case study data is described and three example models proposed. This work enabled us to consider the implications of the different models for supporting creativity and their relationship to success factors.

But their frequency of use, whether individually or in combination, and their variation over time reflect the researchers' perceived benefit. This survey covers more than 4,600 articles with more than 2,000 applications of advanced (multivariate) methods. Regression-Based Methods and Exploratory Factor Analysis account for 45% of all applications. In third place and by far the fastest growing analytical instrument is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), followed by clustering techniques. Numerous other methods are in occasional use. Best practice examples, smart combinations of analytical methods, and underutilized methods with a promising application potential are identified. Typical pitfalls and shortcomings get diagnosed. Three of the most popular method classes and application areas, viz. scale development, SEM, and classification methods, are portrayed in greater detail and highlighted regarding their tourism-specific mode of employment.

It has been identified as a promising technique to improve students' engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamified learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamified learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamified activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.	computer science;gamification;programming language;video game design	María Blanca Ibáñez;Angela Di Serio;Carlos Delgado Kloos	2014	IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies	10.1109/TLT.2014.2329293	planning;games;cooperative learning;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;experiential learning;game mechanics;learning sciences;multimedia;management;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-74.70171881049794	-41.95877153101778	12640
88716afd43def84397c256f505e993f150bf7219	incorrect results in software engineering experiments: how to improve research practices	empirical software engineering;statistical hypothesis testing;controlled experiments	Context: The trustworthiness of research results is a growing concern in many empirical disciplines. Aim: The goals of this paper are to assess how much the trustworthiness of results reported in software engineering experiments is affected by researcher and publication bias and to suggest improved research practices. Method: First, we conducted a small-scale survey to document the extent of researcher and publication biases in software engineering experiments. Then, we built a model that estimates the proportion of correct results for different levels of researcher and publication bias. A review of 150 randomly selected software engineering experiments published in the period 2002–2012 was conducted to provide input to the model. Results: The survey indicates that researcher and publication bias is quite common. This finding is supported by the observation that the actual proportion of statistically significant results reported in the reviewed papers was about twice as high as the one expected assuming no researcher and publication bias. Our models suggest a high proportion of incorrect results even with quite conservative assumptions. Conclusion: Research practices must improve to increase the trustworthiness of software engineering experiments. A key to this improvement is to avoid conducting studies with unsatisfactory low statistical power. Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man's task.

Yet they are likely to transform SKOs as well. The aim of this paper is to propose a way to structure SKOs that allows for both a clear individuation of the main scientific contributions and a fine-grained structure of credits and evaluation. Design/methodology/approach – The authors review and analyze existing practices of structuring SKOs in different disciplines. Findings – Provisionally considering the published paper as an atomic SKO, possible subatomic structures of SKOs are investigated. It is hypothesized that SKOs are meant to satisfy two separated but interdependent sets of constraints, one related to the contribution the SKO makes to the body of knowledge, and another related to the contribution the SKO makes to the reputation of its authors. It is hypothesized that existing SKO structures are not optimal for satisfying both sets of constraints at once. Research limitations/implications – A broader analysis may be needed that covers the totality of existing practices. Practical implications – Guidelines are offered. This paper, including the present abstract, is an example of what the scientific paper of tomorrow could be like. Social implications – The paper proposes better apportioning of scientific credits and evaluation; substantive evolution of the academic publishing and credit attribution models. Originality/value – The idea that the communication and evaluation function of a SKO are differently reflected in their structure is novel. The proposed fine-grained credit attribution system is novel. The molecular/atomic/sub-atomic distinction is a new way to fix the terminology.	evaluation function;gloria gordon bolotsky;interdependence;scientific literature;simple knowledge organization system;subatomic particle	Roberto Casati;Gloria Origgi;Judith Simon	2011	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220411111183546	library science;social science;design methods;epistemology;scientometrics;computer science;knowledge management;body of knowledge;evaluation function;data mining;mathematics;management science;sociology;electronic publishing;world wide web;sociology of scientific knowledge;information retrieval;satisfiability	NLP	-76.57981321526204	-17.570726992351396	12660

In this paper, I explore the relationship between interruptions and acquisition of routines—a form of knowledge—by teams. Recent research suggests that interruptions may play an important role in changing organizational routines, and as such may influence knowledge transfer activities. Results suggest that interruptions influence knowledge transfer effort, and both knowledge transfer effort and interruptions are positively related to the acquisition of new work routines. I conclude with implications for research and practice. (Team; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Acquisition; Routines; Interruptions)	knowledge acquisition;knowledge management	Mary E.

A questionnaire distributed to 90 (97% responding) university and business company researchers resulted in that leadership was rated higher than organizational support. First, leaders were more important to creativity than organizational support. Secondly, LOS differed to a limited extent between members and leaders, universities and business companies and excellent and less excellent groups. Thirdly, working freedom was rated higher in universities than in business companies. Fourthly, group members perceived they were more encouraged to think freely in comparison to their group leaders. Finally, innovation goals were more pronounced in excellent than less excellent groups.

We contribute quantitative arguments to this predominantly qualitative discussion by analyzing a dataset of political campaign contributions. We validate that the campaign donations of politicians are mainly influenced by his or her political power and affiliation to a political party. Approaching the question of whether donations influence votes, we employ supervised learning techniques to classify how a politician will vote based solely upon from whom he or she received donations. The statistical significance of the results are assessed within the context of the debate currently surrounding campaign finance reform. Our experimental findings exhibit a large predictive power of the donations, demonstrating high informativeness of the donations with respect to voting outcomes. However, observing the slightly superior accuracy of the party line as a predictor, a causal relationship between donations and votes cannot be identified.	causality;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;kerrison predictor;money;party line (telephony);statistical classification;supervised learning	Samuel Smith;Jae Yeon Baek;Zhaoyi Kang;Dawn Xiaodong Song;Laurent El Ghaoui;Mario Frank	2012	2012 11th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	10.1109/ICMLA.2012.119	politics;regularization;biological classification;computer science;artificial intelligence	SE	-81.69914162857316	-17.968516418984468	12665

Learning occurs through motivation therefore, personalizing motivation is key to enhancing learning rate and retention for the learner. Supplying the intelligent tutors with key information not will advance the familiarity of individual’s motivational factors and interest for individualizing motivation. Building this relationship stems from a streamlined Motivational Assessment Tool (MAT), aimed at assessing several motivation factors. The Motivation Assessment Tool is based on the interconnectedness of motivational factors with personality. The creation of the assessment allows the intelligent tutor to implement reinforcers that influence motivational level based off individual variances such as personality.

Therefore a literature review of the AIS Electronic Library is done. With a single term search including “learning efficiency”, “learning effectiveness” and “blended learning” 14 papers are identified. Regarding learning efficiency, less research is available so that only few measurements are available and no drivers are identified. In contrary, learning effectiveness is in research focus: 10 measurement indicators and 16 drivers are analyzed. Few of these findings concentrate on blended learning environment in corporate education. In conclusion, an evaluation framework including learning effectiveness and efficiency for blended learning environments of corporate education is desirable. This paper discusses opportunities for future search based on the state-of-art knowledge published by the AIS Electronic Library.	david g. kirkpatrick;device driver;future search;holism;word lists by frequency	Diana Renner;Sven Laumer;Tim Weitzel	2014			simulation;blended learning;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	Web+IR	-74.61335576958496	-39.07820478242382	12680

The literature tends to highlight participants' access to practice, feedback from experienced members, and relationship building. However, not all crowdsourcing environments offer participants opportunities for access, feedback, and relationship building (e.g., Citizen Science). We study how volunteers learn to participate in a citizen science project, Planet Hunters, through participant observation, interviews, and trace ethnography. Drawing on Sørensen's sociomaterial theories of presence, we extend the notion of situated learning to include several modes of learning. The empirical findings suggest that volunteers in citizen science engage more than one form of access to practice, feedback, and relationship building. Communal relations characterize only one form of learning. Equally important to their learning are authority--subject and agent-centered forms of access, feedback, and relationship building.	citizen science;crowdsourcing;online community;planet hunters;situated;theory	Gabriel Mugar;Carsten S.

cd147ae2c7faeb3639db956ea2fce962771059f7	addressing the digital divide between nursing practice and education using a personal digital assistant (pda)	digital divide	The nursing practice environment is currently in the midst of change as nurses undergo the shift in documenting care from the historical print paradigm to the contemporary digital paradigm. As the electronic health record becomes a working reality, educators are faced with the challenge of preparing graduates of the pre-registration programmes for the digital world of practice. Although students of undergraduate pre-registration nursing programmes are required by the Nursing Council of New Zealand to have a minimum of 1500 clinical hours within the reality of the health care delivery sector they have no opportunity to use the associated electronic health record networks due to the correlation between levels of access and employee status, which is designed to protect consumers of health care and health providers. Coupled with this is a necessity for graduates to be proficient with the electronic health record and with the legalities and ethics that surround the phenomenon. International trends indicate that the bedside collection of patient based information using point-of-care technology will be the modality of the future. The School of Health Science, UNITEC has addressed this issue for their students by writing a database programme that emulates the real world of nursing practice and enables the necessary learning to occur based upon sound pedagogical principles. The programme is introduced over the three-year duration of the nursing student’s education, in that students use a desktop version initially to capture the academic requirements of their clinical experiences and skills mastery, culminating in using a PDA in their final year within community clinical placements to construct ‘pseudo’ electronic health records and access nursing specific applications that provide learning resources from the point-of-care delivery. The ‘pseudo’ electronic record becomes part of a growing database on a server located within the educational organisation. The database then provides students with a record of their clinical function over a period of time, whilst at the same time informing curriculum development by providing faculty with data concerning the nursing problems that students in the field face and the nursing actions that they take accordingly. The authors will present the pedagogical principles associated with integration of the technology in curriculum and will provide participants with the opportunity to use the PDA version of the programme, connecting to a server and accessing the learning resources that nursing students use in the field by using this contemporary learning technology.

With the globalization of crafting software and its services, the software industry is seen as a lucrative economic growth opportunity. Unlike other industrial investments, the software industry is convenient to developing countries for its low-cost of establishment. All is needed is an affordable real estate rental, a bunch of PCs, and a few skilled workers to get the business running. The globalization of the software industry with attention given to accessing the right skills no matter where and reducing costs through cheap labor is even a realization to those countries ambitions to remedy part of their economic challenges. India preceded with utilizing such potential and made good use of such globalization, or flatism, of the software industry; positioning itself as a successful model to those nations aspiring to compete globally and establish economic growth.  Egypt is no exception from this ambition. Geographically positioned in proximity to Europe at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia and with access to abundant low wage talent pool of multilingual technical graduates annually are all factors that made it conceivable that Egypt can compete in the global industry of software. However, such entrance into competition, notably with India as well as other Middle Eastern countries, have shaped trends in the practices of software engineering in Egypt as well as it did emerge several challenges that Egypt should learn to remedy if it wants to stay competitive in the global software industry. This paper attempts to shed light on salient current software engineering practices and related challenges that would be affecting Egypt's progress and competitive edge.

In the social network, the recommendation is often from one user to another user. Therefore, it is necessary to determine how the two users trust each other. However, much work has paid more attention to the one-to-one trust relationship but ignored the many-to-one relationship. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid trust degree model to describe how two users trust each other. This model not only considers the direct trust degree and indirect trust degree between the two users, but also considers the group trust degree.

This paper uses the locus of control to test the influence of individual employee’s attitude towards turnover intention. The results showed that: perceived organizational support had a significant positive correlation with job satisfaction; perceived organizational support had a significant negative correlation with turnover intention; and job satisfaction mediates the relationship between perceived organizational supports and turnover intention.	locus;theory	Qin Zhou	2009	2009 Second International Conference on Education Technology and Training	10.1109/ETT.2009.80	organizational commitment;job attitude;computer science;knowledge management;job performance;job satisfaction;empirical research;affective events theory	HCI	-85.75582731399925	0.023984561693696716	12789

Vulnerability categorisation plays a major role in this regard by increasing objectivity of security assessment process. Further, it suggests doing assessment of severity level of vulnerability categories to prioritise them relatively. That in turn leads in developing better risk mitigation strategies by addressing multiple vulnerabilities of same genre simultaneously. In this direction, this paper proposes an algorithm to evaluate severity index of vulnerability categories focusing on vulnerability characteristics and relative distribution of vulnerability population. Proposed algorithm applied on 22846 vulnerabilities listed by NVD which are categorised under 23 categories and further severity index for all the 23 categories were calculated.	algorithm;categorization;common weakness enumeration;national vulnerability database;network security;objectivity/db;vulnerability (computing);vulnerability management	Anshu Tripathi;Umesh Kumar Singh	2013	IJICS	10.1504/IJICS.2013.058211	vulnerability;computer science;data mining;computer security;cvss;categorization	Security	-71.00729247450892	-8.652136618093396	12797

Understanding the machine can be easier when it is represented graphically, and tools have been developed to this end. However, these tools typically support only one programming language and do not work in a web browser. In this article, we present the functionality and technical implementation of the two visualization tools. First, the language-agnostic and extensible Jsvee library helps educators visualize notional machines and create expression-level program animations for online course materials. Second, the Kelmu toolkit can be used by ebook authors to augment automatically generated animations, for instance by adding annotations such as textual explanations and arrows. Both of these libraries have been used in introductory programming courses, and there is preliminary evidence that students find the animations useful.

36eeeb3a4a52924edf5f5a554555cdd2bdebb15f	"""developing a """"culturally together"""" system for cultural sustainability and the reconciling of peoples"""		At its core, the issue of sustainability, perhaps the critical issue of this millennium, is not an ecological one. It is, we would argue in this paper, a cultural one. Strategists have long recognized that for an organization (country, business) to be competitive, it is not enough that it have “the competitive edge”. Its advantage must be sustainable over time. If our basic resources are not sustainable, competitive advantage is itself a meaningless concept. In short, the very concept of strategy is itself under threat or at least being re-invented by this threat. A shift from the sharp “hyper-competitive” end of the competitive-collaborative continuum towards the collaborative end is (perhaps is not, but ought to be) taking place in our time. Underlying this “ought” is a cultural shift, from a culture of exploitation, or harvesting, to one of respect, or guardianship (In Maori “Mana tiaki“). In broad terms, this is a radical mindshift as rationality drives the western business mindset towards that of indigenous culture. Underlying this strategic issue, therefore, is a keenly-felt cultural business dilemma.	apache continuum;ecology;exploit (computer security);rationality;threat (computer)	Wayne Taurima;Michael Cash	2000			dilemma;political science;legal guardian;socioeconomics;mindset;cultural sustainability;indigenous;competitive advantage;rationality;sustainability	AI	-76.00747607191094	-10.426444569641026	12800

When these affiliates are excluded from the parent IT infrastructure, they establish their own social media presence. Yet the digital presence of a company is typically controlled by the parent information technology (IT) function even if current social media platforms can be used without IT assistance. The study identifies ways in which parents can still exert control over social media usage through the use of IT control points that still connect an affiliate to a parent. These control points were identified through studying the social media strategy of a local affiliate associated with a multi-national clothing retailer. The study hints at the potential shift in the balance of power by easy-to-use social media applications and the intricate web of control to maintain it.	balance of power;social media	Nelson E.

Some of these roles are ear-marked for “traditional” information specialists, but many are not – and although some information specialists have moved into this kind of work, others from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds occupy many of the newly-created information-related positions. This paper reports on a project undertaken by a team of researchers from the corporate and academic sectors in the UK. The project aimed to consolidate, and strengthen, understanding of the emerging information job market, with a view to indicating how those in the “traditional” information profession may extend their occupational reach. The preliminary findings of the work, as presented here, indicate that this job market has grown due to a number of factors. Individuals who can offer skills in particular areas of work that support information delivery, in particular information architecture and content management, are well-positioned to take up the opportunities that this market offers, whether or not they hold formal information qualifications. The research approaches adopted have taken this discussion beyond the natural constituency of earlier work that predicts the nature of information profession in the digital future. This paper, which furnishes an overview of main messages from the preliminary findings of the project under discussion, will be of particular interest to those keen to explore the existing scope of work opportunities for information professionals in electronic environments, and to those whose ambitions lie in preparing for, responding to, and leading the future information world.

324426ce6d21c1cdf7c089aef231dcb2a9fbdd82	accounting institution citation-based research rankings by topical area and methodology		ABSTRACT: This study creates citation-based rankings for accounting institutions by topical areas (AIS, audit, financial, managerial, tax, and other) and methodologies (archival, analytical, experimental, and other) extending prior count-based ranking studies that disaggregate rankings by topic and methodology. We report separate rankings for different year windows (previous six years, 12 years, and since 1990) and only give institutions credit for authors who currently work for the institution. We show that disaggregated citation-based rankings are important as the correlations for some topic areas and methodologies with an overall ranking are modest. We also show that the correlation for citation-based and count-based rankings can differ significantly in some situations suggesting the importance of considering both types of rankings in decision making.

2186e181bff954bd98d143f3c7d46b0bdcdfebf0	causal discovery with models: behavior, affect, and learning in cognitive tutor algebra		Non-cognitive and behavioral phenomena, including gaming the system, off-task behavior, and affect, have proven to be important for understanding student learning outcomes. The nature of these phenomena requires investigations into their causal structure. For example, given that gaming the system has been associated with poorer learning outcomes, would reducing such behavior improve outcomes? Answering this question requires an understanding of whether gaming the system is a cause of poor outcomes, rather than, for example, only sharing a common cause with factors influencing learning. Because controlled experiments to settle such causal questions are often costly or impractical, we employ algorithmic search for the structure of graphical causal models from non-experimental data. Using sensor-free, data-driven detectors of behavior and affect, this work extends Baker and Yacef’s notion of “discovery with models” to incorporate causal discovery and reasoning, resulting in an approach we call “causal discovery with models.” We explore a case study of this approach using data from Carnegie Learning’s Cognitive Tutor for Algebra and raise questions for future research.	causal filter;causal system;causality;cognitive tutor;experiment;sensor	Stephen Fancsali	2014			machine learning	ML	-73.05824823715184	-47.105665049534096	12870
bb277fa95ad2867576e6e7562a4475bee4286ae4	the samal model for affective learning: a multidimensional model incorporating the body, mind and emotion in learning		In this study we propose a new model for affective learning, SAMAL Model (Smart Ambience for Affective Learning Model) which illustrates the interplay between the body, mind and emotion in learning. This model is based upon experiential theories and the use of the body moving within the virtual reality space. The SAMAL project investigates the application of immersive interactive media and virtual reality as a tool in education to enhance learners’ motivation to learn, and make a bridge between affect, cognition and learning. The players actively engage with the interactive media experiencing the feelings associated with the challenges and successes of interacting with the virtual learning scenarios. SAMAL learning activities give opportunity for students to feel the many facets of animal survival. Our initial findings revealed that action based trial by error experiential process offered through the SAMAL allowed the students to experience the challenges of survival for birds from an affect sense thus increasing students’ learning motivation. Our data also showed that there was also a higher correlation between affect and greater learning for players than was for the watchers, who actively observed.

This has been an obstacle for adoption. We report on an initial design for a firm-level cloud computing readiness metrics suite. We propose categories and measures to form a set of metrics to measure adoption readiness and assess the required adjustments in strategy and management, technology and operations, and business policies. We reviewed the relevant interdisciplinary literature and interviewed industry professionals to ground our metrics based on theory and practice knowledge. We identified four relevant categories for firm-level adoption readiness: technological, organizational, economic and environmental factors. We defined sub-categories and measures for each category. We also proposed several propositions to show how the metrics can contribute to business value creation.	cloud computing	Robert J.

It's hypermedia capabilities, and its multi-layered structure makes it possible to put in context different sources and testimonies in a virtual space where all objects are semantically related, as well as to take into account explicit distinctions about original sources, related historical information, or editorial interventions. Music digital scholarly editions embodied an interactive nature allowing users to choose from different outputs or reading paths on the bias of different purposes; namely musicological study, learning/teaching activities or performing.  In this context, this Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop a theoretical model for the integration of performing variants (technical and/or expressive) that are transmitted orally or through informal channels (marks, notes or text annotations), and usually from teacher to student, within a particular stylistic or interpretive school. The new standards for encoding musical documents like MEI, allow incorporating this information as superposed layers, explicitly differentiated, to the original sources and testimonies. The proposed model is developed within the so-called social editing paradigm, which postulates the integration of some of the 2.0 Web characteristics as the collaborative production of knowledge within the academic editing processes. These new editing practices allow the integration of work's related knowledge, that circulates outside the formal editing and publication circuits, within the scholarly edition.	hypermedia;music encoding initiative;programming paradigm;quantum superposition;theory;virtual reality	Javier Merchán Sánchez-Jara;José Antonio Cordón García;Raquel Gómez Díaz	2017		10.1145/3144826.3145446	knowledge management;musical;multimedia;encoding (memory);hypermedia;music encoding initiative;computer science;embodied cognition	Web+IR	-66.14601033461622	-33.27627282187684	13023

The industry needs to develop standard networks, platform and devices and also create reliability in the medium through which m-commerce will take place. From the empirical section of this paper, m-commerce has become more available and user friendly and is considered a pull market as reflected in increasingly positive attitudes towards the implication of such technology into routine decision-making tasks.	mobile commerce	Alan D.

A difficulty when preparing such elicitation interviews is to select the topics to discuss, so as to avoid missing important information. Stakeholders may spontaneously share information on some topics, but remain silent on others, unless asked explicitly. We propose the Elicitation Topic Map (ETM) to help engineers in preparing interviews. ETM is a diagram showing topics that may be discussed during interviews, and shows how likely stakeholders discuss each of these topics spontaneously. If a topic is less likely to be discussed spontaneously, then this suggests that engineers may want to prepare questions on it, before the interview. ETM was produced through theoretical and empirical research. The theoretical part consisted of identifying topic sets based on a conceptual model of communication context, grounded in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and computer science. The empirical part involved interviews with requirements engineering professionals to identify the topic sets and topics in each set, surveys of business people in order to evaluate how likely they would spontaneously share information about topics, and evaluations of how likely students would share information about each topic, when asked about requirements for social network websites.	artificial intelligence;computer science;diagram;interviews;requirement;requirements engineering;social network;topic maps	Corentin Burnay;Ivan Jureta;Stéphane Faulkner	2014	Inf.

The results revealed that the top five countries produced the NR raw material by the order of productivity volumes were Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and China whereas those produced the synthetic rubber were the United States, China, Japan, Russia and Germany. Among the top three countries for NR production, Malaysia became a NR producer for its own use, whereas Thailand and Indonesia still had higher export volumes. Research articles and patents on natural rubber had contribution shares of about 20.9% and 47.5% of all rubber publications, respectively. The patents on natural rubber were found to increase with time while the research articles remained unchanged. Journal of Applied Polymer Science was the most preferable for publishing the research papers on rubbers. Eight countries ranked in the top countries for contributing the research articles on natural rubber were the United States, India, Malaysia, France, Germany, Thailand, Japan and China, similar country distributions being also found for research articles on synthetic styrene-butadiene rubber except for Thailand and Malaysia. No linear relationship between the productivity-export volume and research publication number was observed, but the results implied that the growth rate for commercializing the rubber was greater than that for research and development of natural rubber. Most NR research works focused on neat NR, which was contributed the most by USA while NR blend and NR composite papers were mainly published by Indian researchers.	citation index;database;neat particles;noise reduction;numerical recipes;polymer;scopus;synthetic intelligence	Narongrit Sombatsompop;Teerasak Markpin;E.

Technology for the disabled , technostress, the loss of personal privacy, deskilling of jobs, and universal access to the information highway are but a few of the terms and catch phrases that we normally associate with computers and the quality of life. But the quality of life is a much broader issue and how computer technology affects the quality of life is much more elusive than what much of the current discussion on these topics suggests. Further, there are significant ways in which computers will affect our quality of life in the future which are not on the """"radar screen"""" of current research and thus cannot be addressed at all if we limit ourselves to the examination of specific topics. The purpose of this paper is threefold. The first objective is to explore the concept of the quality of life with the goal of developing a useful framework for understanding this phenomenon independent of computer technology. The second objective is to use this framework to evaluate how computer technology can impact the quality of life now and in the future. The third objective is to operationalize this framework to the extent that it can be applied to the specific issues above by other researchers who wish to embed their analysis in broader psychological and philosophical concepts. The quality of life can be examined from two very different perspectives: one objective and one subjective. As an objective phenomenon, the quality of life is measurable lind reportable independent of the specific experiences of individuals. As a subjective phenomenon, the quality of life is something that every person experiences but is difficult to report on in a meaningful way. The demands of responsible research would push one toward the objective view of quality of life, while the demand for understanding pushes one toward the subjective view.

In the late 1990s, industry started to investigate the benefits of using RFID to identifying non-living things throughout the supply chain toward new efficiencies in business operations. Not long after, people began to consider the possibilities of getting RFID tag or transponder implants for themselves. Mr Amal Graafstra of the United States is one of the first, and probably most well-known ‘do it yourselfer’ (DIY) implantees, who enjoys building customized projects which enable him to interact with his private social living space. Since 2005, hundreds of people have embarked on a mission to interact with their mobile phones, their cars, and their house via a chip implant, providing personalized settings for their own ultimate convenience. This paper presents some of the socio-technical issues facing the RFID implantee sub-culture, namely health and safety, privacy, security, regulation, and societal perceptions. The paper concludes with a list of recommendations related to implantables for hobbyists.		Amal Graafstra;Katina Michael;M. G.

Very few contemporary studies have addressed the issue of understanding the actual beliefs and attitudes toward such initiatives. In this study, we investigate the beliefs and attitudes surrounding the ill-fated Australian Government's Health and Social Services Smart Card. We apply a proven electronic business theory model to address the research question: what are the general beliefs and attitudes of the Australian community and industry toward the introduction and use of the smart card? The study uses a composite concept mapping and content analysis technique to reveal that information security, personal privacy and the spectre of a national identification card engender serious community concerns over the proposed introduction of the smart card. The article brings further empirical understanding of the use of public smart cards, while highlighting the importance of political transparency, broad ranging community consultations, and sound technical design in electronic government projects.	smart card	Nigel J.

Nevertheless, most of the research work focuses on the competence-based approaches disregarding the assessment process. Following some previous works where we discussed our competence-based assessment model, we present in this paper an overview of the overall approach and we provide a generic scenario model to depict the performing of the competence-based assessment process.	requirement;software engineer	Mounira Ilahi;Lilia Cheniti-Belcadhi;Rafik Braham	2014	2014 IEEE 14th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2014.103	simulation;knowledge management;competence-based management;competence;lifelong learning;management;pedagogy	Robotics	-78.52830168731697	-45.24360445565687	13238

Supporting conversion theory, majorities had a more interpersonal, outward focus as tested through use of more third person plural pronouns (“they”). Supporting conversion theory’s validation process, minority members who used a higher percentage of causation words were more influential. Majority members who used more second person pronouns (“you”) had less influence in the group, in support of previous research that found that “you” words were counterproductive with conflict. It was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between linguistic mimicry and discussion of information shared by all group members, but this was only found in homogeneous groups.

This is because the need for explanations is obvious, and generation from a knowledge-based application such as reasoning should be relatively straightforward. However, while explanation has been universally acknowledged as a desirable functionality in expert systems, natural language generation has not taken a central place in contemporary expert system development. For example, a popular text book about expert systems such as (Giarratano and Riley, 1994) stresses twice in the introduction the importance of explanation, but provides no further mention of explanation in the remaining 600 pages. (The book is based on the popular CLIPS framework.) In this paper, we present a new approach to providing an expert system with an explanation facility. The approach comprises both software components and a methodology for assembling the components. The methodology is minimally intrusive into existing expert system development practice.	cdk;clips;component-based software engineering;expert system;natural language generation	Regina Barzilay;Daryl McCullough;Owen Rambow;Jonathan D.

Since its implementation and applications are important in all areas it has become a regular school subject. Probably because of unpredictable development and impact in the future, there are many questions concerning the content and methods of informatics education. The paper intends to find the way how to prepare proper informatics education for future non-professionals in Informatics, so that it isn't just about “clicking the correct buttons” in the current packets of programs/applications - and therefore not getting obsolete just after a few months/years. Being aware of the increasing pedagogical challenges posed by using and teaching ICT, we at the Faculty of Economics, Technical University of Košice started to improve our Informatics courses. The education we propose is practical and real-life oriented. Our aim is also to capture successful experiences of learning and teaching from both academic and practice areas.	experience;informatics;real life	Libusa Révészová	2016	2016 39th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522255	health administration informatics;business informatics;unified modeling language;engineering informatics;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data science;informatics engineering;management science;informatics;materials informatics;management	HCI	-75.39205179386478	-29.3619193573738	13270

Starting from a textual analysis of funding program calls aimed at individual researchers and from the challenges for an indicator at this level in particular, a new type of indicator is proposed. The Impact Vitality indicator [RONS & AMEZ, 2008] reflects the vitality of the impact of a researcher's publication output, based on the change in volume over time of the citing publications. The introduced metric is shown to posses attractive operational characteristics and meets a number of criteria which are desirable when comparing individual researchers. The validity of one of the possible indicator variants is tested using a small dataset of applicants for a senior full time Research Fellowship. Options for further research involve testing various indicator variants on larger samples linked to different kinds of evaluations.	bibliometrics;operational definition	Nadine Rons;Lucy Amez	2013	CoRR	10.3152/095820209X470563	social science;management science;sociology;public administration;management;operations research	AI	-78.21515582710019	-22.471306088581553	13281

2daab220c55c4da66ef9e19e6e60cb1b0dedfd14	the moral imperative to preserve	text;monumental preservation;libraries and society	This article introduces the concept of monumental preservation, which the author defines as the preservation of all cultural phenomena, because from the smallest item to the greatest monument all things emanate from and reflect culture. The imperative to preserve monuments is the imperative to preserve our cultural heritage. Whether there is a moral responsibility to preserve cultural heritage may be considered from philosophical, political, and legal perspectives. The preservation of cultural heritage1 has been around for millennia, as illustrated by the biblical passage “take these evidences . . . and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue for many days” ( Jeremiah 32:14).2 Many similar references to the preservation or safe-keeping of artifacts exist in literature. One recent author has gone so far as to say that “[t]he Human Being is a repairing animal. Repair is ubiquitous, something we engage in every day and in almost every dimension of our lives. Homo sapiens is also Homo reparans” (Spelman, 2002, p. 1). But equally forceful as the impulse to preserve is the impulse to destroy. History is strewn with countless examples—-as the destruction of the Alexandrian Library in the fourth century ad or the destruction of the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 vividly and poignantly demonstrate. Sometimes destruction occurs in the name of preservation. Perhaps the most cited example is the Elgin Marbles, the Phidian sculptures from the Parthenon. In the process of supposedly liberating the marbles from Greece, Lord Elgin’s workers broke or destroyed a number of them. They had to destroy the original edifice to “preserve” some of its parts.3 LIBRARY TRENDS, Vol. 55, No. 3, Winter 2007 (“Libraries in Times of War, Revolution, and Social Change,” edited by W.

a635248bd1d1be600b7d8477f1a4749f158ac5a2	we value your privacy ... now take some cookies: measuring the gdpr's impact on web privacy		The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Its privacy regulations apply to any service and company collecting or processing personal data in Europe. Many companies had to adjust their data handling processes, consent forms, and privacy policies to comply with the GDPR’s transparency requirements. We monitored this rare event by analyzing the GDPR’s impact on popular websites in all 28 member states of the European Union. For each country, we periodically examined its 500 most popular websites – 6,579 in total – for the presence of and updates to their privacy policy. While many websites already had privacy policies, we find that in some countries up to 15.7 % of websites added new privacy policies by May 25, 2018, resulting in 84.5 % of websites having privacy policies. 72.6 % of websites with existing privacy policies updated them close to the date. Most visibly, 62.1 % of websites in Europe now display cookie consent notices, 16 % more than in January 2018. These notices inform users about a site’s cookie use and user tracking practices. We categorized all observed cookie consent notices and evaluated 16 common implementations with respect to their technical realization of cookie consent. Our analysis shows that core web security mechanisms such as the same-origin policy pose problems for the implementation of consent according to GDPR rules, and opting out of thirdparty cookies requires the third party to cooperate. Overall, we conclude that the GDPR is making the web more transparent, but there is still a lack of both functional and usable mechanisms for users to consent to or deny processing of their personal data on the Internet.

The tool, designed with Shockwave and Macromedia Director, is used as a teaching methodology in an undergraduate course using modern microprocessors, architectures, and applications. An information system theory, called the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM), has been applied to detect both the use of the tool and the external variables that have a significant influence over it. The obtained results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses to be reinforced and have been taken into account to implement the final version of the tool. The proposed method may be extended to similar tools and experiments to fill the lack of scientific studies in the validation and acceptance of computer-based educational tools.	adobe shockwave;digital signal processing;experiment;external variable;ibm tivoli access manager;information system;interactivity;microprocessor;systems theory;web application;world wide web	Sergio L.

System dynamics is the simulation method selected in this theory-building effort, based on qualitative data collected by the Center for Technology in Government. The model integrates concepts from economic models, as well as psychological and sociological theories about trust, learning, and perceptual processes in interpersonal relations. The simulation experiments show plausible path dependent behaviors with the characteristic asymmetries between trust and distrust described both in the literature an in the case data. The role of trust and knowledge development in the success of these projects is explored by combining models of sub processes into larger models of the overall collaboration.

Based on a survey of 240 undergraduate students in a Malaysian university, the study explores the relationship between learning styles and the acceptance of open learner models for information sharing using a chi-square test. An independent t-test is conducted to investigate the gender difference on the acceptance of open learner models. The result reveals that there is no association between learners' learning styles and the acceptance of open learner models for information sharing. It shows that there is no difference between genders on the acceptance of open learner models. Such findings can assist open learner models designers to apply appropriate instructional design strategies in developing sustainable collaborative learning.

Our involvement in these programs was to develop the metrics and methodologies for assessing the impact on users; in this case, on intelligence analysts. In particular, we focused on metrics to evaluate how much the intelligent systems contribute to the users’ tasks and what the cost is to the user in terms of workload and process deviations. In this paper, we describe the approach used. We started with two types of preliminary investigations – first, collecting and analyzing data from analysts working in an instrumented environment for a period of 2 years, and second, developing and conducting formative evaluations of research software. The long-term studies informed our ideas about the processes that analysts use and provided potential metrics in an environment without intelligent software tools. The formative evaluations helped us to define sets of application-specific metrics. Finally, we conducted assessments during and after technology insertions. We describe the metrics and methodologies used in each of these activities, along with the lessons	evaluation function;on intelligence;user-centered design	Jean Scholtz;Emile L.

4c2841ee315c5bf64699fe56576403c876e9978a	predictors of cancer information overload: findings from a national survey		Introduction. We explore predictors of information overload among cancer information seekers who reported having suffered from information overload. These persons were characterized by socio-demographic characteristics, health status, health information and communication environment and behavioural, cognitive, and affective cancer information seeking. Method. A secondary analysis was performed of the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute with 6,369 randomly selected participants. A subset of this dataset, which includes the responses of 3,011 cancer information seekers, was analysed. A bivariate analysis was used to identify factors significantly associated with information overload. These factors were then entered in a logistic regression model to identify predictors of overload. Results. Lower socio-economic status, poor health, low media attentiveness and high affective components of information seeking were associated with overload. The strongest predictors were education level and cognitive aspects of information seeking, which indicates that overload is strongly predicted by health information literacy skills. Use of the Internet and high media attentiveness, two factors usually thought to cause overload, were found not to be associated with overload. Conclusion. The findings emphasize the importance of health information literacy in coping with information overload and implies the need to design better health information campaigns and delivery systems. 1/13/08 11:35 PM Predictors of cancer information overload: findings from a national survey Page 2 of 29 http://informationr.net/ir/12-4/paper326.html CHANGE FONT	bivariate data;information literacy;information overload;information seeking;internet;logistic regression;randomness	Kyunghye Kim;Mia Liza A.

f2460a0687bc5dd85edb1ad4ea74d8ceb7f9da45	enablers in crisis information management: a literature review		Social media often plays a central role in crisis informatics as it is an important source for assessing, understanding, and locating crises quickly and accurately. In addition, social media enables actors to react more effectively and efficiently when managing crises. However, enablers of crisis information management have not been carved out explicitly in a systematic view. Therefore, we perform a literature review to synthesize the existing literature on crisis information management with a focus on technical enablers and their classification into the crisis-management phases. As our results show, searching for crisis informatics mostly results in social media-related publications. We found that Twitter is one of the most important technical enablers but that research on other social media platforms is underrepresented. Also, most publications center on the post-crisis phases of crisis management, leaving out the pre-crisis phases.	crisis (dynamical systems);disaster informatics;information management;social media	No-San Lee;Stefan Hirschmeier;Sven Müller;Lars Jürgen Luz	2017			management science;information management;knowledge management;computer science;social media;environmental resource management	HCI	-78.82854684690092	-3.6778768642217954	13510

From this view point some considerations have been done in the law knowledge modeling [Kowalski, this volume]and in this paper the possible impact in the engineering field is discussed. First, a brief overview of the proposals for deep knowledge modeling physical processes is presented. Second, the possible approaches for task oriented architectures in different application fields are discussed (design, reliability analysis, real time failure detection and diagnosis, and real time decision support). Finally, some prospective considerations are made for the application in education of the basic engineering tasks libraries as an alternative or intermediate step to the medium term predictable use of intelligent tutoring systems.	expert system;second generation multiplex plus	José Cuena	1989		10.1007/3-540-52952-7_4	engineering management;legal expert system;systems engineering;knowledge management;subject-matter expert	NLP	-85.16970189002356	-29.765606282691287	13533

Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows Churchill’s guideline for developing measures that have desirable reliability and validity. The pilot data are used to develop a proper measurement. The survey data, based on the 126 valid responses of 328 companies, are analysed by structural equation modelling (SEM) statistical methods. Findings – The paper finds that the dimensions affecting ERP adoption show that characteristics of the CEO and perceived benefits possess positive effects on ERP adoption, while cost and technology have negative effects on ERP adoption. However, only “perceived benefits” is a significant dimension. It is surprising that the cost of the ERP system does not significantly affect ERP adoption. Research limitations/implications – The paper shows that the sample size should be taken into consideration when generalising the findings, and extended data and measures are required for further in-depth investigation in specific areas. Practical implications – The paper points out that the managers of SMEs with limited resources can find many ways to get more resources from governments. Government managers should be more realistically set the goal of helping firms in a healthy condition to adopt e-business instead of setting the goal of improving the e-business readiness of all SMEs. To help all CEOs of SMEs to realise the potential benefits, governments can work with academic research groups to set up forums and workshops to broadcast knowledge. Originality/value – The paper develops measurements to assess the ERP adoption of small and medium-sized enterprises. The results offer practical help for government managers to better understand ERP adoption with institutional help in Taiwan.

4738629abeafe6e414dc6ce56136d80076831464	academic research groups: evaluation of their quality and quality of their evaluation		In recent years, evaluation of the quality of academic research has become an increasingly important and influential business. It determines, often to a large extent, the amount of research funding flowing into universities and similar institutes from governmental agencies and it impacts upon academic careers. Policy makers are becoming increasingly reliant upon, and influenced by, the outcomes of such evaluations. In response, university managers are increasingly attracted to simple indicators as guides to the dynamics of the positions of their various institutions in league tables. However, these league tables are frequently drawn up by inexpert bodies such as newspapers and magazines, using rather arbitrary measures and criteria. Terms such as “critical mass” and “metrics” are often bandied about without proper understanding of what they actually mean. Rather than accepting the rise and fall of universities, departments and individuals on a turbulent sea of arbitrary measures, we suggest it is incumbent upon the scientific community itself to clarify their nature. Here we report on recent attempts to do that by properly defining critical mass and showing how group size influences research quality. We also examine currently predominant metrics and show that these fail as reliable indicators of group research quality.	critical mass (sociodynamics);turbulence	Bertrand Berche;Yurij Holovatch;Ralph Kenna;Olesya Mryglod	2015	CoRR	10.1088/1742-6596/681/1/012004	league;critical mass (software engineering);newspaper;public relations;economics	ECom	-78.10115664058495	-22.04257191520865	13556

These arguments are based on a discussion of the European and Chinese standardisation systems, on a subsequent SWOT analysis and on a brief case study.		Kai Jakobs;Martina H.

6ea230ddd42848899fc04bb0cd9cc199709e32a9	a study on designing effective introductory materials for information visualization		Designing introductory materials is extremely important when developing new information visualization techniques. All users, regardless of their domain knowledge, first must learn how to interpret the visually encoded information in order to infer knowledge from visualizations. Yet, despite its significance, there has been little research on how to design effective introductory materials for information visualization. This paper presents a study on the design of online guides that educate new users on how to utilize information visualizations, particularly focusing on the employment of exercise questions in the guides. We use two concepts from educational psychology, learning type (or learning style) and teaching method, to design four unique types of online guides. The effects of the guides are measured by comprehension tests of a large group of crowdsourced participants. The tests covered four visualization types (graph, scatter plot, storyline, and tree map) and a complete range of visual analytics tasks. Our statistical analyses indicate that online guides which employ active learning and the top-down teaching method are the most effective. Our study provides quantitative insight into the use of exercise questions in online guides for information visualizations and will inspire further research on design considerations for other elements in introductory materials.	active learning (machine learning);computer graphics;crowdsourcing;eurographics;information retrieval;information visualization;john d. wiley;teaching method;top type;top-down and bottom-up design;treemapping;uc browser;usability testing;visual analytics;visual guide	Yuzuru Tanahashi;Nick Leaf;Kwan-Liu Ma	2016	Comput.

Offline bullyvictimization can create negative emotional strains. This negative strain combined with the anonymity in cyber space may lead youths to be engaged in cyberbullying behavior as the externalized response to the strain. Using longitudinal Korean National Youth Survey data, this study empirically tested the above theoretical explanation. First, this study found the declining trend of cyberbullying engagement among Korean youths. Secondly, consistent with GST, offline bully-victimization was significantly related to the cyberbullying engagement. Youths who were victims of traditional bullying showed a higher tendency of becoming cyberbullying assaulters with externalizing their strain in cyberspace. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, they provide opportunities for reinventing business processes. Especially, effective knowledge management (KM) requires the use of appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) as well as social interaction. Emerging virtual worlds enable new ways to support knowledge and knowing processes because these virtual environments consider social aspects that are necessary for knowledge creating and knowledge sharing processes. Thus, collaboration in virtual worlds resembles real-life activities. In this paper, we shed light on the use of Second Life (SL) as a KM platform in a real-life setting. To explore the potential and current usage of virtual worlds for knowledge and knowing activities, we conducted a qualitative study at IBM. We interviewed IBM employees belonging to a special workgroup called ‘Web 2.0/ virtual worlds’ in order to gain experience in generating and exchanging knowledge by virtually collaborating and interacting. Our results show that virtual worlds – if they are able to overcome problems like platform stability, user interface or security issues – bear the potential to serve as a KM platform. They facilitate global and simultaneous interaction, create a common context for collaboration, combine different tools for communication and enhance knowledge and knowing processes.	avatar (computing);business process;interaction;knowledge management;real life;sl (complexity);second life;user interface;virtual reality;virtual world;web 2.0	Julia Mueller;Katja Hutter;Johann Füller;Kurt Matzler	2011	Inf.

The problem- based learning (PBL) is a learning theory that emphasizes collaboration and teamwork to solve a problem. However, a problem that occurs frequently in the implementation of PBL is the out-of-context conversation, which is a situation in which the students lose focus and start talking about topics that are not related to the discussion. In presential learning, the teacher can easily detect this problem and try to avoid it in order to improve the learning process. In distance learning, however, detecting this problem is not a trivial task. That is mostly due to issues related to the students' geographic distribution and the lack of information regarding their motivation. Another noteworthy aspect is the creation of workgroups. In PBL, the members of a workgroup that is responsible for solving a problem must have certain complementary knowledge and skills related to the problem, and it might be difficult for the facilitator to assign students to workgroups, since the lack of presential contact makes it difficult to perceive important characteristics of the students' profiles. Then, this paper presents an agent-based architecture for detecting out-of-context conversation and for helping in the creation of workgroups on the PBL.	agent-based model;sensor;web application	Laysa Mabel de Oliveira Fontes;Francisco Milton Mendes Neto;Alexandre Ádames Alves Pontes;Gustavo Augusto Lima de Campos	2011		10.1145/1982185.1982444	distance education;collaborative learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multimedia	AI	-78.04277022360502	-44.151463677112446	13713

Sixty-four university students participated in a remote computer-mediated dyadic learning scenario. Co-learners were provided (or not) with a visual representation of their peer’s level of prior knowledge through what we refer to as a knowledge awareness tool (KAT). The results show that, providing co-learners with objective cues about the level of their peer’s prior knowledge positively impacts learning outcomes. In addition, this effect seems to be mediated by the fact that co-learners provided with these objective cues become more accurate in estimating their partner’s knowledge – accuracy that predicts higher outcomes. Analyses on the process level of the verbal interactions indicate that the KAT seems to sensitize co-learners to the fragile nature of their partner’s as well as their own prior knowledge. The beneficial effect of the KAT seems to mainly rely on this induction of epistemic uncertainty that implicitly triggers compensation socio-cognitive strategies; strategies that appear to be beneficial to the learning process. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It describes and investigates two different change agent roles, driver and enabler, that are seldom articulated as fundamentally different concepts. It rdso differentiates between two technology-related agents of change that are often intermingled in research: IT applications and the IS group that delivers the new applications. Sixteen senior IS and business managers employed in five large Silicon Valley companies were interviewed to obtain insight into their experiences with IT/IS as an agent of change in their organizations. Qualitative analyses of these interviews suggest that IT and IS have, in fact, both played a significant role as an organizational change agent, each having served as an enabler and as a driver of change in different circumstances.

Four of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions were considered as categories of interpretation. The purpose of the research was to determine the extent to which Hofstede’s static quantitative, research could be used as a basis for an essentially qualitative dynamic interpretation. While Hofstede’s work focuses on cultural differences, this article tries to uncover what commonalities were constructed in the process. It was found that in this case, dimensions such as power distance and uncertainty avoidance tended to amplify each other, while together they resulted in a movement away from individualism towards collectivism. Accommodating across cultures did not mean that one should move into the other culture. Three elements seem to play a role when cultures meet: Reduction of communicative uncertainty, construction of shared meaning, and appropriate use of technology. More research should be conducted to uncover the elements that are common to cultures because emphasising commonality seems more useful than trying to overcome differences. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper builds a multi-task principal-agent model based on those tasks which are delegated to teachers by universities. Then, through in-depth analysis of the model, we explore the relationships among teachers' effort level, relative incentive intensity, tasks' uncertainty degree, and their risk aversion. The results show that, when teachers' risk aversion and tasks' uncertainty degree become bigger, their effort level will become lower. Secondly, the relative incentive intensity will reduce with the increase of the uncertainty of teaching task and the relative incentive intensity will increase with the increase of the uncertainty of scientific research task. Finally, teachers should be motivated differently according to tasks uncertainty and risk aversion.	computer multitasking;risk aversion	Fang Lu;Jiangshun Zhang;Luo Ding Ti	2014	2014 Seventh International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization	10.1109/CSO.2014.23	public relations;principal–agent problem;uncertainty;economics;knowledge management;statistics	Robotics	-88.471750947313	3.15697991101112	13806

However, one of the main problems faced by students is making optimal decisions in relation to their academic progress and status based on formal information available to them. In this context, this research proposes a decision support system that incorporates qualitative information, including use of the experiences of previous students in the recommendation process.	decision support system	Hyonam Jeong;Jun Hwang	2017	IJAMC	10.1504/IJAMC.2017.10004897	r-cast;recommender system;decision support system;management science;computer science;management information systems;higher education;executive information system;knowledge management	Robotics	-76.18423200086993	-34.02468982915957	13835

A structural equation-modeling approach was applied to identify the variables that significantly affect the decision of using the system. Using LISREL 8.54, data collected from 546 blue-collar workers were used to test the proposed research model. Empirical testing of the extended TAM found all paths to be significant in the hypothesized directions, that is, the results of the study strongly support the application of extended TAM in predicting the blue-collar workers' intention to use a web-based learning system. Among the factors, social influence is a much stronger predictor of user intention compared to others. The study concludes with the implications of this study for managers and recommendations for possible future research.	web application	Demet Karaali;Cigdem Altin Gumussoy;Fethi Calisir	2011	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2010.08.012	psychology;simulation;automotive industry;social psychology;law;statistics	AI	-92.38266395272431	-10.201812107544708	13836

Two years ago, fresh out of graduate school, I believed in meticulously following the design processes and standard evaluation methods I had just mastered. But since then, I’ve discovered that more important than any particular process is the sheer time spent with the people I was designing for or with during initial investigations, during prototyping, and during usability testing. Immersion in a community allowed me to gain intuition and a sense of its culture in a way that is difficult to realize through process alone. It is this cultural understanding that is of foremost value to key insights. Of course, processes have their place, but almost always with adjustment to the cultural context. Together with my colleagues, I have been working on text-free user interfaces for illiterate and semi-literate users. The goal is to devise and implement design principles such that a illiterate person can, at first contact with a PC, immediately realize useful interaction with minimal or no assistance. Through an extensive ethnographic study involving more than 300 hours and 250 people from urban slums in Bangalore, India, we arrived at several design principles that we believe could apply to many illiterate groups new to computer use. These design principles include avoidance of text, use of unabstracted cartoons, User-Centered Design for Development U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T f u o u r u u u m	foremost;immersion (virtual reality);personal computer;semiconductor industry;software prototyping;star trek: first contact;usability testing;user interface;user-centered design	Indrani Medhi-Thies	2007	Interactions	10.1145/1273961.1273973	user interface design;user experience design;user-centered design;human–computer interaction;computer science;design education	HCI	-66.59284662839819	-27.541266704559096	13853

We apply the sentiment analysis technique to analyze the overall sentiment of each insurance type since 2012. Our findings show that since 2013 consumers had more negative attitudes toward insurance services. We also extracted consumers’ emotions for each insurance type and found that consumers generally have more negative emotions than positive ones toward insurance services. Moreover, the results show that consumer reviews sentiments could accurately predict consumer review ratings and there are significant differences in review ratings between positive, neutral, and negative consumer reviews sentiments for all insurance types. The results of this study highlight the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding consumers’ opinion toward different services that could help companies to reduce consumers negative attitudes and to attract more customers.	sentiment analysis	Maryam Ghasemaghaei;Seyed Pouyan Eslami;Ken Deal;Khaled Hassanein	2016				HCI	-88.0532768609721	-12.493968048702014	13861

The author believes that electronic borders are a viable mechanism for controlling international connections. But the actual implementation of borders requires much more study and experience. There are those who would argue against any controls over the Internet, but that position ignores the crime, oppression, and aggression that already occur in Cyberspace. Borders are a definitional measure for electronic commerce. Border controls can be protective or oppressive, according to the policies of those who implement them. By discussing the basic issues we hope to expand the discussion of mechanisms to improve the security of international computer networks. Most discussions about electronic network protection have failed to arrive at viable alternatives for protection. Human nature seems to prefer separation over uncontrolled interaction. If we cannot somehow manage and control our interactions on the Internet, we may find that members of the global community prefer isolation. This would be more unfortunate than any of the disadvantages exhibited in our discussion of border control. One other thought comes to mind after examining the issues. It appears that most of the arguments for and against electronic borders derive from either a nationalist or globalist view of the Internet. Every nation on earth dislikes some form of activity that occurs on the Internet. In light of these needs for self-protection and self-interest, it is likely that national interests will triumph in the long run.		James E.

5b645343a3e35eef4325011d91f56bccf4f77808	the role of artificial intelligence technologies in the implementation of people-finder knowledge management systems	knowledge management systems;knowledge management;people finder systems;artificial intelligent;knowledge sharing;knowledge management system	The development of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) demands that knowledge be obtained, shared, and regulated by individuals and knowledge-sharing organizational systems such as Knowledge Repositories. One kind of Knowledge Repository, known as Knowledge Yellow Pages or People-Finder Systems, are repositories that attempt to manage knowledge by pointing to experts possessing specific knowledge within an organization. This paper presents the insights, challenges and future plans for the development of two People-Finder KMS: the Searchable Answer Generating Environment (SAGE), and the Expert Seeker. Here we also discuss the role that Artificial Intelligence technologies play in the development of PeopleFinder KMS and in automating the profile-maintenance. Introduction to Knowledge Management Systems Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) have been defined as “an emerging line of systems [which] target professional and managerial activities by focusing on creating, gathering, organizing, and disseminating an organization’s ‘knowledge’ as opposed to ‘information’ or ‘data’” (Alavi and Leidner 1999). It has been observed that KMS currently underway at most organizations fall into three categories (Becerra-Fernandez 1999a): 1. Educational KMS: To elicit and catalog tacit knowledge, and at the same time serve as an educational tool. 2. Problem-Solving KMS: Organizations with significant intellectual capital require eliciting and capturing knowledge for reuse in solving new problems as well as recurring old problems. 3. Knowledge Repositories: The majority of the KMS in place. One kind of Knowledge Repository is known as Knowledge Yellow Pages or People-Finder Systems, are repositories that attempt to manage knowledge by holding pointers to experts who possess specific knowledge within an organization. The paper presents insights from the development of two examples of such People-Finder KMS: the Searchable Answer Generating Environment (SAGE), and the Expert Seeker. This paper discusses insights and lessons learned from the development of these two systems. Finally, it presents the role of technology in automating the process of profile-maintenance, as well as future plans for the integration of Artificial Intelligence technologies in the development of People-Finder KMS. The Searchable Answer Generating Environment (SAGE) KMS The NASA/Florida Minority Institution Entrepreneurial Partnership (FMIEP) grant is funding the development of the Searchable Answer Generated Environment (SAGE), which is in the category of People-Finder KMS (BecerraFernandez 1999b). The purpose of this KM System is to create a repository of experts in the State of Florida (FL) State University System (SUS). Previous studies have pointed out that there is a void in the ability to identify the capabilities in the FL SUS (Kotnour 1998). Currently, each State University in Florida keeps a database of funded research, but these databases are disparate and dissimilar. The SAGE KM System creates a single repository by incorporating a distributed database scheme, which can be searched by a variety of fields, including research topic, investigator name, funding agency or university. As NASA-Kennedy Space Center (KSC) looks to develop new technologies necessary for the continuation of their space exploration missions, their need to partner with Florida SUS experts becomes evident. The main interfaces developed on the query engine use text fields to search the processed data for key words, fields of expertise, names, or other applicable search fields. The application processes the end user's query and returns the pertinent information. The purpose of the SAGE KMS is to unify myriad data collections into one database collection that could easily be mined for relevant data. The benefits of SAGE are: 1. SAGE is a repository of Intellectual Capital within the state of FL SUS. 2. SAGE helps locate FL SUS researchers for collaboration with industry and federal agencies, thus increasing the potential for research funding to the SUS. 3. SAGE enhances communication and allows more visibility for FL SUS experts, making universities more marketable. 4. SAGE combines and unifies existing data from multiple sources into one user web-accessible interface. The SAGE system addresses an important KM problem: From: AAAI Technical Report SS-00-03.

To this end, many retailers are implementing multichannel marketing strategies. (Forrester Research, Inc., 2008) The re-use of structure and content from an existing online shop as an in-store sales tool therefore becomes an attractive proposal. If done successfully, total sales will increase. The challenge is knowing what to keep, tweak, remove or add to ensure the customer experience is retained in-store. By using a combination of qualitative field studies backed up by quantitative data, we adapted the online shop of a large national Swedish sports retailer to an in-store electronic kiosk. In the process, we discovered that the website had to be adjusted to its new environment with regards to both functionality and design. The physical aspect of the kiosk added 'invitation to interaction' and 'reliability' to the list of crucial considerations. Our experience shows that it is possible to use an existing online shop as an in-store sales tool - provided particulars of the socially and architecturally situated retail environment are taken into account.	backup;online shopping;situated	Monika Andersson;Maria Nordmark	2008		10.1145/1463160.1463252	user experience design;interaction;contextual design;human–computer interaction;computer science;retail;marketing strategy;management	AI	-83.4342603557063	-8.049889166305645	13900

During this paper we will outline the European Union sponsored project SUPPLYPOINT (ESPRIT 27007) which addresses the issues of panEuropean electronic trade links for business-to-business and business-to-public body electronic commerce. This will be achieved by using virtual supply chains and covering a life cycle from contract identification to completion, including virtual supply chain management and electronic payments. It will provide a one-stop shopping service for companies to purchase goods and services from small / medium sized enterprises (SMEs) co-operating in virtual and dynamic supply chains. The project started on July 1 1998 and is co-funded by the European Commission to support the multi-national consortium conducting the research and development over a two year peroid.	e-commerce;markov chain;procurement	Susan Kerridge;Andrew Slade;Simon Kerridge;Kevin Ginty	1998	Electronic Markets	10.1080/10196789800000037	supply chain management;economics;computer science;marketing;supply chain	ECom	-64.91199547311521	0.8466953168976649	13916

The goal of this paper is to investigate cross-cultural similarities and differences in the adoption of writing and reading technologies by young people. In particular, it explores the affordances of writing and reading on paper and those of writing on a keyboard and reading on a screen in Germany, Italy and UK.The study is based on a comparative analysis of essays (N=206) about reading and writing practices written by 54 German, 23 British and 129 Italian students. These essays were analyzed through qualitative content analysis in order to understand how reading/writing are reshaped after the advent of ICT use in the educational context.The main result of the study is that there are no major differences between German, Italian and British students. Their choice of paper and pencil vs. screen and keyboard depends on different reasons, which could be summed up into six categories: (1) aesthetical reasons/appearance; (2) practical reasons/habits/traditions; (3) social reasons/receiver and sender relations; (4) physiological/cognitive/health reasons; (5) technological reasons; and (6) ecological reasons.Secondly, there are not mutually exclusive. Both reading on paper or screen and writing with a pen or a keyboard has advantages and disadvantages at the same time. Students take that mode of reading and writing which subjectively suits those best in different contexts.Further research is proposed to explore how subjective preferences and actual performance are affiliated with each other.	computer keyboard	Manuela Farinosi;Christopher Lim;Julia Roll	2016	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2015.09.006	artificial intelligence;multimedia;management;world wide web;reading	HCI	-82.09065421255181	-22.579212511235994	13927

Four potential factors (perceived ease of use, usefulness, negativity, and compatibility) are incorporated to examine their impacts on customers' acceptance of the three electronic reservation services (Internet, telephone, and interactive voice response). The comparisons among the three reservation services about their relative position in each influencing factor are also evaluated. Liner regression and ANOVA were employed to analyze data among 140 usable surveys. The results reveal that perceived ease of use, usefulness, negativity, and compatibility are all related to customers' acceptance of the three electronic services. However, perceived negativity turns to insignificant when considering all the variables simultaneously. The results also indicate that telephone is the least and Internet is the most negative tool for making reservations.	interactive voice response;internet;negativity (quantum mechanics);usability	Mei Hua Huang;Zhao Yu Liu;Perng-Fei Huang	2014	2014 Eighth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2014.81	e-commerce;the internet;computer science;information security;privacy;computer security	HCI	-89.35674238668872	-9.640806992898206	13936

The Virtual Clinic Learning Environment has recently been developed and implemented at East Carolina University using a design framework based on Bloom’s variables, and in the process of refining those design questions, identifies the methods of how serious games provide an overt and subtle learning experience. The overt learning experience is based in the design questions defined and the subtle experience was derived by examining the idea of sense of place as it relates to the virtual environment. By considering these two streams of learning, designers can avoid pitfalls and build on these design elements of a virtual learning environment.	conceptualization (information science);experience;immersion (virtual reality);problem solving;virtual reality	Joshua Peery;Celen Pasalar	2018	Informatics	10.3390/informatics5030030	streams;knowledge management;learning environment;virtual machine;knowledge building;virtual learning environment;instructional design;computer science;sense of place;game design	HCI	-75.23831186502767	-44.3827166210118	13980

Towards this end, we build a system dynamics model using the Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry as the context. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry has started to adopt new information communication technology to connect its offshore platforms, onshore control centers, and suppliers. In oil companies, the management is generally aware of the increasing risks associated with operational transition; however, to date, investment in incident response capability has not been highly prioritized because of the uncertainty related to risks and the present reactive mental model of security risk management. The model simulation shows that a reactive approach to security risk management might trap the organization into blindness to minor incidents and low incident response capability, which can lead to severe incidents. The system dynamics model can serve as a means to promote proactive investment in incident response capability.	computer security incident management;information security;mental model;risk management;simulation;system dynamics	Ying Qian;Yulin Fang;Jose J.

Study participants estimated the risk of harm to victims and the extent of their suffering. They also indicated their own risk and concern for their own safety. The readers’ numeric ability was ascertained thereafter. A trisection of this ability showed that persons of high ability comparatively overestimated others’ risk but underestimated their own; this despite indicating greater concerns for their own safety. These results were not altered by consideration of the readers’ empathic, experiential, and rational traits. The incorporation of personalized cases of victimization in the news report did not appreciably influence risk assessments. The involvement of cases resulting in major bodily injury, however, increased estimates of the incidence of such robberies.		Coy Callison;Rhonda Gibson;Dolf Zillmann	2013	J.

Relationships mature through the mobility (virtual or otherwise) of academics, graduates, and seasoned industry professionals. From an industry perspective, innovation is driven by a need to grow product portfolios, market share and rejuvenate the corporate talent pool. Academics may be more motivated by the search for knowledge, the desire to publish, and the need to move education yardsticks by keeping curriculum relevant and mentoring top students. Research in an industry context ranges from in-house """"labs"""" to a hybrid combination of company acquisitions and -- or university partnerships.

In this paper we introduce three key knowledge services of the APOSDLE system and illustrate how they interact. The context determination daemon observes user interactions and infers the current work task of the user. The user profile service uses the identified work tasks to determine the competences of the user. And finally, the associative retrieval service utilizes both the current work task and the inferred competences to identify relevant (learning) content. All of these knowledge services improve through user feedback.	daemon (computing);flight simulator;interaction;international relations and security network;microsoft outlook for mac;prototype;requirements engineering;simulation;user profile	Stefanie N.

Its immaterial methods of production and distribution are comparable with those behind economic globalization. What occurs when sensibilities are prompted by the particularities of local conditions? Do these ideas fall victim to some of the same forces that critics of globalization bemoan, such as homogenization of culture in the service of a hegemonic aesthetic status quo? Or does the work gain insight from a broad discourse of artistic sensibility? In this panel, several artists present work that grows out of particular aesthetic, political, and conceptual conditions connected to issues of concern in the art world at large.	art world	Alex Dragulescu;Shahrokh Yadegari;Rita Raley;Cristina Venegas	2007		10.1145/1280120.1280274		NLP	-77.00555324007517	-13.907301003389097	14037
b92de305891346584be2f0d196fdbdc8393b52d0	content based approach to find the credibility of user in social networks: an application of cyberbullying		Cyberbullying is derogatory act carried out intentionally by sending or posting harmful material on social networks to cheat or tarnish anybody’s image in real world. Today it has become a significant problem among teenagers and kids as they spend much time on social networking. Two types of cyberbullying have been observed in the messages posted on social network: direct cyberbullying and indirect cyberbullying. Direct cyberbullying is to send disrespectful/abusing material in the form of text, images, videos and audios to harass/torture individual directly. Indirect cyberbullying is to attack or torture individuals indirectly by doing activities like sending objectionable contents such as false rumors, lies etc. concerning them, tagging their embarrassing images, refuse to socialize with the victim. These type of activities can be viewed by large number of audience on social media. Ground breaking research is being carried out only on the identification of cyberbullying and not on its categories such as direct and indirect cyberbullying. As indirect cyberbullying is much harmful than direct cyberbullying due to the messages posted online are visible to large number of users, which may adversely impact the victim’s reputation/position. So, it becomes necessary to find the solution for this problem. In this paper, we first categorize the messages into direct and indirect bullying messages and then proceed to find the solution for controlling the bullying through checking the credibility of user.	apevia;categorization;cyberbullying;dictionary;emoticon;jan dietz;machine learning;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical model;multigraph;social media;social network;socialization;windows rt;year 10,000 problem	Geetika Sarna;M.

By comparing data from a common survey, models are tested through structural equation modelling. We find significant differences and communalities in the factors affecting the present and future use of mobile services in the three countries, related to personal attitudes towards mobile innovation. We conclude that expectations for the future uptake of mobile data services may be formulated not only through a number of common factors (mobile entertainment services, for example, are influenced by entertainment value in all countries), but also by situation-specific ones (for example, mobile information services are influenced by perceived flexibility in Finland and Greece, and by perceived status enhancement in the Netherlands). Such findings have practical consequences for the design and marketing of mobile services in different markets.	structural equation modeling	Harry Bouwman;Christer Carlsson;Francisco J.

This was a study on the perceived enjoyment of different movie genres. In an online experiment, 176 students were randomly divided into two groups (n = 88) and asked to estimate how much they, their closest friends, and young people in general enjoyed either serious or light-hearted movies. These self–other differences in perceived enjoyment of serious or light-hearted movies were also assessed as a function of differing individual motivations underlying entertainment media consumption. The results showed a clear third-person effect for light-hearted movies and a first-person effect for serious movies. The third-person effect for light-hearted movies was moderated by level of hedonic motivation, as participants with high hedonic motivations did not perceive their own and others’ enjoyment of light-hearted films differently. However, eudaimonic motivations did not moderate first-person perceptions in the case of serious films.		Matthias Hofer	2016	J.

At their core these investigations seek to examine strategies for better connecting data, policies, and research communities. Often data and their related practices, policies, and infrastructure lack connection and cohesiveness to support data sharing among various communities. To better understand the current situation these connections will be explored through an assessment of emerging research. It is hoped that this research can be utilized to transform and better connect data practices, policies, and communities of practice.		Joan E. Beaudoin;Deborah H.

However, the inherent subjectivity of such approaches and the apparent lack of a basis to validate or even replicate such research has often been the subject of debate among IS researchers. As a result, many IS researchers tend to fall back on variance-theoretic approaches to conceptualize, design and operationalize their research. In this paper, we show how a grounded approach, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), can be used to qualitatively elicit individual cognitive structures. Further, we show how it can be applied to derive the shared aspects of such a structure across many individuals. We use the well-known technology acceptance model (TAM) to demonstrate the utility of our approach. We conclude the paper by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.	basis (linear algebra);class diagram;ibm tivoli access manager;implicit shape model;mental model;self-replication;theory;verification and validation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Shivraj Kanungo;Vikas Jain	2009			social science;computer science;knowledge management;management science;social psychology;information system;research	SE	-83.8626537796497	-3.127162371757293	14120

This research investigates the impact of inter-subgroup dynamics on knowledge coordination in distributed teams. To address this research question, we extend and apply theory from two primary sources – Transactive Memory Systems (TMS) theory and the faultline model. The paper uses data collected from 22 distributed MBA student teams to provide several novel insights into how perceived faultlines impact team processes (knowledge coordination) and outcomes (team performance and member satisfaction). First, perceived faultlines reduce knowledge coordination, which is an important antecedent of team performance and member satisfaction. Second, knowledge coordination fully mediates the negative effect of perceived faultines on team performance and member satisfaction. Third, low levels of TMS not only impair performance, but also reduce member satisfaction in distributed teams. Implications for research and practice are discussed together with potential avenues for future research.	primary source	Yide Shen;Michael J.

Aim: With the aim of studying the possible impact of knowledge acquired from CS programs on software testing, this paper reports an investigation composed of four experiments. The experiments conducted in Spain, Mexico and Ecuador examine the quality of test cases (TC) generated using black-box and white-box methods. The subjects of the experiments were undergraduate and graduate students who were exposed to different levels of CS knowledge. Method: We pool together the data from the four experiments and apply logistic regression to investigate possible relations of the quality of test cases with students' level of exposure to CS knowledge. Results: The quality of test cases generated by students depend significantly on the amount of CS program studied. The odds of generating test cases that reveal failures against those that do not reveal decrease when students are exposed to a low level of CS knowledge. Conclusions: Software testing plays a key role in what is an increasingly complex process of developing and maintaining software products today. The results of our empirical study provide evidence in favor of greater formal training in software testing as part of CS programs.	black box;cs games;computer science;experiment;failure;logistic regression;software engineering;software testing;test case;white box (software engineering)	Omar S.

In this paper we present our strategy of integrating in a single resource an electronic book with a companion eLearning website. Instead of considering the textbook and the eLearning website as two distinct resources that have to be adopted by the students of the course, here we propose a unified approach that integrates both in a single resource.	book;e-book;printing	Riccardo Mazza	2008		10.1145/1458412.1458414	computer science;e-learning;multimedia;world wide web	AI	-77.13727023776268	-38.00298350314276	14149

The three case sites illustrate differences in collection building approaches, technological infrastructures, and statutory contexts. The findings reveal two basic modes of selection practices—active selection and passive selection, and three selection models based on the loci of selection control—library selection, liaison selection, and creator selection. Also, the findings suggest the power of defining and selecting government publications for state depositories is shifting from government agencies to state libraries in the active selection. The authors argue for the needs to attend to Web publications in non-traditional formats (e.g. an interactive HTML document) and to include common publications produced for lay citizens (e.g. brochures, fact sheets, FAQs, etc.) in the permanent collections in order to fully document the government activities for the historical record of a society.

This paper regards the firm itself as an autopoietic entity. This approach helps identify: the “sensory function” (“interactive openness”) that enables the continual co‐evolution with the environment; and “memory function” (“self‐referentiality”, “organisational closure”) that enables the firm’s effective functioning. The integration of these two functions helps utilise the major knowledge flows and facilitates the firm’s continual learning and renewal in its changing business environment. The analysis of case companies that represent the management consulting industry indicates that very different firms can be described as autopoietic, self‐producing systems. The case firms have built sophisticated, interconnected organisational solutions and information and communication systems to support interactive openness and self‐referentiality.

A self-administered online survey was used to collect data later assessed through partial least squares analysis. The partial least squares-prediction-oriented segmentation methodology evidenced unobserved heterogeneity. Also, the most significant variables within each segment were revealed through an importance-performance map analysis. This general model shows that the current banking usage and satisfaction have a positive impact on customer loyalty. Three different segments were obtained according to banking usage, ease of use and utility variables. Satisfaction turned out critical in all cases. Research was conducted in only one country (Chile). Thus, limited in size but large enough for the PLS analysis. The conclusions and managerial implications provide alternatives and strategies for banking entities so they will need to approach satisfaction measurement and enhancement systems alongside discriminatory variables to increase trust, utility and ease of use in every segment. As of today, customer segmentation in mobile banking was based on a priori partitions. This new approach does not depend on sample distribution, it rather determines unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, this research also evaluates current mobile banking usage.

d2bbdf469bfab8cd521e062b64498e1cabd878d8	television and social networks: an analysis of the influence of live-tweeting in the social audiences		Social networks have transformed the conception of the television audience. In order to adapt to a viewer increasingly active on the Internet, tele‐ visions conducted social media strategies to generate interactivity and attract users to their social profiles. One of them is based on the live-tweeting phenom‐ enon, in which the conversation is encouraged through publications on Twitter during the broadcast of the programme. This research analyses the effectiveness of live-tweeting as a strategy for promoting user traffic on social networks and its impact in the social audience. According to a quantitative methodology, we have selected four Spanish prime time programmes broadcasted during the first half of September 2016. The aim is to study the network of interactions generated around the programme during its broadcast and the degree of influence of the official profiles in each case.	interaction;interactivity;social media;social network;television	Sabela Direito-Rebollal;Diana Lago-Vázquez;Ana Isabel Rodríguez Vázquez	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56541-5_13	public relations;political science;multimedia;advertising;television studies	Web+IR	-82.56386177324853	-16.859918815624525	14226
fa8e611f59546fe601c554dc4170b89c3b076439	towards suicide prevention: early detection of depression on social media		The statistics presented by the World Health Organization inform that 90% of the suicides can be attributed to mental illnesses in high-income countries. Besides, previous studies concluded that people with mental illnesses tend to reveal their mental condition on social media, as a way of relief. Thus, the main objective of this work is the analysis of the messages that a user posts online, sequentially through a time period, and detect as soon as possible if this user is at risk of depression. This paper is a preliminary attempt to minimize measures that penalize the delay in detecting positive cases. Our experiments underline the importance of an exhaustive sentiment analysis and a combination of learning algorithms to detect early symptoms of depression.

It has been validated across several linguistic and cultural contexts. In this study, we investigated the extent of administration method invariance of the AMAS by comparing results (average scores, reliabilities, factorial structure) obtained online with those from paper-and-pencil. We administered the online version of the AMAS to Polish students. Results indicate that psychometric properties of the AMAS do not differ between online and paper-and-pencil administration. Additionally, average scores of the AMAS did not differ considerably between administration forms, contrary to previous results showing that computerized measurement of MA leads to higher scores. Therefore, our results provide evidence for the usefulness of the AMAS as a reliable and valid MA measurement tool for online research and online screening purposes across cultures and also large similarity between administration forms outside an American-English linguistic and cultural context. Finally, we provide percentile and standard norms for the AMAS for adolescents and adults (in the latter case for both online and paper-and-pencil administration) as well as critical differences for the comparison of both subscales in an individual participant for practical diagnostic purposes.

Possession and application of them is an important method for companies to obtain advantage in the fierce market competition. With its great potential economic benefits, commercial secrets have become the target of illegal infringement. However, some enterprises didn¿t have strong awareness of intellectual properties and the preventive measures are therefore inadequate. What¿s more, present laws are limited in the protection of commercial secrets. As a result, commercial secrets, as intangible property, were undermined. To actually protect commercial secrets, it is necessary to complete law protection system and to enhance its legislation. Meanwhile, companies themselves should recognize the importance of commercial secrets, complete preventive measures and establish mutual system to both protect their own commercial secrets and avoid infringing the legitimate rights and interests of the other.	pei-yuan wei;yang	Shao Wei-jie	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.58	commercial law;actuarial science;management;law;intangible property;intellectual property	SE	-71.53226660184737	-7.620823250139704	14251

We describe how different tools were used within the design process, specifically: the ways in which the potential audience members were both included and represented; the prototypes that have been constructed as a way of envisioning how the final work might be experienced; and how these tools have been brought together in ongoing designing and evaluation. We close the paper with some reflections on the extension of participatory commitments into still-emerging areas of technology design that prioritise the design of spaces for human experience and reflective interaction.	amiga reflections;immersion (virtual reality);multi-user;participatory monitoring;software prototyping	Toni Robertson;Tim Mansfield;Lian Loke	2006		10.1145/1147261.1147267	persona;simulation;design process;economics;human–computer interaction;engineering;prototype;multimedia;management	HCI	-63.40039441031987	-38.278514886794525	14257

The Sudan is a country rich in artefacts that go back to the dawn of history: archaeological remains, art, manuscripts that date back to beginning of Islam, books, archival documents, documentary film, hundreds of thousands of hours of video, television and radio, millions of photographs. The National Archives alone hold 76 million photographic negatives. This rich heritage is at risk. At risk from the heat, dust and humidity, from obsolescence of media: the documentary film in the film archive, for instance, can only be accessed on ancient and deteriorating equipment, for which no spare parts for repair can be found. These materials record history and culture of the country that is fast disappearing in the modern world. If these artefacts themselves are lost, so too will be the knowledge of a way of life. Digital Sudan will transform Sudanese intellectual productions to modern electronic and digital media, which will be safer to preserve and easier to retrieve. There are a number of digitization projects being carried out in Sudan, and spurred on to action by the news of the loss of vital parts of the cultural heritage in Timbuktu in Mali with the destruction of libraries, the Ministry of Information, the Sudanese Association for the Archiving of Knowledge (SUDAAK), and museums, libraries, archives throughout the country are collaborating to form the National Cultural Heritage Digitization Team (NCHDT) to raise the level of activity significantly. Working with teams in Durham University and King's College London in the UK, and with other organizations throughout the world, the NCHDT is creating a collaborative infrastructure to integrate resources and facilitate usage.

87429eeda16d0cac16dcce18a571e0ecdaa01615	revealing latent factors of temporal networks for mesoscale intervention in epidemic spread		The customary perspective to reason about epidemic mitigation in temporal networks hinges on the identification of nodes with specific features or network roles. The ensuing individual-based control strategies, however, are difficult to carry out in practice and ignore important correlations between topological and temporal patterns. Here we adopt a mesoscopic perspective and present a principled framework to identify collective features at multiple scales and rank their importance for epidemic spread. We use tensor decomposition techniques to build an additive representation of a temporal network in terms of mesostructures, such as cohesive clusters and temporally-localized mixing patterns. This representation allows to determine the impact of individual mesostructures on epidemic spread and to assess the effect of targeted interventions that remove chosen structures. We illustrate this approach using high-resolution social network data on face-to-face interactions in a school and show that our method affords the design of effective mesoscale interventions.	image resolution;interaction;latent variable;mesoscopic physics;mixing patterns;social network;temporal logic;utility functions on indivisible goods	Laetitia Gauvin;André Panisson;Alain Barrat;Ciro Cattuto	2015	CoRR		simulation;nanotechnology	Web+IR	-88.96239361508374	-19.51293819937793	14329

93eb1eb931fa4b3cb80bfd960a111836844d399f	a case study of mobile technology-enabled english language learning: the amazon kindle e-reader initiative in palestine		The proliferation of increasingly interactive e-reader devices such as the Amazon Kindle represents an opportunity to explore their evolving pedagogical value. This study aims to investigate how use of the Kindle can enhance individuals’ English language learning—more specifically their attitudes, reading comprehension, vocabulary development and pronunciation performance—in the context of informal and lifelong learning in Palestine, and to explore the further potential of scaling up the use of e-readers at a national level. At the piloting stage of this initiative, the study operated at two levels (micro and meso) of the M3 evaluation framework. Mixed methods were used: qualitative data were obtained through a case study of the practices and perceptions of two teachers in two classrooms in the Qalqilia center and quantitative data were collected through a survey of 114 learners. The study shows that the Kindle’s technological affordances are effective in creating a flexible, authentic and interactive environment for English language learning, provided that teachers change their teaching methods to take full advantage of the features of mobile technologies to create innovative learning approaches aligned with the needs of the e-generation. It was also found that despite some concerns with the usability issue, attitudes towards learning English changed positively and learners’ vocabulary and pronunciation improved.	amazon kindle;e-reader	Khitam Yousuf Shraim	2014	iJIM		multimedia;world wide web	NLP	-71.93329371605708	-38.94755570310103	14351

Compared to lecture, PI has been shown to decrease fail rates, increase final exam grades, and increase engagement and enjoyment. In PI, students work together to exchange perspectives and use clickers to answer challenging conceptual questions in the presence of a knowledgeable instructor.  In our efforts to mentor potential PI adopters, we note difficulties bootstrapping PI uptake at new institutions and new departments. In this workshop, our main goal is to support potential adopters in the process of shifting from lectures to PI. In recent months, we have contributed materials for many freely-available PI courses, and led a successful 3-day NSF-funded PI workshop. We will work with participants and their existing lecture-based resources to begin considering the ways that PI might be effective in new contexts.  Instructors interested in increasing engagement in any CS course may attend. Participants are encouraged to bring current lecture materials.

Design/methodology/approach – A commercial search engine was harnessed to deliver hyperlink data via its automatic query submission interface. A special purpose link analysis tool, LexiURL, then summarised and graphed the link data in appropriate ways. Findings – Webometrics can provide a wide range of descriptive information about the international connectivity of research groups. Research limitations/implications – Only one field was analysed, data was taken from only one search engine, and the results were not validated. Practical implications – Web connectivity seems to be particularly important for attracting overseas job applicants and to promote research achievements and capabilities, and hence we contend that it can be useful for national and international governments to use webometrics to ensure that the web is being used effectively by research groups. Originality/value – This is the first paper to make a case for the value of using a range of webometric techniques to evaluate the web presences of research groups within a field, and possibly the first “applied” webometrics study produced for an external contract.	bibliometrics;email;hyperlink;journal of the association for information science and technology;link analysis;nl (complexity);online and offline;portable document format;web performance;web search engine;webometrics;world wide web	Mike Thelwall;Xuemei Li;Franz Barjak;Simon Robinson	2008	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012530810847344	scientific method;link analysis;webometrics;design methods;telecommunications;computer science;linked data;data mining;hyperlink;sociology;management;operations research;world wide web;search engine	Web+IR	-75.71787304292685	-21.165376735011332	14390

It proposes an analysis framework of 18 core attributes, divided into the areas of bibliographic information, activity metrics, economics, accessibility, and predatory issues. The framework has been employed in a systematic analysis of 30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information systems (IS), which were selected from among 386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of OA Journals. An analysis was performed on the sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS. The journals were then compared between-group, according to the presence of article processing charges. A within-group analysis was performed on the journals requesting article processing charges from authors, in order to understand what is the value added according to different price ranges. This article offers several contributions. It presents an overview of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born from the observation of data and the existing literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS while offering a first analysis. Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper highlights several concerns still threatening the adoption of OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS. Among them, it is shown that high article processing charges are not sufficiently justified by the publishers, which often lack transparency and may prevent authors from adopting OA.	accessibility;computer science;information system;software engineering	Daniel Graziotin;Xiaofeng Wang;Pekka Abrahamsson	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1278-7	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information system	SE	-74.45415465006636	-16.120650963492245	14394

Another way to guide the use of these systems is to embed some facilitation mechanisms into the GSS itself (i.e., automated facilitation). Using the Adaptive Structuration Theory, this study investigated the tradeoffs associated with human facilitation and automated facilitation. Groups using a multicriteria decision model in the context of a resource allocation task were exposed to one of two experimental conditions: (1) human facilitation, or (2) automated facilitation. Results indicated that automated facilitation, embedded in the GSS, was as effective as human facilitation in enhancing the faithfulness of appropriation of the technology.	embedded system	Moez Limayem	2006	DATA BASE	10.1145/1161345.1161363	decision model;facilitation;resource allocation;knowledge management;management;social psychology	SE	-69.32290618422249	-47.416418403137634	14407

MIS training is a principal component of the education of new surgical residents, with an increasing demand for knowledge and skills for medical students and surgeons. Technology enhanced learning (TEL) solutions can deal with the growing need for MIS learning. This research work aims to develop a MIS learning environment based on web technologies, named TELMA, which will respond to the growing amount of information and multimedia surgical contents available (mainly intervention’s video recording libraries), in compliance with specific learning needs of surgical students and professionals, enhancing their competence on MIS cognitive skills. Furthermore, TELMA will support knowledge capturing, sharing and reuse, and effective management of didactic contents through personalised and collaborative services.	minimally invasive education	Patricia Sánchez-González;Ignacio Oropesa;V.

The paper attempts to investigate governance issues and the need for new strategic paths emerging as a result of changed scenarios. Specifically, the greater number of stakeholders involved in academic activities requires universities to take into account a variety of social, economic and cultural factors when making strategic decisions. Adjustments in board composition through appointing non-academic members are signals of such trends. Moving from this consideration and relying on data on the governance structures of Italian universities, the paper discusses challenges for academic institutions in terms of change in their strategic management and governance structures as well as the likely directions such change is taking.

The research is being framed in terms of the 1998 document model, Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), in which different levels, or aspects, of content have been identified. FRBR is being incorporated into international library cataloging standards, however, research is only now beginning to be conducted to test the applicability of the model to people who are actually searching for documents. The study has two purposes: first, to improve information systems, particularly online catalogs, using specific knowledge of the range of acceptable items that may be the object of a search, and second, to determine the extent to which the FRBR model is useful in describing entities of interest to library users.	functional requirements for bibliographic records	Allyson Carlyle;Samantha R.

Often these are elective courses, limiting the material to the subset of students choosing to take the course. Recently there has been movement to distribute topics across the curriculum in order to ensure that all graduates have been exposed to concepts such as parallel computing. Previous work described an attempt to systematically weave a tapestry of topics into the undergraduate computing curriculum. This paper reviews that work and expands it with representative examples of assignments, demonstrations, and results as well as describing how the tools and examples deployed for these classes have a residual effect on classes such as Comptuer Literacy.

In typical tutorial systems the interaction and the sequence of presentation as well as the mode of evaluation are predetermined and follow a somewhat linear sequence. This model was implemented in many of the early computer based trainings, computer assisted instruction systems and tutorial drill programs. However, by introducing artificial intelligence in the inference engine or by enhancing the expert system component (by means of including feedback), by improving the evaluation of the learners responses and facilitating interaction between these components one may provide a learning environment that more closely resembles a real teacher and student interaction. This approach is known as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Various tutorial systems were developed based on this paradigm that proved useful in knowledge domain areas that are highly structured and relatively small (e.g. solving math problems or balancing chemical equations). The difficulty resides in the complexity involved in making the various components encompassing and complete in a knowledge area. For instance, understanding why learners commit a particular error and then assisting them is highly challenging since the cause of an error might be different for every learner. Variations on this ITS model have been employed with success in developing tutoring systems in less structured knowledge domains and more generic environments.	artificial intelligence;expert system;inference engine;knowledge base;programming paradigm;user interface;widget (gui)	Namdar Mogharreban	2004	JITE		knowledge base;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;knowledge-based systems;machine learning;procedural knowledge;fuzzy set;user interface;world wide web;expert system;domain knowledge	AI	-77.53701880755297	-46.71724001669027	14514

Reference standards based on journal classification schemes are fraught with problems in the case of multidisciplinary and general journals and are limited with respect to their resolution of fields. To overcome these shortcomings of journal classification schemes, we propose a new reference standard for chemistry and related fields that is based on the sections of the Chemical Abstracts database. We determined the values of the reference standard for research articles published in 2000 in the biochemistry sections of Chemical Abstracts as an example. The results show that citation habits vary extensively not only between fields but also within fields. Overall, the sections of Chemical Abstracts seem to be a promising basis for reference standards in chemistry and related fields for four reasons: (1) The wider coverage of the pertinent literature, (2) the quality of indexing, (3) the assignment of papers published in multidisciplinary and general journals to their respective fields, and (4) the resolution of fields on a lower level (e.g. mammalian biochemistry) than in journal classification schemes (e.g. biochemistry & molecular biology).

In this paper we postulate that more direct questions may measure motivation better, and they may also be better correlated with learning. In an eight week study with ESL students learning vocabulary in the REAP reading tutor, we administered two types of selfassessment questions and recorded indirect measures of motivation to see which factors correlated well with learning. Our results showed that some user actions, such as dictionary look up frequency and number of times a word is listened to, correlate well with self-assesment motivation questions as well as with how well a student performs on the task. We also found that using more direct selfassesment questions, as opposed to general ones, was more effective in predicting how well a student is learning.	cognitive tutor;dictionary;eli;ibm notes;interaction;tamar schlick;thrust;vocabulary	Kevin Dela Rosa;Maxine Eskénazi	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21869-9_39	cognitive psychology;social psychology;pedagogy	NLP	-73.72842144437215	-44.585962484188244	14526

Little understanding is available in either service recovery literature or ecommerce literature. In the online environment, a vendor’s response to customer complaints is often posted on a website and examined broadly by consumers including complainants and potential consumers. This is different from the offline environment whereby of the explanation is only received by complainants. Therefore effectively response to online negative reviews is a critical business activity that is oriented towards consumers in a larger scope than it would be in the offline environment. We intend to investigate how an online vendor’s response influences consumers’ trust beliefs toward the vendor. Justice theory and Toulmin’s model of argumentation are applied to analyze the meditating variables between vendor explanation and consumer trust. Three constructs, i.e., apology provision, explanation adequacy and responder information disclosure, are proposed to be the mediating variables. For practitioners, they also serve as guidance to construct response content.	e-commerce;mediation (statistics);online and offline	Jing Elaine Chen;Peiying Huang;Yunjie Calvin Xu	2010			e-commerce;public relations;computer science;marketing;user-generated content;management;world wide web;commerce	AI	-89.18457310528177	-12.389717845778579	14605

This model can definitely reduce the transition time and the presentation burden switching among a variety of learning activities to achieve a seamless learning. The TAM statistical analysis method is then exploited in the assessment for ease of use and usefulness for the proposed model. Finally, the experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model could readily support highly interactive learning activities for the flipped learning and have high acceptance of intent of use and usage behavior.	interactivity	Cheng-Yu Tsai;Chih-Tsan Chang;Jenq-Muh Hsu;Hung-Hsu Tsai;Zhi-Cheng Dai;Pao-Ta Yu	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20621-9_14	computer science;multimedia;usability;flipped classroom;interactive learning	NLP	-69.13576994642003	-42.561085862520905	14608

In the emerging society other student competencies are required. Students will only be able to develop these competencies in a changed educational setting in which information technology plays an important role. What is the current situation in secondary education with respect to information technology? What is currently possible? In which direction will developments take secondary education? How will teachers be prepared? For answering these questions there is a basis of accumulated experience in IFIP Working Group 3.1 on Secondary Education. On this basis the WCCE95 Professional Groups, sponsored by Working Group 3.1, will provide a forward look.	computer;ifip working group 2.1;international federation for information processing	Tom J. van Weert	1995		10.1007/978-0-387-34844-5_1	mathematics education;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management	Vision	-75.50239427249646	-28.96003225182574	14646

There are two broad types of learning outcomes: facts, rules and action sequences (on lower levels of complexity in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains), and concepts, patterns and abstractions (on higher level of complexity in the above named domains). Facts, rules and action sequences are taught using instructional strategies of direct instruction. Concepts, patterns and abstractions are taught using strategies of indirect instruction. Strategies of both types of learning may be combined, providing a menu of teaching strategies that help students solve problems, think critically and work cooperatively. This article presents teaching strategies suitable for direct and indirect instruction used in teaching engineering.

This is the largest civil IT programme worldwide at an estimated technical cost of d6.2 billion over a 10-year period. An institutional analysis of our historical and empirical data from six NHS organisations identifies growing fragmentation in the organisational field of healthcare, as past and present institutional logics both fuel and inhibit changes in the governance systems and working practices of healthcare practitioners. This is further complicated by new institutional logics that place the citizen at centre stage of the NPfIT, in a move to promote patient choice and public value.

One of the points of criticism is the interaction between two elements of article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the widely discussed issue of being able to benefit from scientific progress and the less argued for position of having a right to take part in scientific enterprises. To shine light on the question if we should balance the two elements or prioritize one of them, an exploration will be offered on how benefiting from scientific progress and the ability to participate in the advancement of science relate to securing human capabilities. A different perspective to the question will be gained by identifying the problem as an issue of misrecognition, especially the failure to recognize many willing collaboration partners in scientific research as peers. Lastly, I will argue that cooperative justice requires that if we have an innovation incentive system that disproportionally benefits one particular group, a certain duty to counterbalance this advantage exists when we are relying on mutual cooperation for the recognition of intellectual property rights.	counterbalance device component;gain;intellectual disability;intellectual property;benefit	Cristian Timmermann	2014	Science and engineering ethics	10.1007/s11948-013-9438-3	psychology;public relations;economics;engineering;socioeconomics;sociology;management;law	AI	-75.69134400769924	-12.004203982546958	14688

It brings the unceasing expansion of the interactive data, information, knowledge, and services. The frontier information science is expected to imitate the heuristic intelligence, including human cognition (e.g. attention, emotion, and wisdom) and natural attributes (e.g., dynamics, and self-adaptability), to promote the evolution of the information techniques. Accordingly, Cybermatics (i.e., cyberscienceand technology) emerges as an interdisciplinary involving three main aspects: the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber, physical and social computing, and green computing and communications.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;cognition;cyberspace;entity;heuristic;information science;internet of things;social computing	Huangsheng Ning;Jianhua Ma;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Weifeng Lü;Xindong Wu;Victor C.

A conceptual framework was developed and empirically tested based on data collected from 278 SNS users in China. The results demonstrate that social presence is positively related to sense of belonging and enjoyment. Sense of belonging has a positive effect on enjoyment, including escapism, pleasure and arousal, but has no effect on SNS addiction. Escapism and pleasure can result in SNS addiction, but arousal has no significant influence. Drawing on a new perspective of belongingness theory, this study makes theoretical contributions related to social presence and SNS addiction, and the findings have managerial implications for SNS providers and users.	social presence theory	Wei Gao;Zhaopeng Liu;Jingyuan Li	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.002	pleasure;social psychology;psychology;conceptual framework;addiction;escapism;belongingness;arousal;social network	ECom	-88.04559797868	-14.533556572100196	14746

Recently, new bibliometric indices and databases have been established, which may change the visibility of disciplines, institutions and individuals. This study examines the effects of the new indices on the visibility of Medical Informatics.   METHODS By objective criteria, three sets of journals are chosen, two representing Medical Informatics and a third addressing Internal Medicine as a benchmark. The availability of index data (index coverage) and the aggregate scores of these corpora are compared for journal-related (Journal impact factor, Eigenfactor metrics, SCImago journal rank) and author-related indices (Hirsch-index, Egghes G-index). Correlation analysis compares the dependence of author-related indices.   RESULTS The bibliometric visibility depended on the research focus and the citation database: Scopus covers more journals relevant for Medical Informatics than ISI/Thomson Reuters. Journals focused on Medical Informatics' methodology were negatively affected by the Eigenfactor metrics, while the visibility profited from an interdisciplinary research focus. The correlation between Hirsch-indices computed on citation databases and the Internet was strong.   CONCLUSIONS The visibility of smaller technology-oriented disciplines like Medical Informatics is changed by the new bibliometric indices and databases possibly leading to suitably changed publication strategies. Freely accessible author-related indices enable an easy and adequate individual assessment.	aggregate data;benchmark (computing);bibliometrics;citation index;databases;informatics (discipline);information sciences institute;internal carotid artery structure;internet;journal citation reports;medical informatics;published database;scientific literature;scopus;small;text corpus	Cord Spreckelsen;Thomas Martin Deserno;Klaus Spitzer	2011		10.1186/1472-6947-11-24	health informatics;the internet;medicine;bibliometrics;computer science;data science;nursing;data mining;information retrieval;profitability index;affect	ML	-77.42814108794751	-22.080634207106794	14758

Forty five students in the experimental group received the Blended Learning model, while 45 students in the control group received the traditional grammar translation method. The effectiveness is quantitatively assessed by Kirkpatrick's evaluation model from four aspects of reaction, learning, behaviour and skills. SPSS17.0 is used to analyse the collected data. In-depth interview is also used to confirm the results of quantitative analysis.

Developed under the auspices of the Institute for Advanced Technologies in the Humanities (IATH), the major sections of the project include a visual archive of approximately three hundred images; the TEI-tagged Italian text of the Inferno, presented through Dynaweb; and a text visualization, a VRML model of the Inferno. This paper describes the visual material found on the project, explains the tagging criteria employed in the markup of the poem, and clarifies the type of research that the project makes possible. The project went online in December 1997. Readers have often been struck by the clarity, variety, and complexity of Dante's comparisons. T. S. Eliot considered Dante unequalled in his ability to form 'clear visual images' (Eliot, Dante, Faber & Faber, London, 1929, p. 22). In his essay, 'A Reading of the Inferno', Eliot singles out for praise the remarkable quality of Dante's 'visual imagination', citing as an example the comparison of a group of men who gaze at Dante and Virgil in the dark to an old tailor peering at the eye of his needle (Inf. 15.21). Eliot's remarks concerning the remarkable nature of Dante's similes arise in the midst of a discussion of the poetics of the Inferno. Hell is the most material of the three realms of the Afterlife. Dante mentions about one hundred places in the Inferno, sixty in the Purgatorio, and twenty in the Paradiso. Dante's Hell is made up of precipitous slopes, barren forests, thunderous waterfalls, bloody rivers, and burning sands. To convey the savage nature of these places, Dante often evokes the landscape of his own Italy. Yet the multitude of natural, architectural, and geographical allusions that constitute Dante's material world are unfamiliar to most readers. One of the principal objectives of The World of Dante is to make Dante's universe more accessible to students of the poem.	archive;hypermedia;inferno	Deborah Parker	2001	LLC	10.1093/llc/16.3.287	philosophy;document structure description;sociology	Crypto	-71.9093102505903	-21.908889421174802	14815

London/New York: Bloomsbury, 2014. xxii + 232 pp. ISBN 978-14-411-6112-3. $42.95 (paperback).#N##N#The Web as Corpus: Theory and Practice is a timely and thorough introduction to the promising field of ‘Web as Corpus’ (hereafter WaC) at a time when exponentially cumulating online language use has, to a great extent, become the default mode of personal and professional communication. The increasing production of huge amounts of linguistic data on the Web has also become powerful resources in linguistic and social research. It is without exaggeration to say that WaC is coming of age. Although several dedicated monographs have been published on this subject, the book stands out by putting both theoretical considerations and technical and analytical aspects at the center in the account of using the Web as corpus. In the book, the Web is understood as ‘a corpus surrogate’, ‘a corpus shop’, and ‘the mega-corpus/mini-Web’ simultaneously as identified by Bernardini et al. (2006). The author, adopting a non-technical style of writing, bears in mind the intended readership of corpus linguists, students and researchers in humanities, and students in programs of EFL, ESP, or Translation Studies. The seven chapters address such crucial issues as Web corpus creation, Web corpus concordancing, and lexical and cultural analyses. The same chapter structure is shared and each chapter is complemented with carefully chosen and designed study questions and activities as well as extended reading materials, making the book a strong candidate for a corpus linguistics textbook. Overall, the book has presented both the ‘theoretical implications’ and the ‘different methods’ of WaC by concentrating on the Web’s ‘inexhaustible’ language resources and their interaction with established standards in corpus linguistics.#N##N#The first two chapters deal with the relevant concepts and theories in pre-WaC corpus linguistics and the emerging WaC field. To contextualize WaC in the realm of corpus linguistics, Chapter 1 encapsulates corpus linguistics as both a theory … #N##N#  liangpingwu{at}bfsu.edu.cn	world wide web	Liangping Wu	2015	DSH	10.1093/llc/fqv020	humanities;natural language processing;computer science;corpus linguistics;text corpus;linguistics	NLP	-71.33717965362086	-25.577601685112416	14871

This study provides evidence concerning the internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the Deep, Strategic and Surface scale scores when used to sort students’ responses. Participants consisted of 446 resident university students (230 males, 216 females) in agricultural science courses with face-to-face instruction supplemented with web-based lessons. Cronbach’s alphas for the three scales ranged from 0.65 to 0.75. The data file was submitted to a maximum likelihood factor analysis with oblimin rotation. When three factors were extracted, all 18 items loaded on the expected factors. One example of an analysis based on ASSIST scale scores is presented to show the potential of this procedure for helping with the interpretation of student comments.	factor analysis;library;reliability engineering;web application	Carol A.

By integrating the research streams of technology adoption, diffusion of innovations and continuance theory of information systems, technology factors, channel factors, social factors and value-for-money factors were hypothesised to exert an impact on consumers’ post-adoption behaviour towards Internet banking. Data were gathered from 372 Internet banking users through a cross-sectional mall intercept survey. The data were analysed using Partial Least Squares path modelling. The results show that technology factors, channel factors and value-for-money factors partially influence consumers’ post-adoption behaviour towards Internet banking. Social factors were found to be non-significant. The practical implications for retail bank managers in formulating effective service delivery channel management strategies were outlined.

The prototype development aims to exploit the use of service-oriented concepts for achieving healthcare interoperability while it also attempts to move towards a virtual patient record paradigm. The proposed evaluation strategy investigates the adaptation of the DeLone and McLean model of information systems success with respect to service-oriented implementations. Specific service-oriented and virtual patient record characteristics were empirically encapsulated in the DeLone and McLean model and respective evaluation measures were produced. The proposed theoretical framework was utilized for conducting an empirical study amongst sixty two participants in order to observe their perceptions with respect to the hypothetical adoption of the prototype framework. The data gathered was analyzed using partial least squares. The generated results highlighted the importance of information quality whereas system quality did not prove to be a strong significant predictor in the overall model.	acclimatization;angela mclean (biologist);behavior;information systems;information quality;information system;interoperability;kerrison predictor;medical records;partial least squares regression;programming paradigm;prototype;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure	Stylianos Daskalakis;John Mantas	2008	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-58603-864-9-285	simulation;computer science;data mining;database	Web+IR	-85.27357738046383	-2.6182451947088654	14950

In a between-subjects design, 73 learners worked with an agent representing one of the following three agent roles while learning about instructional planning: Motivator, Expert, or Mentor (designed to incorporate both motivation and expertise). The roles were evaluated according to three contrast comparisons, comparing the value of the agents with and without motivation, the value of the agents with and without expertise, and the overall value of the Mentor agent (which combined motivation and expertise). Results indicated that the motivational agents (Motivator & Mentor) were significantly more engaging, human-like and facilitative of learning than the Expert agent, yet were also less credible. The agents with expertise (Expert & Mentor) were significantly more credible, and led to better performance on the transfer measure than the Motivator agent, yet were also less supportive and less human-like. Overall, the Mentor was perceived as significantly more engaging and facilitative of learning than the other two agents, and also led to significantly better transfer performance.	agent-based model;experiment;mimic;pedagogical agent	Amy L.

The quality of an entry sheet can heavily influence a company's selection. While books and other resources for job seekers are more widespread these days, it can still be difficult for students to understand the contents and put them into practice. We believe self-reflection can play an important role in addressing these difficulties. This paper analyzed the efficacy of a reflection support system by conducting two user studies. Our findings indicate that the manner by which reference information is presented at the rewriting stage influences a participant's understanding of the information. We also found that the likelihood of reflection is improved when tips for successful ES writing are categorized and are provided step-by-step.	book;categorization;rewriting;self-reflection	Mitsunori Matsushita;Nanae Shirozu	2013	2013 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence	10.1109/TAAI.2013.64	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia;job analysis	HCI	-66.97839160204508	-47.93097249098927	14989

In general the scientists were disposed favourably towards the overlay journal model. However, they raised several implementation issues that they would consider important, primarily relating to the quality of the editorial board and of the published papers, the speed and quality of the peer review process, and the long-term archiving of the accepted research material. The traditional copy-editing function remains important to researchers in these disciplines, as is the visibility of research in indexing services.

The students published web content, originally in form of blog articles, and they received feedback in form of peer reviews from their colleagues. In the previous run of the course, this method helped us to improve the learning outcomes, however the students did not perceive the publishing/reviewing activity very well; they felt it is too much work and they are forced to do it. In the last two runs of the course we tried to cope with this problem by replacing blog development by more free web design-related assignments the topic of which the students were allowed to choose. They could come up with their own project. The students worked in teams, and peer reviews did not focus entirely on web content, but also on more technical aspects of the task like layout design, and on the team work inside the teams. The learning outcomes were approximately the same, however the students’ perception of the usefulness of the publishing/reviewing activities was much improved, as much as their overall satisfaction with the course.	web design	Zuzana Kubincová;Martin Homola;Veronika Dropcová	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52836-6_66	peer review;knowledge management;technical peer review;teamwork;publishing;web design;web content;page layout;computer science	NLP	-77.32073254719276	-38.14828496637832	15026

In particular, educators are increasingly using computer-based games as learning environments with a focus on education over entertainment. The emerging phenomenon of serious gaming requires new approaches to serve the growing number of people using them and to better understand their effectiveness, impact, and the challenges they pose. Serious games offer fertile ground for studying the interactions among people, technology, and information (the core components in information science). In this paper, we describe an approach for integrating an existing forensic science game into a virtual world for adolescents known as Whyville. We explain the rationale in our approach, the infrastructure involved in embedding a game in a virtual world, the challenges we faced, and the lessons learned. A total of 2,206 people played the game throughout the 35 days it was available. The results of the players' survey responses and comments on how they explored this information space are analyzed. Our approach offers an interesting glimpse of how people between the ages of 11 and 18 explore a science game hosted within a virtual world.	design rationale;information science;interaction;pose (computer vision);virtual world;whyville	Carlos Monroy;Yvonne Klisch;Leslie M.

There is no published evidence that either these features or principles have been empirically tested for their suitability from the users' perspective. This paper reports on an empirical study which aimed to assess the usability of a set of on-line help features and principles, in the context of users performing real application tasks. The results reveal that the more general principles associated with understandability are considered the most relevant, and that while users may complain about the design of existing on-line help features, they tend to value them more than features with which they are unfamiliar. A follow-up study showed that only minor changes need to be made to the existing defacto standard for users' concerns to be addressed, without sacrificing the advantages of familiarity. The study addresses questions of context sensitivity, obtrusiveness and the importance of definitions, and highlights the usefulness of questioning emerging defacto standards that have not been based on empirical studies.	online and offline	Helen C.

Existing social influence research primarily focuses on friendship networks among people. We propose a general approach to measure social influence in a type of objective entity, specifically in company networks. To construct the company influence network, we mine network links (company relationships) from the news and obtain node attributes (company influence) from search indices. Using the company influence network, two social influence measures are explored: the number of peers and weighted peer effects. To address time-series data, all variables are integrated into a vector autoregression model to forecast the company’s financial performance in terms of stock return and risk. The results of our simulation and robust testing suggest that our social influence measures have the power to predict firm financial performance. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

c95a3bf8ae6bcb31d4faa569323d8d647e79e92c	jamia looks to the future amidst profound changes in the world of publishing		Rapid technological change has affected many aspects of our society, but perhaps none more profoundly than the world of publishing. Scientific journals largely have moved to primary publication online. Clinicians and researchers first learn of, and then read articles on the Internet— and print them locally when required. Thus, as all publishers, whether commercial or non-profit, have attempted to address online communities, they have had to reconsider their business models and track new opportunities. The end of the current five-year Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) publisher ’s contract in 2009 afforded the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) the opportunity to reconsider seriously its plans for the future of the journal. Thus, in May 2008, following an invited presentation by the Editor-in-Chief regarding the current status, perceived opportunities, and important decisions to be made for JAMIA, the AMIA Board of Directors began work on the renewal of the publishing contract for its flagship journal. The AMIA Board charged a task force comprising representatives from the Board of Directors, the AMIA Publications Committee, AMIA Staff, the JAMIA Editor, and a seasoned scholarly publishing consultant to assess future publishing options and to then issue a request for proposals. The task force convened frequently (electronically) during the first few months of its work, to examine the overarching principles of the process, to study the current publishing model, and to explore alternative approaches to publishing the association’s scholarly journal. As their first order of business, the task force conducted a survey of all AMIA members to solicit comments on a variety of possible approaches. The survey asked members to indicate their personal preferences for five different publishing models, which included combinations of various options of print, online, and open-access versions of JAMIA. The survey results indicated that AMIA members’ most favored (70%) overall model was the combined availability of print and online JAMIA versions. The ‘open-access only ’ model was rated least desirable, due to the high per-article publication costs that all authors would have to pay. In the autumn of 2008, the task force developed a request for proposals (RFP), heavily influenced by an analysis of the data from the member survey. The RFP was released in December 2008 and sent to 11 publishers. Five bidders submitted proposals in early 2009. The task force analyzed the proposals, taking into account those solutions that would advance JAMIA’s leadership position in the field of biomedical informatics, and those that would implement best practices and best evolving technologies. The task force ranked proposals based on criteria covering vision, innovation, quality, cost, marketing, and support. It considered the ability of the publisher to provide extraordinary service to authors and to the Editorial Office, to deliver an exceptional product, and to assure diversification of publication revenues. Three publishers were ultimately selected as finalists to make presentations to the task force in early May 2009 in Bethesda,MD. In a series of sessions held on the same day, the three finalists presented overviews of their proposals and entertained clarifying questions from Publisher Selection Task Force members. Immediately after the candidate publishers’ presentations, the task force met to select which publisher it would recommend to the AMIA Board of Directors as the next publisher of JAMIA. In order to make the best selection, the task force focused on 14 evaluation criteria (as developed by Morna Conway, AMIA’s consultant) and the weighting that each would carry. The task force members each assigned scores to each candidate publisher based on the evaluation criteria, and considering the written proposals, the oral presentations, and the responses to task force member questions, and intangible aspects. In the end, the task force voted unanimously to recommend the BMJ Group as the next JAMIA publisher. All task force members agreed that while there was higher risk for this strategy, due to the distance of London from the USA and various other factors, there was also the potential for a much higher reward for JAMIA both in recognition and impact (eg, close association with a highly regarded and widely circulated clinical journal), and in the potential for significantly enhanced financial returns to AMIA. The BMJ Group has been at the leading edge of innovation in electronic publishing and in promoting evidence-based medicine in the clinical arena. After receiving the final report and recommendation from the task force, the AMIA Board of Directors voted to invite the BMJ Group to serve as the next publisher of JAMIA, beginning with the January 2010 issue. The BMJ Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Medical Association. It is based in BMA House on Tavistock Square in London. They have over 310 staff worldwide with 20 staff in the USA, including six physicians. They publish the British Medical Journal (BMJ) plus 30 specialty journals, for which the BMJ Group has 10 editorsin-chief based in North America. The AMIA Board decided that the BMJ Group would be more likely to extend JAMIA’s (and AMIA’s) brand, prestige, and impact through its high-profile presence and innovative publishing practices, as well as its market strength in the healthcare arena. The Board believed that JAMIA would thrive intellectually, enhance its electronic publishing functionality, and increase its relevance under the BMJ Group. The reviewers found several key points attractive in the BMJ Group’s proposal, including: guaranteed income to AMIA for 2009 and beyond (with the potential for significant increases), direct association with the BMJ brand, change of access policies to maximize revenues, development of new revenue streams, transition costs covered by BMJ Group, plans to introduce a range of dynamic interactive features, and the opportunity to interact and share best practices with other international journal editors. The BMJ Group proposed a major focus on the journal’s revenue growth, including enhanced direct AMIA, Bethesda, Maryland, USA University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA	best practice;block-matching algorithm;conway's game of life;diversification (finance);intellect;interactivity;journal of the american medical informatics association;molecular dynamics;online community;relevance;request for proposal	Edward H.

2f7d652f40535896f67246467c6720b74844c977	on the study of social interactions in twitter	micro blogs;social network analysis;dynamic networks	Twitter and other social media platforms are increasingly used as the primary way in which people speak with each other. As opposed to other platforms, Twitter is interesting in that many of these dialogues are public and so we can get a view into the dynamics of dialogues and how they differ from other other tweet behaviors. We here analyze tweets gathered from 2400 twitter streams over a one month period. We study social interactions in three important dimensions: what are the salient user behaviors in terms of how often they have social interactions and how these interactions are spread among different people; what are the characteristics of the dialogues, or sets of tweets, that we can extract from these interactions, and what are the characteristics of the social network which emerges from considering these interactions? We find that roughly half of the users spend a fair amount of time interacting whereas 40% of users do not seem to have active interactions. We also find that the vast majority of active dialogues only involve two people despite the public nature of these tweets. We finally find that while the emerging social network does contain a giant component, the component clearly is a set of well-defined tight clusters which are loosely connected.	giant component;interaction;social media;social network	Sofus A.

Traditionally, school science education has followed deductive and inductive forms of inquiry investigation, while the abductive form of inquiry has previously been sparsely explored in the literature related to computers and education. We have therefore designed a mobile learning application ‘ThinknLearn’, which assists high school students in generating hypotheses during abductive inquiry investigations. The M3 evaluation framework was used to investigate the effectiveness of using ‘ThinknLearn’ to facilitate student learning. The results indicated in this paper showed improvements in the experimental group’s learning performance as compared to a control group in pre-post tests. In addition, the experimental group also maintained this advantage during retention tests as well as developing positive attitudes toward mobile learning. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper illustrates the merits of an alternative approach to giving support for constructionist learning, based on the principles of empirical modelling (EM), with reference to an algorithm from database theory. Effective model-building for constructionist learning has to support activities relating to three roles: that of student, teacher and developer. This paper aims to show that EM brings far greater conceptual unity to interactions in these roles than is typically found in conventional approaches to educational software development.	algorithm;database theory;interaction;programming paradigm;relational database;software development	Meurig Beynon;Antony Harfield	2005	Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT'05)	10.1109/ICALT.2005.134	relational database;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;database;empirical modelling	SE	-84.09834246909934	-35.48660482707251	15142

This paper aims to compare folksonomy, a new social classification system currently being developed on the web, with conventional taxonomy in the light of theoretical sociological and anthropological approaches. The co-existence of these two types of classification system raises the questions: Will and should taxonomies be hybridized with folksonomies? What can each of these systems contribute to information-searching processes, and how can the sociology of knowledge provide an answer to these questions? This paper aims also to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is situated at the meeting point of the sociology of knowledge, epistemology and information science and aims at examining systems of classification in the light of both classical theory and current late-modern sociological and anthropological approaches. Findings – Using theoretical approaches current in the sociology of science and knowledge, the paper envisages two divergent possible outcomes. Originality/value – While concentrating on classifications systems, this paper addresses the more general social issue of what we know and how it is known. The concept of hybrid knowledge is suggested in order to illuminate the epistemological basis of late-modern knowledge being constructed by hybridizing contradictory modern knowledge categories, such as the subjective with the objective and the social with the natural. Integrating tree-like taxonomies with folksonomies or, in other words, generating a naturalized structural order of objective relations with social, subjective classification systems, can create a vast range of hybrid knowledge.	folksonomy;information science;situated;taxonomy (general)	Yael Keshet	2011	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220411111105489	library science;medical sociology;social epistemology;social science;design methods;epistemology;biological classification;knowledge management;social issues;management science;sociology;sociology of scientific knowledge;sociology of knowledge;mathematical sociology;library classification	AI	-73.70360005965442	-17.8701091050551	15149

Students' interests and motivation to pursue a career in CS related fields are highly influenced by school. Also beliefs in the nature of CS are influenced, and necessary foundations in knowledge and skills are built. However, a major problem is the gap between information and communication technologies (ICT) and computer science (CS). Often pupils have only experiences in ICT, and therefore develop inadequate beliefs about CS. We propose educational standards for CS in lower high school in order to bridge ICT and CS.	bridging (networking);computer science;experience	Torsten Brinda;Hermann Puhlmann;Carsten Schulte	2009		10.1145/1562877.1562965	information and communications technology;computer science;pedagogy	AI	-75.16445129726118	-34.62122626368256	15165

8f5fa818c50cb060b6fdb81f714567b6c2160cd9	computer systems as institutions: social dimensions of computing in organizations		This paper introduces terminology and develops a framework for incorporating and emphasizing important social and political choices that become part of the history of Computer-Based Information Systems (CBIS) and are embedded in the social structure which supports its development and use. These social and political elements of a CBIS are not just discrete elements in an environment. They can be organized in specific ways which may enhance usability and performance and, paradoxically, constrain implementations and post-implementations. It is argued argue that CBIS, developed from complex, interdependent social and technical choices are better conceptualized as institutions than as tools. The distinction between tools and institutions is important for several reasons: the usability of CBIS is the critical factor, not the technology itself; CBIS that are well-used and have stable social structures are more difficult to replace than those with less social structure and fewer participants; and CBIS vary from one social sctting to another according to the ways in which they are organized and embedded in organized social systems.	embedded system;history of computing hardware;information system;interdependence;social structure;social system;usability	Suzanne Iacono;Rob Kling	1988			public relations;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-78.38985516392022	-2.960688111076635	15184
2059e66fdb45fb6763ebf9ac9b85d5bbd0e3c799	a model for rating and certifying competences in the eucip framework		Italian Computer Society acronym AIP-ITCS is a trade association which allows its members, through a “network of social relationships”, to communicate with and between different environments with the purpose of increasing the intellectual capital of computer professionals and the social capital of the association. While waiting for better policies for innovation and ICT to be identified, we are aware that an “objective” and “merit based” management of knowledge, although difficult to achieve, should constantly be pursued, in opposition to the natural tendency of man to develop a “subjective” and “patron-and client” management of knowledge. We consider a merit based system the ideal system; in practice this means a constant tendency towards a merit based management. The guideline for policies of social and economic development will therefore be a merit based and corporative rewarding welfare applicable to the “market of knowledge.” This is how the model for measuring and certifying competences originates. The aim is to achieve, in an objective and merit-based manner, a system for the assessment of competences, in this case those concerning the ICT sector, without leaving out, next to distinctive competences, relational and communicative skills. The purpose of this model is to elaborate a standard method for the issuing of competence certificates in accordance with the EU directive 92/51 of 18 June 1992 and subsequent modifications and with the national regulations of reference, in order to show the market that a certain professional is competent in a specific or general profession and that that competence can be used all over the EU. This model was first conceived in July 2005 with the purpose of finding a strategic and merit-based solution that fulfils the need for certification of competences in all intellectual jobs. It has been necessary to reduce the complexity of the issue through the implementation of a model easily understandable and usable by the work, training, service, industry, trade and consumer markets and in all cases by any interested organization.	eucip	Andrea Violetti;Susanna Daddi;Stefano Hajek	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-09712-1_12	simulation;engineering;management;pedagogy	NLP	-76.17939635744297	-26.73417118531594	15205

Our results show that Full-Body Interaction had a highly significant impact on how the participating children perceived collaboration in small groups and on how they felt about the other children in the group. This indicates that Full-Body Interaction may be beneficial for supporting the construction of a positive social space for collaborative learning, given its potential to enable the use of embodied resources, which are fundamental for social communication and social cognition.	desktop computer;social cognition	Laura Malinverni;Narcís Parés	2015		10.1145/2771839.2771849	psychology;interactive systems engineering;human–computer interaction;communication;social psychology	HCI	-70.74637036793669	-42.62364311854294	15249

In particular, the authors found that team members’ perceptions of the leader-member exchange relationship and the team’s past performance are related to individuals’ identification with the virtual team and that identification affects satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Individuals who perceive leader-member exchange as high (e.g., the leader displays a willingness to help the team member solve problems and the leader recognizes the member’s potential) and who report that their teams perform well had stronger identification with the team. Individuals who reported strong identification with their team were more satisfied with the team and had greater intentions to perform positive behaviors in the future.

481f71f3a275d91e6e658b41ae84831c365e7f30	an exploration of rotating leadership in a knowledge building community		This study aims to investigate the COINs concept of rotating leadership within a Knowledge Building context. Individual and group level leadership patterns in a grade 4 science class were explored through temporal visualization of betweenness centrality. Results indicate that the student network was relatively decentralized, with almost all students leading the group at different points in time. Rotating leadership appears to be an emergent phenomenon of Knowledge Building, and we suggest that it has the potential to be an indicator of collective cognitive responsibility. INTRODUCTION Knowledge Building (KB; Scardamalia, 2002) is a principle-based pedagogy that engages students directly in processes of knowledge creation through sustained, creative work with ideas. Within a KB community, students assume collective cognitive responsibility for the advancement of their community knowledge. Thus, the success of the community lies in the distribution of group effort across all members, rather than a concentration of effort amongst a few individuals. For example, a case study analysis of a KB class revealed that the decentralization of the student network led to increased advances in collective knowledge (Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, & Messina, 2009). This observation is in line with research on innovative groups in open network communities, as research in COINs theory (Gloor, Laubacher, Dynes, & Zhao, 2003) shows that the decentralization of leadership across group members through patterns of oscillation is a good indicator of group productivity and creativity. The current exploratory study aims to use COINs theory as an analytical framework to investigate leadership dynamics in KB. We used social network analysis (SNA) in order to visualize patterns of collective cognitive responsibility over time. We expected that rotating leadership, as indicated by oscillating betweenness centrality similar to those of productive innovative groups (Kidane & Gloor, 2007), would emerge as the collective knowledge advances. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our sample is a grade 4 class, comprising 22 students, who engaged in the inquiry of light over a three-month period (Sun, Zhang, & Scardamalia, 2010). Student discourse in an online KB environment (i.e., Knowledge Forum®) was exported into Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX; Oshima, Oshima, & Matsuzawa, 2012) in order to perform SNA based on a list of contentrelated words (101 words) compiled from the Ontario Curriculum of Science and Technology. KBDeX is an analytic tool which was designed to facilitate content-based SNA for KB discourse. It produces visualization models of word, note, and student networks based on the co-occurrence of words in a note. Edges in the student network show the strength of connections among students whose notes share the same word. KBDeX also supports temporal network analysis by showing animations of how the network metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality) change over time. The betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a member influences other members of the group (Gloor et. al., 2003). At the individual level, a betweenness centrality value of 1 means that a member is highly influential, whereas a value of 0 means that a member is equally influential as other members. At the group level, the centralization of betweenness centrality is used to indicate the extent to which the network is centralized (i.e., influence is not evenly distributed in the network, high influence is occupied by a few members of the network). A centralization of betweenness centrality value of 1 means that the network is completely centralized, whereas a value of 0 means that the network is completely decentralized. FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS First, we examined the centralization of the betweenness centrality of the student network in order to examine the extent to which the student network was centralized around specific members. We found that the average centralization of betweenness centrality is relatively low, m = 0.089, sd = 0.064 (range = 0 to 0.25), which suggests that the student network was relatively decentralized, and students shared more or less the same level of influence in their network. Students maintained a relatively high cohesive network over time. Figure 1. KBDeX visualization of individual betweenness centralities across time Next, we examined the betweenness centrality at the individual level as shown in Figure 1. The Y axis of the chart shows the betweenness centrality value, and the X axis shows the time. Each student is represented by a coloured line, resulting in a total of 22 lines displayed in the chart. Of the 22 students, 20 students took a leading position, suggesting that different students were leading across different times. As a higher betweenness centrality means that the student holds a more important position in the social network, the overlapping phenomena of the lines indicate that the leading student (i.e., the student with the highest centrality at the time) is frequently changing. Figure 2: a) student network, b) note network, and c) word network at turn 112, when student u26 had the highest betweeness centrality Follow up content analyses on the top five cases of betweenness centrality (range = 0.18 to 0.25) revealed that students with the highest betweenness centrality held a pivotal role in connecting diverse student ideas with the whole-class discussion. The most typical case was selected for explanation and the three networks in KBDeX are shown in Figure 2. The student network in Figure 2a shows that student u26 connected students u18 and u22 to the largest group network. The note network in Figure 2b shows that notes 78 and 120, written by student u26, linked notes 72, 73, and 119 to the larger cluster of notes. The word network in Figure 2c shows that student u26 connected the concepts of “reflection”, “angle”, and “mirror” to the main discussion of whether light travels in a wave or straight line. The discussion later touched upon topics such as “mirrors and angles”, “reflection and absorption”, and “colours and shadows”. Thus, student u26 helped the entire class reach a deeper understanding of light, by seeking coherence between diverse ideas from student u18, student u22, and the whole group. Similar patterns were found with the other four cases of leadership. Our results confirm our hypothesis that rotating leadership is manifested within a KB community that values idea diversity and assumes collective cognitive responsibility for idea improvement. Future research should further examine the conditions that give rise to the phenomenon of rotating leadership. For example, it would be interesting to supplement our findings with additional qualitative analyses in order to detangle whether or not other types of contribution lead to rising or falling leadership amongst group members.

The empirical research focuses on IRIS, an online platform where citizens can report urban maintenance problems by posting a message on a web page and expect an almost instant reply by local government. The theoretical focus of the paper is the effect that the implementation of web services that require an """"Internet-time"""" response has on the bureaucratic structure of government. The research is mainly based on expert interviews and describes the managers' and representatives' interpretations and sensemaking realized in order to manage the implementation of this kind of Internet service. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the empirical data and attempts to assess how the provision of an Internet-time service, such as IRIS, and the development of an effective interactive web platform by a local government influences the structure of government. The analysis highlights that the use of this type of technology implies a redefinition of the Weberian structural elements of bureaucracy, such as the principles of legitimacy, hierarchy and specialization."""	bureaucracy;internet	Giuseppe Alfano	2011	Information Polity	10.3233/IP-2011-0226	public relations;knowledge management;political science;management	ECom	-80.88763481526364	-12.992387330033424	15282

To invert or “flip” a course is to (i) introduce students to core concepts outside of class time, thereby (ii) creating more room for in-class active learning. Typically students watch lecture videos as homework, then solve related exercises in teams, with instructor assistance, in the classroom. In the Fall semester of 2013, the authors flipped ME 450, but only partially: the first 30% of the course was flipped, while the remainder was taught through a traditional lecture format. This allowed the authors to observe some distinctions between the two formats. The goal of this paper is to describe the above classroom flip to the system dynamics and control community, and share some of the associated firsthand observations. The subjective nature of these observations is indisputable, and the paper should therefore be viewed as a record of experiences rather than rigorous summary of objective findings. Penn State University's Leonhard Center for Enhancement of Engineering Education has conducted an internal review board (IRB)-approved, objective assessment of the ME 450 course flip, the results of which complement this paper but are intended for independent dissemination.	active learning (machine learning);dynamical system;review board;system dynamics;systems modeling	Hosam K.

As pressure mounted at the University of Capetown (UCT) to extend student access to computer laboratories, build bigger and better laboratories, wire residences, improve networks and provide faster computers, we asked what students do with the computers they already have access to, and whether they are using those computers to support their learning.	computer lab	Laura Czerniewicz;Dick Ng'ambi	2004	BJET	10.1111/j.0007-1013.2004.00385.x		HCI	-77.46402740955726	-30.476735525512314	15359

This article presents a study of plagiarism behavior in an introductory programming course, where a traditional pen-and-paper exam was replaced with multiple take-home exams. The students who took the take-home exam enabled a software plugin that recorded their programming process. During an analysis of the students' submissions, potential plagiarism cases were highlighted, and students were invited to interviews.  The interviews with the candidates for plagiarism highlighted three types of plagiarism behaviors: help-seeking, collaboration, and systematic cheating. Analysis of programming process traces indicates that parts of such behavior are detectable directly from programming process data.	adobe streamline;computer science;educational data mining;sequence alignment;tracing (software)	Arto Hellas;Juho Leinonen;Petri Ihantola	2017		10.1145/3059009.3059065	multimedia;cheating;computer science;knowledge management;plug-in;software;help-seeking;educational data mining	HCI	-84.49886442888845	-33.214239656361066	15378

In this study, an instrument based on SERVPERF's service quality dimensions, i.e., tangibles, reliability, empathy, responsiveness, and assurance, was developed to study the service quality for in-house and outsourced system development process. Analysis of the data collected from 152 system users who had also involved in the development of those systems supported the validity and reliability of the newly developed measures. The relative contribution of the individual service quality dimensions to the overall system development service quality was found to vary between the outsourcing and in-house group, so as the impact of the overall system development service quality on the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. These results suggest that users may evaluate the services provided by outsourcing vendors and in-house IT personnel differently.	outsourcing;quality of service;responsiveness;usability	Man Kit Chang;Louisa Lui	2008			service provider;service level requirement;service level objective;service delivery framework;operations management;service design;rapid application development;management;service quality;statistics;data collection	SE	-89.90945613290154	-4.782814224968436	15384

034ecff61adc8b5a5f291be32c02990ee1259d36	a meta-relational approach for the definition and management of hybrid learning objects	electronic learning;metadata;databases;classification	Electronic learning objects (LOs) are commonly conceived of as digital units of information used for teaching and learning. To facilitate their classification for pedagogical planning and retrieval purposes, LOs are complemented with metadata (e.g., the author). These metadata are usually restricted by a set of predetermined tags to which the classification schema must conform (e.g., IEEE LOM). In our experience, certain complex LOs need to be complemented with different types of domain-dependent information for their pedagogical planning and retrieval: (i) classification metadata for enhancing contextualisation, search and retrieval (e.g., the tagged structure of an archaeological site where an archaeological object has been found) and (ii) additional data that can enrich the LO (e.g., the weight and other dimensions of an archaeological artifact described in a podcast). We refer to LOs enhanced with domain-dependent information as hybrid learning objects (HLOs). However, most learning object repositories (LORs) only permit a predetermined, fixed set of metadata attributes to be used in the classification of LOs. This rigidity is inappropriate when domain-dependent information schemas are used for the browsing, retrieval, and domain-specific pedagogical sequencing of HLOs. Thus, custom software applications are needed to manage LOs that must be tagged with information belonging to specific domains. This paper presents a theoretical approach that permits the use of a single LOR for classifying and enriching LOs according to domain-dependent information schemas, which can be dynamically changed after their definition. The key issue in our approach is the presence of a meta-relational model for the dynamic definition of specific domain-dependent relational database schemas used for classifying and enriching LOs.	podcast;relational database;relational model;units of information	Antonio Navarro;Ana M.

We sample the existing literature regarding online communities in an historical sense and critique the preponderance among these writings to advocate trust and consensus. Our argument is that much of the existing literature has a particular intellectual heritage that has heavily shaped contemporary understandings of online communities. Field examination of the community reveals the use of meaning-laden, often aggressive pseudonyms coupled with conversations that are openly belligerent and more pointedly a lack of general consensus. We conclude with the presentation of a research agenda for this field of research that argues for a nuanced reconnection to more 'traditional' sociological literature where conflict figures heavily.

We conducted a questionnaire survey of 32 Chinese college students, asking them to evaluate 40 pictures from their feelings. By comparing the results of Chinese and Japanese, we found several interesting conclusions. First of all, both Chinese males and Japanese males have come up with 5 identical main factors for pictures, but these main factors have different degrees of influence. Second, Chinese females only have four main factors for pictures. Third, we compared Chinese males with Chinese females and then found their respective main factors. Lastly, by changing the way of the factor rotation, the correlation between the main factors was found.	image	Qiyu Yang;Teruhisa Hochin;Hiroki Nomiya	2017	2017 18th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)	10.1109/SNPD.2017.8022779	questionnaire;feeling;impression;computer science;kansei;multimedia	SE	-82.16538631379538	-22.297033330794374	15510

However, existing tools often fail to assign some students to groups creating a problem well known as ldquoorphan studentsrdquo. In this paper we propose a framework for learner group formation, based upon satisfying the constraints of the person forming the groups by reasoning over semantic data about the potential participants. The use of both semantic Web technologies and logic programming proved to increase the satisfaction of the constraints and overcome the orphanspsila problem.	focus group;logic programming;semantic web	Asma Ounnas;Hugh C.

The open source movement on the other hand, is more pragmatic in their attempts to promote open source software (OSS). Employees belonging to these movements often advocate the use of OSS in their organization. Hence, decision making in organizations on the adoption of OSS may exhibit certain idealistic characteristics. A recent study has shown that American organizations are quite pragmatic about the adoption decision on OSS. We investigate whether similar results will be obtained in circumstances in which there is more opportunity for idealistic behavior. Therefore, we have conducted ten case studies in Belgian organizations on the organizational adoption of OSS. Our results are largely consistent with previous studies, although some differences were discovered. Idealistic behavior with respect to the adoption of OSS only seems to manifest itself in very small organizations.	open-source software	Kris Ven;Jan Verelst	2006			pragmatism;management science;knowledge management;computer science;software;idealism;politics	SE	-81.45978494099175	0.32262196131578424	15554

It explores how, at the project's outset, key actors (e.g., nanotechnologists and pTA researchers) frame elements of the process like 'the public' and draw on interpretive repertoires to fit their perspective. The examples call into question normative commitments to cooperation, consensus building, and common action that conventionally guide pTA approaches. It is argued that pTA itself must reflect an awareness of competing interests and perspectives inherent in the discourse associated with the meaning of 'participation' if it is to incite action beyond vested interests and ensure genuine mutual learning.	conceptualization (information science);consensus (computer science);contingency (philosophy);critical illness;framing (world wide web);risk assessment;technology assessment;vision;interest	Michiel van Oudheusden	2011	Science and engineering ethics	10.1007/s11948-011-9313-z	psychology;engineering;knowledge management;power;management science;sociology;social psychology	HCI	-80.28941936451506	-3.2002931213939556	15592

The empirical data was collected from five high-tech and IT industries in Taiwan. A total of 217 companies returned the questionnaires and the data was analysed using chi-square tests and regression analysis. The results show that different organisational capabilities correspond to different product architectures. Also, selective organisational capability has a mediated effect on modular product architecture and business performance. Against our expectations, however, integrated collaborative organisational capability does not have a mediated effect on integrated product architecture and business performance. Overall, this study provides a theoretical analytic framework to better understand the interactive relationship between product architecture and organisational capability.	theory	Ing-Shane Yung;Chin-Fa Tsai	2016	IJITM	10.1504/IJITM.2016.077356	systems engineering;knowledge management;operations management;product management;law;information technology;business architecture	HPC	-82.29310678065335	3.746226703439318	15667

It follows clearly from this that an effective interface is an essential ingredient in a quality software product. Whilst the discipline of Human Computer Interaction is maturing quickly, there still remains only limited support for designing in quality rather than evaluating it afterwards. In this paper the authors present the results of a pilot study within the first stage in the development of the LUCID (Logical User Centred Interface Design) method which attempts to integrate a number of human factor tools within a quality framework. Particularly they focus on the phases which adopt the Taguchi Method for designing quality into products and processes. By adopting such techniques within a practical example, the authors demonstrate how the use of a scientific experimental design strategy, together with conventional statistical tools can assist the selection of the optimum user interface.	taguchi methods	Andy Smith;Lynne Dunckley	1996			systems engineering;engineering;operations management;engineering drawing	EDA	-64.7833724440623	-48.149439810567124	15679

Design/methodology/approach – This research follows qualitative interpretive approach. The results produced in this paper are based on thematic analysis of responses from open-ended interviews with ERP stakeholders in large size Australian organizations. The research findings have been further triangulated with surveys and content analysis. Findings – This research is still in progress; therefore, this paper presents the results of the field study conducted so far along with the instrument used to collect data. This instrument consists of a list of selected questions based on the thorough review of current information systems literature. However, the major finding of this study, thus far, is that the ERP implementation is a process of aligning technology with organizational, social, cultural, economic, technical, and other organizational environmental institutions. Research limitations/implications – The major research limitation of this study is that it is still in progress, therefore, the results reported in this paper are emergent and not complete. Another limitation of this paper is that it is Australian specific; therefore, the generalizability of the results in other settings cannot be ascertained. Nevertheless, this research contributes to the ERP implementation literature by applying a stage-based model which takes into account the pre-implementation, implementation and post-implementation stages of ERP assimilation into an integrated structure. Practical implications – This research concludes that ERP assimilation is characterized and shaped by mutual interactions of various organizational, social, cultural, environmental, and other institutional factors. The research framework developed in this study may be mastered as a decision-making tool by business manager to guide the organization through various stages of ERP institutionalization. Originality/value – Institutionalization of ERP technologies is a recent phenomenon and this field is far for being matured. This research is based in Australian settings where they have been no previous study of institutionalization of technology.	data assimilation;decision support system;erp;emergence;field research;information system;interaction;nonlinear gameplay;polygon triangulation	Azadeh Pishdad;Abrar Haider	2013	J.

This re-alignment entails a move from broadly Foucauldian, macro-level, structural or poststructural analyses, to the existential–phenomenological study of subjective consciousness and experience. This piece illustrates such an experiential study by taking part of Sartre’s famous description of “the look,” and comparing it to a similarly experientially based description of an everyday context of surveillance—specifically, a bank machine or ATM transaction. Through the analysis of these descriptions, the piece shows how the study of the lived experience of surveillance highlights the role of the body, of social convention, and also of individual agency in surveillant practices that can be overlooked in other analyses.	atm turbo;consciousness	Norm Friesen;Andrew Feenberg;Grace Smith	2009	Inf.

This paper argues that a new perspective on the concept """"community"""" can shed light on the subject. Ideas from cognitive science, particularly category theory, can help. I suggest that community can be viewed as a prototype-based category. Prototype-based categories are defined not by simple rules of inclusion and exclusion, but instead by their prototypical members--a robin is a better example of a bird than an emu or a penguin. Items in a category are better or worse examples of the category depending on their degree of similarity to the prototypical members. I will argue that these theoretical insights can help resolve debates about the nature of community, and also can help guide designers of computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems."""	category theory;cognitive science;computer-mediated communication;internet;online community;prototype	Amy Bruckman	2006		10.1145/1125451.1125579	community organization;community;computer science;knowledge management;management;world wide web;computer-mediated communication;category theory	HCI	-77.02020087415025	-14.540696727394453	15812

Social media marketing tactics of three luxury retail brands (Barneys New York, Net-a-Porter.com, and Saks Fifth Avenue) were examined across three major social media networks (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). All posts by the three retailers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were recorded over the course of a week. A content analysis revealed that different social media networks may be effectively used in different ways by luxury retailers. Facebook allows for the greatest connection with consumers (all three retailers had the most followers on Facebook) while Twitter allows for the largest volume of posts; consumer feedback was highest on Instagram. Overall, social media marketing proved an effective, low-cost tool for the three retailers, with payoff well justifying the effort. For example, all three retailers had over 1,200 shares and retweets on Facebook and Twitter. Social Media Marketing in Luxury Retail	instagram;social media marketing	Izabella M.

I argue that many of the conclusions arrived at by existing research, while laudable in their inventiveness and/or practicality, miss the mark by viewing information overload as a problem that can be understood (or even solved) by purely rational means. Such a perspective lacks a critical understanding in human information usage: much in the same way that economic models dependent on rationality for their explanations or projections fail (often spectacularly, as recent history attests), models that rely too heavily upon the same rational behavior, and not heavily enough upon the interplay of actual social dynamics—power, reputation, norms, and others—in their attempts to explain, project, or address information overload prove bankrupt as well. Furthermore, even research that displays greater awareness of the social context in which overload exists often reveals a similar rationality in its conceptualization. That is, often the same “social” approaches that offer potential advantages (in mitigating information overload) over their “non-social” counterparts paradoxically raise new problems, requiring a reappraisal of overload that takes social issues into account holistically.

For this reason, we must consider including accessibility requirements in a synchronized manner with the alternative resources such as caption and audio description among others. In addition, it is very important to take into account accessibility requirements in the player to avoid barriers and to ensure access to this multimedia content as well as their resources. This paper presents an overall study on standards and players with accessibility requirements. Moreover, solutions to improve the accessibility features in the YouTube player are presented. Based on this study, we have distinguished a set of guidelines to take into account for including accessibility requirements in players. Furthermore, we suggest an agile evaluation process which indicates the order of accessibility guidelines to check. Finally, the proposed evaluation method is put into practice with a case study: accessibility features are evaluated in three widely used players.	accessibility;agile software development;audio description;documentation;requirement;world wide web	Lourdes Moreno;Maria Y González;Paloma Martínez;Ana Iglesias	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21672-5_28	web accessibility initiative;web standards;engineering;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-64.84447756421443	-51.13232416291679	15908
e4258cbcb861015623fe5b8de3076e41d33d4873	trajectory segmentation for a recommendation module of a customer relationship management system		In business analytics some industries rely heavily on commercial geo-demographic segmentation systems (MOSAIC, ACORN, etc.), which are a universally strong predictor of user's behavior: from diabetes propensity and purchasing habits to political preferences. A segment is de-fined with a postcode of the client's home address. Recent research suggests that a mature competitor to geo-demographic segmentation is about to emerge: segmentation based on user mobility is reported to be a reliable proxy of social well-being of the neighborhood. In this submission, we have completed a user segmentation model based on cluster-ing of user trajectories from the Call Detail Records covering one week of activity of one region in Sweden. The new seg-mentation has been compared against MOSAIC in the recommendation module of a customer relationship management system and has revealed better business options with regard to network exploitation and potential revenues.

The latter scrutinize some of the logic that underlies arguments made by those who either support or reject the need for a theoretical core. Unfortunately, nature-of-the-discipline commentaries are unlikely to help clarify or resolve fundamental issues that underpin the debate. Too often they are based on idiosyncratic views that are difficult to either justify or refute. Logic-ofthe-core commentaries, however, lay bare the arguments made by the protagonists so they can be evaluated. In this paper, I examine the logic-of-the-core arguments made by Lyytinen and King (2004) and evaluate their validity.	information system	Ron Weber	2006	J.

AltaVista advanced searches were used for the data collection and network diagrams used to portray the results from four perspectives. It was found that each of the four angles allowed novel interpretations of the data, but that Australia and Japan were nevertheless clearly at the heart of the Web in the region, with Australia being a particularly common target of links and Japan having a more balanced profile of ingoing and outgoing hyperlinks. Interestingly, one of the perspectives mimicked an official grouping of less wealthy countries in the region whilst another contained the more developed countries, with Singapore and Thailand appearing in both. It was hypothesised that the nature of larger Web sites covered was qualitatively different from that of smaller ones, making the deduction of relationships between the hosting institutions difficult from the link counts alone.	diagram;hyperlink;natural deduction;while;world wide web	Mike Thelwall;Alastair G.

Based on two dominant theories in the field of diffusion of innovation, a conceptual model is proposed. In order to test the model empirically, an online survey was designed and launched. Decision makers of 101 SMEs agreed to participate in this survey. In order to evaluate the internal, convergent, and discriminant validity of the instrument, factor analysis and reliability tests were performed. Logistic regression is employed to test our hypotheses. The results of regression reveal that decision maker's knowledge about cloud computing is the main influential factor in decision making about its adoption.	cloud computing	Shima Ramezani Tehrani;Farid Shirazi	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07863-2_60	marketing;operations management;management science;business	HPC	-82.88034770868828	3.3755566242230794	15987

In recent years, discussions have focused on programs aimed at fostering socioemotional factors, such as social connections, subjective wellbeing, life satisfaction, and levels of loneliness of older adults, to maintain their quality of life. This paper reviews the literature on socioemotional benefits and the impacts of digital games on this factor. Three examples are given from recent studies carried out in Canada that demonstrate the impacts of digital games on social connectedness.

20ffed6e3257a47cb5b587999ebf5d4e4a255095	alignment of human resources and information technology: a case study of a major australian bank		While there is significant evidence to suggest that the alignment of Human Resources(HR) and Information Technology(IT) planning and implementation processes have a positive impact on firm performance, there is little discussion on how to achieve alignment. Industry evidence suggests there are limited communications or connections between HR and IT executives, and significant problems in translating alignment intentions into executive understanding and actions. This research looks at the case of a major bank through the lens of the Reich and Benbasat social alignment framework to contribute to an understanding of the issues that enable or inhibit alignment between the IT and HR strategic functions. Findings support the view that shared domain knowledge, and history of IT and HR implementation success impact on the communication and planning activities that ultimately determine levels of social alignment. Other factors of geographical location, structural power, accountability, and leadership have been added as a result of this research.	location (geography)	Kristine F.

8f68227fcf2a66a52b9b207200c3e8de65e99f71	against individual creativity	004;creativity culture	In this paper I discuss reasons for viewing human creativity more as a social process than as an individual act. These reasons include the subjectivity of evaluation in attributing creativity, the potentially arbitrary relationship between individuals and creativity at the cultural level, the importance of the capacity for preserving cultural information over and above the capacity to innovate, the role of objects, institutions and interaction in sparking creativity, and the social constructedness of creative domains. I consider the consequences of this way of thinking for research into computational creativity. I argue that realising the goals of computational creativity depends on integrating research on creative agents with social technologies.	computational creativity;emergence;interaction	Oliver Bown	2009			psychology;social science;creativity technique;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-63.187181692542026	-30.272359481352638	16126

This study analyzed online learner profiles in regard to their entry characteristics, participation behaviors and achievement of course outcomes. The sample consisted of 186 participants from an online course that required the employment of synchronous and asynchronous communication methods over the Internet. The data were collected through five online questionnaires and included 10 variables (gender, age, work status, self-efficacy, online readiness, self-regulation, participation in discussion list, participation in chat sessions, satisfaction and achievement). A two-step cluster analysis, chi-square analysis and multivariate analysis were used to analyze the collected data. The results indicated that online learners fell into three significantly different clusters and within each cluster, learners had a close combination of employment characteristics, gender type, age level, perception of self-efficacy for online technologies and participation behavior level.	cluster analysis	Erman Yükseltürk;Ercan Top	2013	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01339.x	psychology;simulation;computer science;asynchronous communication;multimedia;communication;social psychology;computer-mediated communication	NLP	-75.8593500603289	-41.97293923906919	16144

In the paper we analyze the data collected in ten innovative schools in Israel which have incorporated ICT in unique ways and have succeeded in devising innovative classroom pedagogies and school system changes. The major research questions addressed are: (a) What levels of innovation were observed in the participant schools, and in which domains? (b) How does the level of innovation in the various domains vary among and within schools? (c) What correlation patterns among levels of innovation in the various domains can be identified? The results of ten comprehensive case studies of exemplary schools in Israel were analyzed by mean of the innovation analysis schema developed by us for characterizing ICT-based educational innovations.	emoticon;international ergonomics association;pedagogical agent	Dorit Tubin;David Mioduser;Rafi Nachmias;Alona Forkosh-Baruch	2003	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1024554313858	innovation;information and communications technology;knowledge management;mathematics;law;information technology;statistics;pedagogy;data collection	HCI	-75.76294341183886	-34.59446745389554	16191

In many social exclusion situations crowdfunding is the last stronghold to ensure the access to basic commodities, essential to the daily life and well-being of individuals. Despite the commercial success of many crowdfunding platforms, this study shows future research opportunities in the crowdfunding as an inclusion mechanism that can trigger a broader adoption for social causes. The high social impact of the research contributions in this domain can also contribute to make it a hot topic in the upcoming years.	cellular automaton;crowdfunding;stronghold	Hugo Paredes;João Barroso;Jeffrey P.

Another staff demographic is that many are relatively recent graduates. What they have in common is a hierarchical, standards-driven and technical worldview - the antithesis of the peculiarities of higher education's organizational structure. This void, despite excellent skills and knowledge of information technology, frequently results in miscommunication, misunderstanding, and costly mistakes when working with the majority of the university whose worldview is autonomous, variable and non-hierarchical (not to mention, non-technical). After a series of embarrassing mistakes, we launched a mandatory professional development course called Higher Ed 101 to give our IT staff the vocabulary and understanding of the complexities of higher education's organizational structure, particularly shared governance, academic freedom and tenure. The rationale was twofold: 1) to reduce disruption to the community because of insensitivity to the academic calendar and processes; and 2) to ease internal tension, raise levels of job satisfaction and develop flexible approaches to common campus technology issues. This paper details the course, Higher Ed 101, for use in staff training and development. It concludes with why making an investment in teaching the technology staff about the culture of higher education is as sound an investment in their (and the IT department's) future as is learning the latest technology.	autonomous robot;comment (computer programming);denial-of-service attack;design rationale;downtime;email;my vision;randomness;subject matter expert turing test;vocabulary;windows me	Leslie Hitch;Beth-Anne Sullivan	2006		10.1145/1181216.1181249	engineering;knowledge management;management;pedagogy	HCI	-76.04046012349406	-29.83913306911625	16203

Nowadays, people can exchange short messages via various digital devices through micro-blog. Witnessing this trend, practitioners strive hard to seek opportunities in utilizing micro-blog for better customer reach. Numerous studies have also investigated this phenomenon. While previous studies primarily placed their focus on people’s motivation to use SNS, usage pattern and potential applications in various fields, to our best knowledge, Research on microblog is still in its infancy and the core concept of SNS, i.e. social relationship, is rarely addressed. This study thus proposed a framework to investigate the effects that micro-blog is to exert on consumer’s relationship with firms. Results suggested that system quality, interaction quality, and relationship benefits are influential to relationship quality, which contributes to loyalty.

While these projects can achieve important disciplinary outcomes for the students, what has been under examined is the benefit that these projects have for the service recipients and their community. This paper argues that since service learning projects are meant to benefit both student donors and community recipients, we must examine much more carefully how computing service projects interact with all the social actors affected by the projects. Taking such an approach will require recognizing that ICT by itself will not improve or increase democracy, equality, social inclusion, or any other social good. Analogous to the experience of foreign aid recipients in the developing world, some service learning projects may actually do more harm than good. The paper concludes by providing some sample computer learning projects that are oriented more strongly towards achieving true service for the recipients.		Randy W.

Yet, more and more nations are developing restrictive information policies to maintain their political, cultural and economic status. The author calls this phenomenon, “information protectionism,” and examines a number of cooperative steps that are being taken to assure the open exchange of ideas and information and to create a policy of global information interdependence. The basic challenge, the article concludes, is to find and maintain a realistic balance between open transborder data flow and national concerns and priorities.		Lee Edwards	1988	Inf.

Through a study of a number of UK government-industry “task forces” and recent world events in drug regulation it identifies two opposing trends in play and suggests that there are actually limits to the all pervasive notion of governance. Instead, the multi-faceted policy and regulatory situation that applies to the life sciences is leading to the existence of a government-governance continuum where different aspects of genomics and life science technologies sit at different points; contrasting the role of the state in controlling and framing the context for the implementation of innovations in life sciences through the regulatory system with the more participative forms of policy-making that are being fostered both to promote national competitiveness and encourage public acceptance of these new technologies.	apache continuum;faceted classification;framing (world wide web);pervasive informatics	Catherine Lyall	2007	Techn.

It was developed to support teaching history of civilization courses at the engineering faculty. It covers hierarchically arranged concept maps which are presented dynamically by using Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. MCTs are integrated in e-learning portals to support self-learning. MCTs were investigated in terms of the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) discipline to evaluate their usability in online courses. For this purpose, relationships between learners’ cognitive abilities, individual differences, and usability of e-learning portal were considered in order to create a model between individual differences and software usability. The usability of MCT was evaluated by 116 (70 male, 46 female) subjects who were registered for the HUM1005 History of Civilization I, a general elective course at the faculty of engineering. They completed four different surveys: an IQ survey, a personality survey, a motivation survey, and a software usability measurement inventory (SUMI). This research compares intelligence, personal factors, and motivation factors with the personal software usability results in order to determine the correlations and associations between the usability of the software and learners’ individual differences. In the study, results show that the usability of any education tool has effect on achievement of the learner. Noteworthy, a correlation was found between Grade Point Average (GPA) and usability scores.	civilization iii;cognition;concept map;human computer;human–computer interaction;iso/iec 9126;learnability;markup language;mobile data terminal;portals;social inequality;usability;xml	Dilek Karahoca	2013	J.

83427c6d72fda86becef2e0635d1c54641c1649b	understanding awareness diffusion in microblogging	product adoption;online communities;academic research;conference_paper;microblogging;homophily	The word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing has been recognized to be the most credible and important marketing approach, especially when the social network websites have become an internet phenomenon. Previous studies have shown that the dispersion of WOM across various communities has significant positive impact on product adoption (Godes and Mayzlin, 2004). On the other hand, the homophily theory in sociology indicates that people usually feel more comfortable talking with those who are similar to them than those who are not. Such psychological discomfort caused by communicating to dissimilar people may cause information “stuck” in clusters of similar people in a social network (Touchey, 1974). As a result, it is usually more difficult for information to traverse across the boundary of online communities than to spread within a community. However, it appears that the setting at a microblogging website such as twiter.com enables easier cross-boundary message dispersion. The main reason is that when a person retweets a message received from people he follows, the message is broadcasted to his followers, a group of people who might be very different from those this person follows. Given that microblogging has been an important means for organizations to communicate with prospective/existing customers, such retweet behavior becomes crucial for organizations’ online branding endeavors. This study thus seeks to uncover the factors associated with the retweeting behavior of participants at twitter.com by using content and social network analysis technologies. We believe that the results from this project will have both significant contribution to academic research and important implication for practitioners. INTRODUCTION There is no doubt that the social network websites have become an internet phenomenon. A Nielsen report indicated that in 2008, two thirds of internet population spent ten percent of total internet time on either social network or blog sites (Nielsen, 2009). Online network communities provide an effective channel for marketers to reach potential consumers. And the word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing has been recognized to be the most credible and important marketing approach. The awareness or adoption spreads from network member to member when people talk about a product with their online friends. Research has shown that people who communicate with a prior customer of a product or service are three to five times more likely to become the customer of the same product or service than people who do not know any prior customers (Hill et al., 2006). As a result, practitioners and researchers are demanding more insight on how people influence each other in social network communities. On the other hand, the explicit linkage among online community members is well recorded, which in turn provides great opportunity for the understanding of interactions among online community members. It is much easier to measure the word-of-mouth (WOM) in an online community than in a community in real world. In addition, studies have also shown that the WOM measured in online communities is related to the adoption of product (Godes and Mayzlin, 2004). Sociological theory of homophily (McPherson et al., 2001) has been applied to explain the product diffusion. People incline to communicate with those who are similar to them (Arvidsson, 1999; Marschan-Piekkari et al., 1999; Monteiro et al., 2004). As a result, similar people may affect each other and end up buying similar products. For example, geographic similarity has been found to be helpful for explaining consumer behavior in purchasing Japanese cars (Yang and Allenby, 2003). On the other hand, the homophily theory also indicates that people may experience psychological discomfort when they have to communicate with others who are too dissimilar from them (Touchey, 1974). The communications between dissimilar people thus could be hampered and people form clusters in social networks. As a result, WOM could be stuck within a community. However, only when the WOM traverses the boundary between communities can it reach more people. This research-in-progress paper thus proposes to analyze archives of twitter.com to understand the dispersion of awareness information across group boundaries. Both content analysis and social network analysis will be applied to uncover factors associated the spreading of awareness information across online communities. The paper is organized as follows. Following the introduction, section 2 reviews related literatures and introduces the twiter.com, followed by the discussion of research question development in section 3. Section 4 describes the design and our plan for this study, whereas section 5 provides the summary and discussions. LITERATURE REVIEW Previous studies support that people could be affected by each other’s opinion (Banerjee, 1992). WOM is both a drive and an outcome of the adoption of a product or service. Consumers may have similar purchase behaviors when there is frequent communication among them. WOM usually spreads quickly within communities and slowly across them (Putsis et al., 1997; Godes and Mayzlin, 2004). People tend to have strong ties with others in the same community but have weak ties with those in different communities. However, it is usually the information that traverses the weak ties has the potential to reach more people than that traverses only the strong ties. Consequently, the dispersion of WOM across different communities, as opposed to the volume of WOM, has more significant impact on the adoption of product (Godes and Mayzline, 2004). This gives rise to another question, what are the factors related to the spread of WOM in online communities? In another word, what are the attributes of this person or a group that may contribute to the occurrence of the across community dispersion? Various factors have been found to contribute to the dissemination of product information. Those factors include the geographic proximity (Case, 1991; Yang and Allenby, 2003; Linden et al., 2003), the direct communication with prior customers (Hill et al., 2006), the content of information itself (Frenzen and Nakamoto, 1993), as well as various social network factors (Hill et al., 2006). However, it is unclear if above mentioned factors could be applied to explain the dispersion of information in the online environment. Microbloging is a new type of communication using web social service such as twitter.com, where people can send short messages to describe what happened in life or to express their opinion and feeling. Twitter participants could select people to follow and receive the messages from those they follow through instant message, mobile phone, e-mail, and web instantly. The communication format has become so popular that many organizations have opened an account at twitter to share information, receive feedback, and to build relationship with their customers. It appears that the setting at a microblogging website such as twiter.com enables easier cross-boundary message dispersion. The main reason is that when a person retweets a message received from people he follows, the message is broadcasted to his followers, a group of people who might be very different from those this person follows. Therefore it is crucial to understand factors associated with the retweet behavior in microblogging. RESEARCH QUESTION DEVELOPMENT As reviewed in section two, WOM marketing is an effective way to spread product information and to facilitate the adoption of this product. Previous studies have shown that the dispersion of WOM across various communities has significant positive impact on product adoption (Godes and Mayzlin, 2004). On the other hand, the homophily theory in sociology indicates that people intend to communicate only with those who are similar to them (Arvidsson, 1999; Marschan-Piekkari et al., 1999; Monteiro et al., 2004). The psychological discomfort due to communicating with dissimilar people may cause information “stuck” within clusters of people in a social network (Touchey, 1974). As a result, it is usually more difficult for information to traverse across the boundary of online communities than to spread within a community. However, only the product information that crosses the boundary can make WOM more effective. While it appears that the retweeting behavior enables easier cross boundary message dispersion, none research has been fund to help us understand such behavior that might be crucial for organizations’ online branding endeavors. Therefore, using the archives of twitter.com that documents message content and links among participants, this paper seeks to answer the question that under what circumstances will one person retweet information about a product/service?	archive;blog;economy of second life;email;feedback;instant messaging;interaction;internet branding;linkage (software);mobile phone;online community;prospective search;purchasing;reblogging;social network analysis;systematic review;traverse;word lists by frequency;yang	Bin Zhu;Michael Chau	2010			public relations;political science;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-86.55916287740392	-13.133813521215654	16380

This study examines the dynamic relationships between social media and bitcoin performance. We consider the distinct effects of different social media platforms and different user groups subdivided by posting volume. The results suggest that more bullish forum posts have a positive effect on bitcoin returns, and the effect is stronger when we only include the posts by users who are less likely to contribute. In addition, messages on Internet forum have stronger impacts on future bitcoin market measures at a daily frequency, but microblogs’ effects are more significant at an hourly frequency.	bitcoin;emergence;social media	Feng Mai;Qing Bai;Jay Shan;Xin Wang;Roger H.

The website is an important information channel which provides quickly, accurately and timely information on food safety, hygiene, and disease prevention, and also provides necessary documents, data and information for managers, policy makers and researchers in the health sector. This study aimed to assess the satisfaction of the CHCE website users and propose solutions to improve the quality of the website to meet the needs of users. For this purpose, this study built a research model by applying IS Success Model, and conducted a survey by delivering questionnaires to the users from CHCE in 9 provinces and one Institute of MOH in Vietnam. The results show that three factors (information quality, system quality, system design quality) have positive effect on user satisfaction of using CHCE website. Moreover, users care more about quality systems and quality information. In other words, users are more interested in what information and knowledge the website provides, and how good is its information quality; e.g., reliable or useful, for organization management or for people's everyday life.	information quality;information systems success model;quantum channel;systems design	Ming-Hsiung Hsiao;Tran Quang Mai;Nguyen Thi My Loc;Yung-Ting Lee	2015		10.1145/2781562.2781568	public relations;engineering;knowledge management;marketing	HCI	-86.61519591160302	-28.338798974052924	16414

Measuring performance is a necessary management practice if action is to result in desired outcomes. An important objective of the Iranian private sector was to focus the attention of private servants on clear specified results rather than bureaucratic procedures. The development of performance management to date appears inadequate in that the most important component of results-outcomes is overlooked from the measurement. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire with 100 respondents from 20 randomly selected private sectors in different environment. The findings showed the necessity of implementation of strategic planning in private sector concerning the use of appropriate performance management tools and strengthening the implementation of strategic planning functions in order to improve management performance. These findings suggest that specific management function-focused process should be designed and implemented.

Using a course assignment on software architecture styles, students had study a problem, find basis for a tentative approach, and discuss it online with programmers. The expectation was that students would find motivation for their studies from both the contact with communities of programmers, and from having to study and reflect upon their problem well enough to be able to draw the interest of members of those communities. We present the strategy we used, the developments and outcomes, and ideas for further application of this approach.	online community;programmer;programming paradigm;social network;software architecture;software engineering;virtual world;web 2.0	Leonel Morgado;Benjamim Fonseca;Paulo Martins;Hugo Paredes;Gonçalo Cruz;Ana Margarida Maia;Ricardo Nunes;Arnaldo Santos	2012	Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2012.6201129	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	SE	-81.44144693372212	-39.971969380700365	16474

Evidence on these points is presented based on a role playing experiment conducted with 128 software practitioners. Results show that a risk checklist helps software practitioners identify more risks than they would identify without the aid of a checklist. However, the role assigned to subjects did not seem to affect either their risk perception or behavior. The number of risks identified did not affect decision-making, but the use of a risk checklist appeared to shape subjects perceptions of which risks were salient in the scenario. Interestingly, subjects using a checklist were able to identify more seeded risks in the scenario, but they also identified more unseeded risks. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Since most support requests are for problems that a user is encountering, immediate response is essential. Immediate response should be more than just a simple acknowledgment of the receipt of a problem. (Users can easily identify generic electronic or human responses and will eventually become frustrated by this approach.) A proper response should include remedies a user can take to fix the situation. If none are available, then a user should be informed. Since there will not always be someone who can immediately answer a specific question, the user should be routed to the most capable person in the staff to respond to their concern. The human factor shouldn’t be dismissed. It’s imperative that a user always have a personal avenue to resolve their problem. Requirements Of A New System It is paramount for a system to take the user’s need into account since this will be the user’s primary interaction with the support staff. A responsive system will leave the user with a positive overall perception of the support staff. An unresponsive system can lead to widespread feelings of While immediate and personalized responses would suggest an added burden on the staff, a properly designed system will also take the support personnel into consideration and be designed to make their job easier as well. The system should function primarily on it’s own without much human intervention for much of the “busy work”. A system should also avoid redundancy of effort.

To this extent, extensive literature review on business models in the context of open data was performed. Interestingly, scholarly efforts providing practical elaborations and rigorous analysis of open data business models are omitted. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on open data business models are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of open data business models which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. Therefore, this thesis will address issues related to open data business models. This paper focuses on the background and results of my research to date.

966320028a68a5dd3d044f2bf1b40239aa2fcf58	understanding topic models in context: a mixed-methods approach to the meaningful analysis of large document collections		In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of large document collections. This development has spawned the need for appropriate analytical means. In particular, to seize the thematic composition of large document collections, researchers increasingly draw on quantitative topic models. Among their most prominent representatives is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Yet, these models have significant drawbacks, e.g. the generated topics lack context and thus meaningfulness. Prior research has rarely addressed this limitation through the lens of mixed-methods research. We position our paper towards this gap by proposing a structured mixedmethods approach to the meaningful analysis of large document collections. Particularly, we draw on qualitative coding and quantitative hierarchical clustering to validate and enhance topic models through re-contextualization. To illustrate the proposed approach, we conduct a case study of the thematic composition of the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals.	cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;latent dirichlet allocation	Matthias Eickhoff;Runhild Wieneke	2018			topic model;management science;computer science	Web+IR	-78.48162009721011	-16.962746807809317	16595
ffcea80018ab362bde4a2b3ee2fc35a1dc813ec2	the google book search settlement		Is the Google Book Search Settlement1 (which has received the preliminary approval of the US courts) the start of a new era of access, or the start of monopolistic domination by Google? The answer depends, of course, on the lens through which you are looking. One of the largest potential benefits is the possibility of providing more access to so-called orphan works – those works still under copyright but whose copyright owner cannot be traced. Through the Google Library Project, some 7 million books from 22 libraries have so far been digitized (those which Google determined to be still in copyright were made available only in ‘snippet’ views). One million of these were digitized under agreements with publishers under the Google Partners Program, and a further 1 million were in the public domain. However, many of the remaining 5 million are out of print but not out of copyright (in fact, Google estimates that 70% of all published books fall into this category); the legality of the digitization of these titles was hotly disputed by publishers and authors (in fact, the European library participants only digitized books they determined to be out of copyright). This settlement at least gives Google permission to include these works in its program. On the other side, the legal principle of whether orphan works (let alone non-orphan, out-of-print works) can be digitized without explicit permission has not been answered. To do that would have taken years of legal wrangling, and delayed access. It seems to be a good compromise to take this first step now, rather than wait. The agreement is non-exclusive, so there is nothing in theory to prevent similar arrangements being reached with other organizations; but do they really have the muscle (and the access to library collections) to do so? Note that Microsoft is winding down its Live Book Search;2 one has to wonder, too, about the future of the Open Content Alliance.3 As before, publishers (or other copyright owners) will be able to opt out if they do not want their out-ofprint books digitized. Google will now be able to provide not just snippet results, but entire pages for viewing and printing (free of charge for US users) – up to 20% of the content, depending on the type of book, in the absence of a publisher agreement. Books in copyright and currently in print, on the other hand, now fall into an opt-in process. While they will still be included in Google Book Search unless the rightsholder requests otherwise, only bibliographic details will be displayed in the absence of an explicit agreement with the publisher. The full text of books, both in and out of print, can be purchased by users – the publisher has the right to set the price (Google will do so otherwise), and Google will pay retrospective cash payments and future royalties to copyright owners who register their interest. There is also the hope that the newly formed Book Rights Registry (BRR),4 which Google is helping to fund, will become an important player by helping to locate rightsholders and making it easy for them to include or exclude the content they own from the project. If publishers work with Google in the Partners Program, they can benefit from the extra search-driven traffic (searchers are directed to the publisher’s or booksellers’ sites to purchase the print book) with very little investment, thus opening up the market for their in-print books. It is important to remember that over 50% of the traffic in Google Book Search is coming from outside the US, particularly from areas such as South America which have been notoriously difficult for publishers to serve.5 Google has invested heavily in making the interface to Google Book Search appear in multiple languages. Free online access, within limits, is allowed within certain types of libraries. But will this part of the settlement be enough, in the long run, to enable public access, particularly access by parts of the population that have less ability to purchase 82 Editorial	dominating set;google book search settlement agreement;google search;library (computing);million book project;open content;printing;the european library	Janet Fisher	2009	Learned Publishing	10.1087/2009201	archaeology;advertising;world wide web	Theory	-66.58487521982593	-20.070291758674404	16619

However, there are still only a handful of institutions that offer specialized education in BPM in a systematic and in-depth manner. This article is based on a global educators' panel discussion held at the 2009 European Conference on Information Systems in Verona, Italy. The article presents the BPM programs of five universities from Australia, Europe, Africa, and North America, describing the BPM content covered, program and course structures, and challenges and lessons learned. The article also provides a comparative content analysis of BPM education programs illustrating a heterogeneous view of BPM. The examples presented demonstrate how different courses and programs can be developed to meet the educational goals of a university department, program, or school. This article contributes insights on how best to continuously sustain and reshape BPM education to ensure it remains dynamic, responsive, and sustainable in light of the evolving and ever-changing marketplace demands for BPM expertise.

Therefore, the ultimate goal is development of the intelligent tutoring system that provides learning materials considering the requirements and understanding capability of the specific learner. In our previous research, we implemented a tutoring system named Protus 2.1 (PROgramming TUtoring System) that is used for learning basic concepts of Java programming language. It directs the learner's activities and recommends relevant actions during the learning process based on the personal profile of each learner. This paper presents the implementation of collaborative tagging technique for content recommendation in Protus 2.1. This technique can be applied in intelligent tutoring systems for providing tag-enabled recommendations of concepts and resources.

Research in social psychology has demonstrated that the act of self-regulation during one task can lead to impaired performance on a subsequent, unrelated task, because individuals have limited cognitive resources. In situation where companies are trying to limit the effect of interruptions due to persistent conversation by establishing workplace policies and regulations, the employees’ performance might be thus adversely affected. This state of fatigue which results from the depletion of cognitive resources is termed ego depletion. The current study analyzes the effects of self-regulating behavior and motivation on task performance in a simulated organizational setting. Consistent with the findings in social psychological research, the results of this experiment support an adverse effect of self-regulating behavior on task performance. Although the directions of the means suggest a moderating role of motivation, no statistical support was found. However, ego-depleted participants in the high-motivation condition did not display weaker performance than participants in the nondepleted conditions. The implications of these results on organizational computer use policy and future research are discussed.	depletion region;homeostasis;race condition	Christoph Schneider;D.

An understanding of the continuance intention to use such services can provide insights into failed mobile marketing campaigns, and help to improve the implementation of future ones. Therefore, it is important to examine the underlying drivers of loyalty with regard to mobile advertising. This study uses the expectation–confirmation model in conjunction with the perspectives of value and trust to derive an integrated model to better understand the motivations behind consumers’ continued use of mobile advertising. We conducted an empirical study consisting of an online survey of 508 consumers who had experience with mobile advertising.

The project sought, over a 2 year period, to make available online a significant portion of the university’s research output for the years 2000-5. It was envisaged that improved accessibility to journal articles and conference papers would assist in enhancing the research reputation of the university. This paper outlines why Digital Commons, re-branded as Research Online (ro.uow.edu.au), was chosen rather than an open source software solution. Issues arising from the utilisation of an outsourced, off-campus institutional repository system are discussed. This case study focuses on the University of Wollongong’s experience in regards to planning and implementation.

To date, there is a lack of adequate knowledge in terms of civic participation and empowerment that are related to ICT programs evaluations. This paper proposes a conceptual model for evaluating psychological empowerment of telecentres users based on review of literature. The Zimmerman’s constructs of empowerment theory that include intrapersonal, interactional and behavioural components form the basis of the model.

Because those who suffer the most are often the most marginalized, these communities are largely neglected by governments and national media. In rich countries, social media has enabled ordinary citizens to add their voices to the public discourse. In the Global South, access to Internet and social media technologies is extremely constrained. In this paper, we study how, despite these barriers, communities in Bangladesh that are chronically affected by riverbank erosion are managing to use Facebook to participate in """"hashtag activism.""""

One promising but largely unexplored approach is to use social proof: by showing people that their friends use security features, they may be more inclined to explore those features, too. To explore the efficacy of this approach, we showed 50,000 people who use Facebook one of 8 security announcements'7 variations of social proof and 1 non-social control-to increase the exploration and adoption of three security features: Login Notifications, Login Approvals, and Trusted Contacts. Our results indicated that simply showing people the number of their friends that used security features was most effective, and drove 37% more viewers to explore the promoted security features compared to the non-social announcement (thus, raising awareness). In turn, as social announcements drove more people to explore security features, more people who saw social announcements adopted those features, too. However, among those who explored the promoted features, there was no difference in the adoption rate of those who viewed a social versus a non-social announcement. In a follow up survey, we confirmed that the social announcements raised viewer's awareness of available security features.	computer security;login;social proof	Sauvik Das;Adam D. I. Kramer;Laura A.

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate measurement scales for personalization by identifying four distinctive personalization archetypes and hypothesizing their respective relationships with different cognitive and affective outcomes. This effort was successful in several respects. New scales for measuring personalization strategies were developed based on the definitions of personalization archetypes (architectural, instrumental, social and commercial), which were in turn derived from an extensive review of multidisciplinary studies. A lab experiment with 229 student subjects was conducted to explore the structure of the personalization construct and to validate the instrument using four Web site stimuli representing four types of personalization strategies. The new measures were found to have strong psychometric properties and exhibit significant linkages with respective cognitive and affective outcomes as theoretically postulated.	personalization	Haiyan Fan;Liqiong Deng	2008	IJTHI	10.4018/jthi.2008100101	knowledge management;marketing;personalization;law;world wide web	HCI	-86.43950700248426	-2.2340483341973956	16727

We showed that an ITS teaching a domain-independent problem-solving strategy indeed closed the gap between High and Low learners, not only in the domain where it was taught (probability) but also in a second domain where it was not taught (physics). The strategy includes two main components: one is solving problems via BackwardChaining (BC) from goals to givens, named the BC-strategy, and the other is drawing students’ attention on the characteristics of each individual domain principle, named the principle-emphasis skill. Evidence suggests that the Low learners transferred the principle-emphasis skill to physics while the High learners seemingly already had such skill and thus mainly transferred the other skill, the BC-strategy. Surprisingly, the former learned just as effectively as the latter in physics. We concluded that the effective element of the taught strategy seemed not to be the BC-Strategy, but the principle-emphasis skill.	cognition;deductive database;problem solving;aptitude	Min Chi;Kurt VanLehn	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69132-7_63	cognitive skill;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pedagogy	AI	-73.81249106524365	-46.317216682158424	16768
2bac53209be9f545a4df1e38b902be458361d575	comparison between user affinity with digital libraries and virtual communities		There is ongoing discussion about the value and reliability of information produced by experts and organized by digital libraries in universities versus information produced by the crowd in virtual communities. This study compares users’ perceptions of digital libraries and virtual communities in terms of affi nity. In this study, affi nity with digital libraries or virtual communities is defi ned as the degree of importance that users place on digital libraries or virtual communities. Data collected from 334 users of digital libraries and virtual communities were used for data analysis. The statistical method of ‘compare means’ is employed. We fi nd the mean of affi nity with digital libraries is signifi cantly larger than that of virtual communities, suggesting users are likely to perceive higher levels of affi nity with digital libraries than with virtual communities. More analysis oriented to different groups is also conducted. The fi ndings and their implications are discussed. Introduction A digital library is a distributed system that has the capability to store various electronic resources, which can be easily and conveniently accessed by remote end-users via networks.1 As the logical extension of physical libraries in the modern information society, a digital library is a ‘collection of information that has associated services delivered to user communities using a variety of technologies’.2 During the last 30 years, digital libraries have gone from a curiosity to mainstream.3 In China, digital libraries in universities have achieved substantial development since the Ministry of Education (MOE) initiated the China Academic Library and Information System (CALIS) in 1998. CALIS provides the ultimate support for information users through its four national information centers, namely the Science, Social Science and Humanities Information Center, the Engineering and Technology Information Center, the Medical Information Center, and the Agricultural Information Center. Its principal aim is ‘to introduce and produce various databases’.4 All academic libraries and other social information service organizations in China can apply to join CALIS and enjoy all the services CALIS provides, such as dissertation database building, imported resource consortia acquisitions, online cataloguing, interlibrary loan (ILL), and document delivery (DD)5. CALIS now has more than 1,000 member libraries.6 Given the insuffi cient funding of libraries, ILL and DD services have received much attention. The CALIS ILL/DD service network was created in June 2004. With this service network, about 60 large academic libraries can provide lending services to other member libraries.7 Virtual communities are considered to be ‘online social networks in which people with common interests, goals, or practices interact to share information and knowledge, and engage in social interactions’.8 Virtual communities provide informal yet useful platforms © Yalan Yan and Xianjin Zha 2014 Yalan Yan	charles f. van loan;digital library;distributed computing;information system;library (computing);moe;processor affinity;social network;stagefright (bug);virtual community	Yalan Yan;Xianjin Zha	2014	Learned Publishing	10.1087/20140207	public relations;computer science;multimedia;digital library	HPC	-80.78170374892463	-22.110272827121246	16802

Using cross-lagged structural equation modeling in a longitudinal and representative sample from Germany, we found that SNS communication increased both FtF and IM communication 6 months later. Likewise, IM communication at T1 increased SNS communication at T2. FtF, SNS, and IM communication did not affect loneliness, and FtF and IM communication did not change life satisfaction. However, communication on SNSs slightly increased life satisfaction. Thus, the data indicated that conversing via SNSs and IM has a mainly reinforcing effect and that communicating via SNSs can enhance life satisfaction several months later.	displacement mapping	Tobias Dienlin;Philipp K.

Employers are looking for students that not only have conceptual knowledge but also hands-on practical experience when hiring graduates into telecomm and networking related positions. This chapter will discuss how a telecommunications and networking bachelor's degree option was established at Purdue University. The chapter will discuss why the program started and discuss how it has evolved. Other areas discussed include: the curriculum, facilities, faculty, and the industrial advisory board. The paper will conclude with where the program is going to grow. As the personal computer emerged companies started networking their computers together. As technology advanced and companies started developing local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) the need for skilled professionals in these areas increased. At the same time, many students going through the information systems curriculum at Purdue University wanted more courses in this area and they also wanted hands-on practical experience.	distributed computing;hands-on computing;information system;personal computer	Julie R.

Mandatory participation in collaborative learning was the primary examination that had to be passed in order to qualify for the secondary examination, the authoring of a short essay. The evaluations show that mandatory participation as examination (MPE) is a viable format of examination for ALN based learning. The main strength of this format of examination is that it promotes active participation, which is a main ingredient in the desired learning process. Surprisingly in practice, ALN based learning with MPE was not considered beneficial for learning by the students. This is explained by the problematic shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered education and the traditional view of examination as separated from learning.

The focus of the study was on Carpe Diem as a process to enable academic course teams to seize 2 days to design and embed pedagogically appropriate e-tivities into their courses. The study also addressed the use of technology in the design of e-tivities and the level of tutor and learner engagement with them during course delivery. Six academic course teams representing three disciplines at four British universities took part in this 12-month study. Cognitive mapping was the main research methodology used. The results suggested that Carpe Diem is an effective and powerful team-based process to foster pedagogical change and innovation in learning design and assessment practices. The e-tivities designed during Carpe Diem were successfully used primarily for learning and formative assessment, and exceptionally for summative assessment. Web 2.0 tools, especially wikis, were employed to enable collaborative online learning and were prominent in the new designs. The tutors’ e-moderation skills were key to engage learners and thus capitalise on the benefits of e-tivities. Introduction and focus E-tivities are defined as ‘frameworks for enhancing active and participative online learning by individuals or groups’ (Salmon, 2002, p. 3). They can be used in a wide range of face-to-face, online and blended learning settings across disciplines and may be designed to make use of many learning technologies. E-tivities are low-cost, reusable, customisable and scalable. British Journal of Educational Technology (2009) doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.01013.x © 2009 The Authors.

Carpe Diem (Armellini & Jones, 2008; Salmon, Jones & Armellini, 2008) is a wellresearched, team-based intervention to promote innovation in learning design and assessment practices by academic course teams. The intervention includes a 2-day workshop in which teams design online learning activities (e-tivities) for effective and collaborative learning within their online, blended and face-to-face courses. This paper reports on the findings of the ADDER (Assessment and Disciplines: Developing E-tivities Research, www.le.ac.uk/beyonddistance/adder) project. As part of the project, academic course teams took part in Carpe Diem interventions to design and embed e-tivities in their courses for learning and assessment purposes. ADDER was funded by the UK Higher Education Academy and led by the Beyond Distance Research Alliance at the University of Leicester. The project compared and contrasted assessment practices that make use of e-tivities in three disciplines (media studies, psychology and inter-professional education, a discipline that aims to enable multiple health professionals to work together effectively) at four universities (De Montfort, Derby, Northampton and London South Bank) between October 2007 and September 2008. We report on the outcomes of this research, in which we: • Evaluate the effectiveness of the Carpe Diem intervention in terms of innovation into practice and change towards learner-centred, task-based learning design and assessment in the three disciplines at the four participating universities over 12 months. • Characterise the e-tivities produced by academic course teams during Carpe Diem and establish whether and how these e-tivities link to formative and summative assessment. • Identify tutors’ learning technology choices and their rationale for its use in e-tivity design. • Identify the factors influencing tutor and learner engagement with e-tivities during course delivery. • Explain how Carpe Diem helped academic course teams shift from practices based on the use of technology for delivery of course content to the development and management of tasks for collaborative knowledge construction and assessment. Learning design and assessment Learning design has been defined as ‘an application of a pedagogical model for a specific learning objective, target group and a specific context or knowledge’ (Conole & Oliver, 2006, p. 5). Recent literature on learning design points to the diverse challenges faced by academics in terms of pedagogy, technology and learning context (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007; Conole, Dyke, Oliver & Seale, 2004; Conole & Fill, 2005; San Diego et al, 2008). Many academics default to traditional practices, resulting in innovation in learning design hardly ever becoming a priority for them. Consequently, tutors often have limited awareness of what constitutes good practice in participative learning design and which learning technologies can be deployed in its implementation. Given the varied demands on their time and growing academic, administrative and pastoral responsibilities, lecturers need and welcome guidance on learning design leading to 2 British Journal of Educational Technology © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Becta. pedagogical innovation (San Diego et al, 2008). This guidance has the potential to make their teaching more effective, engaging and rewarding. Assessment is central to learning and therefore key to learning design. The curriculum is defined by assessment (Ramsden, 1992), which shapes the student experience (Brown & Knight, 1994). Assessment ‘orients all aspects of learning behaviour’ (Gibbs, 2006, p. 23). Formative assessment can improve student learning and raise academic standards (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Yorke, 2003). Formative assessment practices empower students to develop skills to monitor, judge and manage their learning (Nicol, 2007). Students possess, according to Nicol, self-assessment and selfregulation skills. Effective formative assessment depends on students developing these skills (Nicol & Macfarlane-Dick, 2006). Tutors may build on this capacity rather than solely provide expert feedback themselves (Nicol, 2006). Learners are more likely to benefit from feedback that is timely, relevant and appropriate in terms of its content and how it is offered. These are crucial attributes of feedback, as they shape the ways in which learners engage with it. The quality of feedback has been found to be less important than the quality of learners’ engagement with the feedback (Gibbs; Nicol & Macfarlane-Dick). Armellini, Jones and Salmon (2007) found that assessment shapes the design of e-tivities and identified links between e-tivity design and assessment. This paper reports on the process of change in learning design and assessment implemented by course teams as a result of the introduction of e-tivities, the types of e-tivities produced by course teams and the technologies used, and the engagement of tutors and learners with those e-tivities during delivery. Carpe Diem Carpe Diem promotes and supports change in learning design and assessment, builds institutional capacity and fosters scalable pedagogical innovation (Armellini & Jones, 2008; Salmon et al, 2008). At the heart of this intervention is a 2-day workshop in which course teams, in collaboration with subject librarians and learning technologists, design e-tivities for effective e-learning and assessment within their online and face-to-face courses. The workshop is structured around six stages. On the first day, the team produces a blueprint (Stage 1) and storyboard for the course (Stage 2), identifying the purpose and main features of the e-tivities they will design. On the second day, participants build prototypes (Stage 3) and turn them into fully functional e-tivities (Stage 4) that they upload to their institutional virtual learning environment (VLE). A ‘reality checker’ (a student or staff member external to the Carpe Diem process) reviews the e-tivities and provides feedback from the user’s perspective. The team uses this feedback to adjust and improve the e-tivities (Stage 5). A clear action plan, including the next steps in the design of the course(s), is then agreed upon (Stage 6). Learning design and assessment with e-tivities 3 © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Becta. At the end of the workshop, teams have a series of ‘reality-checked’ e-tivities running on their VLE, a storyboard showing the purpose and location of those e-tivities within the course design, and an action plan for further development. The workshop is preceded by an initial contact meeting between the facilitator and the course team for preparation and motivation, and is followed up by a meeting designed to plan for the embedding of the changes into the course (Figure 1). Carpe Diem differs from traditional staff development approaches in so far as it focuses on the learning design needs specific to an academic course team taking responsibility for a programme of study. Its outputs can be used by the course team immediately and can inform the development of other course components. Carpe Diem is not a ‘how to use my VLE’ workshop. While participants become more skilled in the use of a range of VLE features, they do so in the process of addressing a pedagogical design challenge that the technology may help them resolve. Learning technologists and subject librarians provide additional input and support during the intervention. In the ADDER project, the Carpe Diem intervention was used to enable disciplinespecific course teams to design and incorporate e-tivities into their courses, in a pedagogically sound way, for collaborative learning and assessment. Based on Salmon’s e-tivity framework (Salmon, 2002), a template was used in Carpe Diem workshops to Initial contact meeting with departmental course team Course team Follow-up meeting with course team All participants should have access to their institutional VLE.

Machine learning methods were applied to all public mentions of bullying on Twitter between September 1, 2011 and August 31, 2013 to extract the posts that referred to discrete bullying episodes (N = 9,764,583) to address five key questions. Most posts were authored by victims and reporters and referred to general forms of bullying. Posts frequently reflected self-disclosure about personal involvement in bullying. The number of posts that originated from a state was positively associated with the state population size; the timing of the posts reveal that more posts were made on weekdays than on Saturdays and more posts were made during the evening compared to daytime hours.

5642df06ae0618a79475731d7556b678756d7be6	augmented reality in ict for minimum knowledge loss		Informatics world digitizes the human beings, with the contribution made by all the industrial people. In the recent survey it is proved that people are not accustomed or they are not able to access the electronic devices to its extreme usage. Also people are more dependent to the technologies and their day-to-day activities are ruled by the same. In this paper we discuss on one of the advanced technology which will soon rule the world and make the people are more creative and at the same time hassle-free. This concept is introduced as 6 sense technology by an IIT, Mumbai student who is presently Ph.D., scholar in MIT, USA. Similar to this research there is one more research going on under the title Augmented Reality. This research makes a new association with the real world to digital world and allows us to share and manipulate the information directly with our mental thoughts. A college which implements state of the art technology for teaching and learning, Higher College of Technology, Muscat, (HCT) tries to identify the opportunities and limitations of implementing this augmented reality for teaching and learning. The research team of HCT, here, tries to give two scenarios in which augmented reality can fit in. Since this research is in the conceptual level we are trying to illustrate the history of this technology and how it can be adopted in the teaching	augmented reality;informatics;integrated information theory;windows hardware certification kit	Ramkumar Lakshminarayanan;R.

One of these rules is the availability in a single field of the institutional affiliations of all the authors of a paper. In practice this rule has been replaced by another, resulting from the inclusion of a new option, whereby records can be retrieved by the author’s reprint address (Reprint Address field). The outcome is diversity in the information on affiliation that may generate some degree of uncertainty in connection with institutional attribution when discrepancies arise between the information contained in the two fields, mainly when the only option available is the reprint address. The present study found a high degree of uncertainty, however, essentially for the period prior to Web of Science, in particular for scientific evaluation in peripheral countries such as Spain.	bibliographic database;peripheral;web of science;world wide web	Carlos García-Zorita;Carmen Martín-Moreno;María Luisa Lascurain-Sánchez;Elías Sanz-Casado	2006	J.

1973e591fd1d60384eae14fd0eb5faf1dd6fe136	blockchain applications in government		In the past few years, researchers and practitioners have highlighted the potential of Blockchain (BC) and distributed ledger technology to revolutionize government processes. Blockchain technology enables distributed power and embedded security. As such, Blockchain is regarded as an innovative, general purpose technology, offering new ways of organization in many domains, including e-government for transactions and information exchange. However, due to its very characteristics of peer to peer information exchange, its distributed nature, the still developing technology, the involvement of new actors, roles, etc., the implementation of blockchain applications raise issues that need governance attention. BC initiatives have implications for citizen trust, privacy, inclusion and participation. Governmental organizations need a thorough understanding of the BC design principles, the possible applications in the domain of e-government and the exploration of governance mechanisms to deal with the limitations and challenges of the BC technology when used in a myriad of sectors, ranging from the financial and business sector to the social domains of healthcare and education. In this panel we explore the impact of block chain technology on all levels of government and create an awareness of effects or applications in society that raise governance issues.	bitcoin;e-government;embedded system;information exchange;markov chain;peer-to-peer;privacy	Lemuria Carter;Jolien Ubacht	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209329	knowledge management;peer-to-peer;business sector;information exchange;general purpose technology;government;computer science;ranging;blockchain;corporate governance	HCI	-76.81632307105026	-4.94605500020934	16939

This research analyses the potential for Egyptian craftswomen to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve their earnings. The research shows that while ICTs could be a useful tool for marketing and selling their products, there are various structural challenges to trade via micro-ICT outlets like websites to the international market. Though online sales of crafts are possible, the use of ICTs as a marketing outlet by the average craftswoman is not viable in todaypsilas Egypt. The findings show that in the case of handicraft trade the generic ldquoexport is bestrdquo attitude is not the solution. In fact, the global craft market is too competitive for the typical Egyptian craftswoman as they are generally not equipped to handle the global handicrafts business environment. If the purpose is to empower artisan women then it would be better to enhance the demands for Egyptian handicrafts among the average Egyptian and thus create a domestic market for these products.

The necessity to integrate social networks into library management occurred due to the presence of a large number of patrons on the Web. It also turned out that besides being a learning and resource centre, the essential concept of a modern library refers to its active participation in teaching. For the purpose of this study we have isolated the Central Library Facebook Page, as the most significant in social networking. This paper will review and analyze the reactions of users/patrons to the content offered by the Central Library FER and the interaction over a certain time period. In the long run, it is expected that the Facebook Page will allow a form of maintaining users/patrons database, close communication, development of interactive services, breaking the conventional stereotypes of libraries and librarians, in other words, opening the door to the “living-room library” concept.	faculty of electrical engineering and computing, university of zagreb;google+;librarian;library (computing);social network;web 2.0;world wide web	Jadranka Lisek;Dina Vrkic;Ivan Jelic	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 35th International Convention MIPRO		education;multimedia;law;world wide web;cyberpsychology	DB	-72.59657484670484	-29.159301492163884	16973
4e7ec7fd42cdc46b616653806332f0a65d546827	towards pii-based multiparty access control for photo sharing in online social networks	pii;multiparty;online social networks;access control;privacy	The privacy control models of current Online Social Networks (OSNs) are biased towards the content owners' policy settings. Additionally, those privacy policy settings are too coarse-grained to allow users to control access to individual portions of information that is related to them. Especially, in a shared photo in OSNs, there can exist multiple Personally Identifiable Information (PII) items belonging to a user appearing in the photo, which can compromise the privacy of the user if viewed by others. However, current OSNs do not provide users any means to control access to their individual PII items. As a result, there exists a gap between the level of control that current OSNs can provide to their users and the privacy expectations of the users. In this paper, we propose an approach to facilitate collaborative control of individual PII items for photo sharing over OSNs, where we shift our focus from entire photo level control to the control of individual PII items within shared photos. We formulate a PII-based multiparty access control model to fulfill the need for collaborative access control of PII items, along with a policy specification scheme and a policy enforcement mechanism. We also discuss a proof-of-concept prototype of our approach as part of an application in Facebook and provide system evaluation and usability study of our methodology.	access control;personally identifiable information;privacy policy;prototype;usability testing	Nishant Vishwamitra;Yifang Li;Kevin Wang;Hongxin Hu;Kelly Caine;Gail-Joon Ahn	2017		10.1145/3078861.3078875	access control;privacy policy;computer security;computer science;enforcement;internet privacy;usability;personally identifiable information;social network;compromise	Security	-90.13257317201402	-15.676869963514307	16982

At Duke’s website, copies of the book can be ordered and lengthy excerpts are presented. A detailed review and a different selection of excerpts of My Awakening are presented at the website of an organization opposed to Duke’s ideas: the AntiDefamation League, which markets software designed to block access to websites such as Duke’s. The major online bookstores sell My Awakening, posting reviews submitted by members of the public, most of whom give it and Duke’s politics the highest possible rating. Filtering software may recognize Duke’s website and block access to hateful rhetoric there, but similar rhetoric posted as online book reviews remains publicly available; rather than attempting to adapt filtering software to public forums such as online bookstores, information must be added at such sites enabling human visitors to detect hate speech.	architecture description language;artificial intelligence;blade runner;computer-mediated communication;content-control software;cyberspace;excitable medium;hypertext;independent computing architecture;information superhighway;intelligent user interface;internet;joyce;lotus 1-2-3;online book;online shopping;speech synthesis;the new york times;toys	Rosemarie L.

Crisis-related research is one such domain, typically requiring the reenactment of an extensive crisis scenario. To lessen the resource requirements and provide a more flexible setup geared towards testing, crisis scenarios can be reconstructed as virtual reality simulations. This paper outlines the development of an initial prototype of such a simulation following the design science method. The prototype is used to test if injecting an item that will be tested into the simulation affects the realism of the virtual reality crisis simulation. The realism was measured in a within-subject experiment and equivalence tests showed that injecting a representation of a simple app had no significant influence on the realism of the simulation.

1edbdb9546a2fd1e0c939497ee4633c196d45293	scamming the scammers: towards automatic detection of persuasion in advance fee frauds	scam baiting;advance fee fraud;mass marketing fraud;persuasion;cybercrime	Advance fee fraud is a significant component of online criminal activity. Fraudsters can often make off with significant sums, and victims will usually find themselves plagued by follow-up scams. Previous studies of how fraudsters persuade their victims have been limited to the initial solicitation emails sent to a broad population of email users. In this paper, we use the lens of scam-baiting – a vigilante activity whereby members of the public intentionally waste the time of fraudsters – to move beyond this first contact and examine the persuasive tactics employed by a fraudster once their victim has responded to a scam. We find linguistic patterns in scammer and baiter communications that suggest that the mode of persuasion used by scammers shifts over a conversation, and describe a corresponding stage model of scammer persuasion strategy. We design and evaluate a number of classifiers for identifying scam-baiting conversations amidst regular email, and for separating scammer from baiter messages based on their textual content, achieving high classification accuracy for both tasks. This forms a crucial basis for automated intervention, with a tool for identifying victims and a model for understanding how they are currently being exploited.	email;exploit (computer security);final fantasy tactics:;internet troll;list of code lyoko episodes;social engineering (security);star trek: first contact;vigilante	Matthew John Edwards;Claudia Peersman;Awais Rashid	2017		10.1145/3041021.3053889	world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-90.73445803940486	-20.458824251462776	17012

The results show that the DSASL can correct the studentspsila misconceptions and enhance their concept understandings. However, there are individual differences in studentspsila learning effects when learning with DSASL. Finally, the researchers analyze the transcripts of think-aloud and find that the learning process may influence the students' learning effects.	design of experiments;dynamic simulation;machine learning	Tzu-Chien Liu;Yi-Chun Lin;Kinshuk;Maiga Chang	2008	2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2008.302	dynamic simulation;cooperative learning;simulation;interview;design methods;human–computer interaction;computer science;machine learning;software testing;design of experiments;computational model;correlation;information system;statistics	Robotics	-74.59697333329835	-44.3898481429236	17034

The research model was assessed by structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that continuance intention of blog use was predicted collectively by user involvement, satisfaction and perceived enjoyment. Habit, however, exhibited no strong relationship with satisfaction and use intention. Users' satisfaction with blog use was predicted primarily by perceived enjoyment, followed by users' confirmation of expectation and user involvement. Perceived enjoyment was predicted by users' involvement and users' confirmation of expectation. Blogging time significantly moderates the effect of habit on perceived enjoyment, but not on satisfaction and continuance intention.

The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) is introduced as the theoretical base for the hypotheses. The principles of multimedia and coherence from the CTML are used to hypothesize about the effectiveness of graphics embedded in TMC environments. Comprehension and transfer are used as dependent measures. Three TMC interface treatments were considered (no graphic, irrelevant graphic, relevant graphic). Hierarchical ANCOVA comparing TMC treatments indicated no significant differences in comprehension; however, transfer scores for the TMC teams with context relevant graphics were significantly higher than the other TMC teams. Although adding graphics to the collaborative interface improves the level of understanding developed within a group, the graphics need to be context relevant to be effective. These findings support the coherence and multimedia principles and provide guidance for designers of TMC environments.

The people who organized and ran IFIP 68 worked very hard for no tangible return and with very little recognition. One is tempted to offer congratulations and to say """"well done."""" They deserve our thanks, and more, for the effort expended and for the results that they achieved. Yet, at the risk of being considered a boor, and perhaps as a demonstration of bad manners on my part, I wish to present a number of complaints, complaints that I know echo those of many other participants in this and other IFIP Congresses. Edinburgh is a wonderful city. They have perhaps the world's friendliest people and the world's best whisky. But one thing they do not have-they do not have adequate facilities for a conference of the size of IFIP 68. There was not a single adequate meeting hall assigned to the conference. Anyone who simply came on time to one of the popular sessions would find himself locked out. Parallel sessions were held in widely separated buildings. The conference headquarters was miles away from the lecture halls. Bus service, provided at what seemed a reasonable fee, was very inadequate. Hotel rooms were in very short supply, and some delegates were reported to be commuting from Glasgow. Prospective delegates from various parts of the world who had not preregistered but who showed up on the first day of the conference were not permitted to register on the basis that there was inadequate space, as well as inadequate copies of the proceedings. With the whole world to choose from, it would seem that the responsible IFIP committee could come up with a location at which the facilities for running an IFIP meeting would be adequate. With the whole world to choose from, the committee has scheduled the next IFIP Congress in 1971 in Ljubljana, Yugo-slavia. In the movie """"The Yellow Rolls Royce"""" in an episode that takes place in Yugoslavia a bit of conversation goes roughly as follows: HE: We are entering Ljubljana. You can let me off right here. SHE: Wait. Is there a good hotel in this town? HE: None that you would consider good. This episode took place in 1941. Perhaps things have changed since then.

They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” So begins the late Mark Weiser’s seminal article, “The Computer for the 21 Century,” published in the September 1991 issue of Scientific American. This oft-quoted piece would establish the vision and set the course for ubiquitous computing, a phrase Weiser coined three years earlier to describe a time when computers would be invisibly embedded in everyday objects. Since then, the effort to make technologies vanish into the background of our lives has been an ongoing endeavor involving a series of international initiatives and innovative programs and encompassing an array of multidisciplinary discoveries and advancements in smart environments. This month’s special section explores the progress in creating the disappearing computer. We are honored to have many of the influential leaders in this effort share their experiences here. Guest editors Norbert Streitz and Paddy Nixon (chair and co-chair, respectively, of The Disappearing Computer initiative) have orchestrated authors and projects from around the globe to present a variety of perspectives, reflections, and visions for building technologies that serve people in an unobtrusive way. They explain the goal of this section—and these ongoing programs—is to explore how daily life can be supported and enhanced through the use of interacting artifacts that form environments in which the computer as we have come to know it has no role. Or, as Weiser envisioned almost 15 years ago: “Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs.”	amiga reflections;artifact (software development);communications of the acm;computer;embedded system;interaction;smart environment;ubiquitous computing	Diane Crawford	2005	Commun.

The model is constructed through analysis and synthesis of models from academic literature, reports by industry professionals, and grounded through interviews with Australian-based industry experts. Models identified include, cost of identity fraud, identity and identity fraud risk management, identity fraud profiling, fraud risk management, accounting and auditing, corporate and internal fraud, computing abuse, and e-fraud prevention. The proposed framework's strengths include, robust stages within anticipatory, reactionary and remediation phases, and covers internal and external crimes, including traditional (offline) and electronic (online) crimes.

Although support costs would certainly increase if there were no standards, it is hard to demonstrate that current standards have significantly reduced the overall support burden. From the user’s perspective, hardware and sojtware are just a few of the links in a long chain of information entities/functions needed to do their job. Hardware/software standards increase the reliability of those particular links, but do not make the whole chain significantly stronger. Users feel the restrictions of the standards, but see little obvious and immediate benefit. Exceptions become the rule, and the institution loses most of the benefits of standardization. A typical response to this problem is to diminish the importance of standards. Standardization, however, is the single most power@ tool we can use to provide a high quality btformation environmentfor the campus. To fully exploit this potential the standardization scheme must address two critical concepts. The first is that no standard environment can meet all of the information needs of the users, We can, however, create a baseline environment that will meet 80% of the needs of 80% of the users. With good design and . architecture we can accommodate, or at least not disenfranchise, the remaining 20%. The secondfactor is that the standards must encompass the “whole-product, ” not just the hardware and sojtware. The majority of our users are not interested in microcomputers, word processors, or video projectors. Their jobs involve correspondence, grade management, and the delivery of instructional materials. ’ Only by orienting standards toward these end products, will the users see enough direct benefit to be willing to accept the limitations that any standard imposes. This presentation elaborates upon the basic problem, suggests a general solution, and then presents specific examples of whole-product standards.	baseline (configuration management);central processing unit;display resolution;entity;exception handling;information needs;microcomputer;movie projector;video projector	John W.

Taking the design science approach, we developed a Web-based knowledge mapping system (i.e., Nano Mapper) that provides interactive search and analysis on various scientific document sources in nanotechnology. We conducted multiple studies to evaluate Nano Mapper's search and analysis functionality respectively. The search functionality appears more effective than that of the benchmark systems. Subjects exhibit favorable satisfaction with the analysis functionality. Our study addresses several gaps in knowledge mapping for nanotechnology and illustrates desirability of using the design science approach to design, implement, and evaluate an advanced information system.	knowledge management	Yan Dang;Yulei Zhang;Paul Jen-Hwa Hu;Susan A.

Currently there are no standards for what constitutes an acceptably fast restoration. This paper introduces the use of data envelopment analysis to help evaluate post-hurricane restorations through comparison with the experiences of other companies in similar storms. The method accounts for the variable severity of the hurricane themselves, so that companies are not penalized for outages that are long only because the hurricane that caused them was particularly severe. The analysis is illustrated through an application comparing 19 recent post-hurricane restoration experiences across 9 different electric power companies in the United States. The method could be applied to other types of infrastructure systems and other extreme events as well.

61e7b841c664771fdb619d77a4a35b21cc32c08e	a curriculum of computational thinking as a central idea of information & media literacy		Using, processing and evaluating digitized information is relevant to every subject in primary and secondary school education. As this information is represented, modified and perceived through analog and digital media, competencies including critical reflection, knowledge, usage, and creation of information and media have been included in the German education system. Due to the highly inter- and transdisciplinary character of these skills, the development of a combined information and media literacy to teach the critical handling, reflection and design of information and (digital) media similar to a classical literacy concerning reading and writing skills. As this skill is fundamental for understanding the everyday digital environment, Computational Thinking poses a central idea of information and media literacy in order to understand how information of the real or fictional world are represented through digital media, how this digitized information is automaticly processed and displayed using media systems as well as how the resulting representations are interpreted. Information and media literacy adresses every subject and school type which is why it has to be integrated into future teacher education curricula. This paper shows the conception and implementation of an Information and Media Literacy certificate for student teachers with a focus on Computational Thinking. Based on recent studies, established curricula for Media Literacy, Computer Literacy and Digital Literacy as well as present Bavarian school curricula for Computer Science, we built the curriculum for the Computational Thinking part of the certificate upon fundamental ideas of Computer Science: Representation of Information, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Networks, Data Integrity and Data Security, Languages, and Physical Computing.	algorithm;computation;computational thinking;computer science;data integrity;data security;digital environment;digital media;physical computing;software engineering	Andreas Dengel;Ute Heuer	2018		10.1145/3265757.3265777	mathematics education;curriculum;media literacy;pedagogy;digital media;literacy;digital literacy;computer science;computational thinking;teacher education;computer literacy	AI	-73.1128035985548	-36.78978272631832	17300

The aim of this study is to understand the implications of news organizations’ adoption of social media sites through (1) an examination of the relationship between news organizations’ adoption of social media and their online readership and (2) a comparison of online traffic generated by social media sites with that generated by other online media institutions. Evidence suggests that newspapers’ adoption of social media is positively associated with an increase in their online readership, and this association increases in the size of the newspapers’ social media networks (e.g., number of Twitter followers). Evidence also suggests that the association between newspapers’ social media adoption and their online traffic may differ compared to the association between other online media institutions and the online traffic they generated. A descriptive analysis shows that the online traffic generated by social media sites is less concentrated than that generated by search engines or news aggregators; this can be explained by the fact that social media sites might be less susceptible to information cascades, compared to search engines or news aggregators.	social media	Sounman Hong	2012	Information Economics and Policy	10.1016/j.infoecopol.2012.01.004	public relations;media relations;online presence management;media;social media;social media optimization;economics;new media;news media;digital media;information economics;advertising;internet privacy;user-generated content;search engine;information cascade;online participation	NLP	-82.55622097218802	-16.12839900451197	17309

In order to address the problem, this article presents a systematic methodology for retrieving targeted information on a political issue from prominent online sources. Using news services for triangulation, the methodology enables qualitative analysis regarding the spread of political opinions on an issue across a relevant sample of linked social information on the internet. The resulting pattern informs not only about the structure and information flows across linked social information but also about sentiments and opinion adoption over time. A model of opinion formation is presented and used to apply the methodology.	blog;institute for operations research and the management sciences;internet;social network	Michael Kaschesky;Reinhard Riedl	2011	2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2011.456	public relations;politics;information flow;media;computer science;marketing;multimedia;internet privacy;law;world wide web;government	AI	-80.65506110999544	-17.130984400263454	17311

In this article, we will draw on the recent outcomes of cognitive sciences to offer a broader definition of presence, not related to technology only. Specifically, presence is described here as a core neuropsychological phenomenon whose goal is to produce a sense of agency and control: subjects are “present” if they are able to enact in an external world their intentions. This framework suggests that any environment, virtual or real, does not provide undifferentiated information, ready-made objects equal for everyone. It offers different opportunities and produces presence according to its ability in supporting the users and their intentions. The possible consequences of this approach for the development of presence-inducing virtual environments are also discussed.	cognitive science;enactive interfaces;enactivism;mental state;social presence theory;virtual reality	Giuseppe Riva	2009	Virtual Reality	10.1007/s10055-009-0121-6	teleoperation;simulation;cognition;bidding;computer science;virtual machine;artificial intelligence;space;virtual reality	HCI	-70.37857780750997	-50.23744055994023	17317

The aim is to build capacity using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In this paper a comprehensive synthesis of research into ICT in education is given with the aim to inform the WSIS planning and action by drawing together reviews of policy and research, with an emphasis on formal education in schools and universities. The synthesis provides a picture of a complex situation by considering four reasons to invest in ICT in education: economic competitiveness, ICT to increase educational attainment, ICT to increase access to education, and ICT as a catalyst for educational renewal. It clarifies the complex challenges for such reengineering, which will require sustained interdisciplinary and intercultural collaboration to support the diversity of our emerging knowledge societies. This synthesis is a work in progress. The authors invite feedback and additional references to reviews of research, especially to research findings for the many underrepresented populations of the world.	code refactoring;feedback;population	Klaus Brunnstein	2003		10.1007/0-387-23120-X_8	secure coding	HCI	-77.40808039618734	-7.599550958017474	17325

However, most of these theories focus on women’s under representation, and little attention has been paid to women who are attracted by technology. This communication describes an exploratory study carried out in an IT company located in France. We based our research on Hennion’s theory of taste as a practice, and we conducted nine semi-structured interviews with male and female IT professionals (IT architects, managers and consultants). Textual analysis and structural analysis have provided the following results: Most interviewees share an attraction for IT because of the ever-changing nature of IT and the diversity of their jobs. However, some differences were clearly expressed; male interviewees assume a hedonic posture, whereas women emphasized the empowerment they feel through mastering technology. Social recognition in the workplace appears to play a major role for women in pursuing a technical career.	bus mastering;job stream;poor posture;semiconductor industry;structural analysis;theory	Chantal Morley;Martina McDonnell;Martie Milon	2009			psychology;gender studies;communication;social psychology	HCI	-84.82861257438704	-0.7109538056610171	17335

Students who generate solutions to science and mathematics problems develop a procedural understanding of the fundamental theories of these disciplines. Students should be taught to use programming languages for these solutions for the same reasons they are taught the universal tools of arithmetic and algebra, and because only a computer provides the means to describe solutions in explicit, correct, and executable form. Programming should be integrated into all mathematics and science teaching from the earliest years. In precollege education, programming should be taught over a period of eight to ten years, rather than as a 6-12 week separate topic, and should be matched to the level of complexity of the science and mathematics content.	computer programming;executable;programming language;theory	Sylvia A.

In this paper, we propose to build the ontology of Internet behavior by projecting from psychological phenomena. The psychological phenomenon index was developed with top-down literature study. We conduct focus group study and build an online openended questionnaire to collect the comprehensive Internet behaviors as much as possible according to the psychological index. This study combines the qualitative and quantitative methods and sets the foundation for further study via the Web.

2e7611c6a963624846751bd10c71099e8756c5e6	towards a global infrastructure for digital cultural heritage		The development of global information infrastructure for digital cultural heritage is a key to ensuring the openness and accessibility of objects of such heritage on a global scale, increasing the economic, social and cultural impact of the created resources and services, and more efficiently addressing social priorities. Author shows that documentation systems play an important unifying role in the modern world of information infrastructure for digital cultural heritage. The diversity of information resources requires further study and classification, which is also necessary for more detailed documentation and cataloging of these resources. The development of systems for documenting information resources for digital cultural heritage on a global scale is continuing and has great potential in terms of systematizing data on information resources.

c2821d9174a46522bca958dcbc04b0529ef64e00	group storytelling for team awareness and entertainment	digital media repositories;digital storytelling;collaboration;virtual teams;awareness	This paper presents a novel concept to provide awareness of a virtual team's social activities and its self representation, based on a collaborative storytelling approach. Utilizing shared workspaces, team members can create, annotate, share, and discuss stories. A story consists of a sorted collection of annotated photos similar to comics. Users can rearrange stories manually or with the help of a storytelling algorithm that is based on drama arcs. We believe that this approach offers a compelling and entertaining way to provide team awareness and to support team coherence in virtual teams.	algorithm;workspace	Leonie Schäfer;Carla Valle;Wolfgang Prinz	2004		10.1145/1028014.1028090	awareness;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;multimedia;management;world wide web;collaboration	HCI	-64.43961514703311	-38.684888626448405	17523
f6e1ec1802959f1b62f87723f0823390a39961c0	differentiation of student perceptions for online courses, over time		This paper presents the main findings of a study exploring graduate student perceptions of online education, with a specific focus on their change over time, throughout an asynchronous web-based course. The study was conducted in the UK, and data collection methods included content analysis of online messages and interviews. Data analysis was based on systematically contrasting participant early- (at the beginning of the course) and late- (by the end of the course) course perceptions. Several inconsistencies were identified between early- and late- course perceptions, which were categorized according to three emerging themes: managerial, social and cognitive. The findings indi- cate negative perception change with respect to the managerial and social aspects, whereas positive change was evident in terms of the cognitive aspect. The implications drawn from the study are expected to inform and support the design and implementation of web-based courses.

fae192ccfb65aae20052a2656d60f05e9a884ee7	designing for student interactions: the role of embodied interactions in mediating collective inquiry in an immersive simulation		Advances in mobile and wireless technologies provide new possibilities for supporting K-12 learning activities that can be spatially distributed in the classroom, for example in jointly investigating a scientific phenomenon. Such technologies have an impact on the ways in which students engage with one another, and with the quality of their engagement with the activity itself. This paper uses an embodied approach to understand the patterns of interactions between students (e.g., student-to-student, student-to-teacher) and with computational media within the environment (e.g., student-to-device, student-to-large display), in relation to students' real-time meaning making as they engage in collective inquiry in an immersive simulation environment. The design-based research study consists of two iterations tested in an authentic school setting. We found that increased student-to-student interactions was accompanied by improved observational accuracy and higher quality student explanations constructed. The design implications of the research findings are discussed.	collective intelligence;computation;iteration;mixed reality;multimodal interaction;real-time locating system;simulation	Michelle Lui	2018		10.1145/3173574.3174027	multimedia;human–computer interaction;multimodality;meaning-making;immersion (virtual reality);embodied cognition;computer science;phenomenon	HCI	-70.08777947707244	-42.317681206613585	17597

However, successful implementation and diffusion of these systems innovations requires the cooperation and commitment of all participating member firms. A number of interorganizational as well as internal, organization-specific factors can influence both the extent to which EDI is diffused and used and the level of subsequent benefits that accrue to the firms.

72a9f04e78abc36c4a5fc2194cd5d4730dd6feed	building trust between users and telecommunications data driven virtual assistants		When we think about traditional technology services, such as the Internet and popular smartphone apps, interaction or experience related words tend to come to our mind. However, when we shift to more disruptive and breakthrough technologies, such as big data, IoT or Artificial Intelligence (AI), trust and security become a key challenge as the environments in which the personal information is stored and used to extract value changes in ways that are difficult to understand for normal users. This study explores the current challenges to trust and rely on a Virtual Assistant and establishes a series of constructs to build trust in a Telecoms Data Driven Virtual Assistant by considering aspects from an embryonic idea of the AI to its final articulation as a digital service. It examines a series of multi-methodology research interactions to help shape and refine the service, not only to build trust in the AI but also in the organisation behind it.

The in°uence is not only limited to political and social, but also relates to organisational and economical reputation and brands. Within public opinion, organisations must manage how they are represented competitively within mass media so that they can develop their brand strategically to grow and compete in the current global knowledge economy. This is where the link to Intellectual Capital (IC) Measurement is signi ̄cant. IC, as the sum of all an organisation's intangible assets drives a company's presence and value within the media, albeit related to human, structural or relational capital attributes. The measurement, therefore, of IC in the mass media context is invaluable to understand how a company is placed strategically and competitively in the external space, and how this links to internal activities, goals and outcomes. This paper is an attempt to address some of the issues related to IC measurements in the mass media context by suggesting a framework that provides a multidisciplinary and holistic approach to the understanding and contextualising of the organisation's presence in the public space.	holism;itil;knowledge management;mass effect trilogy;social media measurement	Jaco Pienaar	2012	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649212500293	public relations;media relations;individual capital;public opinion;economics;knowledge management;media system dependency theory;management;commerce;mass media	ML	-82.4897337719708	0.7360326531518261	17633

EDUCE is an Intelligent Tutoring System for which a set of learning resources has been developed using the principles of Multiple Intelligences. It can dynamically identify user learning characteristics and adaptively provide a customised learning material tailored to the learner. This paper introduces the predictive engine used within EDUCE. It describes the input representation model and the learning mechanism employed. The input representation model consists of input features that describe how different resources were used and inferred from fine-grained information collected during student computer interactions. The predictive engine employs the Naive Bayes classifier and operates online using no prior information. Using data from a previous experimental study, a comparison was made between the performance of the predictive engine and the actual behaviour of a group of students using the learning material without any guidance from EDUCE. Results indicate correlation between student's behaviour and the predictions made by EDUCE. These results suggest that the concept of learning characteristics can be modelled using a learning scheme with appropriately chosen attributes.

We investigate Danish users' perceptions on a set of attributes similar to those utilised in an empirical research conducted during 2001, in what we expect to constitute a more mature market for m-services. Our objective is twofold: to confirm or reject the impact of the set attributes on consumer behaviour, and to highlight differences, which are bound to market evolution, between 'basic' and 'advanced' users. The results provide indications of an evolutionary path of strategic importance for firms with a competitive stake in advanced m-service's use.		Ioanna D.

This study develops a sense of virtual community (SOVC) measure, building off the strengths of a widely used measure of sense of community (SOC) for face-to-face communities. Although there is overlap between the senses of community for face-to-face and virtual communities, there are significant differences. The new SOVC measure is compared to the SOC measure on 265 members of seven online groups, explaining at least 7% more of the variance from exchanging support and member identification. This study represents an important step in developing a valid measure of SOCV.	esthesia;sample variance;virtual community	Anita L.

Participants played a trivia game with a computer, which they knew generated random answers that were accompanied by either strictly factual or flattering feedback on their performance. Although both high and low rationals attributed greater social attractiveness to the flattering computer than the one providing generic feedback, only low rationals exhibited different levels of conformity to flattering than generic-comment computers, favoring the latter. Results on recall memory and perceived validity of the computer feedback suggest that flattery elicited greater attention and heightened suspicion among those less prone to engage in analytical thinking, temporarily fostering mindfulness.	computer;rationality	Eun-Ju Lee	2009	Int.

The purpose of the assignment was to raise students' awareness concerning conceptions that characterise eective pedagogical interactions, by collaboratively comparing and discussing their analyses of a dialogue between a tutor and a student. To examine whether the use of synchronous CMC could meet this end, students' dialogues are characterised in terms of their constructive and argumentative contributions, and by their focus on the meaning of concepts. In addition, a comparison was made with a control group in which no peer coach was available with two forms of peer coaching. Peer coaches were focussed either on structuring arguments or on re ̄ectively checking arguments in terms of strength and relevance. First, the results indicate that the study of students' learning from electronic discussions requires an analysis of focus in relation to argumentation. Second, the coaching instruction did not ful®l our expectations. In this study, students seem to need support to focus on meaning rather than on argumentation in general, but they may also need support to hold overview, to keep track of their discussion and to organise their interface. Text-based electronic communication seems to be sensitive to such issues that may cause meaningful interaction to be disturbed. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

886fda93996f7e9f86639615155029c17405b567	collaborative hybrid agent provision of learner needs using ontology based semantic technology		This paper describes the use of Intelligent Agents and Ontologies to implement knowledge navigation and learner choice when interacting with complex information locations. The paper is in two parts: the first looks at how Agent Based Semantic Technology can be used to give users a more personalised experience as an individual. The paper then looks to generalise this technology to allow users to work with agents in hybrid group scenarios. In the context of University Learners, the paper outlines how we employ an Ontology of Student Characteristics to personalise information retrieval specifically suited to an individual’s needs. Choice is not a simple “show me your hand and make me a match” but a deliberative artificial intelligence (AI) that uses an ontologically informed agent society to consider the weighted solution paths before choosing the appropriate best. The aim is to enrich the student experience and significantly re-route the student’s journey. The paper uses knowledge-level interoperation of agents to personalise the learning space of students and deliver to them the information and knowledge to suite them best. The aim is to personalise their learning in the presentation/format that is most appropriate for their needs. The paper then generalises this Semantic Technology Framework using shared vocabulary libraries that enable individuals to work in groups with other agents, which might be other people or actually be AIs. The task they undertake is a formal assessment but the interaction mode is one of informal collaboration. Pedagogically this addresses issues of ensuring fairness between students since we can ensure each has the same experience (as provided by the same set of Agents) as each other and an individual mark may be gained. This is achieved by forming a hybrid group of learner and AI Software Agents. Different agent architectures are discussed and a worked example presented. The work here thus aims at fulfilling the student’s needs both in the context of matching their needs but also in allowing them to work in an Agent Based Synthetic Group. This in turn opens us new areas of potential collaborative technology.

Although there are ways to minimize such events, fire drills are used to train the building occupants for emergency situations. However, organizing and implement these exercises is a complex task, and sometimes not sucessfull. Furthermore, fire drills require the mobilization of some finantial resources and time, and affect the normal functioning of the site where they occur. To overcome the aforementioned issues, computer games have a set of features that might overcome this problem. They offer engagement to their players, keeping them focused, and providing training to real life situations. The game evaluate users, providing them some feedback, making possible for the players to improve their performance. The proposed methodology aims to study the viability of using a game that recreates a fire drill in a 3D environment using Serious Games. The information acquired through the player’s performance is very valuable and will be later used to implement an artificial population. A sample of 20 subjects was selected to test the application. Preliminary results are promising, showing that the exercise had a positive impact on users. Moreover, the data acquired is of great important and will be later used to demonstrate the possibility of creating an artificial population based on human behaviour.	feedback;organizing (structure);pc game;real life	José Fernando M.

However, building this understanding into a computer-based intelligent tutor is a time-intensive process usually conducted by subject experts. Much of this time is spent in building production rules that model all the ways a student might solve a problem. In our prior work, we proposed a novel application of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to automatically generate hints for an intelligent tutor that learns. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by extracting MDPs from four semesters of student solutions in a logic proof tutor, and calculating the probability that we will be able to generate hints for students at any point in a given problem. Our past results indicated that extracted MDPs and our proposed hint-generating functions will be able to provide hints over 80% of the time. Our results also indicated that we can provide valuable tradeoffs between hint specificity and the amount of data used to create an MDP.	cold start;deep thought (chess computer);markov chain;markov decision process;problem solving environment;scalability;sensitivity and specificity	Tiffany Barnes;John C.

This policy arises in the nancial segment of the commercial sector, which provides consulting services to other companies. Consultants naturally have to deal with con dential company information for their clients. The objective of the Chinese Wall policy is to prevent information ows which cause con ict of interest for individual consultants. Brewer and Nash develop a mathematical model of the Chinese Wall policy, on the basis of which they claim that this policy \cannot be correctly represented by a Bell-LaPadula model."""" In this paper we demonstrate that the Brewer-Nash model is too restrictive to be employed in a practical system. This is due to their treatment of users and subjects as synonymous concepts, with the consequence that they do not distinguish security policy as applied to human users versus security policy as applied to computer subjects. By maintaining a careful distinction between users, principals and subjects, we show that the Chinese Wall policy is just another lattice-based information policy which can be easily represented within the Bell-LaPadula framework."""	bell–lapadula model;chinese wall;lattice model (physics);mathematical model;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;nash equilibrium;trojan horse (computing);trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Ravi S.

In this interpretive case study, we look at knowledge sharing not within an organization, but in the context of schoolteachers and students in Singapore secondary schools. Through interviews with teachers and students, we investigate the reasons behind the reluctance of teachers/students to share educational content outside the school through an e-learning digital repository, and ways to address these. It was found that very real human reasons of fear and trust stand in the way of knowledge sharing. An important contribution of this study is a set of impediments concerning schoolteachers (and students), and potential solutions to these impediments. Despite apparent difference in motivation/time-constraints between organizational employees and schoolteachers/students, the findings support Husted and Michailova’s model of organizational knowledge sharing hostility, and should be useful for application in similar e-learning knowledge-sharing initiatives.	digital library	Naresh Kumar Agarwal;Keat Houng Tan;Danny Chiang Choon Poo	2007			organizational learning;computer science;knowledge management;management	HCI	-74.5051921719604	-31.907787498298326	17909

This culture stresses the importance of knowledge and education, but it promotes only the instrumental knowledge that the present techno-economy directly needs. Such practice displaces other dimensions of the human knowledge and cognitive abilities, which are needed for the progress of people and humanity. Business forces are raising the means to the level of the end, and shape education in the way that serves business aim, rather than the promotion of knowledge. Information technology has brought many excellent means and services to education , but it should not be used in the way that reduces people to automatons that perform prescribed procedures, without understanding or asking anything beyond that.	automaton;cognition;http 303;mind;programming paradigm	Mario Radovan	2017	2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973501	knowledge management;humanity;computer science;management science;information technology;cognition	HCI	-73.15979350293945	-30.688288863299	17916

Building on studies of youth Internet search roles, this paper investigates adults' online information seeking processes within the home. Through in-home interviews and observations of search task performance with 40 adult participants, we identify and describe characteristics of 9 search roles. By comparing these roles with those of youths, we explain how previously identified roles, such as Power Searcher and Social Searcher, have evolved in adult populations, and how new roles, such as Efficient Searcher and Interest-driven Searcher, have emerged. We also review the challenges and benefits associated with search roles and their potential impacts on search performance. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of how contextual factors influence search roles in relation to ELIS, what can be learned from search roles, and opportunities to support different search roles.	information seeking;population	Jinyoung Kim;Brenna McNally;Leyla Norooz;Allison Druin	2017		10.1145/3025453.3025572	multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-84.622734484268	-21.893362289682138	17966

The way that IT organizations manage their IT professionals is essentially manifested in their implementation of human resource management (HRM) practices, such as those related to work environment and career development opportunities, social support, compensation, and employment security. This paper briefly introduces person-environment (P-E) fit theory to explore what an IT professional wants from an employment arrangement and what is supplied by the employer. However, a criticism of P-E fit theory is that it does not specify the form of the relationship between P-E fit and other constructs, such as satisfaction and job search. In order to address this gap, the paper investigates both equity theory and prospect theory as possible explanations. Ultimately, prospect theory is used to develop illustrative hypotheses. The paper then describes the methodology that will be used to test these hypotheses. The results of the tests, when completed, will be used to suggest directions for managing IT professionals and future IT HRM theory development and testing.	human race machine;social support	Thomas W.

Within the field of computer supported learning there are many attempts to acknowledge this. One approach involves the addition of virtual characters to electronic learning environments. Such character enhanced systems are the focus of the present article. Firstly, a systematic overview is given of pedagogical benefits that have been proposed in the literature regarding character enhancement of electronic learning environments, for example increased motivation, stimulation of particular learning activities, enhanced flow of communication and fulfillment of a need for deeper personal relationships in learning. Secondly, I examine the empirical results presented in the literature with respect to the proposed positive pedagogical effects. Based on these reviews, I finally discuss possible directions for continued research and design in the field from a pedagogical point of view. I propose a research agenda for the near future and conclude with some reflections on a longer-term perspective.	amiga reflections	Agneta Gulz	2004	I. J.

Usually, the experienced teacher is able to detect problematic situations at early stages. However, this is only true for classes up to a hundred students. For bigger ones, automatic methods are needed. In this paper, we present a predictive system based on three criteria retrieved and computed from the logs of the learning management system. We built fast frugal decision trees to help predict and prevent student failures, using data retrieved from their resource usage patterns. Evaluation of the decision system shows that the system's accuracy is very high both in train and test phases, surpassing logistic regression and CART.

BRIDGE promotes an innovative approach to answer the educational challenges in software engineering. It is comprised of three integrated subsystems: a code annotation system that provides an effective way to share the understanding of open- source code examples; a collaborative educational material creation system that helps build educational modules capable of connecting theories with real- world examples; and a collaborative course management system that allows educators to construct innovative courses based on the educational modules. BRIDGE encourages participation and collaborative knowledge sharing of software engineering professionals, educators, and students. BRIDGE is driven by this participation. The system will help students learn both technical knowledge and nontechnical skills highly desired in modern software engineering practices.	computer science;open-source software;software engineering;theory;web application	Hong Zhang;Hongjun Su	2007	31st Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC 2007)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2007.10	innovation management;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;social software engineering;software engineering;management;collaborative software;software system	SE	-83.00376911034533	-43.04589756921463	18040

This is puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar. Based on an exploratory case study of the country's e-government system that draws on group and social theories, I argue that the convergence of four factors associated with the policy environment, political leadership, emigrants and refugee returnees, and epistemic communities account for Rwanda's achievements. The primacy of interest group politics in the unfolding story of e-government diffusion in developing countries is underscored and potential areas for further research highlighted.	e-government;internet;primacy of mind;theory;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Wagaki Mwangi	2006		10.1145/1146598.1146658	development economics;political science;socioeconomics;economic growth	Web+IR	-77.83153244272624	-8.233411928103168	18062

39ca62c49da3b898d87d349caee497a3c20ef955	extending information quality assessment methodology: a new veracity/deception dimension and its measures		This paper extends information quality (IQ) assessment methodology by arguing that veracity/deception should be one of the components of intrinsic IQ dimensions. Since veracity/deception differs contextually from accuracy and other well-studied components of intrinsic IQ, the inclusion of veracity/deception in the set of IQ dimensions has its own contribution to the assessment and improvement of IQ. Recently developed software to detect deception in textual information represents the ready-to-use IQ assessment (IQA) instruments. The focus of the paper is on the specific IQ problem related to deceptive messages and affected information activities as well as IQA instruments (or tools) of detecting deception to improve IQ. In particular, the methodology of automated deception detection in written communication provides the basis for measuring veracity/deception dimension and demonstrates no overlap with other intrinsic IQ dimensions. Considering several known deception types (such as falsification, concealment and equivocation), we emphasize that the IQA deception tools are primarily suitable for falsification. Certain types of deception strategies cannot be spotted automatically with the existing IQA instruments based on underlying linguistic differences between truth-tellers and liars. We propose the potential avenues for the future development of the automated instruments to detect deception taking into account the theoretical, methodological and practical aspects and needs. Blending multidisciplinary research on Deception Detection with the one on IQ in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Management Information Systems (MIS), the paper contributes to IQA and its improvement by adding one more dimension, veracity/deception, to intrinsic IQ.

Outsourcing to vendors in foreign countries brings about unique challenges which need to be understood and managed effectively. This paper explores cultural differences in IS offshoring arrangements involving German client organizations that outsource application development activities to Indian vendors. For this purpose, a research framework is developed based on both theoretical considerations and specific empirical observations from multiple case studies. The goal is to (1) explore the nature of cultural differences in offshoring arrangements in depth and to (2) analyze the relationship between those cultural differences and offshoring success. Based on the case findings, implications and practices for the management of offshore development projects are outlined.	information system;outsourcing	Jessica K.

Based upon Hayekian ideas of the advantages of decentralised experimentation (as a discovery procedure), we analyse the long-term benefits of parallel experimentation in a federal system from an evolutionary economics perspective. We present a simulation model in which the lower-level jurisdictions in a federal system experiment with randomly chosen policy innovations and can imitate the relatively best solutions. The simulations confirm our hypotheses that a higher degree of decentralisation has positive effects on the long-term accumulation of knowledge of suitable policy solutions and also limits risks through better protection against erroneous policies. Also problems of policy learning and trade offs with (static and dynamic) advantages of centralisation are taken into account.		Nicole J. Saam;Wolfgang Kerber	2013	J.

While there are certainly profits to be captured in the economic exchange, the upstream information gathering and decision making activities offer some interesting opportunities for consumer support. Data warehousing offers the ability to implement consumer decision support systems that allow consumers to identify an interesting subset of fine-grained transactions, analyze the data, and produce customized reports. This paper uses an existing health care data warehouse to explore the use of detailed data in constructing consumer decision support systems. The health care arena is characterized by complex consumer decision making, such as the need to become educated with regard to a particular illness and the various treatment options. The example reports demonstrate how detailed knowledge regarding the health care delivery system, including hospitals and physicians, can supplement the clinical perspective of an informed consumer.	decision support system;e-commerce	Donald J.

The importance of this dynamic is its value in preparing students for the workplace. The supposition is if a group is homogeneous, commitment and performance is improved. Data for the study was collected from upper-level undergraduate male and female students, registered in two sixteen week business courses taught by one instructor, at a large university in a metropolitan city in the northeastern United States. There were five racially mixed groups of seven members in each of the four sections of the two courses. During this period, group members met frequently for class projects, including a series of case analyses. Only balanced heterogeneous groups significantly enhanced their groups’ performance on complicated problem-solving tasks over time. They exceeded the performance of all homogeneous groups, except that of the black American female homogeneous groups. Ultimately, the academic grades of the balanced heterogeneous groups as well as their individual members were in the upper half of all grades issued.

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of racial and gender diversity on group process (the effect of group actions/interactions over time on individual group members) and problem solving by: 1. Analyzing group performance on a series of difficult problem-solving tasks of significant importance to group members. 2. Utilizing a longitudinal design in which the communication within, and performance of homogeneous and heterogeneous groups were contrasted. It seems that if the group is homogeneous, commitment and performance is improved. The group members should engage more successfully in the task of discussing and then writing about the assigned projects than the members in a heterogeneous group. Diverse groups are those having gender, ethnic, and national differences among members; therefore, being called heterogeneous groups, whereas homogenous groups contain members from one gender, ethnic, or national group. This research attempts to answer the question: Over time, what consequence do a high level of racial and/or gender diversity have on group communication and group problem solving? REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE Graen, Hui, and Taylor (2006) contend that effective work relationships can be differentiated from ineffective ones. “Effective work relationships are referred to as having high-quality leadership-member exchanges, whereby, ineffective work relationships are referred to as having low-quality leader-member exchanges” (Graen, Hui, & Taylor, 2006, p. 450). In addition, “leader-member exchange (LMX) is the quality of relationship that emerges between leaders and their direct reports” (Graen, Hui, & Taylor, 2006, p. 450) however, this theory stands for only one of a number of forms of relationships in teams. Relationships in teams can also be formed outside of work. These are generally recognized as dyadic friendships. There exist several studies in the social network literature exalting the need for friendships at the team level (e.g., Krackhardt & Stern, 1988; Nelson, 1989; White, 1961). Moreover, dyadic friendship networks can be correlated to team communications and conflict (Krackhardt & Kilduff, 1990; Labianca, Brass, & Gray, 1998). In fact, there are studies indicating that friendship, predominantly of one’s leader, may be significant to organizational achievement (Moore, 1996). Fraternization among workers may also aid morale and provide individuals a motive for going to work. The fundamental belief is that friendship affords connection and interdependence, and that this friendship transforms the relationship between leader and follower from that of supervisor and subordinate to one of friend and friend (Parraault, 1991). Meanwhile, Festinger’s theory of social comparison has offered a useful social psychological framework for understanding peer effects (Festinger, 1954; Suls & Wheeler, 2000). Festinger argued that people assess their beliefs and skills through a comparison with other people and that they can make a much more viable assessment by comparing themselves with similar people. Many studies have shown that people compare themselves to their peers using other personal characteristics, such as income, appearance, and fitness, but the theory’s original emphasis on beliefs and skills is very important to a consideration of peer influences among college students (Suls & Miller, 1977; Suls & Wills, 1991; Wood, 1996). The common view is that American culture is diverse; however, sometimes this is at the same time at conflict with the actions and ideology regarding the American culture, which is one of homogeneity. This homogeneity was created from American European beginnings, which implies an attitude that Eurocentric culture is dominate over non-Eurocentric culture. 9 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/heterogeneous-homogeneousgroups/62982?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Library Science, Information Studies, and Education, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Educational Leadership, Administration, and Technologies eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Select.

They tend to propose interfaces which are not accessible for learners with vision or auditory disabilities. Modeling techniques are necessary to map real world experiences to virtual worlds by using 3D auditory representations of objects for blind people and visual representations for deaf people. In this paper we describe common aspects and differences in the process of modeling the real world for applications involving tests and evaluations of cognitive tasks with people with reduced visual or auditory cues. To validate our concepts, we examine two existing systems using them as examples: AudioDoom and Whisper. AudioDoom allows blind children to explore and interact with virtual worlds created with spatial sound. Whisper implements a workplace to help people with impaired auditory abilities to recognize speech errors. The new common model considers not only the representation of the real world as proposed by the system but also the modeling of the learner's knowledge about the virtual world. This can be used by the tutoring system to enable the learner to receive relevant feedback. Finally, we analyze the most important characteristics in developing systems by comparing and evaluating them and proposing some recommendations and guidelines.	virtual world	Nelson Baloian;Wolfram Luther;Jaime Sánchez	2002		10.1145/638249.638270	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;interactive media;educational software	HCI	-67.73244016539428	-45.00169169963349	18254

Most smokers want to quit, but many find quitting difficult. The Internet enables people interested in quitting smoking to connect with others via online communities; however, the characteristics of these discussions are not well understood. This work aims to explore the textual cues of an online community interested in quitting smoking: www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking --- \""""a place for redditors to motivate each other to quit smoking\"""". A total of approximately 5,000 posts were randomly selected from the community. Four subgroups of posts based on the cessation days of abstainers were defined: S0: within the first week, S1: within the first month excluding cohort S0, S2: from second month to one year, and S3: beyond one year. Psycho-linguistic features and content topics were extracted from the posts and analysed. Machine learning techniques were used to discriminate the online conversations in the first week S0 from the other subgroups. Topics and psycho-linguistic features were found to be highly valid predictors of the subgroups, possibly providing an important step in understanding social media and its use in studies of smoking and other addictions in online settings."""	online community	Thin Nguyen;Ron Borland;John Yearwood;Hua-Hie Yong;Svetha Venkatesh;Dinh Q.

We'd like to bring together two groups of web programming instructors: Newcomers who have not yet taught this material before (or are just starting) and want to soak up information, and veterans who have now taught it and have insights to share with the group. Newcomers can ask questions about materials, languages and technologies to use, what works and what doesn't, and so on. Veterans can share tips from the classroom and helpful resources.

Since today's information assurance (IA) students are tomorrow's security specialists, they must maintain an increased sensitivity to the protection of intellectual property. Do these future security specialists hold this knowledge, or does society simply assume that they do? Are today's IA programs successfully instilling this sensitivity? Hiring managers make certain assumptions about these security students that extend into the work force when designing and developing computer-based collaborative systems. Are these assumptions correct? The answers to these questions and more will be reported in the results of a research project on the student awareness of copyright laws among the IA students at a Midwestern university and will evaluate the effectiveness of current curriculum.	information assurance	Trisha Brewer	2010		10.1145/1880071.1880131	public relations;social science;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;management;law;world wide web;computer security;intellectual property	Security	-81.41229204041295	-28.244969869586846	18275

Results suggest most developers use the word dyslexia to increase the visibility of their apps within digital distribution platforms but do not intentionally design with dyslexics in mind. Those developers intentionally designing for dyslexics often have accurate but simplistic and one-dimensional conceptions of dyslexia and, unfortunately, some also have misconceptions especially as related to the myth that dyslexia can be cured or outgrown. Although a small number of developers are collaborating with dyslexia experts to design their apps, the onus for determining the quality of most apps is left to users. Examples of curated resource repositories and evaluation rubrics for mobile apps are provided to support users in this endeavor.	digital distribution;mobile app	Kara Dawson;Pavlo D.

A network is identified when a criminal comes to notice and any associates who could also be potentially implicated would need to be identified if only to be eliminated from the enquiries as suspects or witnesses as well as to prevent and/or detect crime. However, an identified network may not be the one causing most harm in a given area.. This paper identifies a methodology to identify all of the criminal networks that are present within a Law Enforcement Area, and, prioritises those that are causing most harm to the community. Each crime is allocated a score based on its crime type and how recently the crime was committed; the network score, which can be used as decision support to help prioritise it for law enforcement purposes, is the sum of the individual crime scores.	automatic identification and data capture	Richard Adderley;Atta Badii;Chaoxin Wu	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89900-6_4	element;decision support system;criminal justice ethics;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;crime scene;law;computer security;criminal investigation	ML	-71.90125854674676	-9.100871634842584	18303

But naïve consequentialism is intellectually too weak to serve as a practical guide in the profession. Besides, the complexity of software systems makes it very hard to know in advance the consequences that will derive from professional activities in the production of software. Therefore, following the spirit of well-known codes of ethics such as the ACM/IEEE's, we advocate for a more solid position in the ethical education of software engineers, which we call 'moderate deontologism', that takes into account both rules and consequences to assess the goodness of actions, and at the same time pays an adequate consideration to the absolute values of human dignity. In order to educate responsible professionals, however, this position should be complemented with a pedagogical approach to virtue ethics.	aclarubicin;algorithm;borg scale rating of perceived exertion score 17;code;complex systems;educational curriculum;information systems;information system;intellect;judgment;logic programming;naivety;programming complexity;rule (guideline);school;software engineer;software system;value (ethics)	Gonzalo Génova;M.

Whether computers are a means to an instructional end or an end in themselves, the implications of computers in elementary and secondary schools are significant. Officials take pride in advertising the number of computers and state-of the-art software programs available for students' use. But is everything as it seems behind this curtain of educational technology? What do we know about the skills of the individuals directing our children's performance in computer labs? To find out, we interviewed Eric (named changed) asking him to tell us about his experience managing a computer lab in a suburban high school of 1800 students. This is Eric's first year as a computer lab manager.

This movement has raised a number of questions including: Why are municipalities acting as the early adopters of wireless broadband technology? How does increased state regulation of municipal broadband networks affect this trend and how can cities respond? As cities use wireless broadband technology to enhance services to citizens, the growth of municipal wireless deployments has transitioned from linear to exponential. In response, many states have passed laws to regulate and restrict cities' ability to own, operate, deploy, or profit from either telecommunications or information services. Current and pending laws will be examined to understand how cities can deploy a wireless broadband network under these regulations. An analysis of municipal facilities and technology expertise illustrates the opportunity for public– private cooperation in wireless deployments. This paper will show that cooperation is beneficial in many cases. Finally, current business models will be examined for their ability to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors, bridge the digital divide, and create competition among private	internet access;job stream;population;requirement;software deployment;subdivision surface;time complexity	Andrea H.

Guild membership can be beneficial to game progress, and offer opportunities for social interaction. In the current study we focus on the MMORPG World of Warcraft (WoW), with the main aim to examine whether guild commitment and players’ intention to remain in their guild can be predicted by players’ satisfaction, investments, and perceptions of alternatives to their guild. To this end, 165 WoW players completed an online questionnaire and answered questions related to their guild membership. They also completed the investment model scale which was reworded so all questions pertained to their guild and their fellow guild members. Results show that satisfaction level, quality of alternatives, and investment size significantly predict commitment level (p’s < .001), which in turn predicted likelihood of participants’ staying with their current guild (p < .001) and the number of guilds they had been a member of in the past (p < .001). Moreover, high levels of guild commitment were indicative of better mental health, whereas weekly hours of game play was negatively related to mental health. In the discussion, we conclude that interdependence theory and the investment model of commitment are applicable to online gaming environments, and we argue that commitment to one’s guild is one factor that could prevent the risks associated with online game play (i.e. problematic use).	world of warcraft	Aleksandra M.

Even though minors can deepen their relationships by such communication, online communication sites introduce risks including cyber-bullying or the luring of sexual predators. Such communication risks involving minors are social matters that must be detected automatically and prohibited. In this paper, we clarify communication behaviors by focusing on private chat systems, which are sometimes used to sexually entrap minors. Our analysis found that most of users communicate with less then 5 users, and the communication ended within a half hour. Then we classified users into 15 clusters based on their communication behaviors. From the clustering results, we identified both active communication senders and active communication receivers. Such communication receivers must be monitored because they might have much more opportunities to be entrapped by sexual predators.	cluster analysis;computer-mediated communication;cyberbullying;mobile device;smartphone	Fujio Toriumi;Takafumi Nakanishi;Mitsuteru Tashiro;Kiyotaka Eguchi	2015	2015 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT)	10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.49	the internet;multimedia;internet privacy;law;world wide web	HCI	-83.7283004765856	-19.03420713391905	18340

The problem with these developments is that they are implemented in isolation. This isolation causes limited sharing of resources, duplication, poor-governance of the resources, and in worse-case scenarios, failure of these projects is realised before their intended purposes. The smart community centre model that could be used to address these problems by focusing on the Siyabuswa Educational Improvement and Development Trust (SEIDET) community centre for experimentation purposes has been proposed. This model followed a descriptive analysis of ICT related work spanning over two decades performed within the SEIDET context, including the ongoing SEIDET Digital Village. The benefits of this smart community centre model include community and rural development through sharing of scarce ICT resources. It could further provide support for entrepreneurs through training interventions, action-based research for policy development as well as spawn local innovation and free-sharing of resources and services. This model can further be adapted to any local community, as it is designed using the international studies and theories. This paper presents the design of the smart community centre model. The design is described using Practice Theory concepts towards an empirical study that will be conducted using the General Morphological Analysis methods to corroborate aspects of practices. The scenario of how these theories could be practiced within the SEIDET centre is also presented.	file spanning;isolation (database systems);spawn (computing);theory	Jackie Phahlamohlaka;Zama Dlamini;Linda Malinga;Sipho Ngobeni;Thami Mnisi	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS)	10.1109/ISTAS.2015.7439411	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;management science	SE	-78.88828469431485	-7.082880654570228	18425

Research suggests, however, threaded forums, one of the most popular asynchronous discussion environments, do not often foster productive online discussions naturally. This paper explores how certain properties of threaded forums have affected or constrained the quality of discussions, and argues that developing alternative discussion environments is highly needed to offer better support for asynchronous online communication. Using the Productive Online Discussion Model developed by Gao, Wang and Sun, we analyzed current work on four types of asynchronous discussion environments that have been developed and researched: constrained environments, visualized environments, anchored environments and combined environments. The paper has implications for developing future asynchronous online discussion environments. More specifically, future work should aim at (1) exploring new environments that support varied goals of learning, (2) integrating emerging technologies to address the constraints of current environments, (3) designing multifunctional environments to facilitate complex learning and (4) developing appropriate instructional activities and strategies for these environments.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Practitioner Notes#R##N##R##N#What is already known about this topic#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#• #R##N#Asynchronous online discussion plays an important role in facilitating learning.#R##N##R##N#• #R##N#It is hard to foster a focused, interactive and in-depth asynchronous discussion in traditional threaded forums.#R##N##R##N#• #R##N#Researchers have investigated multiple ways of structuring or facilitating asynchronous online discussions.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#What this paper adds#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#• #R##N#The paper analyzes how existing features of threaded forums constrain the quality of online discussion.#R##N##R##N#• #R##N#The paper identifies the progress made in designing alternative asynchronous discussion environments and discusses four major types of asynchronous discussion environments that have been developed and researched.#R##N##R##N#• #R##N#The paper provides suggestions for developing future asynchronous discussion environments.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Implications for practice and/or policy#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#• #R##N#Designing alternative asynchronous discussion environments is necessary to improve the quality of online discussion and communication.#R##N##R##N#• #R##N#New asynchronous discussion environments need to be designed to meet varied learning goals and facilitate complex learning.#R##N##R##N#• #R##N#Appropriate instructional strategies need to be developed for both existing and new online discussion environments.

6190222698ea18988dc57d0a51f3db3eb4685a97	the coup that flopped: facebook as a platform for emotional protest		This paper develops the idea that recent “networked” social movements are driven by emotions and provides an analysis of the role of emotions in movement mobilization. The case study focuses on the 2013 protests against a “coup” within the Czech Social Democratic Party. The protests had an immediate impact, resulting in a series of demonstrations, mainstream media attention and a successful overturning of the “coup”. The movement’s Facebook page served as an important catalyst for the protest. We argue that the movement’s success can be explained by its emphasis on perceived issues of morality. As people tend to gather on Facebook to express their feelings, social media become a primary conduit for emotional protest, which can be subsequently taken to the streets.

Additionally, the effect of customer engagement in relation to box office performance is rarely examined. Using social media measures from Twitter and movie box office data from boxofficemojo.com the present study found not only that WOM volume does have a direct positive effect on box office outcomes but also that customer engagement or marketer-generated content (MGC) from movie studios plays a role indirectly relating to box office outcomes.

We propose a way in which explanations of system behavior can be generated using a causal domain representation and qualitative simulation methods. In this paper, in particular, we propose a representation for the objects (components and processes), employed in the training process, which permit us to obtain, besides conceptual and structural explanations, behavioral explanations when, either they are explicitly requested by the trainee, or they are needed to resolve misunderstandings detected during a practical exercise. The method to obtain the causal models and its application in a Thermodynamic domain will be also described.	causality	José Ángel Vadillo Zorita;Arantza Díaz de Ilarraza;Isabel Fernández de Castro;Julián Gutiérrez Serrano;Jon A.

We discuss our experiences from the course IN3050: Applied Logic in Engineering, introduced as a “logic for everybody” elective course at at TU Munich, Germany, to engage pupils studying Computer Science, IT and engineering subjects on Bachelor and Master levels. Our goal was to overcome the bias that logic and formal methods are not only very complicated but also very boring to study and to apply. In this paper, we present the core structure of the course, provide examples of exercises and evaluate the course based on the students’ surveys. 1	computer science;formal methods;natural deduction	Maria Spichkova	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_18	formal methods;formal science;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;programming language;logic;algorithm	Logic	-81.50033688241842	-34.116312888514365	18493

This can form a key point for educators and decision makers to help them in advancing their systems. In this paper, we proposed a data mining framework for analysing end of unit general textual feedback using four machine learning algorithms, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, and naive bays. We filtered the whole data set into two subsets, one subset is tailored to assessment practices (assessment related), and the other one is the non-assessment related data subset, We ran the above algorithms on the whole data set, and on the new data subsets. We also, adopted a semi automatic approach to check the classification accuracy of assessment related instances under the whole data set model. We found that the accuracy of general feedback data set models were higher than the accuracy of the assessment related models and nearly the same value of the non- assessment related modeles. The accuracy of assessment related models were approximated to the accuracy of the assessment related instances under the full data set models.

Surveys found that the large majority of students viewed all investigated types of interaction as educational and motivational. Students perceived learner–instructor and learner–content interactions to have significantly higher educational value (α < 0.01) than learner–learner interactions, and viewed learner–instructor interaction to be significantly more motivational (α < 0.01) than learner–content interaction. Furthermore, nine significant correlations were found involving the time students reported spending on human interaction and course outcomes. Seven of the significant correlations were related to the time students reported spending in human interaction and the more affective outcomes, such as course satisfaction and disposition towards the subject area. Outcomes also indicate that learner–learner interaction had higher correlations with course outcomes than learners' interactions with the content or their instructor. Students' perceived learning was not significantly correlated with any type of interaction, and only students' total reported time spent on learner–learner interaction and students' social learner–learner interaction were significantly correlated with their grade.	michigan virtual high school	Jered Borup;Charles R.

EduCou0027s defining characteristic is integrating a number of services for software development activities, for example, project management, requirements engineering, design, and programming into integrated shared workspaces with social-networking facilities to enhance collaboration among students and instructors. We conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in doing a three-iteration programming project. A total of 126 second-year students who attended an object-oriented programming course participated in the experiment. The results show that while the system was not found to affect student programming performance, it improved student engagement and satisfaction when working in teams. These results imply that the systemu0027s shared workspaces and social-networking services have the potential to enhance learning outcomes of students working in teams when these features are integrated into collaborative learning environments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many of these technologies routinely used by the general population are frequently inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Barriers to the use of these technologies by people with varying disabilities may be subtle and unintentional, but never the less very real. This paper presents preliminary results of policy research designed to develop a framework for assessing the status quo, developing inclusive policy initiatives, and evaluating the efficacy of the research approach.	population	Paul Manuel Aviles Baker;Christine Bellordre	2004	37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

These perceptions are collectively characterised as an ‘‘online store image.’’ Our research developed reliable and valid measures for the components of an online store image, and examined the relationships of these components to attitudes and intentions to purchase online. Conceptually, the paper relied on the relatively established literature on ‘‘traditional’’ store image and technology acceptance research. Empirically, we focused on the store images of two online bookstores. Following standard processes for instrument development, we conducted two rounds of data collection (pilot sample, n 1⁄4 61; main sample, n 1⁄4 312) to assess reliability and validity. The paper presents multiple-item measurements for components of a store image: online store usefulness, enjoyment, ease of use, store style, familiarity, trustworthiness, and settlement performance. The components were regressed on attitudes and intentions towards purchasing at the online store, revealing significant, direct influences from usefulness, enjoyment, trustworthiness and settlement performance. # 2003 Elsevier B.V.

One approach to teaching this skill has been through tangible programming since it facilitates intuitive interaction with children. In this paper, we introduce CodeTrain and CodeBox, two motorized toys whose behavior can be programmed through wooden building blocks without the use of a computer, tablet, or screen-based interface. The goal with both these designs is to foster playful exploration of computational thinking in pre-adolescent children through tangible objects. We describe the design process from the conceptual design to the functional prototype. Furthermore, we present first impressions of the prototypes from a pilot study and highlight some lessons learned from our first iteration.	algorithm;computation;computational thinking;iteration;prototype;tablet computer;toys	Erika Root;Maren Steinkamp;Beatrice Coldewey;Christin Poloczek;Frederik Scharnowski;Mark Kettner;Marion Koelle;Swamy Ananthanarayan;Marlon Willms	2017		10.1145/3152832.3156620	literacy;multimedia;human–computer interaction;conceptual design;computer science;engineering design process;computational thinking;first impression (psychology)	HCI	-65.31973881032943	-40.67160524880838	18614

This research analyzes social, economic, and demographic data, to identify factors that correlate with homicide rates. Previous research efforts have focused on trends of homicide rates and provided subjective recommendations without supporting empirical evidence. This research provides an objective analysis of homicide rates, using a large database consisting of census data provided by the Instituto Nacional De Estradstica Y Geografa (INEGI) website. Through formal experimentation, we found that the most significant indicators were economic and education variables (e.g., Occupants in Refuge and Population over 5 Years Without Schooling), supporting recommendations on policy changes from other research efforts. This paper presents our experiments, results, and insights regarding future work.		Carl M. Kruger;Matthew S.

Although self-reported computer anxiety has reduced in the past decade, it continues to be a significant issue for many. This is especially true for students of today where the stakes are high when using computers for their course work. Anxiety becomes even more critical when students are taking online courses. Past research has shown that computer experience is a strong predictor of whether or not a user will suffer anxiety symptoms while using a computer. Moreover, a substantial amount of work has been done to study the effect of previous computer experience on anxiety and on ease of use of information technologies using the technology acceptance model. However, few, if any, have investigated the role of anxiety in mediating technology usage experience on perceived ease of use. In this study, technology usage is viewed from two perspectives, the computer and the internet. We study the influence of anxiety in mediating the impact of computer and internet experiences on perceived ease of use. Questionnaire data from 114 university students were analyzed. The context was the use of a quiz tool to practice multiple choice questions. Contrary to most related studies, results indicated that anxiety has no mediating role on the impact of computer experience and perceived ease of use. However, anxiety was shown to present some moderating influence on perceived ease of use.	usability	Raafat George Saadé;Dennis Kira	2007	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2006.01.009	psychology;multiple choice;questionnaire;educational technology;the internet;computer experiment;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;mathematics;multimedia;higher education;social psychology;law;information technology;statistics;anxiety	HCI	-86.70226456530186	-23.25280361155372	18675

The research in this paper develops and tests an adaptation and theoretical extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by explaining intent to use not only in terms of variables related to functional evaluation like perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, but also variables that relate to social interaction. The new model was tested using controlled experiment and longitudinal data collected regarding three different social agents at elderly care facilities and at the homes of older adults. The model was strongly supported accounting for 59–79% of the variance in usage intentions and 49–59% of the variance in actual use. These findings contribute to our understanding of how elderly users accept assistive social agents.	usability	Marcel Heerink;Ben J. A. Kröse;Vanessa Evers;Bob J. Wielinga	2010	I. J.

The data were analysed using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe PLS-SEM approach revealed that voters’ commitment to vote was the strongest determinant of students’ decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting. Voters’ high satisfaction with campus e-voting was based on the commitment and requirement of students of the university to vote. Compulsory voting was not a hassle for them in order to achieve campus development and sustainability. A moderation analysis revealed that the relative influence of commitment to vote on students’ satisfaction in campus e-voting was higher in the group with medium level of trust than among the group with high level of trust.rnrnrnrnrnPractical implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe election commission of the university and the university management should increase students’ turnout and commitment to vote during campus e-voting by outlining effective marketing strategies, campaigns and promotions across a number of digital platforms, including mobile SNS. They need to ensure that voters can sense their involvement is warranted and will continue to vote electronically in the next campus election.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThe research yielded an exclusive perspective into students’ decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting. It also uncovered the influence of moderating effect of trust in the system in developing countries which is marginally concealed in the literature.

And for the most part, these could all be considered a failure. So, what happened? What was so different from the mainstream social networks that didn’t work with academic social networks?

bdfce4cd05e718bd88774ce254f55cb04e6f2532	a bibliometric analysis on the published papers in journal of technology enhanced foreign language education (tefle) from year 2006 to 2015		This Paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the papers published in the journal of Technology Enhanced Foreign Language Education (TEFLE), a core professional academic journal in China, during the years from 2006 to 2015. Our result aims to provide a clear view of the evolution of literature in the research field of technology enhanced foreign language learning over the past decade, intending to put forward a preliminary framework for TEFLE to improve its publication quality and at the same time foster better technology enhanced foreign language education in China. Bibliometric indicators of paper amount, author information, total citations, and frequency of keywords have been analyzed with the use of tools of BICOMB and SPSS and methods of co-word and cluster analysis, which indicates that, over the past decade, both of the quality of the published papers and the paper evaluation system has been improved. The statistics also reveal that the authors in TEFLE are mainly from eastern China, a research group that has been formed with more researchers constantly joining in, and a number of papers have been highly cited, bringing further interest in the related disciplines. Currently, the reform of foreign language classroom teaching with technological aids appears the hotspot topic in the related applied field. An effort is made to demonstrate that the research method has shifted to a new way that places equal emphasis on both quantitative and qualitative study in technology enhanced learning (TEL) and technologies have a bigger influence on foreign language learning in China, but in the meantime, there is an imbalance in the distribution of authors from different national geographic areas in TEL research.	bibliometrics	Xiu-Yan Zhong	2018	T.

The research goal is to drive innovation in governments through the integration of user activities from social networks into government applications. Instead of using third-party social media tools, we call for self-developing integration software, so that the government retains full control of the sensitive government data that is linked to social network user data. Following a design science approach, we developed a data model of user activities in social networks. Our 40 user activity types conceptualize the common fundamental data structure and are a means for comparing current features of ten prominent social networks. We find that a substantial share of user activities can be mutually integrated by wrapping social network Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).	social network	Marcel Rosenberger;Christiane Lehrer;Reinhard Jung	2017	Information Systems Frontiers	10.1007/s10796-016-9682-6	public relations;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;data mining;database;management;world wide web;computer security	ECom	-76.16658431633303	3.4143306100136153	18886
eeb82c76d6dfbd2fc8bf2fc5acab6237db6cd5fb	using students as experimental subjects in software engineering research - a review and discussion of the evidence		Should students be used as experimental subjects in software engineering? Given that students are in many cases readily available and cheap it is no surprise that the vast majority of controlled experiments in software engineering use them. But they can be argued to constitute a convenience sample that may not represent the target population (typically “real” developers), especially in terms of experience and proficiency. This causes many researchers (and reviewers) to have reservations about the external validity of student-based experiments, and claim that students should not be used. Based on an extensive review of published works that have compared students to professionals, we find that picking on “students” is counterproductive for two main reasons. First, classifying experimental subjects by their status is merely a proxy for more important and meaningful classifications, such as classifying them according to their abilities, and effort should be invested in defining and using these more meaningful classifications. Second, in many cases using students is perfectly reasonable, and student subjects can be used to obtain reliable results and further the research goals. In particular, this appears to be the case when the study involves basic programming and comprehension skills, when tools or methodologies that do not require an extensive learning curve are being compared, and in the initial formative stages of large industrial research initiatives — in other words, in many of the cases that are suitable for controlled experiments of limited scope. keywords: Controlled experiment; Experimental subjects; Students; Experimental methodol-	artifact (software development);basic programming;capability maturity model;data point;debugging;experience;experiment;experimental software engineering;external validity;foremost;interaction;level of detail;list comprehension;monte carlo method;next-generation network;pixel;programmer;proxy server;relevance;sampling (signal processing);spatial variability;statistical model;web application;wolfenstein: enemy territory	Dror G.

d91090c4d3da4f245aa211aa86c8369286907dbd	research portfolio analysis and topic prominence		Stakeholders in the science system need to decide where to place their bets. Example questions include: Which areas of research should get more funding? Who should we hire? Which projects should we abandon and which new projects should we start? Making informed choices requires knowledge about these research options. Unfortunately, to date research portfolio options have not been defined in a consistent, transparent and relevant manner. Furthermore, we don’t know how to define demand for these options. In this article, we address the issues of consistency, transparency, relevance and demand by using a model of science consisting of 91,726 topics (or research options) that contain over 58 million documents. We present a new indicator of topic prominence – a measure of visibility, momentum and, ultimately, demand. We assign over $203 billion of project-level funding data from STAR METRICS® to individual topics in science, and show that the indicator of topic prominence, explains over one-third of the variance in current (or future) funding by topic. We also show that highly prominent topics receive far more funding per researcher than topics that are not prominent. Implications of these results for research planning and portfolio analysis by institutions and researchers are emphasized.	modern portfolio theory;relevance;transparency (graphic)	Richard Klavans;Kevin W.

They concentrate only on the portion of the pipe directly controlled by them or at best by their customers and suppliers. This is a myopic view. Supply chains are in fact complex interacting networks linking industries, economies and other organizations, which in turn interact with the landscape and climate. We should identify and study these interactions in order to understand the complexity of operations, to acquire domain knowledge and expertise for building analytics towards excellence in strategy and execution, and to also mitigate the risks involved. For most manufacturing companies their product quality and performance are dealt with by well established manufacturing processes. Companies are now also assessed by the level of secure services provided before, during and after the sale of sustainable products by meeting social, environmental and economic needs. Customers make comparisons based on Total Cost of Ownership rather than Cost of Acquisition. Furthermore the demographics and hence the consumerism of the world will be changing. According to Goldman Sachs, two billion people may join the global middle class by 2030. These new consumer markets should develop economically in a sustainable way. Hence “green” awareness, compliance and regulations around societal, economic concerns will assume great importance. A tangible product, the services associated with it, and the relationship between the two over time constitute the three dimensions that together fully define a “service product”. We look at this rather complex and important problem and suggest a framework for analysis and design of GIMSN.	interaction;james d. sachs;logistics;markov chain;outsourcing;smarter planet;total cost of ownership	Nukala Viswanadham;Nithya Rajamani	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2009.5234112	marketing;operations management;business;commerce	DB	-72.81823415687164	3.946853094436378	18944

Many others struggle each day just to stay in school, focus on lessons or make sense about what is taught. Several students face underachievement and dropout because they feel that school is outdated, uninteresting and does not fulfill their learning needs. In this paper, the authors offer a proposal, often talked about but rarely put into action to bring back struggling students to school: to use multiple forms of presenting information and expression in order to attract students that need more dynamic and broader learning strategies.

Therefore, it is of utter importance to create an environment where learners become confident, autonomous learners, increasingly able to use their creativity and to take safe risks. One way of looking at this problem, analyzing it and seeking a solution may be by considering the perspective of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Universal Design for Learning is a concept introduced by David Rose in 1984 who has worked at the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) since then. His work and that of his fellows at CAST, provides a vision that ruptures the “one-size-fits-all” model of education for the masses that dilutes the vast individual differences and, therefore, expands the opportunities for learning for all students with diverse learning characteristics. For UDL, diversity is the keyword: the diversity of students in schools demands diverse enabling strategies so that no one is excluded and every one can benefit from equal opportunities. The UDL framework is grounded in cognitive and neural perspectives of learning. It embodies a set of principles based on research that constitutes a practical model to maximize learning opportunities for all students. Learning takes place through changes made at a neurological level where complex functional networks are interconnected. For learning to happen through the processing of information, via the interpretation of stimuli, the manipulation of concepts, the involvement and activity in the surrounding environment, which then leads to the accommodation of knowledge, it is necessary that the individual’s recognition, strategic and affective networks be fed adaptively. The three principles of UDL, which consist of (i) Providing Multiple Means of Representation; (ii) Providing Multiple Means of Action and Expression and (iii) Providing Multiple Means of Engagement, are described in detail ahead in this article. These principles should be applied to all students in a classroom, because there is a fundamental incompatibility between them and the standardized curriculum and pedagogical practices that are still pervasive in today’s schools. UDL principles focus on the adjustment of the learning and teaching process, through differentiated instruction and the implementation of curricular adaptations, rather than on retrofitting for the student. Such notions are in line with current perspectives on the support of students with adverse learning paths, advocated by major international institutions like UNESCO (1994) and the World Health Organization (2004). They sustain that environment plays a crucial role on rising and/ or aggravating constraints to the individual’s performance and that, subsequently, it should adapt to the individual and not otherwise. They aim at promoting access and participation by acknowledging student diversity as an added value and at eliminating and/or reducing barriers in order to allow any student to fulfill his/her potential and thus obtaining the best academic results possible in the least possible restrictive environment. Web-based environments for communicating, networking and collaborating, often referred to as Web 2.0 or social Web have been heralded as flexible contexts that can easily be adapted to individual needs. Understanding how such technologies can be used for educational purposes has become a focus of research in various fields of Education. Research suggests that the use of communication technologies (CT) fosters students’ development and enhancement on a number of aspects, including collaboration (Schellens & Valcke, 2005; Persico Pozzi, & Sarti, 2009; Forment, De Pedro, Casañ, Piguillem, & Galanis, 2010); knowledge construction (Yap & Chia, 2010; Lucas & Moreira, 2010; Deed & Edwards, 2010) critical thinking (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2001); socialization (Richardson & Swan 2003); satisfaction (Hostetter & Busch, 2006), or inclusion (Walker & Logan, 2009; Ware, 2002). Students’ inclusion has been one of the major challenges for school systems in the past decades. It is safeguarded by the Inclusive Education Framework (IEF) (UNESCO, 1994) which poses that inclusion rejects exclusion and that Education is for all “regardless of their physical, intellectual, emotional, social, 8 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/aiming-affective-processlearning/65568?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

We argue that learnability can be significantly improved by integrating into the programming system learning supports that allow individuals to educate themselves about the syntax, semantics, and applications of a language. Reflecting on our experience with developing novice programming systems, we identify infrastructural characteristics of such systems that can make the integration of learning supports practical. We focus on five core facilities: annotatability, scriptability, monitorability, supplementability, and constrainability. Our hope is that our examination of these technical facilities and their tradeoffs can inform the design of future programming systems that better address the educational needs of their users.	admissible numbering;arcade game;hoc (programming language);learnability;lemmings;nonlinear gameplay;scripting language;toontalk;usability;video game developer;visual programming language	Chris DiGiano;Kenneth M.

The archive was created in the late 1980s and maintained until 2005.The study was prompted by the archives creators concerns about the resources involved, and the need to preserve their electronic records and systems vis-à-vis the presence of the signed and sealed paper documents. The approach used to study the digital archive was to consider it akin to an archaeological site. A formation process study of the archives components was conducted using interview methods; primary and secondary sources; and metadata extraction, file viewers, and file transformation software. The study revealed information about the technical and social contexts involved in the archives formation, and how its creators used it and valued it over time. The results informed the design of a preservation strategy aimed at maintaining the archives integrity and authenticity and continuing documentation of its evolution. The attributes characterizing the archive led to the development of the concept of natural electronic archive.	archive;attachments;bliss;case preservation;coexist (image);confidentiality;database;directory (computing);documentation;electronic funds transfer;potentially visible set;secondary source;server (computing)	Maria Esteva	2008		10.1002/meet.2008.1450450270	multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-69.81505056503693	-15.79803226825245	19040

Rational and emotional are the two opposite adjectives with the most resonance during interpretation of the properties of product forms. Among the researches on form ratio, the golden ratio is the most historic. In this study the questionnaire survey of two group variables of “rational and emotional properties” and “preference” among 5 kinds of ratio states of 4 kinds of basic forms has been carried out for the purposes of (1) figuring out the correlation among the backgrounds of respondents, the form preference, and the rational and emotional perception, and (2) the difference in rational and emotional perceptions of different forms. This study is also aimed at the impacts of ratio variations of different forms on the rational and emotional properties. Both the online questionnaire and questionnaire in paper copy have been implemented simultaneously in this experiment for two weeks. In the end 230 online questionnaires and 220 paper copies of questionnaires have been collected, and there are 417 valid questionnaires out of the total of 450 questionnaires. The results of these questionnaires have led to two conclusions: 1. The one with the highest significance of impact on rational and emotional properties and preference level is the college attended, followed by the gender. 2. The smaller aspect ratio of rectangular, the more rational it will be. The smaller aspect ratio of the organic form, the more emotional is will be.	darknet market;resonance	Chiu-Wei Chien;Chih-Long Lin;Rungtai Lin	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20907-4_2	psychology;questionnaire;market segmentation;social psychology;computer-assisted web interviewing;personality;personality psychology;product design;product marketing	AI	-89.6358626559306	-18.09073966533474	19061

New ideas, products and capabilities spring into existence and are developed within months, making it nearly impossible to predict the exciting new opportunities even a few years from now. But we can say that technology will be increasingly incorporated in most aspects of formal, informal, and casual education, and that it will build upon today’s capabilities. In this review I discuss some current and emerging technologies and suggest how they might be used to increase learning in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and geography (STEM-G). I don’t describe well-entrenched tools, nor administrative or teacher management applications, and am not limited to classroom uses. These are personal choices of tools with high opportunities for engaging learning. The foundation of most educational technologies is the World Wide Web and similar networks (e.g., wireless cell phone nets) that are already widely available in the Western World and many parts of Asia (though issues of financial access still loom everywhere). These networks are becoming more pervasive (even invasive), ever faster, and ultimately everyone in developed nations will be connected. The educational value of evolving networks is that learners will be able to connect to almost every conceivable kind of learning opportunity, anytime, ABSTRACT	anytime algorithm;evolving networks;loom;mobile phone;pervasive informatics;world wide web	Charles A.

We consider that the student has to do exercises when he is learning a programming language; these tasks cause extra difficulties in conventional web environments. To remove these difficulties we propose an application that we have called DWE (Development Web Environment); the core is a language compiler integrated in the web application. Along with this compiler there are other modules to help the student while he's developing the programs; to obtain this we try to facilitate the communication teacher - student and student - student and we try to use the experience from all users in a group.

Digital games have become an attractive tool for teaching coding, yet rarely do they account for collaboration among players. The goal of this paper is to show how asynchronous collaboration can be leveraged in a game-space by facilitating players to share and compare their solution methods. By comparing and contrasting code side-by-side players are more likely to detect structural (rather than superficial) similarities and differences (analogical encoding). A pilot study involving pre-teens found that this design feature led to reflection on the differences and different affordances of the solution methods based on their deep structure.	computer programming;pair programming;the superficial	Marleen Villeroy	2017		10.1145/3078072.3084327	multimedia;affordance;coding (social sciences);computer science;asynchronous communication;encoding (memory);computer programming	HCI	-72.13114087526705	-43.509935858098295	19079

These data forms are presented in the context of the related sub-disciplinary research area, and they provide the flow of the research process from which these data are generated. The profiles also represent the needs for data curation from the perspective of the data producers, using their own language. As such, they support the exploration of data curation across different research domains in real and practical terms. With the sponsorship of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, investigators from Purdue University and the University of Illinois interviewed nineteen faculty subjects to identify needs for discovery, access, preservation, and reuse of their research data. For each subject, a profile was constructed that includes information about his or her general research, data forms and stages, value of data, data ingest, intellectual property, organization and description of data, tools, interoperability, impact and prestige, data management, and preservation. Each profile also presents a specific dataset supplied by the subject to serve as a concrete example. The Data Curation Profiles are being published to a public wiki for questions and discussion, and a blank template will be disseminated with guidelines for others to create and share their own profiles. This study was conducted primarily from the viewpoint of librarians interacting with faculty researchers; however, it is expected that these findings will complement a wide variety of data curation research and practice outside of librarianship and the university environment. 2 Constructing Data Curation Profiles Data Curation Profiles	case preservation;data curation;digital curation;interaction;interoperability;librarian;wiki	Michael Witt;Jacob Carlson;D.

This task, also referred to as """"knowledge tracing"""", has been explored extensively on exercises where student submissions fall into a finite discrete solution space, e.g. a multiple-choice answer. However, we believe that rich information about a student's learning is captured within their responses to open-ended problems with unbounded solution spaces, such as programming exercises. In addition, sequential snapshots of a student's progress while she is solving a single exercise can provide valuable insights into her learning behavior. In this setting, creating representations for a student's knowledge state is a challenging task, but with recent advances in machine learning, there are more promising techniques to learn representations for complex entities. In our work, we feed the embedded program submissions into a recurrent neural network and train it on the task of predicting the student's success on the subsequent programming exercise. By training on this task, the model learns nuanced representations of a student's knowledge, and reliably predicts future student performance."""	artificial neural network;color gradient;deep learning;embedded system;entity;experience;feasible region;feature learning;knowledge acquisition;machine learning;nonlinear gameplay;personalization;recurrent neural network;stepping level	Lisa Wang;Angela Sy;Larry Liu;Chris Piech	2017		10.1145/3051457.3053985	programming language	ML	-74.6816255905849	-51.609069484920376	19118

The networks of journals in all fields, the three strongly science-based fields (i.e. Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Organic Fine Chemistry), and the three weakly science-based fields (i.e. Optics, Telecommunications, and Consumer Electronics), have been analyzed from the global and the ego views, respectively. We study a variety of statistical properties of our networks, including number of actors, number of edges, size of the giant component, density, mean degree, clustering coefficient and the centralization measures of the network. We also highlight some apparent differences in the network structure between the subjects studied. Besides, we use the three centrality measures, i.e. degree, closeness, and betweenness, to identify the important journals in the network of all fields and those strongly science-based networks.	betweenness;bibliographic coupling;centrality;clustering coefficient;giant component;social network analysis	Xia Gao;Jiancheng Guan	2007	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-007-2013-4	social network analysis;social science;computer science;data science;data mining;clustering coefficient;advertising;world wide web;giant component	Web+IR	-77.60337277490517	-19.034124616076816	19155
67b4fadcb9afeec0155c9c5b7b3db8c66ae890b8	towards over-the-shoulder guidance following a traditional learning metaphor	computer assisted learning;educational environment;question answering	Abstract   Much research in the field of computer-assisted learning (CAL) has focused on the use of the computer as a surrogate teacher of facts and concepts. Only recent work has aimed at making CAL an integral part of the learner's normal educational environment which includes practice at applying those facts to problems. During practice a student requires advice, coaching and demonstration in order to learn in the most efficient manner. This paper highlights how the computer can be the surrogate demonstrator (coach) which provides that “over-the-shoulder” guidance needed when a student applies facts and concepts to problems. It does so by giving clues to the kind of argumentative process that an expert would use to reach a solution. It is envisioned that the lecturer will author the material in much the same way as they write examination questions. Answer argumentation is seen as a method with which to guide the lecturer in providing on-line justification of the answers. Clues to those arguments would then be available on demand by the student through a spoken narrative.		Angela C. Hague;Ian D.

Through case studies in two organisations, this paper presents insights into how adoption of emergent social software platforms may take form, and discusses the implications of two radically different approaches to manage these processes. Our findings suggest that organisations may need to cede control over parts of the IT innovation adoption process to benefit from grassroots initiatives, and rather standardise successful innovations on an ongoing basis to avoid detrimental fragmentation of media usage across organisational boundaries.

Gaining competitive advantage by retaining users in the SNS is an important issue for operators. By conceptualizing stickiness as the state of individuals’ prolong stay on the SNS, the aim of this study is to explore the process of formatting SNS stickiness in the context of Facebook from the perspectives of media richness theory, uses & gratifications (U & G) theory, and intimacy. Data was collected from the northern Taiwan University. A total of 187 questionnaires were selected for the data analysis. The results support the following conclusions: 1) the media richness provided by the Facebook website directly influences users’ gratifications, including interpersonal utility and social utility; 2) the intimacy is an important mediating variable involving in the process of formatting Facebook stickiness; and 3) Facebook stickiness is indirectly influenced by gratifications, interpersonal utility and social utility, which exerts its effect through intimacy. By integrating the theoretical perspectives of media richness theory, U & G theory with intimacy into the process model of formatting Facebook stickiness, this study provides both academics and practitioners with insight into how Facebook stickiness form and enable SNS manager to retain their users.	mobile social network;process modeling;web 2.0	Yu-Hsun Lin;Wen-Hsuan Lee;Chu My Giang	2016			advertising;social psychology	HCI	-87.79151301583101	-12.332224773154627	19202

We found that although participants could properly articulate the purpose of credit bureaus, their understanding of credit bureaus' data collection practices was divided and incomplete. Although most of them conceptualized identity theft as the primary risk of data breaches disclosing credit information, and noted a lack of trust/self-efficacy in controlling their data collected by credit bureaus, they did not take sufficient protective actions to deal with the perceived risks. Our findings provide implications for the design of future security-enhancing tools regarding credit data, education and public policy, with the aim to empower consumers to better manage their sensitive data and protect themselves from future data breaches.	credit bureau;data breach;personally identifiable information	Yixin Zou;Florian Schaub	2018		10.1145/3170427.3188510	data collection;multimedia;public policy;public relations;risk perception;data breach;computer science;identity theft;user-centered design	HCI	-85.38811384632982	-7.5091551253420805	19203

In practice, however, sometimes face-to-face meetings are not possible, and designers have to rely on asynchronous communication. Important contextual information that is available in face-to-face meetings often becomes missing in such asynchronous communications, which can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. To address this challenge, we present SketchComm: an enhanced tool to support rich and flexible asynchronous communication of early design ideas. The key of the system is to allow designers to capture and communicate important contextual information to the audience in addition to sketches. A user study with designers and audience demonstrated effectiveness of asynchronous early design communication using SketchComm.	angelfire;iterative design;iterative method;microsoft research;tablet computer;usability testing	Guang Li;Xiang Cao;Sergio Paolantonio;Feng Tian	2012		10.1145/2145204.2145261	design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;asynchronous communication;multimedia;communication;management;world wide web	HCI	-64.20770957093872	-40.21173145865124	19226

This study analyzes studentsu0027 collaborative learning experiences within small interdisciplinary cohorts while learning computational thinking in a university-level class. The cohort allows students from different disciplines to contribute diverse perspectives, socially interact with each other and in turn create situations where two or more students learn together. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative means to explore studentsu0027 collaborative learning experiences. Ethnographically-informed qualitative data using Stahlu0027s collaborative framework is analyzed. The analysis revealed that most students found the cohort model to be valuable in learning computational thinking by allowing them to ask about and explain problems, especially with students from different disciplines who perceive and explain a problem differently. Quantitative data from a multi-term survey complements and confirms the findings from the qualitative data. Our study helps to inform those teaching foundational computing concepts to a diverse audience of learners.	ct scan;computation;computational thinking;experience;level of measurement	Bushra Chowdhury;Austin Cory Bart;Dennis G.

Recently online and mobile digital payment platforms has entered the stage as contenders to this position and possibly could penetrate societies thoroughly and substitute current payment standards in the decades to come. This paper portrays how digital payment paltforms evolve in socio-technical niches and how various technological platforms aim for institutional attention in their attempt to challenge earlier platforms and standards. The paper applies a co-evolutionary multilevel perspective to model the interplay and processes between technology and society wherein digital payment platforms potentially will substitute other payment platforms just like the credit card negated the check. On this basis this paper formulate a multilevel conceptual framework and shows, through examples of new digital payment platforms, how transitions and substitutions might occur. Finally we discuss how possible venues and routes of transitions appear in the genesis and evolution of digital payment platforms.	control theory;evolution;genesis;niche blogging;sociotechnical system	Morten Hjelholt;Jan Damsgaard	2012			simulation;computer science;public economics;commerce	Security	-78.9365696538543	-10.334472726653619	19289

This research seeks to understand the factors affecting the purchase intention on Airbnb users in terms of five key factors: rating, rating volume, review, information quality, and media richness. ANOVA and path analysis are used to test the relationships of these factors with perceived value, satisfaction and purchase intention. Results indicate that perceived value and satisfaction are key determinants of intention to buy, while rating volume, review, information quality, and media richness are important precursors. In addition, gender and usage experiences with Airbnb are also used to classify the sample to assess the difference between each classification. The results of this study can provide a useful reference to researchers and firms and individuals working in the sharing economy.	information quality	Chia-Chen Chen;Ya-Ching Chang	2018	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2018.03.019	marketing;public relations;information quality;computer science;species richness;idle;sharing economy	NLP	-88.10419697227898	-12.520818235934644	19312

In isolation, these data are insufficient to address important questions about socioeconomic status (SES) and MOOC enrollment and performance. We demonstrate the use of third-party datasets to enrich demographic portraits of MOOC students and answer fundamental questions about SES and MOOC enrollment. We derive demographic information from registrants' geographic location by matching self-reported mailing addresses with data available from Esri at the census block group level and the American Community Survey at the zip code level. We then use these data to compare neighborhood income and parental education for US registrants in HarvardX courses to the US population as a whole. Overall, HarvardX registrants tend to reside in more affluent neighborhoods. Registrants on average live in neighborhoods with median incomes approximately. 45 standard deviations higher than the US population. Higher levels of parental education are also associated with a higher likelihood of registration.	geographic coordinate system;massive open online course;scsi enclosure services	John D.

Because of the centricity of the technology artifact, much of this research builds upon theories and prescriptions adapted from the information systems discipline. In information systems, the study of artifact design has benefitted from the adoption of the rigor and generalizability enabled by design science research. The purpose of this paper was to provide an overview of design science principles guiding the construction of technological artifacts, which we use to examine a decade of digital government research articles that fall into the design science camp. We assess these articles, using the guidelines of Hevner, March, and Park (2004) for conducting and presenting design science research; we identify common strengths and gaps; we recommend how digital government researchers may benefit from applying a grounded view of design to expand the generalizability of their work; and finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of ways to open up the narrow focus of design science to a broader understanding of the impact of external factors, such as the environment and organizational milieu, on the complex setting most digital government innovation inhabits.

However, this process is hindered by the difficulty of experimentally studying how individual behavioral tendencies lead to collective social dynamics in large groups of people interacting over time. In this study, we investigate the role of social influence, a process well studied at the individual level, on the puzzling nature of success for cultural products such as books, movies, and music. Using a """"multiple-worlds"""" experimental design, we are able to isolate the causal effect of an individual-level mechanism on collective social outcomes. We employ this design in a Web-based experiment in which 2,930 participants listened to, rated, and downloaded 48 songs by up-and-coming bands. Surprisingly, despite relatively large differences in the demographics, behavior, and preferences of participants, the experimental results at both the individual and collective levels were similar to those found in Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006). Further, by comparing results from two distinct pools of participants, we are able to gain new insights into the role of individual behavior on collective outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of Web-based experiments to address questions of collective social dynamics."""	auditory perception;bands;book;causal filter;demography;design of experiments;experiment;experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis;interaction;movies;social dynamics;social system;web;watt;weakness	Matthew J.

Our preliminary investigation shows approximately 50% of virtual groups formed online for the purpose of collaborative learning will encounter barriers that prevent them from forming an effective learning team. Our ongoing research is designed to identify the barriers that stand in the way of online learning groups in order to develop and test various intervention techniques, which can effectively remove the obstacles. Our secondary goal is to analyze the conversations of virtual group members using computational linguistics techniques and to develop a learning activity discourse model. The model is being used to construct an automatic system, which can be used to monitor the activities of the online learning group members to alert the instructors when the members encounter barriers.

A network consists of a set of nodes connected by ties. Social network research focuses on how outcomes are influenced not just by the attributes of the nodes (e.g. individuals), but also by the ties connecting nodes to each other. The nodes are typically conceptualized as actors, such as individuals, teams, or organizations. A unique network structure is created to reflect each different type of tie, such as trust, advice, collocation, or organizational affiliation. Social network analysis can be used for research examining individual, dyadic or network levels of analyses, and is a powerful tool for conducting multi-method research. Given the vast amounts of trace electronic data collected via accounting information systems, thispaper reviewshowsocial networkanalysisnot only opens new research avenues for accounting information systems researchers, but identifies opportunities for the field of accounting information systems to inform social network research by identifying new network structures and dynamics leveraging transactional data. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The area of cross-project coordination, where shared goals are tenuous or non-existent, has been under-researched. This paper explores the question of how multiple projects working on a single piece of existing software in the FLOSS environment can coordinate. Using the Ordering Systems lens, we examine this question via a cross-case analysis of four projects performed on the open source game Jagged Alliance 2 (JA2) in the forum Bear’s Pit. Our main findings are that: (1) Ongoing cross-project ordering systems are influenced by the materiality of development artifacts. (2) The emergent trajectory of cross-project ordering systems is influenced by affordances that emerge from the interaction between the goals and desires of the project team building the development artifact, and the materiality of the development artifact. (3) When two parties need to coordinate in the ordering system, all or almost all coordination effort can be borne by a single party. Furthermore, over time, emergent FLOSS projects bear more coordination effort than stable, mature projects.	archive;atari;cecil (programming language);chua's circuit;compiler;dia;diagram;erp;email;emergence;focal (programming language);gnu smalltalk;interaction;jagged alliance 2;journal of the association for information systems;library (computing);materiality (digital text);mod (video gaming);modding;open-source software;pc game;relevance;scheduling (computing);the temple of elemental evil;user exit;version control;ws-coordination	Cecil Eng Huang Chua;Adrian Yong Kwang Yeow	2010	J.

Computational support is needed for such analyses due to the size of the data and distributed nature of interaction. This paper reports on one step towards implementing an analytic framework that addresses these needs. Contingencies, defined as observed relationships between contributions that evidence contextual relevance, are computed according to automatable rules, and combined to infer uptake relations between contributions. The resulting uptake structure is then analyzed through various network-analytic methods and is also transformed into a graph of uptake between actors for social network analysis. Our initial results show that a simple contingency analysis based on temporal factors, actor addressing, and lexical overlap provides structures of sufficient quality for identification of major features of a discussion and the roles of actors. The results are expected to improve as semantic analysis is added.	computation;ibm notes;logic programming;multilevel model;natural language processing;pervasive informatics;relevance;scalability;semantic analysis (compilers);social network analysis;sociotechnical system;test automation	Daniel D.

As such, knowledge is more often than not subjective and inter-subjective. Furthermore, a specific form of constructed knowledge (known as collective tacit knowledge) can only be attained across social immersion and engagement. Paradoxically, it is through this subjective contextualisation of knowledge that we can attain more pertinent knowledge in dealing with a situation at hand. The implications for management in regards to routines, procedures and expert systems, as well as on the need for hands-on mediation are discussed.	expert system;hands-on computing;immersion (virtual reality);intersubjectivity;knowledge management;relevance	W.

Traditionally, students have worked with free-text scoring tools by typing free-text answers to the open-ended questions shown on the system’s interface. Students could not personalize the aspect of the interface or visually acknowledge the level of progress they have made after answering the questions. In contrast, with this new form of interaction they are able to input natural language text and look at their generated conceptual model, which can be defined as a network of concepts and the relationships among them. In the conceptual model, each node has a background colour that indicates how well it has been understood by the student. The conceptual model can be represented in several formats such as concept maps, tables, charts, diagrams or textual summaries. The results of two experiments carried out with a group of students and teachers show how they like this new possibility.	chart;concept map;diagram;experiment;natural language;nonlinear gameplay;personalization;table (database)	Diana Pérez;Ismael Pascual-Nieto;Pilar Rodríguez Marín	2008			natural language processing;conceptual model;natural language programming;universal networking language;question answering;object language;conceptual model;domain model;natural language;programming language;temporal annotation	AI	-78.8162186355928	-46.904249319110306	19530

A new technique is described that combines the benefits of heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability walkthroughs. This technique, a heuristic walkthrough, provide more structure than heuristic evaluations but less than cognitive walkthroughs. The result is an effective task-oriented evaluation technique that is easy to learn and apply. Methods are proposed for comparing the validity, thoroughness, and reliability of evaluation techniques. Finally, heuristic walkthroughs are compared to heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs in a controlled study. The results indicate that heuristic walkthroughs are more thorough than cognitive walkthroughs and more valid than heuristic evaluations.

The implementation of an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) device is often essential to promote language development and participation in school, home and community environments. The present study evaluated the impact of introducing a high-tech alternative and augmentative device, namely an Apple iPad with the """"GoTalk Now"""" communication application to a student diagnosed with cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder. Integration of the technology focused on promoting key elements associated with long term AAC usage, namely, targeted training of the student, teacher, educational assistant and parents, over the course of the school year. Marked increases in the student's communication skills and non-academic school functioning were observed. The need for communication partner prompting declined over time while the student, teacher and parent remained engaged by the iPad solution. This case study supports the classroom implementation of high-tech communication devices for those with complex communication needs via a comprehensive access delivery protocol that invokes systematic student, teacher, educational assistant and parent training. iPad-based communication solution fostered communication skill development.Training of teaching staff and parent promoted device use in the classroom.Non-academic school function improved and required prompting decreased."""	assistive technology;ipad	Tania Desai;Katherine Chow;Leslie Mumford;Fanny Hotze;Tom Chau	2014	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2014.07.009	psychology;simulation;multimedia;communication	HCI	-67.78024205694459	-47.09975412136633	19560

The executives in these organizations must make decisions rapidly and must often coordinate their decisions and actions with those of their fellow executives scattered all over the globe. Limited time and financial resources have created the fast-growing need to be able to do this efficiently through a computer-supported system. United States business schools, the training grounds for many of these executives, are attempting to address this new challenge. This paper presents an innovation in teaching that is on the cutting edge of business education. CATT, a groupware-based system for business case discussions breaks through existing geographic technological and mental barriers. It simulates the actual high stress environment executives face by allowing for on-going international discussions aimed at formulating a plan of action in a given business situation. Structured argumentation provides the framework for the description of all the facts and nuances of the case and the discussion as well as the later evaluation of student performance. The multi-media input and the feedback of both fellow students and instructors guide the discussion toward its ultimate conclusion, keeping in mind the specifics of the situation as well as experience gained from past case discussions. This paper outlines the present barriers to effective case discussions, the key design objectives of CAIT, the system's major characteristics and the future directions of this field of research. The word education means, literally, the process of leading out. Thus we are talking of the way in which all your faculties and capacities should be encouraged to expand and unfold themselves.

f86c96d4abf15a71a676da0d31619920e9717bb4	irrational privacy?		The purpose of this symposium is to consider the implications of important recent work at the intersection of behavioral economics and information privacy. There is much to celebrate in this work, which has improved our understanding of the ways that markets in personal information actually function. Yet behavioral economic analysis has done little to defuse the most intractable problem that emerges from the study of so-called “information privacy markets.” The problem appears initially as a question of terminology. Discussing whether or not information privacy markets work presumes something rather important about what exactly such markets produce. The terminological question leads into an epistemological difficulty that has bedeviled information privacy law and policy: explaining what information privacy markets produce (if not “information privacy”) can cause information privacy claims to seem irrational at the most basic level. This essay seeks to force the epistemological question onto the behavioral economists’ table. I will first argue that the term “information privacy markets” is a misnomer; information privacy markets do not in fact produce more information privacy but instead produce its opposite: more and more information about the actual or hypothesized attributes of individuals and groups. It does not follow, however, that a condition of information privacy (i.e., a condition of diminished or restricted access to personal information) is inherently antithetical to knowledge. Information privacy markets produce one kind of knowledge, but not the only kind. The condition of information privacy, and the kinds of knowledge it privileges, are best understood not as irrational but as differently rational—predicated on an approach to knowledge that we do not prize nearly as much as we should. In other words, information privacy’s seeming irrationality should trouble us a lot less than it seems	computational complexity theory;information privacy law;personally identifiable information;privilege (computing)	Julie E.

However, these educational innovations have not yet been implemented in some Latin American countries, so the present research searches to introduce the PLE approach in Ecuadorian university, taking advantage of the functionalities offered by mobile devices not only for leisure but for learning activities in informal environments and which are recognized and valued in the academy. Similarly it is intended that students identify with these new Mobile Personal Learning Environments as ecosystems of lifelong learning.	academy;ecosystem;mobile device	Patricio Humanante Ramos;Francisco J.

Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, no research work in the literature addressed the issue of automatically assessing the student’s argumentation quality, and the teaching load of the teacher that used the online argumentation support environments is not alleviated. In this work, an intelligent argumentation assessment system based on machine learning techniques for computer supported cooperative learning is proposed. Learners’ arguments on discussion board were examined by using argumentation element sequence to detect whether the learners address the expected discussion issues and to determine the argumentation skill level achieved by the learner. Learners are first assigned to heterogeneous groups based on their responses to the learning styles questionnaire given right before the beginning of learning activities on the e-learning platform. A feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to the learners in case the argumentation assessment system detects that the learners go in a biased direction. The Moodle, an open source software e-learning platform, was used to establish the cooperative learning environment for this study. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed work is effective in classifying and improving student’s argumentation level and assisting the students in learning the core concepts taught at a natural science course on the elementary school level. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

6ac11d8695a64277dbbd603ec3b45edf6ae41bd0	political facebook groups: micro-activism and the digital front stage		"""The growth of social networking sites (SNS), like Facebook, has caused many to rethink how we understand political activism and citizen engagement. In 2010, 43% of Internet users reported using social networking sites """" several times a day, """" a sizeable increase from 2009 where only 34% reported using social networking at the same rate (Pew 2010). Research on digital activism has emphasized the use of websites, listservs, and other forums by formal organizations to raise awareness for their specific causes (McCaughey and Ayers 2003; Van de Donk 2004). Information communication technologies (ICT's) have been regarded as particularly effective tools in mobilizing disparate, resource-poor counter-spheres in collective off-line activity (Van de Donk 2004). In recent years, scholars have moved away from viewing information communication technologies (ICT's) as simply a tool for formal activist organizations. Breindl (2010) argues that on-line digital activism has largely been examined through a classic """" social movement paradigm. """" She calls for scholarship that looks at how the meaning and structure of activism has been transformed by ICT's. One key way it has been transformed is by allowing for small scale, many-to-many forms of politically oriented communication, what I conceptualize as a new term: microactivism. Examples include the formation of political Facebook groups, re-tweeting of articles of political interest and sharing politically relevant videos on YouTube. These acts reflect micro-level intentions and are not necessarily geared towards mobilization like more traditional forms of digital activism. This microactivism has helped bring about a radical reformulation of the political arena. One major change that emerges from the ease of many-to-many communication brought about by SMS is the reduced incentive to join social movements (Earl and Schussman 2003). These new applications encourage movement entrepreneurs (Garrett 2006) not affiliated with formal social movements but interested in fomenting social change. The ease with which individuals can create content and connect with one another to share content is viewed by others as a harbinger of a more democratic and egalitarian society (Benkler 2006, Jenkins 2007, Shirky 2010). Salter (2005) argues that sites like SNS' provide new radical public spheres that provide additional spaces for voice cultivation and political citizenship formation. More importantly, in his view information technologies help shift political discourse to more informal venues that are less subject to elite control (Dahlberg 2004). Social critics like Morozov (2009) suggest, however, that microactivism might do more harm than good.

Because no technical or legal solutions are readily available, and awareness programs have limited impact, the only remedy is to develop a risk management process for consumers. Consumers need to understand the IT risks they face, and decide how to deal with them in an iterative and structured manner: implement technical mitigations, alter their behavior or simply accept the risks. Such a process is feasible: enterprises already execute such processes, and time-saving tools can support the consumer in her own process. In fact, given our society's emphasis on individual responsibilities, skills and devices, a risk management process for consumers is the logical next step in improving information security information security.	information security;iterative method;risk management	André van Cleeff	2010		10.1145/1900546.1900561	information security audit;cloud computing security;itil security management;countermeasure;security management;security through obscurity;security information and event management;consumer;asset;computer science;threat;information security;information security standards;security testing;privacy;computer security;information security management;social network	Security	-72.33952067273994	-9.531108944975633	19722

The experiment reported in this paper investigated the confirmation bias in a complex analysis task that is more characteristic of law enforcement investigations, financial analysis, and intelligence analysis. Participants were professionals, half of whom had intelligence analysis experience. The effectiveness of a procedure designed to mitigate the confirmation bias, called analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH), was tested. Results showed a confirmation bias for both experience groups, but ACH significantly reduced bias only for participants without intelligence analysis experience. Confirmation bias manifested as a weighting bias, not as an interpretation bias. Participants tended to agree on the interpretation of evidence (i.e., whose hypothesis was supported by the evidence) but tended to disagree on the importance of the evidence-giving more weight to the evidence that supported their preferred hypothesis and less weight to evidence that disconfirmed it.	automated clearing house;interpretation (logic)	Paul E.

Developed by a multi-functional team, the program uniquely combines multi-media interactive computer technology with empirically-validated cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques and crucial non-specific aspects of therapy. The paper describes how the project proceeded through its development phase, the unexpected hurdles that occurred and the lessons learnt. As an integral part of the development, the program was beta-tested with 20 patients. Despite the small numbers and the fact that the eight sessions were completed at an accelerated rate, feedback was positive. Patients reported it was helpful, easy to use, and of those who had had previous treatment for their problems, the majority indicated it compared at least as well as other forms of therapy. The beta-test also highlighted where changes were needed to the program. These were implemented prior to release of the program for the next phase of testing. Lastly, the beta-test indicated that the program had sufficient promise for it to be evaluated formally by randomized controlled trial.	software release life cycle	J. Proudfoot;S. Swain;S. Widmer;E.

In this context we propose a problem-centered tool based on the IBIS method initially developed for capturing design rationale. This tool aims at helping teachers to solve practical professional problems through a collaborative co- construction of solutions. A general model is given using among other things the three elements of the IBIS method (problem, position/solution, argument) and allowing multiple solutions for one problem. The problem description and solution construction steps are explained and the way teachers are connected from their profile is detailed. We also take into account a system of opinions and feedback about the usefulness of a solution. A use case is given to illustrate how the model is implemented.

We will explore how we as a community can work together to develop holistic programs to support student development and excellence. We will highlight the shortcomings, strengths and future of the Googler In Residence (GIR) program from the perspective of select participating colleges, as well as other successful initiatives in motion. It is also essential that promising interventions be shared and scaled across institutions that play an essential role in educating and preparing these students. We are still learning as we go, but this is an opportune time to come together as a community to share our challenges and solutions, to determine how we can move together and how we can all be involved as change advocates.

This proposal incorporates a simulation of programmers' psychology tuned with artificial agents' behaviours. The agents are a colony of ants, they perform their tasks collectively with optimized effort similar to any programming assignment in a software development project. The paper then investigates and addresses some issues relevant to monitoring and measurement of a programmer's psychology, as well as evaluation of the acceptability of several new generation programming tools.

This is equally valid for regional, national, continental, and global levels, as will be illustrated in this paper. The paper describes the organizations involved and the current status of the LA standardization efforts. The crucial role that LA plays within the spatial information infrastructure is analyzed; including the relationship LA does have with other registrations and themes within the information infrastructure, of which some are non-spatial ones, such as persons. Special attention is given to a number of global aspects related to LA: combating slums (UN-HABITAT), stabilizing post-conflict areas, development of LA based on free/libre/open source software (UN-FAO) and climate change. Finally, the concept of ‘land administration levels of maturity’ is introduced and four stages of maturity are identified: 1. Standards, 2. Connectivity, 3. Integration, and 4. Network. The LA initiatives described earlier in the paper are assessed in the context of these levels of maturity.	cen/xfs;capability maturity model;data recovery;domain model;earthbound;elegant degradation;fao country profiles;global serializability;graphical user interface;interoperability;köppen climate classification;land administration;map matching;open-source software;system administrator;theme (computing);topography	Peter van Oosterom;Arco Groothedde;Christiaan Lemmen;Paul van der Molen;Harry Uitermark	2009	IJSDIR		information infrastructure;geography;environmental resource management;operations management	HCI	-63.858122666070415	-5.746777617198091	20104

The idea of learning-through-apprenticeship is long accepted in medicine and, more generally, in the health sciences, where practicum courses are an essential part of most curricula. Because of the high cost of apprenticeship programs -- mentors can usually supervise few trainees and trainees may need long apprenticeship periods - simulation has long been adopted as a learning-by-doing training method that can supplement apprenticeship in many professional and engineering programs, including the health sciences. In this paper, we describe our experience developing virtual world-based training systems for two healthcare contexts. In one, procedural training was emphasized, while the other focused on teaching communication skills. In each case, we developed a custom set of tools to meet the needs of that context. We present an analysis of the case studies, and lessons drawn from this analysis.	procedural programming;simulation;teaching method;virtual world	David Chodos;Eleni Stroulia;Patricia M.

bcefb15246b1c9cea74a49a4ba1c990b6b97a19c	review on the effects of age, gender, and race demographics on automatic face recognition		The performance of face recognition algorithms is affected by external factors and internal subject characteristics. Identifying these aspects and understanding their behaviors on performance can aid in predicting the performance of algorithms and in designing suitable acquisition settings at prospective locations to enhance performance. Factors that affect the performance of face recognition systems, such as pose, illumination, expression, and image resolution, are recognized as face recognition problems. These are substantially studied, and many algorithms have been developed to tackle these problems. However, the influence of population demographics (i.e., race, age, and gender) on face recognition performance has not received considerable attention. Early findings that deal with demographic influence give conflicting results. The studies conducted in the last decade resolve some of the contentions. Nonetheless, some findings have not reached consensus. Existing reviews on the influence of covariates are either outdated or do not cover the influence of demographic covariates on the performance of face recognition algorithms. This paper gives an intensive and focused review that covers recent research on demographic covariates. The effects of age, gender, and race covariates on face recognition are summarized based on these findings, and suggestions on the future direction of the field are given to have a significant understanding of these effects individually and their interactions with one another.	algorithm;consensus (computer science);facial recognition system;illumination (image);image resolution;interaction;prospective search;race condition	Miguel A.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Muhammadiyah Palembang (UMP) has had personnel information system which is used to manage HR data both employees and lecturers. However, the information system is to support the operational activities only. Therefore it is necessary to build an executive information system (SIE) in the faculty is the dean. By using the SIE, the dean can easily access summary data visualization, namely the appearance of information in the form of graphs making it easier for executives to make decisions.	data visualization;executive information system;sie (file format)	Fauzan Aziz;Leon Andretti Abdillah;Novri Hadinata	2015	CoRR		human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;operations management;management;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-63.516365526731676	-0.07829611000741646	20151

For the first time the Cup included insight problems in addition to prediction problems, thus posing new challenges in both the knowledge discovery and the evaluation criteria, and highlighting the need to “peel the onion” and drill deeper into the reasons for the initial patterns found. We chronicle the data generation phase starting from the collection at the site through its conversion to a star schema in a warehouse through data cleansing, data obfuscation for privacy protection, and data aggregation. We describe the information given to the participants, including the questions, site structure, the marketing calendar, and the data schema. Finally, we discuss interesting insights, common mistakes, and lessons learned. Three winners were announced and they describe their own experiences and lessons in the pages following this paper.	a* search algorithm;data aggregation;data mining;experience;star schema	Ron Kohavi;Carla E.

These plots can be obtained easily by representing journals as points in a two-dimensional space defined by the citations (y-axis) and citable items (x-axis) used to compute the journal impact factor (JIF). The slope of the line from the origin to the point representing the journal is the JIF. The use of JIF-Plots is illustrated with different subject categories and journals, and with the JIF obtained with a 2-year and a 5-year window. The distribution of journals according to different distances illustrates new scientometric relationships. JIF-Plots can also be used to study and compare the temporal evolution of different journals in terms of JIF, citations and citable items. This tool is straightforward to implement and its powerful visual impact can help elucidate relationships among journals from a new viewpoint.	apache axis;optic axis of a crystal;scientometrics;web of science;world wide web	Juan Miguel Campanario	2017	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-017-2506-8	data mining;information retrieval;computer science;impact factor	DB	-76.89959513461639	-21.264239481169028	20181

The apparent draught in new ideas in database system education is even more surprising given the fact that this area of computer science has arguably undergone its most significant changes for more than 30 years within the last 5 to 10 years. Many new database system paradigms (most of them appearing under the NoSQL label) have been introduced for various reasons. Some of these massively distributed database systems facilitate unprecedented data processing capabilities often labeled as BigData. In order to offer a sustainable and practical CS education, at least some of those new paradigms and methodologies should be included into database education. The BoF is meant to continue the discussion from the 2014 BoF about which of those deserve inclusion into a typical CS curriculum and (even more interestingly) at what time in the curriculum and by replacing what other topics. It shall offer participants a forum to share their opinions and ideas on recent and future changes in database system education as well as to present practical experiences with new concepts picked up at last year's BoF or elsewhere.	big data;computer science;distributed database;nosql	Carsten Kleiner	2015		10.1145/2676723.2691835	curriculum;big data;computer science;data science;software engineering;data mining	DB	-64.24809721764483	-26.229898493961166	20184

The Tutor uses decision networks also called influence diagrams, to improve the development of resources and learning materials in a learning content management system, to offer students the best pedagogical decision according to their performance. The intelligent learning system is validated in an online environment. The results of the evaluation process in undergraduate engineering courses are encouraging because they show improvements in student's learning who used this approach, compared to those who did not use it. The paper also shows the potential application of this learning approach for power system's operators.	artificial intelligence;content management system;influence diagram	Liliana Argotte-Ramos;Julieta Noguez;Gustavo Arroyo-Figueroa	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25324-9_19	robot learning;proactive learning;multi-task learning;instance-based learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;algorithmic learning theory;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;experiential learning;machine learning;multimedia;active learning;action learning;adaptive learning;active learning;synchronous learning	AI	-79.86801808332301	-45.30294473025554	20193

The aim of this research is evaluate the acceptance and use of Moodle as an open source application from the viewpoint of both professors and students at the American University of Beirut. The theoretical framework for this study is drawn from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to investigate user intentions toward Moodle. The participants were 189 professors and 1,867 students who completed an online survey, evaluating a set of 30 items on a scale of five that reflected the UTAUT constructs applied to Moodle. An exploratory factor analysis was employed and generated five factors: community influence, satisfaction, service quality, learnability and technical quality. Repeated measures ANOVA showed community influence as the highest rated by participants, followed by satisfaction, service quality, learnability and technical quality. Also, two open-ended questions were included to solicit comments from users about various features that should be integrated into this free open source application.	exploratory factor analysis;learnability;nonlinear gameplay;open-source software;quality of service;social constructivism	Hoda Baytiyeh	2013	IJICTE	10.4018/ijicte.2013100103	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;sociology;world wide web;middle east;pedagogy	HCI	-75.4145456949012	-40.32142163357169	20206

The fact that the internet knows no jurisdictional boundaries stretches this difficulty a step further as one will then have to deal with the jurisdictional issues in the transnational gathering of evidence in digital crimes. In Australia, the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act 1979 was amended in 2012 by the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Act 2012. The Act allows Australia to accede to the Council of Europeu0027s Convention on Cybercrime. The Telecommunications Interception and Access Act 1979 has been criticised due to privacy concerns as there are no restrictions on the use of information requested by foreign countries. This article examines the challenges in transnational evidence gathering in cybercrime in Australian law and its challenges internationally.	international cybercrime	Jenny Ng	2016	IJICT	10.1504/IJICT.2016.10000120	tort;privacy laws of the united states;computer security	Logic	-72.05428767826442	-10.346871847809382	20265

Computer and computational sciences, especially in academia and research laboratories may not be making as effective use of internship opportunities. In discussing why they do not consider including students in their development projects, staff and management often cite personal lack of time, mentoring skills, and money as barriers to what they would consider an effective internship initiative.This BOF will provide an opportunity for students, supervisors, and other interested people to talk about how to identify internship opportunities and deal with perceived barriers that inhibit sites from offering pre-service opportunities to high school and college students. Discussions will focus on sharing successful strategies for capitalizing on the enthusiasm and availability of the next wave of scientists and technologists.	computation;computational science;computer;supercomputer	Laura F.

Millions of users enjoy downloads of billions of media files such as songs or movies. But where do these files come from? While the economic rationale to download files is obvious, the motives of individuals to actually share and, therefore, internalize the costs (i.e. the risk of being sued for copyright infringement) are less obvious. Consequently, empirical studies have shown a large proportion of users demanding files but not offering any and, therefore, free riding on their peers. Nevertheless, sharing can be rational. This paper offers a theoretical base to explain sharing behavior and proves that the users' utility considerations depend on the network's life cycle. At the beginning of a network's life cycle the incentives to share files are high if an individual understands the economics of network externalities. Nonetheless, the user's utility to share files decreases over time, especially if the network grows and becomes anonymous. The strategies of individual users to share or free ride are explained using game theoretic approaches. Depending on the life cycle, the expectations and utilities of the users differ, leading to various games and optimal strategies. We empirically test our hypotheses using mixture regression models and explain the rationale of sharers in different stages of the life cycle. In order to prevent the (theoretically) inevitable break-down of the file sharing network, the authors finally present strategies for file sharing networks to enhance the user's willingness to share.	design rationale;download;game theory;internet;object lifetime;peer-to-peer file sharing	Jan U.

The study of social networks using longitudinal data may provide new insights into how this collaborative research evolve over time as well as what type of actors influence the whole network in time. The methods and findings presented in this work aim to assist identifying key actors in other research collaboration networks. In doing so, we apply a rank aggregation technique to centrality measures in order to derive a single ranking of influential actors. We argue that there is a strong correlation between the level of degree and closeness centralities of an actor and its influence in the research collaboration network (at macro/country level).	centrality;embnet.journal;scopus;social network	Seyedamir Tavakoli Taba;Liaquat Hossain;Simon Reay Atkinson;Sarah J.

It aims to focus on one technique to solve this dilemma – the creation of a multi-media tutorial: Library 101: Introduction to Research. The paper aims to educate librarians of the many technological tools, which could be employed to enrich library instruction. Design/methodology/approach – Using the Oakleaf Information Literacy Instruction Assessment Cycle (ILIAC), librarians gathered assessment data and determined student research skill deficits in Fall 2009. To address knowledge gaps, the authors systematically designed a multi-media tutorial with ten tools. Findings – The paper finds that the tutorial identified students’ areas of weakness prior to library instruction. As a result, librarians could focus on identified topics during the session and increase student learning. Annual re-evaluation of the tools and data are needed in order to update the program and ensure student learning occurs. Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the creation process include incomplete software evaluation early in the process, learning how to collaborate with different project management styles, developing a realistic timeline, and the need for a robust assessment management system to collect data. The effectiveness of this tutorial needs more empirical evaluation. Practical implications – The paper may help inform those planning to create a tutorial by suggesting useful, low-cost tools for its creation and determining how to incorporate student learning outcomes and assessment into asynchronous instruction. Originality/value – This paper fulfills an identified need to determine students’ knowledge gaps through learning outcome assessment and respond to these gaps with asynchronous instruction methods.	asynchronous i/o;book;download;engine control unit;information literacy;librarian;logical connective;sorting;timeline	Amy Gustavson;David Hisle;Angela Whitehurst	2011	Library Hi Tech	10.1108/07378831111189796	computer science;information literacy;instructional design;management system;multimedia;management;world wide web;educational assessment	HCI	-77.86339083226447	-38.109876633860715	20336
