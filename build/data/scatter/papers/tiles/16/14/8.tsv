This article introduces  Chains , a computer language whose basic datatypes are cells, cell complexes, and  k -chains. To illustrate how  Chains  may be used in numerical computing, we develop a two page  Chains  program that completely specifies a finite element solution to plane strain, including symbolic definition of quadratic shape functions, the related “element stiffness matrices”, and an algebraic-topological specification of the assembly process. In contrast to a textbook derivation of the finite element method (which it closely resembles), this program is a fully formal finite element computation, and hence is a step towards the goal of improving the process of creating software for scientific computing by raising the semantic level at which physical systems are specified.	executable;finite element method	Richard S.

The oscillatory singularity fields are researched. The stress functions are chosen which contain twelve undetermined coefficients and an unknown singularity exponent. Based on the boundary conditions and linear independence, the system of twelve nonhomogeneous linear equations is derived. According to the condition for the system of nonhomogeneous linear equations which has a solution, the singularity exponent is determined. Total coefficients are found by means of successive elimination of the unknowns.The theoretical formulae of stress intensity factors and analytic solutions of stress field near the interface crack tip are obtained. The crack tip field is shown by figures.		Xiaomei Yang;Weiyang Yang;Junlin Li;Xuexia Zhang	2013	J.

13b2273fe71f9278b91927b04827446c589fe884	a noncausal framework for model-based feedback control of spatially developing perturbations in boundary-layer flow systems. part ii: numerical simulations using state feedback	computational grid;control regularization;state feedback;spatially localized convolution kernels;direct numerical simulation;boundary layer dns;boundary layer;spatial locality;flow control;state feedback control;feedback control;numerical simulation	We present numerical results illustrating the successful state feedback control of a spatially developing boundary-layer &ow system. Control is applied using the noncausal framework developed in Part I of this study. After addressing some important regularization issues related to the proper treatment of the in5nite-dimensional nature and semi-in5nite spatial extent of the present system, we compute the state-feedback control gains according to the equations developed in Part I at several spanwise wavenumbers . We then inverse transform the result to obtain spatial convolution kernels for determining the control feedback. The e8ectiveness of the controls computed using these feedback kernels, which are well resolved on the computational grid and spatially localized in the spanwise direction, is tested using direct numerical simulation of the boundary-layer &ow system. A signi5cant damping of the &ow perturbation is observed, which is of the same order as the damping that arises when applying signi5cantly more expensive iterative adjoint-based control optimization schemes. c © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

14d69091e204869fd2ce424f9a5d5c97392cb5fc	steady state convergence acceleration of the generalized lattice boltzmann equation with forcing term through preconditioning	numerical stability;47 11 j;kinetic equation;47 65 md;lorentz force;three dimensions;steady state flows;preconditioning;05 20 dd;stationary state;kinetic theory;low mach number;relaxation time;lattice boltzmann method;multiple relaxation time model;magnetohydrodynamics;lattice boltzmann equation;navier stokes equation;steady state;convergence acceleration	Several applications exist in which lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) are used to compute stationary states of fluid motions, particularly those driven or modulated by external forces. Standard LBM, being explicit time-marching in nature, requires a long time to attain steady state convergence, particularly at low Mach numbers due to the disparity in characteristic speeds of propagation of different quantities. In this paper, we present a preconditioned generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) with forcing term to accelerate steady state convergence to flows driven by external forces. The use of multiple relaxation times in the GLBE allows enhancement of the numerical stability. Particular focus is given in preconditioning external forces, which can be spatially and temporally dependent. In particular, correct forms of moment-projections of source/forcing terms are derived such that they recover preconditioned Navier-Stokes equations with non-uniform external forces. As an illustration, we solve an extended system with a preconditioned lattice kinetic equation for magnetic induction field at low magnetic Prandtl numbers, which imposes Lorentz forces on the flow of conducting fluids. Computational studies, particularly in three-dimensions, for canonical problems show that the number of time steps needed to reach steady state is reduced by orders of magnitude with preconditioning. In addition, the preconditioning approach resulted in significantly improved stability characteristics when compared with the corresponding single relaxation time formulation.

This method is based upon the minimization of a functional related to the error in the constitutive magnetic relationship, while constraints represented by Maxwell’s equations are imposed by means of Lagrange multipliers. In this way, both the magnetic field and the magnetic induction field can be approximated by using the most appropriate family of vector finite elements, and boundary conditions can be imposed in a natural way. Moreover, this method is more suitable than classical approaches for the approximation of problems featuring strong discontinuities of the magnetic permeability, as is usually the case. A finite element discretization involving faceandedge elements is also proposed, performing stability analysis and giving error estimates.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;calculus of variations;computation;discretization;experiment;finite element method;lagrange multiplier;maxwell (microarchitecture);navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis	Ilaria Perugia	1999	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s002110050473	mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;mathematical analysis;extended finite element method;magnetic field;boundary value problem;finite element method;calculus;mathematics;lagrange multiplier;mixed finite element method;quantum mechanics	ML	89.26300821650688	11.2454118194573	109782

The algorithm consists of the robust multigrid technique (variant of the geometric multigrid methods with the problem-independent transfer operators) and the smoothing procedure based on Gauss-Seidel iterations with block unknown ordering. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that close-to-optimal convergence rate for many (non)linear problems is obtained with the same multigrid components. Proposed approach can be used in black box software.	academy;algorithm;black box;computation;experiment;gauss–seidel method;iteration;multigrid method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;smoothing	Serguei Martynenko	2013	IJCSM	10.1504/IJCSM.2013.058058	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;multigrid method;robustness	Robotics	89.43825562834715	15.65354712621361	110239

We introduce a new scheme for proving lower bounds and show the bounds are asymptotically sharp for certain domains and boundary conditions. Our results support the conjecture, due to Aviles and Giga, that folds are onedimensional, i.e.,∇u varies mainly in the direction transverse to the fold. We also consider related problems obtained when (1− |∇u|2)2 is replaced by(1− δux − uy) or (1− |∇u|2)2γ .	boundary case;calculus of variations;transverse wave;variational principle	Weimin Jin;Robert V.

[6,7,11]). However, if a function exhibits localized behaviors such as sharp interfaces, very thin internal or boundary layers, using a standard Gauss-type grid usually fails to produce an accurate approximation with a reasonable number of degrees of freedom. Thus, it is advisable to use a grid which is adapted to the local behaviors of the underlying function. Since spectral methods can not gracefully handle an arbitrarily locally refined grid, a popular strategy is to use a suitable mapping which transforms a function having sharp interfaces in the physical domain to a well behaved function on the computational domain. Thus, to better understand what are the impacts of the mapping on the approximation, it is necessary to study the properties of the mapped polynomials.	approximation;computation;finite difference;finite element method;jacobi method;polynomial;spectral method	Li-Lian Wang;Jie Shen	2005	J.

A local representation of the OT boundary conditions is combined with a finite difference scheme for the Monge-Ampère equation. Newton’s method is implemented leading to a fast solver, comparable to solving the Laplace equation on the same grid several times. Theoretical justification for the method is given by a convergence proof in the companion paper [BFO12]. In this paper, the algorithm is modified to a simpler compact stencil implementation and details of the implementation are given. Solutions are computed with densities supported on non-convex and disconnected domains.

To address this issue, we present a set of preconditioners for the Schur complement domain decomposition method. They implement a global coupling mechanism, through coarse space components, similar to the one proposed in 3]. The deeni-tion of the coarse space components is algebraic, they are deened using the mesh partitioning information and simple interpolation operators. These preconditioners are implemented on distributed memory computers without introducing any new global synchronization in the preconditioned conjugate gradient iteration. The numerical and parallel scalability of those preconditioners is illustrated on two-dimensional model examples that have anisotropy and/or discontinuity phenomena.	coarse space (numerical analysis);computer;conjugate gradient method;distributed memory;domain decomposition methods;interpolation;iteration;numerical analysis;preconditioner;reflections of signals on conducting lines;scalability;schur complement method;tcp global synchronization	Luiz Mariano Carvalho;Luc Giraud;Patrick Le Tallec	2001	SIAM J.

b82ff9841b791b2d9f7feb03a786a36db0be8b91	applications of the numerical inversion of the laplace transform to unsteady problems of the third grade fluid		In this article, we have effectively used the Numerical Inversion of Laplace transform to study some time dependent problems of the third grade fluid. To do so, we have considered three different types of unsteady flows of the third grade fluid, namely (a) Unsteady flow over a flat rigid plate with porous medium. (b) Unsteady MHD flow in a porous medium. (c) Unsteady MHD flow in a non-porous space with Hall currents. The solution to the governing equation in each case is obtained by using the standard Laplace transform. However, to transform the obtained solutions from Laplace space back to the original space, we have used the Numerical Inversion of the Laplace transform. Graphical results for each case have been presented to show the effects of different parameters involved and to show how the fluid flow evolves with time. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Their space distribution is difficult to obtain by direct measurements. In this article we consider an inverse problem, where we aim at recovering α and β from space measurements of the magnetization. The evolution of the magnetization in micromagnetism is governed by the Landau–Lifshitz (LL) equation. We first study the sensitivity of the LL equation. We derive the existence, uniqueness and stability results for the LL equation and the corresponding sensitivity equations. On the basis of the results we analyze the inverse problem. We employ the energy method and we minimize the underlying cost functional by means of the steepest descent method. We derive a convergence result for the proposed algorithm.

In the present, novel method Hermite interpolation is used as point of departure. From this the second order derivative is obtained with degree of precision (2N+1) for the same grid as above. The associated theorem constitutes the main result of this paper. Based on that theorem a method in put forward in which the differential equation and the differentiated differential equation are simultaneously collocated. In this method every grid point counts for two. The double collocation leads to a solution accuracy which is superior to the precision obtained with the conventional method for the same grid. This superiority is demonstrated by 3 examples, 2 linear problems and a non-linear one. In the examples it is shown that the accuracy obtained with the present method is comparable to the solution accuracy of the standard method with twice the number of grid points. However, the condition number of the present method grows like N as compared to N in the standard method.	addendum;collocation method;condition number;euler–lagrange equation;hermite interpolation;iterative method;lagrange polynomial;microsoft outlook for mac;nonlinear system;open dynamics engine;period-doubling bifurcation;preconditioner;the matrix	D.

The nonlinear behavior is based on the equivalent linear method which considers the nonlinear variation of soil shear moduli and damping as a function of shear strain. Linear and non-linear analyses are performed by the stochastic Wilson-h method. Nonlinear response of a rock-fill dam disturbed by non-stationary random excitations is compared with the linear analysis. Meanwhile, some statistical responses obtained by the linear and nonlinear analyses are checked by the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Finally, the effect of deconvolution ground motion on the nonlinear response of dam-foundation system is investigated in this paper. Two different earthquake input mechanisms are used in the dynamic analysis: the standard rigid-base input and the deconvolved-base-rock input models. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this paper is to compare the contending measures and conservation laws.A consequence of the new measures is that power flux vanishes if the scalar and vector potentials are constant with respect to time, in contrast to the Poyn...

In addition to their intrinsic in terest, such techniques have applications in the recently proposed retrograde data assimi lation. As our model system we consider the terminal value problem for the Kuramoto–Sivas hinsky equation in a 1D periodic domain. Such backward problems are typical examples of ill–posed problem, where any disturbances are amplified exponentially during the bac kw rd march. Hence, regularization is required in order to solve such problem efficientl y in practice. We consider regularization approaches in which the original ill–posed prob lem is approximated with a less ill–posed problem obtained by adding a regularization term to the original equation. While such techniques are relatively well–understood for simple linear problems, in this work we investigate them carefully in the nonlinear setting and rep o t on some interesting universal behavior. In addition to considering regularization terms with fixed magnitudes, we also mention briefly a novel approach in which these magnitudes ar adapted dynamically using simple concepts from the Control Theory.

In this paper, we prove general order a priori error estimates for the \mcgq{} and \mdgq{} methods. To prove the error estimates, we represent the error in terms of a discrete dual solution and the residual of an interpolant of the exact solution. The estimates then follow from interpolation estimates, together with stability estimates for the discrete dual solution.	galerkin method	Anders Logg	2006	SIAM J.

The solutions we consider are periodic oscillations on a kink or standing wave breather background. The origin of these oscillations is the presence of internal modes, associated with the static ground state. Some of these modes are associated with the breaking of translational invariance, in going from a spatially continuous to a spatially discrete system. Others are associated with discrete modes which bifurcate from the continuous spectrum. It is also possible that such modes exist in the continuum limit and persist in the discrete case. The regimes of existence, stability and metastability of states as the lattice spacing is varied are investigated analytically and numerically. A consequence of our analysis is a class of spatially localized, time quasiperiodic solutions of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate, however, that this class of quasiperiodic solution is rather special and that its natural generalizations yield only metastable quasiperiodic solutions.	bifurcation theory;buckling;discrete fourier transform;discrete system;emergence;ground state;internationalization and localization;lattice constant;metastability in electronics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;schrödinger;triune continuum paradigm	Panayotis G.

This allows us to model fluid-body interaction without simulating the surrounding fluid at all. We explain some of the phenomena that arise and compare our results against real experiments. It turns out that many real scenarios (sinking bodies, balloons) can be matched using a single, hand-tuned scaling parameter. We describe how to integrate our method into an existing physics engine, which makes underwater rigid body dynamics run in real time.	experiment;image scaling;kirchhoff's theorem;physics engine;simulation	Steffen Weißmann;Ulrich Pinkall	2012	ACM Trans.

These bases have successfully been used both in the analysis and numerical treatment of the Stokes and Navier–Stokes equations. In this paper, we construct stable wavelet bases for the stream function spaces H(curl; Ω). Moreover, curl-free vector wavelets are constructed and analysed. The relationship between H(div; Ω) and H(curl; Ω) are expressed in terms of these wavelets. We obtain discrete (orthogonal) Hodge decompositions. Our construction works independently of the space dimension, but in terms of general assumptions on the underlying wavelet systems in L2(Ω) that are used as building blocks. We give concrete examples of such bases for tensor product and certain more general domains Ω ⊂ Rn. As an application, we obtain wavelet multilevel preconditioners in H(div; Ω) and H(curl; Ω).	biorthogonal wavelet;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;preconditioner;curl	Karsten Urban	2001	Math.

An overview of the method is given for general domains, followed by a discussion of the improved efficiencies and simplifications possible for rectangular domains. A very-high-level description is given of three specific collocation algorithms that use Hermite bicubic basic functions, (1) GENCOL (collocation on general two-dimensional domains), (2) HERMCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with general linear boundary conditions), and (3) INTCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with uncoupled boundary conditions). The linear system resulting from INTCOL has half the bandwidth of that from HERMCOL, which provides substantial benefit in solving the system. We provide some examples showing the range of applicability of the algorithms and some performance profiles illustrating their efficiency. Fortran implementations of these algorithms are given in the companion papers [10, 11].	approximation algorithm;bicubic interpolation;collocation method;fortran;high- and low-level;linear system	Elias N.

The methods use piecewise polynomials of degree k ź 0 for both the flux and numerical trace, and piecewise polynomials of degree k + 1 for the potential. We establish error estimates for the numerical flux and potential under the minimal regularity condition. Moreover, we construct a local postprocessing for the flux, which produces a numerical flux with better conservation. Numerical experiments in two-space dimensions confirm our theoretical results.

We construct some indicator functions for this inverse problem using the far-field pattern directly, without the necessity of transforming the far field to the near field. Based on careful singularity analysis, these indicator functions enable us to reconstruct the shape of the obstacle and distinguish the coated from the noncoated part of the boundary. Moreover, an explicit representation formula for the surface impedance in the coated part of the boundary is also given. Our reconstruction scheme reveals that the coated part of the obstacle is less visible than the noncoated one, which corresponds to the physical fact that the coated boundary absorbs some part of the scattered wave. Numerics are presented for the reconstruction formulas, which show that both the boundary shape and the surface impedance in the coated part of the boundary can be reconstructed accurately. The theoretical reconstruction techniques proposed in this work can be applied in the practical 3-dimensional electromagnetic inverse scattering problems with promising numerical performance. Such problems are of great importance in the design of nondetectable obstacles.	acoustic cryptanalysis;characteristic function (convex analysis);characteristic impedance;cylinder-head-sector;near field communication;nominal impedance;numerical analysis;prototype;radar;radiation pattern;reconstruction filter	J.

The scheme is derived from the master equations for the evolution of the probability density of a sum of discrete time random walks. We show that the diffusion limit of the master equations recovers the fractional partial differential equation of interest. This limiting procedure guarantees the consistency of the numerical scheme. The positivity of the solution and stability results are simply obtained, provided that the underlying process is well posed. We also show that the method can be applied to standard reaction-diffusion equations. This work highlights the broader applicability of using discrete stochastic processes to provide numerical schemes for partial differential equations, including fractional partial differential equations.	numerical method;stochastic process	Christopher Angstmann;Isaac C.

It is an extension of the time splitting developed by Jin, Pareschi, and Toscani [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 38 (2000), pp. 913–936] but uses spatial discretizations on staggered grids, which preserves the discrete diffusion limit with a more compact stencil. The first novelty of this paper is that we propose a staggering in two dimensions that requires fewer unknowns than one could have naively expected. The second contribution of this paper is that we rigorously analyze the scheme of Jin, Pareschi, and Toscani. We show that the scheme is AP and obtain an explicit CFL condition, which couples a hyperbolic and a parabolic condition. This type of condition is common for asymptotic preserving schemes and guarantees uniform stability with respect to the mean free path. In addition, we obtain an upper bound on the relaxation parameter, which is the crucial parameter of the used time discretization. Several numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy and asymptotic property of the scheme.		Kerstin Küpper;Martin Frank;Shi Jin	2016	SIAM J.

The method retains essential conservation properties by stabilizing only the portion of the constraint orthogonal to a coarse multiplier space. This stabilization can easily be applied within iterative methods or semi-implicit time integrators that avoid directly solving a saddle point problem for the Lagrange multiplier field. Heart valve simulations demonstrate applicability of the proposed method to 3D unsteady simulations.

Two subproblems, i.e. the Vlasov-Poisson problem and homogeneous Landau problem, are obtained through time-splitting methods, and treated separately by the Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin method and a conservative spectral method, respectively. To ensure conservation when projecting between the two different computing grids, a special conservation routine is designed to link the solutions of these two subproblems. This conservation routine accurately enforces conservation of moments in Fourier space. The entire numerical scheme is implemented with parallelization with hybrid MPI and OpenMP. Numerical experiments are provided to study linear and nonlinear Landau Damping problems and two-stream flow problem as well.	approximation;computational engineering;dvb-s2;discontinuous galerkin method;experiment;flow network;functional programming;grid computing;ibm notes;isometric projection;kde plasma 5;landau–zener formula;linear programming relaxation;message passing interface;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;openmp;parallel computing;plasma active;runge–kutta methods;solver;spectral method;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chenglong Zhang;Irene M.

7ce6bbf86159c0f30e8086f9c8a1bc6e480437f8	monte carlo simulation of excitation and ionization collisions with complexity reduction		Abstract Kinetic simulation of plasmas with detailed excitation and ionization collisions presents a significant computational challenge due to the multiscale feature of the collisional rates. In the present work, we propose a complexity reduction method based on atomic level grouping for modeling excitation and ionization collisions. High order of accuracy of the reduction method is realized by allowing an internal distribution within each group. We apply the reduction method to the standard Monte Carlo collision algorithm to model an atomic Hydrogen plasma. Numerical results suggest that the stiffness of the collisional kinetics can be significantly reduced with minimal loss in accuracy.	monte carlo method;reduction (complexity);simulation	Hai P.

Inverse IVBV problems are prominent in science and engineering problems governed by partial differential equations where often an effect is measured and the cause is not known. In these situations scientists and engineers typically observe the response of a system and desire to know the particulars of the system that elicited such a response. In this paper, an artificial immune system (AIS) is used to monitor a physical system, to identify the need for solving an inverse IVBV problem within that system, and to solve said problem. Specifically, an AIS is used to determine the heat conducting properties of a material that elicits a measured temperature distribution response when subjected to time-varying boundary temperatures. Results indicate that the AIS provides an effective mechanism for solving this particular inverse IVBV problem.	algorithmic efficiency;artificial immune system;effective method	Charles L.

Optimal strong convergence is shown for Chorin’s time-splitting scheme in the case of solenoidal noise, while computational counter-examples show a poor convergence behavior in the case of general stochastic forcing. This sub-optimal performance may be traced back to the non-regular pressure process in the case of general noise. A modified version of the deterministic time-splitting method that distinguishes between the deterministic and stochastic pressure removes this deficiency, leading to optimal convergence behavior.	angular defect;bellman equation;computation;dtime;iteration;navier–stokes equations;symplectic integrator;velocity (software development)	Erich Carelli;Erika Hausenblas;Andreas Prohl	2012	SIAM J.

In this context, it is important to plan a method able to distinguish the presence or absence of defects within welds as well as a robust procedure able to characterize the defect itself. In this paper, an innovative solution that exploits a rotating magnetic field is presented. This approach has been carried out by a finite element model. Within this framework, it is necessary to consider techniques able to offer advantages in terms of sensibility of analysis, strong reliability, speed of carrying out, low costs: its implementation can be a useful support for inspectors. To this aim, it is necessary to solve inverse problems which are mostly ill-posed; in this case, the main problems consist on both the accurate formulation of the direct problem and the correct regularization of the inverse electromagnetic problem. We propose a heuristic inversion, regularizing the problem by the use of an Elman network. Experimental results are obtained using a database created through numerical modeling, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.	artificial neural network;database;finite element method;heuristic;matrix regularization;numerical analysis;recurrent neural network;strips;software bug;well-posed problem	Matteo Cacciola;Giuseppe Megali;Diego Pellicanò;Francesco Carlo Morabito	2011	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-011-0609-3	nondestructive testing;machine learning	AI	96.6452548071112	7.404423005885364	113241

For this, the bifurcation type buckling theory of thin-walled composite beam subjected to an axial compressive force is developed by extending the nonlinear anisotropic thin-walled beam theory proposed by Bauld and Tzeng. From the stability equations, the explicit expressions for displacements are derived based on the displacement state vector consisting of 14 displacements, and then the element stiffness matrix is determined using the force–deformation relations. In addition, as a special case, the analytical solutions for buckling loads of the orthotropically laminated composite beams with various boundary conditions are derived. To demonstrate the validity and the accuracy of this study, the numerical solutions are presented and compared with the analytical solutions and the finite element results using the Hermitian beam elements and ABAQUS’s shell elements. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is applied to two-dimensional flow around fixed and moving cylinders for Reynolds numbers in the range 3×101 ≤ Re ≤ 105. The compression ratios up to 1 000 are achieved. For the first time it is demonstrated in actual dynamic simulations that the compression scales like Re1/2 over five orders of magnitude, while computational complexity scales like Re.

Using a relaxation approximation, the nonlinear equation is transformed to a semilinear diagonalizable problem with linear characteristic variables. Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are used for the advection stage while an implicit–explicit scheme solves the relaxation stage. The main advantages of this approach are neither Riemann problem solvers nor linear iterations are required during the solution process. Moreover, the characteristic-based relaxation method is unconditionally stable such that no CFL conditions are imposed on the selection of time steps. Numerical results are shown for models on traffic flows and two-phase flows. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions for such conservation laws with discontinuous fluxes are not known mathematically. We have used the approach of explicitly constructing the entropy solutions to a sequence of approximate problems in which the flow-density relationship is continuous but tends to the discontinuous flux when a small parameter in this sequence tends to zero. The limit of the entropy solutions for this sequence is explicitly constructed and is considered to be the entropy solution associated with the discontinuous flux. We apply this entropy solution construction procedure to solve four representative traffic flow cases, compare them with numerical solutions obtained by a high order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme, and discuss the results from traffic flow perspectives.	approximation algorithm;concave function;diagram;downstream (software development);entropy (information theory);explicit and implicit methods;gradient;higher-order function;initial condition;jam;lu decomposition;numerical analysis;piecewise linear continuation;polynomial;quadratic function;regular language description for xml;scott continuity	Yadong Lu;Sze Chun Wong;Mengping Zhang;Chi-Wang Shu	2009	Transportation Science	10.1287/trsc.1090.0277	computer simulation;entropy;mathematical optimization;binary entropy function;maximum entropy probability distribution;principle of maximum entropy;calculus;traffic flow;mathematics;geometry;flux;joint quantum entropy;configuration entropy;entropy rate	Theory	85.19595291270642	11.884991581838252	114196
7499af169f56ca708a5c7a64605cc228ec4db5dd	computing planetary interior normal modes with a highly parallel polynomial filtering eigensolver		A highly parallel algorithm has been developed and exploited to compute the planetary normal modes of the elastic-gravitational system, which is approximated via the mixed finite element method on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The eigenmodes of the relevant generalized eigenvalue problem were extracted by a Lanczos approach combined with polynomial filtering. In contrast with the standard shift-and-invert and the full-mode coupling algorithms, the polynomial filtering technique is ideally suited for solving large-scale 3-D interior eigenvalue problems since it significantly enhances the memory and computational efficiency without loss of accuracy. The parallel efficiency and scalability of this approach are demonstrated on Stampede2 at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the direct calculation of the normal modes of 3-D strongly heterogeneous planets, in particular, Earth and Mars, is made feasible via a combination of multiple matrix-free methods and a separation of the essential spectra.	approximation algorithm;bitap algorithm;eigenvalue algorithm;finite element method;lanczos resampling;matrix-free methods;mode coupling;normal (geometry);normal mode;parallel algorithm;planetary scanner;polynomial;scalability;speedup	Jia Shi;Ruipeng Li;Yuanzhe Xi;Yousef Saad;Maarten V. de Hoop	2018			parallel computing;computer science;lanczos resampling;mixed finite element method;filter (signal processing);eigendecomposition of a matrix;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;normal mode;parallel algorithm;polynomial;algorithm	HPC	94.35633601956046	10.58957867480612	114216

Coupling problems for mixed kind thermal boundary are worked out for reflective interfaces. Effects of various parameters are studied on the distributions of temperature, radiative and conductive heat fluxes. The results of the LBM in conjunction with the CVFEM have been found to compare very well with available results in the literature. So, the numerical approach is extended to deal with a practical combination of mixed boundary conditions in a transient multi-dimensional combined conductive radiative heat transfer problems in an emitting, absorbing, anisotropically scattering enclosure.	finite element method;lattice boltzmann methods	Raoudha Chaabane;Faouzi Askri;S.

7845284a20746ce4d7808360563d2055e62ce643	total value adjustment for european options with two stochastic factors. mathematical model, analysis and numerical simulation		Abstract In the present paper we derive novel (non)linear PDE models for pricing European options and the associated total value adjustment (XVA), when incorporating the counterparty risk. The main innovative aspect is the consideration of stochastic spreads instead of less realistic constant spreads previously used in the literature. For the nonlinear model, a rigorous mathematical analysis based on sectorial differential operators allows to state the existence and uniqueness of a solution. Moreover, for the numerical solution we propose an appropriate set of techniques based on the method of characteristics for time discretization, finite element for spatial discretization and fixed point iteration for the nonlinear terms. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the expected behaviour of the option prices and the total value adjustment.	computer simulation;mathematical model	Iñigo Arregui;Beatriz Salvador;Daniel Sevcovic;Carlos Vázquez	2018	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2018.05.012	differential operator;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;method of characteristics;fixed-point iteration;credit risk;finite element method;computer simulation;mathematics;discretization;nonlinear system	Metrics	85.72613145062452	15.8674109927825	114359

Using Fourier analysis we derive suitable families of transmission conditions in R3 that involve second order tangential differential operators and that guarantee convergence for both propagative and evanescent modes. Such families depend upon parameters that are chosen to optimize the convergence rate of the corresponding iterative algorithm. We then propose iterative solvers for the Maxwell equations based on a domain decomposition procedure where such conditions are enforced on the interface. Some numerical results for a two-domain decomposition show the effectiveness of the optimized interface conditions.	algorithm;domain decomposition methods;evanescent field;fixed point (mathematics);fourier analysis;generalized minimal residual method;iteration;iterative method;krylov subspace;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;rate of convergence	Ana Alonso Rodriguez;Luca Gerardo-Giorda	2006	SIAM J.

Our expansion is a small-time expansion because the expansion parameter is selected to be the square root of the length of monitoring interval. This expansion method is distinguished from many other pricing-oriented expansion algorithms in the literature due to two appealing features. First, we illustrate that it is possible to explicitly calculate not only the first several expansion terms but also any general expansion term in a systematic way. Second, the convergence of the expansion is proved rigorously under some regularity conditions. Numerical experiments suggest that the closed-form expansion formula with only a few terms (e.g., four terms up to the third order) is accurate, fast, and easy to implement for a broad range of diffusion models, even including those violating the regularity conditions.	algorithm;experiment;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;numerical method	Ning Cai;Chenxu Li;Chao Shi	2014	Math.

For elasticity applications, the near-nullspace of the operator includes the so-called rigid body modes (RBMs), which are not adequately represented by the classical AMG interpolation operators. In this paper we investigate several approaches for improving AMG convergence on linear elasticity problems by explicitly incorporating the near-nullspace modes in the range of the interpolation. In particular, we propose two new methods for extending any initial AMG interpolation operator to exactly fit the RBMs based on the introduction of additional coarse degrees of freedom at each node. Though the methodology is general and can be used to fit any set of near-nullspace vectors, we focus on the RBMs of linear elasticity in this paper. The new methods can be incorporated easily into existing AMG codes, do not require matrix inversions, and do not assume an aggregation approach or a finite element framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new interpolation operators on several 2D and 3D elasticity problems.

The velocity of the evolving surface is not given explicitly, but depends on the solution of the parabolic equation on the surface. Various velocity laws are considered: elliptic regularization of a direct pointwise coupling, a regularized mean curvature flow and a dynamic velocity law. A novel stability and convergence analysis for evolving surface finite elements for the coupled problem of surface diffusion and surface evolution is developed. The stability analysis works with the matrix-vector formulation of the method and does not use geometric arguments. The geometry enters only into the consistency estimates. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results.	experiment;finite element method;parabolic antenna;the matrix;velocity (software development)	Balázs Kovács;Buyang Li;Christian Lubich;Christian A.

The effectiveness of the multigrid method can be also exploited by using the finite element method. Finite Element Approximate Inverses in conjunction with Richardon's iterative method could be used as smoothers in the multigrid method. Thus, a new class of smoothers based on approximate inverses can be derived. Effectiveness of explicit approximate inverses relies in the fact that they are close approximants to the inverse of the coefficient matrix and are fast to compute in parallel. Furthermore, the proposed class of finite element approximate inverses in conjunction with the explicit preconditioned Richardson method yield improved results against the classic smoothers such as Jacobi method. Moreover, a dynamic relaxation scheme is proposed based on the Dynamic Over/Under Relaxation (DOUR) algorithm. Furthermore, results for multigrid preconditioned Krylov subspace methods, such as GMRES(res), IDR(s) and BiCGSTAB based on approximate inverse smoothing and a dynamic relaxation technique are presented for the steady-state convection-diffusion equation.	finite element method;multigrid method;numerical analysis;preconditioner	C.

cf3ff26e615a1a96b739495cb20c0423b1aa9f38	a stable tensor-based method for controlled fluid simulations		Abstract The association between fluids and tensors can be observed in some practical situations, such as diffusion tensor imaging and permeable flow. For simulation purposes, tensors may be used to constrain the fluid flow along specific directions. This requires a customized mathematical model for describing fluid motion influenced by tensor. In this work, we propose a formulation for fluid dynamics to locally change momentum, deflecting the fluid along intended paths. Building upon classical computer graphics approaches for fluid simulation, the numerical method is altered to accommodate the new formulation. Gaining control over fluid diffusion can also aid on visualization of tensor fields, where the detection and highlighting of paths of interest is often desired. Experiments show that the fluid adequately follows meaningful paths induced by the underlying tensor field, resulting in a method that is numerically stable and suitable for visualization and animation purposes.

Hereby, symbolic computation on the recently-proposed generalized higher-order variable-coefficient Hirota equation is performed, for certain ultrashort optical pulses propagating in a nonlinear inhomogeneous fiber. For the complex envelope function associated with the optical-pulse electric field in the fiber, an auto-Backlund transformation is worked out, along with a family of the analytic solutions. Both our Backlund transformation and analytic solutions depend on the optical-fiber variable coefficients which represent the effects of the first-order dispersion, second-order dispersion, third-order dispersion, Kerr nonlinearity, time delaying, phase modulation and gain/loss. Relevant constraints among those coefficients are also presented. We expect that the work could be of some use for the fiber-optics investigations.	bellman equation;coefficient;nonlinear system;optical fiber	Xin-Yi Gao	2017	Appl. Math.

Simple, commonly-used integration strategies for ODEs neglect these discontinuities, resulting in large errors. In contrast, available methods to resolve discontinuities exhibit total running times that scale like O(N^2) as the number of elements N->~. The resulting need to choose between either speed or accuracy frustrates attempts to gather well-converged statistical data from large ensembles of elements, a common goal in studies of coarsening. In this work, we introduce a numerical scheme, called Adaptive Localized Replay (ALR), which overcomes this dilemma, provided the underlying system has sparse neighbor dependence. By analyzing the system after each timestep, and then selectively re-simulating only those (small) parts of the system that were affected by discontinuities, we attain high-order accuracy while maintaining running times of O(N). Using a reference implementation of our algorithm, applied to a sample problem from the field of faceted surface evolution, we obtain convergence and runtime results for the ALR method, which compares favorably with existing methods.	dynamical system;simulation	Scott A.

It yields as its output an approximation of the strongly interacting state, as well as the numerical fluxes. The multidimensional Riemann problem produces a self-similar strongly-interacting state which is the result of several one-dimensional Riemann problems interacting with each other. To compute this strongly interacting state and its higher order moments we propose the use of a Galerkin-type formulation to compute the strongly interacting state and its higher order moments in terms of similarity variables. The use of substructure in the Riemann problem reduces numerical dissipation and, therefore, allows a better preservation of flow structures, like contact and shear waves. In this second part of a series of papers we describe how this technique is extended to unstructured triangular meshes. All necessary details for a practical computer code implementation are discussed. In particular, we explicitly present all the issues related to computational geometry. Because these Riemann solvers are Multidimensional and have Self-similar strongly-Interacting states that are obtained by Consistency with the conservation law, we call them MuSIC Riemann solvers. (A video introduction to multidimensional Riemann solvers is available on http://www.nd.edu/~dbalsara/Numerical-PDE-Course.)The MuSIC framework is sufficiently general to handle general nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws in multiple space dimensions. It can also accommodate all self-similar one-dimensional Riemann solvers and subsequently produces a multidimensional version of the same. In this paper we focus on unstructured triangular meshes. As examples of different systems of conservation laws we consider the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics as well as the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Several stringent test problems are solved for both PDE systems.	computation;computational geometry;critical section;emoticon;galerkin method;hypertext transfer protocol;interaction;numerical analysis;riemann problem;riemann solver;self-similarity;unstructured grid	Dinshaw S.

The corrector method is either an interior point method or a generalized Gauss--Newton method. The predictor is an Euler prediction based on the parameter sensitivities of the optimization problem. The benefit of a step size strategy in the predictor corrector scheme is shown by means of an example.	numerical continuation	Dirk Lebiedz;Jochen Siehr	2013	SIAM J.

The discretization is on a fixed reference (Eulerian) grid with an edge-based local h-refinement. The fluid phases are identified and advected using a level set function. The reference grid is then temporarily reconnected around the interfaces in order to maintain optimal interpolations accounting for the singularities. This method is simple and efficient, as demonstrated by the numerical examples on several free-surface problems.	3d projection	Tong Chen;Peter Dimitrov Minev;Krishnaswamy Nandakumar	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-24588-9_2	topology;calculus;mathematics;geometry	Vision	88.67412695370341	11.32368876064936	116413

We are interested in the case that the gas is in contact with the vacuum at a finite interval. This is a free boundary problem for the one-dimensional isentropic Navier--Stokes equations, and the free boundaries are the interfaces separating the gas from vacuum, across which the density changes continuously. The regularity and behavior of the solutions near the interfaces and expanding rate of the interfaces are studied. Smoothness of the solutions is discussed.

Buffa, G. Sangalli, and R. Vazquez, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 199 (2010), pp. 1143-1152]. The method is based on the construction of suitable B-spline spaces such that they verify a De Rham diagram. Its main advantages are that the geometry is described exactly with few elements, and the computed solutions are smoother than those provided by finite elements. In this paper we develop the theoretical background to the approximation of vector fields in IGA. The key point of our analysis is the definition of suitable projectors that render the diagram commutative. The theory is then applied to the numerical approximation of Maxwell source problems and eigenproblems, and numerical results showing the good behavior of the scheme are also presented.	isogeometric analysis	Annalisa Buffa;Judith Rivas;Giancarlo Sangalli;Rafael Vázquez	2011	SIAM J.

f6432893f6f11786fe9443bde98357508a854804	the k-version of finite element method for non-self-adjoint operators in bvp	finite element method;self adjoint operator	In this paper a new mathematical and computational framework for boundary value problems described by self-adjoint differential operators is presented. In this framework, numerically computed solutions, when converged, possess the same degree of global smoothness in terms of differentiability up to any desired order as the theoretical solutions. This is accomplished using spaces Ĥk,p that contain basis functions of degree p and order k - 1 (or the order of the space k). It is shown that the order of space k is an intrinsically important independent parameter in all finite element computational processes in addition to the discretization characteristic length h and the degree of basis functions p when the theoretical solutions are analytic. Thus, in all finite element computations, all quantities of interest (e.g., quadratic functional, error or residual functional, norms and seminorms, error norms, etc.) are dependent on h, p as well as k. Therefore, for fixed h and p, convergence of the finite element process can also be investigated by changing k, hence k-convergence and thus the k-version of finite element method. With h, p, and k as three independent parameters influencing all finite element processes, we now have k, hk, pk, and hpk versions of finite element methods. The issue of minimally conforming finite element spaces is reexamined and it is demonstrated that the definition of currently believed minimally conforming space which permit weak convergence of the highest-order derivatives of the dependent variables appearing in the bilinear form is not justifiable mathematically or from physics view point. A new criterion is proposed for establishing the minimally conforming spaces which is more in agreement with the physics and mathematics of the BVP. Significant features and merits of the proposed mathematical and computational framework are presented, discussed, illustrated, and substantiated mathematically as well as numerically with the Galerkin and least-squares finite element formulations for self-adjoint boundary-value problems.	finite element method	K.

Short-time analysis of the lossless system shows that, when the photon field is excited, the time required for that field to exhibit nonlinear effects is longer than the time required for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, in which the photon field itself is nonlinear. When the initial condition is scaled by (epsilon ^alpha ), it is found that the relative error committed by omitting the nonlinear term in the exciton-polariton system remains within (epsilon ) for all times up to (t=Cepsilon ^beta ), where (beta =(1-alpha (p-1))/(p+2)). This is in contrast to (beta =1-alpha (p-1)) for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The result is proved for solutions in (H^s(mathbb {R}^n)) for (su003en/2).

On $$\partial \Omega\times(0,\infty)$$ we prescribe the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. For large values of t, the coefficients in the elliptic part are close to time-independent coefficients in an integral sense which is described by a certain function $$\kappa(t)$$ . This includes in particular situations when the coefficients may take different values on different parts of $$\Omega$$ and the boundaries between them can move with t but stabilize as $$t\to\infty$$ . The main result is an asymptotic representation of solutions for large t. A consequence is that for $$\kappa \in L^1(0,\infty)$$ , the solution behaves asymptotically as the solution to a parabolic system with time-independent coefficients.	parabolic antenna	Vladimir Kozlov;Mikael Langer;Peter Rand	2008	J.

ed4608c4050858abfdc26fc0d608d8192ff1129d	symmetric interior penalty discontinuous galerkin discretizations and block preconditioning for heterogeneous stokes flow		Provable stable arbitrary order symmetric interior penalty (SIP) discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of heterogeneous, incompressible Stokes flow utilizing Qk–Qk−1 elements and hierarchical Legendre basis polynomials are developed and investigated. For solving the resulting linear system, a block preconditioned iterative method is proposed. The nested viscous problem is solved by a hp-multilevel preconditioned Krylov subspace method. For the p-coarsening, a two-level method utilizing element-block Jacobi preconditioned iterations as a smoother is employed. Piecewise bilinear (Q1) and piecewise constant (Q 2 0) p-coarse spaces are considered. Finally, Galerkin h-coarsening is proposed and investigated for the two p-coarse spaces considered. Through a number of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that utilizing the Q1 coarse space results in the most robust hp-multigrid method for heterogeneous Stokes flow. Using this Q1 coarse space we observe that the convergence of the overall Stokes solver appears to be robust with respect to the jump in the viscosity and only mildly depending on the polynomial order k. It is demonstrated and supported by theoretical results that the convergence of the SIP discretizations and the iterative methods rely on a sharp choice of the penalty parameter based on local values of the viscosity.

The adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm is adopted to enhance the computational efficiency. As the object is naturally separated into two parts by the interface of the half-space, two different mesh densities are required due to the contrast of the two background materials. Therefore, two multilevel tree structures are set up individually in the two regions. When the source and field points are in the same region, which corresponds to the primary terms and reflection terms, the implementation is similar to the free-space case. However, when considering the mutual coupling of the two regions, which corresponds to the transmitted terms, difficulties arise since the two trees are independent and the numbers of levels are, in general, different. In this case, a z-dependent grouping strategy is proposed to redefine the well-separated interactions and match the abrupt changes at the interface. Three clustering strategies are proposed and discussed carefully to account for the mutual coupling in the two different regions of the half-space. The combined field integral equation (CFIE) formulation is further applied to improve the convergence of the system. Several numerical examples are demonstrated to validate the proposed schemes.	algorithm;american cryptogram association;approximation;cluster analysis;computation;interaction;numerical analysis;numerical method;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wan Luo;Zaiping Nie;Yongpin Chen	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2289015	mathematical optimization;mathematics;geometry;computational electromagnetics;optics	Robotics	91.01287309208013	8.214901305751928	117631

At each time step the computations of vorticity transport and streamfunction are decoupled and based on a body-fitted, prowake, orthogonal grid. To handle the no-slip condition properly and efficiently, a new wall-vorticity conditioning algorithm is proposed and incorporated into the vorticity transport equation. When the object presents sharp edges, this algorithm performs particularly well in that it yields a significant increase in the time step increment that can be used in comparison to other known “decoupled” methods. In the method developed here the vorticity is advanced by an implicit scheme of Crank–Nicholson type, and the streamfunction equation is solved by a multigrid technique based on body-fitted coordinates. As an application, the experiment on flow past an inclined thin ellipse with angle of attack ranging from $5^ \circ $ to $85^ ...		Mo-Hong Chou	1992	SIAM J.

Under loadings that do not belong to the dual of the limit energy space, the solution energy grows without limit as the thickness tends to zero and concentrates on internal or boundary layers. We consider both the cases when the singular loadings are applied along a non-characteristic curve or along a characteristic curve. We prove convergence in the layers.

This combination is particularly well suited to long time integration of advection-dominated problems. Herein it is shown that a stabilized implementation of the trapezoid rule leads to a very effective integrator in other situations: specifically diffusion problems with rough initial data; and general advection-diffusion problems with different physical time scales governing the system evolution.	bashforth;error detection and correction;linear multistep method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;scalar processor;stepping level;trapezoidal rule	Philip M.

The method is based on the variational framework that is suitable for discretization by standard finite elements as well as the basis functions employed in isogeometric analysis. The underlying numerical formulation globally conserves mass and preserves a sharp air–water interface for the entire length of the simulation. The numerical tests indicate that the proposed methodology gives an accurate description of the free-surface behavior in both quasi-steady and dynamic regimes. Furthermore, very good per-degree-of-freedom accuracy is obtained when higher-order and higher-continuity isogeometric discretizations are employed in free-surface computations. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Our estimates are based on a H-conforming reconstruction of the potential, continuous and piecewise affine in time, and a locally conservative H(div)-conforming reconstruction of the flux, piecewise constant in time. They yield a guaranteed and fully computable upper bound on the error measured in the energy norm augmented by a dual norm of the time derivative. Localin-time lower bounds are also derived; for nonconforming methods on time-varying meshes, the lower bounds require a mild parabolic-type constraint on the meshsize.	computable function;discretization;dual norm;euler method;finite element method;finite volume method;galerkin method;parabolic antenna	Alexandre Ern;Martin Vohralík	2010	SIAM J.

This problem can be formulated as a control in the coefficient PDE-constrained optimal control problem with additional control and state constraints. The state constraints are treated with a Moreau-Yosida regularization of a dual problem. Variational discretization is employed for discrete approximation of the optimal control problem. For discretization of the state in the mixed formulation we compare the standard continuous piecewise linear ansatz with a piecewise constant one based on the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element. We derive bounds for the discretization and regularization errors and also address the coupling of the regularization parameter and finite element grid size. The numerical solution of the optimal control problem is realized with a semismooth Newton algorithm. Numerical examples show the performance of the method.

The 12 method relies on a three dimensional implementation of the parabolic 13 Monge-Ampère (PMA) technique, for finding an optimally transported 14 mesh. The method for implementing PMA is described in detail and ap15 plied to both static and dynamic mesh redistribution problems, studying 16 both the convergence and the computational cost of the algorithm. The 17 algorithm is applied to a series of problems of increasing complexity. In 18 particular very regular meshes are generated to resolve real meteorolog19 ical features (derived from a weather forecasting model covering the UK 20 area) in grids with over 2 × 10 degrees of freedom.

We have developed an improved approach to curvature estimation for incorporation into modern mesh-based surface tension models such as the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) and Sharp Surface Force (SSF) models. The scheme involves generating samples of curvature estimates from the multitude of height functions that can be generated from VOF representations of interfaces, and applying quality statistics based on interface orientation and smoothness to choose optimal candidates from the samples. In this manner, the orientation-dependence of past schemes for height function-based curvature estimation is ameliorated, the use of compact stencils for efficient computation can be maintained, and robustness is enhanced even in the presence of noticeable subgrid-scale disturbances in the interface representation. For surface tension-dominated flows, the explicit capillary timestep restriction is relaxed through timescale-separated slope limiting that identifies spurious modes in curvature evolution and omits them from contributing to surface force computations, thus promoting efficiency in simulation through the use of less timesteps. Efficiency in flow simulation is further promoted by incorporating awareness of interface location into multigrid preconditioning for Krylov subspace-based solution of elliptic problems. This use of interface-cognizance in solving problems such as the Helmholtz equation and the Poisson equation enables multigrid-like convergence in discontinuous-coefficient elliptic problems without the expense of constructing the Galerkin coarse-grid operator. The key improvements in the surface tension modelling and the numerical linear algebra are also applicable to level-set-based interfacial flow simulation. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As a by-product, some results about the convergence for a type of nonlocal optimal design are given. Since these problems give rise to local design problems in the limit, different results on classical existence are obtained as well. Concerning the nonlocal formulation, the state equation is of nonlocal elliptic type and the cost functional we analyze includes, among other cases, an approximation of the square of the gradient.	aharonov–bohm effect;optimal design	Fuensanta Andrés;Julio Muñoz	2017	J.

642cb872c40ff3d48eb192cbcc1c90b30b264112	analysis of fully-mixed finite element methods for the stokes-darcy coupled problem		In this paper we analyze fully-mixed finite element methods for the coupling of fluid flow with porous media flow in 2D. Flows are governed by the Stokes and Darcy equations, respectively, and the corresponding transmission conditions are given by mass conservation, balance of normal forces, and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law. The fully-mixed concept employed here refers to the fact that we consider dual-mixed formulations in both media, which means that the main unknowns are given by the pseudostress and the velocity in the fluid, together with the velocity and the pressure in the porous medium. In addition, the transmission conditions become essential, which leads to the introduction of the traces of the porous media pressure and the fluid velocity as the associated Lagrange multipliers. We apply the Fredholm and BabuškaBrezzi theories to derive sufficient conditions for the unique solvability of the resulting continuous and discrete formulations. In particular, we show that the existence of uniformly bounded discrete liftings of the normal traces simplifies the derivation of the corresponding stability estimates. A feasible choice of subspaces is given by Raviart-Thomas elements of lowest order and piecewise constants for the velocities and pressures, respectively, in both domains, together with continuous piecewise linear elements for the Lagrange multipliers. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the good performance of the method with these discrete spaces, and confirming the theoretical rate of convergence, are provided.	digital footprint;finite element method;lagrange multiplier;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;piecewise linear continuation;rate of convergence;tracing (software);tridiagonal matrix algorithm;velocity (software development)	Gabriel N.

4b0d4409b8cb4aae82153dcd37ebc8f62afcd895	general four-step discrete-time zeroing and derivative dynamics applied to time-varying nonlinear optimization		Abstract Time-varying nonlinear optimization (TVNO) problems are considered as important issues in various scientific disciplines and industrial applications. In this paper, the continuous-time derivative dynamics (CTDD) model is developed for obtaining the real-time solutions of TVNO problems. Furthermore, aiming to remedy the weaknesses of CTDD model, a continuous-time zeroing dynamics (CTZD) model is presented and investigated. For potential digital hardware realization, by using bilinear transform, a general four-step Zhang et al discretization (ZeaD) formula is proposed and applied to the discretization of both CTDD and CTZD models. A general four-step discrete-time derivative dynamics (general four-step DTDD) model and a general four-step discrete-time zeroing dynamics (general four-step DTZD) model are proposed on the basis of this general four-step ZeaD formula. Further theoretical analyses indicate that the general four-step DTZD model is zero-stable, consistent and convergent with the truncation error of O ( g 4 ) , which denotes a vector with every entries being O ( g 4 ) with g denoting the sampling period. Theoretical analyses also indicate that the maximal steady-state residual error (MSSRE) has an O ( g 4 ) pattern confirmedly. The efficacy and accuracy of the general four-step DTDD and DTZD models are further illustrated by numerical examples.	mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system	Yunong Zhang;Liu He;Chaowei Hu;Jinjin Guo;Jian Li;Yang Shi	2019	J.

It emphasizes the synergic collaboration of multidisciplinary computational models, involving the exchange of simulation data generated in parallel at runtime from the numerical integration processes of these models. Current research on the interaction of models in multidisciplinary collaborative simulation is mainly focused on performing data exchange at fixed intervals, i.e. macro time steps, and using interpolation/extrapolation to find out values at the points in time when data are not available. However, the selection of an appropriate size for macro time tends to be complex and iterative. Firstly, it is mostly based on experience rather than the estimation of simulation errors by analyzing the numerical integration processes involved. Moreover, it is hardly possible to select a fixed step size suitable for all the stages of the simulation process. This paper presents a novel variable-step algorithm which is able to adjust the step size automatically at simulation runtime based on the evaluation of truncation errors. This algorithm not only avoids the instability and inaccuracy caused by a fixed large step but also speeds up the simulation by using a smaller step when a large one is not necessary. It is demonstrated in the numerical experiments that the variable-step algorithm can achieve improved simulation performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.	algorithm;simulation	Hongwei Wang;Huachao Mao;Heming Zhang	2014	Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering	10.3233/ICA-130458	mathematical optimization;simulation;numerical integration;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;product design	EDA	94.41023062753476	12.4781034295007	120194
b5d1bd3efc2df4145f5ddc81f098d417d8c3481b	fundamental study of mechanism of band gap in fluid and solid/fluid phononic crystals		Abstract Phononic crystals (PCs) have possessed outstanding features to control/manipulate the propagation of the acoustic/sound wave. In this paper, the local resonant elements, such as local resonant cavity in fluid PCs and local resonant inclusion in solid/fluid PCs, are introduced. The effect of geometry parameters, Poissonu0027s ratio, Youngu0027s modulus on the band gap solid/fluid PCs are investigated in detail. It is found that wider multiple band gaps are obtained for the fluid PCs with local resonant cavity of “+” hole compared with square and circle holes. More importantly, the very low-frequency band gaps can be obtained by introducing the local resonant inclusion with consideration of fluid-structural interaction for solid/fluid PCs. In addition, we have compared the sound transmission loss in fluid and solid/fluid PCs. The numerical results have clearly indicated that solid/fluids PCs with consideration of fluid-structural interaction can block the propagation of stress wave effectively compared with fluid PCs. The theoretical study and numerical simulation conducted in this work have provided a new avenue to design more innovative fluid and solid/fluid PCs.		Eric S.

As has been shown previously, the approach is applicable also to the nonlinear PDEs of fluid dynamics, and this without requiring large systems of algebraic equations to be inverted. It will be shown that important improvements can be obtained on the one hand by arriving at a substantially better algorithm, and on the other, by systematizing the derivation and refining the earlier way of proceeding.	numerical analysis;numerical integration	Alfred Fettweis	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1010235	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics;partial differential equation;fluid dynamics	Vision	92.42183190536295	10.300767103651777	120274
5488b2e03479712bdd1db1f99b7f96af777acd95	stagnation-point flow of the walters' b' fluid with slip	oblique flow;finite difference method;orthogonal flow	The steady two-dimensional stagnation point flow of a non-Newtonian Walters' B' fluid with slip is studied. The fluid impinges on the wall either orthogonally or obliquely. A finite difference technique is employed to obtain solutions. 1. Introduction. Some rheologically complex fluids such as polymer solutions, blood, paints, and certain oils cannot be adequately described by the Navier-Stokes theory. For this reason, several theories of non-Newtonian fluids were developed. One important and useful model which has been used to describe the non-Newtonian behavior exhibited by certain fluids is the Walters' B' fluid [16]. The equations of motion of non-Newtonian fluids are highly nonlinear and one order higher than the Navier-Stokes equations. Due to the complexity of these equations, finding accurate solutions is not easy. One class of flows which has received considerable attention is stagnation-point flow. In a stagnation-point flow of a Newtonian fluid, a rigid wall occupies the entire x-axis, the fluid domain is y > 0, and the flow impinges on the wall either orthogonally [6, 7] or obliquely [4, 14, 15]. In a study of Newtonian fluid impinging on a flat rigid wall obliquely, Dorrepaal [4] found that the slope of the dividing streamline at the wall divided by its slope at infinity is independent of the angle of incidence. Beard and Wal-ters [2] used boundary-layer equations to study two-dimensional flow near a stagnation point of a viscoelastic fluid. Rajagopal et al. [11] have studied the Falkner-Skan flows of an incompressible second grade fluid. Dorrepaal et al. [5] investigated the behavior of a viscoelastic fluid impinging on a flat rigid wall at an arbitrary angle of incidence. Labropulu et al. [9] studied the oblique flow of a second grade fluid impinging on a porous wall with suction or blowing. In a recent paper, Wang [17] studied stagnation-point flows with slip. This problem appears in some applications where a thin film of light oil is attached to the plate or when the plate is coated with special coatings such as a thick monolayer of hydropho-bic octadecyltrichlorosilane [3]. Also, wall slip can occur if the working fluid contains concentrated suspensions [13]. When the molecular mean free path length of the fluid is comparable to the system's characteristic length, then rarefaction effects must be considered.

The contact method solves a multi-directional Riemann-like problem at each penetrating or touching node along the contact surface. The velocity of a penetrating or touching node and the corresponding forces are explicitly calculated using the Riemann-like nodal solver. The contact method works with material strength and allows surfaces to impact, slide, and separate. Results are presented for several test problems involving both gases and materials with strength.

We consider a control constrained optimal control problem governed by a semilinear elliptic equation with nonlocal interface conditions. These conditions occur during the modeling of diffuse-gray conductive-radiative heat transfer. The problem arises from the aim to optimize the temperature gradient within crystal growth by the physical vapor transport (PVT) method. Based on a minimum principle for the semilinear equation as well as L-estimates for the weak solution, we establish the existence of an optimal solution as well as necessary optimality conditions.

6c930682f86e167e91a93e5d3fbae8fe31fcba96	a stabilized cut discontinuous galerkin framework: i. elliptic boundary value and interface problems		We develop a stabilized cut discontinuous Galerkin framework for the numerical solution of elliptic boundary value and interface problems on complicated domains. The domain of interest is embedded in a structured, unfitted background mesh in R, so that the boundary or interface can cut through it in an arbitrary fashion. The method is based on an unfitted variant of the classical symmetric interior penalty method using piecewise discontinuous polynomials defined on the background mesh. Instead of the cell agglomeration technique commonly used in previously introduced unfitted discontinuous Galerkin methods, we employ and extend ghost penalty techniques from recently developed continuous cut finite element methods, which allows for a minimal extension of existing fitted discontinuous Galerkin software to handle unfitted geometries. Identifying four abstract assumptions on the ghost penalty, we derive geometrically robust a priori error and condition number estimates for the Poisson boundary value problem which hold irrespective of the particular cut configuration. Possible realizations of suitable ghost penalties are discussed. We also demonstrate how the framework can be elegantly applied to discretize high contrast interface problems. The theoretical results are illustrated by a number of numerical experiments for various approximation orders and for two and three-dimensional test problems.

a45418c21cef0b746abceaee0b43fb5171c2d39c	a localized meshless technique for generating 3-d wind fields		A localized meshless method is used to simulate 3-D atmospheric wind fields for wind energy assessment and emergency response. The meshless (or mesh-free) method with radial basis functions (RBFs) alleviates the need to create a mesh required by finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods. The method produces a fast solution that converges with high accuracy, establishing 3-D wind estimates over complex terrain. The method does not require discretization of the domain or boundary and removes the need for domain integration. The meshless method converges exponentially for smooth boundary shapes and boundary data, and is insensitive to dimensional constraints. Coding of the method is very easy and can be done using MATLAB or MAPLE. By employing a localized RBF procedure, 3-D wind fields can be established from sparse meteorological data. The meshless method can be easily run on PCs and hand-held mobile devices. This article summarizes previous work where the meshless method has successfully simulated 3D wind fields over various environments, along with the equations used to obtain the simulations.	discretization;finite difference;finite element method;finite volume method;matlab;maple;meshfree methods;mobile device;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation;sparse matrix	Darrell W.

7987877640548383fade8a598acdd1c29372de35	finite-difference lattice boltzmann model for nonlinear convection-diffusion equations		In this paper, a finite-difference lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for nonlinear isotropic and anisotropic convection-diffusion equations is proposed. In this model, the equilibrium distribution function is delicately designed in order to recover the convection-diffusion equation exactly. Different from the standard LB model, the temporal and spatial steps in this model are decoupled such that it is convenient to study convection-diffusion problem with the non-uniform grid. In addition, it also preserves the advantage of standard LB model that the complex-valued convection-diffusion equation can be solved directly. The von Neumann stability analysis is conducted to discuss the stability region which can be used to determine the free parameters appeared in the model. To test the performance of the model, a series of numerical simulations of some classical problems, including the diffusion equation, the nonlinear heat conduction equation, the Sine-Gordon equation, the Gaussian hill problem, the Burgers–Fisher equation, and the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, have also been carried out. The results show that the present model has a second-order convergence rate in space, and generally it is also more accurate than the standard LB model.	finite difference;lattice boltzmann methods;lattice gas automaton;nonlinear system	Huili Wang;Baochang Shi;Hong Liang;Zhenhua Chai	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.04.015	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;quantum mechanics	Crypto	90.57013134667787	11.015072266854034	121234
b12f8ba07f3798b2f455e232c9524eab54adabd0	a penalty-projection algorithm for a monolithic fluid-structure interaction solver	fluid structure interaction;penalty projection method;monolithic solver	In this paper we propose a new iterative penalty-projection algorithm for a monolithic fluid-structure interaction solver. Projection methods, that split the computation of the velocity from the pressure, are very popular in fluid dynamics since the boundary errors generated by the projection method are localized mainly near the boundary layers where the incorrect pressure boundary conditions are imposed. However, when solid regions are taken into account, the pressure projected field cannot satisfy fully coupled boundary constraints imposed on external solid surfaces such as stress-free conditions, and, due to the rigidity of the medium, the boundary errors propagate deeply in the interior. In order to reduce the projection errors we propose a one-step penalty-projection method in the fluid domain and an iterative penalty-projection method in the solid region. This technique decouples the pressure-velocity degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, the computational cost. In order to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method we compare the results between this splitting velocity-pressure algorithm and the coupled one. These numerical results show stability and robustness of the proposed algorithm with a strong reduction of the computational effort. A new penalty-projection algorithm for a monolithic FSI solver is proposed.Projection method error is localized where pressure boundary conditions are imposed.A one-step penalty together with an iterative projection algorithm is used.This technique reduces the problem degrees of freedom and the computational cost.Numerical results show stability and reduction of cpu effort for large problems.	3d projection;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;coupling (computer programming);displacement mapping;iteration;iterative method;solver;velocity (software development)	Daniele Cerroni;Sandro Manservisi	2016	J.

dd56b968bad3848aa4a0af17c5ce1907d0e9a6f4	a general approach for high order absorbing boundary conditions for the helmholtz equation	bayliss turkel abc;absorbing boundary conditions;helmholtz equation	When solving a scattering problem in an unbounded space, one needs to implement the Sommerfeld condition as a boundary condition at infinity, to ensure no energy penetrates the system. In practice, solving a scattering problem involves truncating the region and implementing a boundary condition on an artificial outer boundary. Bayliss, Gunzburger and Turkel (BGT) suggested an Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) as a sequence of operators aimed at annihilating elements from the solution’s series representation. Their method was practical only up to a second order condition. Later, Hagstrom and Hariharan (HH) suggested a method which used auxiliary functions and enabled implementation of higher order conditions. We compare various absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) and introduce a new method to construct high order ABCs, generalizing the HH method. We then derive from this general method ABCs based on different series representations of the solution to the Helmholtz equation – in polar, elliptical and spherical coordinates. Some of these ABCs are generalizations of previously constructed ABCs and some are new. These new ABCs produce accurate solutions to the Helmholtz equation, which are much less dependent on the various parameters of the problem, such as the value of k, or the eccentricity of the ellipse. In addition to constructing new ABCs, our general method sheds light on the connection between various ABCs. Computations are presented to verify the high accuracy of these new ABCs. 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to inter-object contact, methods relying on Lagrangian discretizations must handle degenerate cases by explicitly remeshing or resampling the object. Eulerian methods, which discretize space itself, provide an interesting alternative due to the fixed nature of the discretization. In this paper we present a new Eulerian method for viscoelastic materials that features a collision detection and resolution scheme which does not require explicit surface tracking to achieve accurate collision response. Time-stepping with contact is performed by the efficient solution of large sparse quadratic programs; this avoids constraint sticking and other difficulties. Simulation and collision processing can share the same uniform grid, making the algorithm easy to parallelize. We demonstrate an implementation of all the steps of the algorithm on the GPU.

5d10fd64f9c0e9092094c32ed3648a42405edb29	dynamic coupling of a finite element solver to large-scale atomistic simulations		We propose a method for efficiently coupling the finite element method with atomistic simulations, while using molecular dynamics or kinetic Monte Carlo techniques. Our method can dynamically build an optimized unstructured mesh that follows the geometry defined by atomistic data. On this mesh, different multiphysics problems can be solved to obtain distributions of physical quantities of interest, which can be fed back to the atomistic system. The simulation flow is optimized to maximize computational efficiency while maintaining good accuracy. This is achieved by providing the modules for a) optimization of the density of the generated mesh according to requirements of a specific geometry and b) efficient extension of the finite element domain without a need to extend the atomistic one. Our method is organized as an open-source C++ code. In the current implementation, an efficient Laplace equation solver for calculating the electric field distribution near a rough atomistic surface demonstrates the capability of the suggested approach.	apex (geometry);c++;emoticon;finite element method;kinetic monte carlo;mathematical optimization;molecular dynamics;monte carlo method;multiphysics;numerical analysis;open-source software;requirement;simulation;solver;star height	Mihkel Veske;Andreas Kyritsakis;Kristjan Eimre;Vahur Zadin;Alvo Aabloo;Flyura Djurabekova	2018	J.

The method is second-order accurate on non-uniform grids in space and time, has a very small dispersion error and computational stencil defined within one space-time cell. For shock-capturing, the scheme is equipped with a conservative non-linear correction procedure which is directly based on the maximum principle.

The striking feature is that higher order schemes of fractional derivatives can keep the same computation cost with first order schemes but greatly improve the accuracy. Nowadays, there are already two types of second order discretization schemes for space fractional derivatives: the first type is given and discussed in [Sousa and Li, arXiv:1109.2345v1, 2011; Chen and Deng, Appl.

Our approach is a robust “discretize” then “optimize” strategy, based on the Fourier-Galerkin projection method and minimax state estimation. We assign a Fourier-Galerkin reduced model to a macroscopic model of traffic flow, described by a hyperbolic partial differential equation. Taking into account a priori estimates for the projection error, we apply the minimax method to construct the state estimate for the reduced model that gives us, in turn, the estimate of the Fourier-Galerkin coefficients associated with a solution of the original macroscopic model. We illustrate our approach with a numerical example that demonstrates its shock capturing capability using only sparse measurements and under high uncertainty in initial conditions. We present implementation details for our algorithm, as well as a comparison of our method against the ensemble Kalman filter applied to a “local” discretization of the same traffic flow model.	algorithm;approximation;basis function;coefficient;concave function;data assimilation;discretization;ensemble kalman filter;finite difference method;galerkin method;godunov's scheme;image noise;init;initial condition;iteration;iterative method;midpoint method;minimax;network traffic control;neural oscillation;numerical analysis;periodic boundary conditions;scope (computer science);sensor;shock capturing method;sparse matrix;system dynamics;test case;testbed	Tigran T.

We consider approaches for truncating the infinite dimensional problem and producing decoupled systems. We discuss conditions under which such decoupling is possible and show that to generalize the known decoupling by numerical cubature, it would be necessary to find new multivariate cubature rules. Finally, we use the acceleration of Monte Carlo to compare the quality of polynomial models obtained for all approaches and find that in general the methods considered are more efficient than Monte Carlo for the relatively small domains considered in this work. A curse of dimensionality in the series expansion of the log-normal stochastic random field used to represent hydraulic conductivity provides a significant impediment to efficient approximations for large domains for all methods considered in this work, other than the Monte Carlo method.

However, the computational cost of conventional numerical modeling methods, such as finite-difference method and finite-element method, becomes prohibitively expensive when applied to very large models. We propose a Generalized Multiscale Generalized Multiscale Finite-Element Method (GMsFEM) for elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous, anisotropic media, where we construct basis functions from multiple local problems for both boundaries and the interior of a coarse node support or coarse element. The application of multiscale basis functions can capture the fine scale medium property variations, and allows us to greatly reduce the degrees of freedom that are required to implement the modeling compared with conventional finite-element method for wave equation, while restricting the error to low values. We formulate the continuous Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the multiscale method, both of which have pros and cons. Applications of the multiscale method to three heterogeneous models show that our multiscale method can effectively model the elastic wave propagation in anisotropic media with a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom in the modeling system.

To this end, we consider a series of one-dimensional prototype SPDEs, whose solution can be expressed analytically, and which are associated with both linear (advection equation) and nonlinear (Burgers equation) problems with excitations that lead to unimodal and strongly bi-modal distributions. We also propose a hybrid approach to tackle the singular limit of the DO equations for the case of deterministic initial conditions. The results reveal that the DO method converges exponentially fast with respect to the number of modes (for the problems considered) giving same levels of computational accuracy comparable with the PC method but (in many cases) with substantially smaller computational cost compared to stochastic collocation, especially when the involved parametric space is high-dimensional.	adaptive filter;algorithm;coefficient;computation;dynamical system;ibm notes;initial condition;nonlinear system;object storage;personal computer;polynomial;randomness;steady state;switching time;technological singularity;time complexity	Minseok Choi;Themistoklis P.

19a915f9d93e394ac6df058a8557a78a6384ebec	electric field radiated by a dipole antenna above a lossy half space: comparison of plane wave approximation with the modified image theory approach		The paper deals with the comparison between the two approaches to account for the presence of a two media configuration when calculating the electric field radiated by the dipole antenna. The first approach features the well-known Fresnel reflection/transmission coefficient approximation which, beside the electric properties of two media, considers also the incidence angle at the interface. On the other hand, the Modified Image Theory (MIT) approach uses the approximation of a normal incidence, thus neglecting the refraction of the wave in the lower medium. The MIT approach thus simplifies the formulation thus providing the analytical solution and the derivation of the time domain computation. In this paper the frequency domain formulation is used. It is based on the Pocklington's integro-differential equation which is solved numerically using the Galerkin Bubnov scheme of Boundary Element Method. The results obtained by both approaches are compared and conclusions are given regarding the limitations and strengths of the MIT approach with respect to the Fresnel coefficients approximation. The comparison undertaken in this work can serve as a benchmark for the analytical solution modeling and time domain modeling.	approximation;benchmark (computing);boundary element method;computation;dipole antenna;galerkin method;incidence matrix;lossy compression;numerical analysis;transmission coefficient;whole earth 'lectronic link	Anna Susnjara;Dragan Poljak;Vicko Doric	2017	2017 25th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)	10.23919/SOFTCOM.2017.8115529	fresnel equations;frequency domain;mathematical analysis;real-time computing;transmission coefficient;dipole antenna;geometry;time domain;galerkin method;plane wave;mathematics;electric field	Robotics	90.85032999530547	6.676410222803223	123928

Our method is based on a Gaussian-sum approximation of the singular convolution kernel combined with a Taylor expansion of the density. Starting from the convolution formulation of the nonlocal potential, for smooth and fast decaying densities, we make a full use of the Fourier pseudospectral (plane wave) approximation of the density and a separable Gaussian-sum approximation of the kernel in an interval where the singularity (the origin) is excluded. The potential is separated into a regular integral and a near-field singular correction integral. The first is computed with the Fourier pseudospectral method, while the latter is well resolved utilizing a low-order Taylor expansion of the density. Both parts are accelerated by fast Fourier transforms (FFT).

Typical models assume that convection dominates so that diffusion can be ignored and the resulting model is defined by a hyperbolic PDE. When the flow velocity becomes small or zero this hyperbolic system becomes degenerate and controllability can be lost. We employ a full flux model, which can be viewed as a parabolic approximation to the hyperbolic equations, to address this issue and illustrate that the full flux model can be used for set point control and tracking even with zero flow.	approximation;parabolic antenna;velocity (software development)	Edward Aulisa;John A.

In this paper, we simulate TCAs in 3-D cylindrically layered and anisotropic earth formations with multiple horizontal beds using an extended numerical mode-matching (NMM) approach. The field components are expanded in terms of longitudinal (vertical) eigenmodes to facilitate the analysis of transverse electric and transverse magnetic fields, which are coupled in this case. The perfectly matched layer is incorporated into the NMM formulation to mimic the Sommerfeld radiation condition in the longitudinal (vertical) direction. NMM results are compared with 3-D simulation results using finite-difference time-domain method and a pseudoanalytical approach based on Sommerfeld integrals (for problems where the latter is applicable), showing very good agreement.	advanced telecommunications computing architecture;anisotropic diffusion;finite-difference time-domain method;normal mode;numerical analysis;perfectly matched layer;propagator;radial (radio);reflection (computer programming);simulation;test engineer;transverse wave	Yik-Kiong Hue;Fernando L.

The entire fluid-particle domain is assumed to be an incompressible, but variable density, fluid. The numerical method is based on a finite-volume approach on a co-located, Cartesian grid together with a fractional step method for variable density, low-Mach number flows. The flow inside the fluid region is constrained to be divergence-free for an incompressible fluid, whereas the flow inside the particle domain is constrained to undergo rigid body motion. In this approach, the rigid body motion constraint is imposed by avoiding the explicit calculation of distributed Lagrange multipliers and is based upon the formulation developed by Patankar ([1]). The rigidity constraint is imposed and the rigid body motion (translation and rotational velocity fields) is obtained directly in the context of a two-stage fractional step scheme. The numerical approach is applied to both imposed particle motion and fluid-particle interaction problems involving freely moving particles. Grid and time-step convergence studies are performed to evaluate the accuracy of the approach. Finally, simulation of rigid particles in a decaying isotropic turbulent flow is performed to study the feasibility of simulations of particle-laden turbulent flows.	algorithm;computation;cylinder seal;finite volume method;interaction;interpolation;lagrange multiplier;neat particles;numerical method;overhead (computing);pin grid array;regular grid;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;simulation;solver;turbulence;velocity (software development)	Sourabh V.

36171a4f23744cd2d96bb366e3ed4dfeefad60a4	static and dynamic physically non-linear analysis of concrete structures using a hybrid mixed finite element model	static and dynamic non linear analysis;damage mechanics;legendre polynomials;stress models;hybrid mixed formulations;time integration	A new hybrid-mixed stress finite element model for the static and dynamic non-linear analysis of concrete structures is presented and discussed in this paper. The main feature of this model is the simultaneous and independent approximation of the stress, the strain and the displacement fields in the domain of each element. The displacements along the static boundary, which is considered to include inter-element boundaries, are also directly approximated. To define the approximation bases in the space domain, complete sets of orthonormal Legendre polynomials are used. The adoption of these functions enables the use of analytical closed form solutions for the computation of all linear structural operators and leads to the development of very effective p-refinement procedures. To represent the material quasi-brittle behaviour, a physically non-linear model is considered by using damage mechanics. A simple isotropic damage model is adopted and to control strain localisation problems a non-local integral formulation is considered. To solve the dynamic non-linear governing system, a time integration procedure based on the use of the a-HHT method is used. For each time step, the solution of the non-linear governing system is achieved using an iterative algorithm based on a secant method. The model being discussed is applied to the solution of two-dimensional structures. To validate the model, to illustrate its potential and to assess its accuracy and numerical efficiency, several numerical examples are discussed and comparisons are made with solutions provided by experimental tests and with other numerical results obtained using conventional finite elements (CFE). 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the expected long tail of the electrostatic potential requires either the use of a large and costly outer domain or Dirichlet boundary conditions estimated via multipole expansion. We find that the oft-used single-center spherical multipole expansion is only appropriate for isotropic mesh domains such as spheres and cubes. In this work, we introduce a method suitable for high aspect ratio meshes whereby the charge density is partitioned into atomic domains and multipoles are computed for each domain. While this approach is moderately more expensive than a single-center expansion, it is numerically stable and still a small fraction of the overall cost of a DFT calculation. The net result is that when high aspect ratio systems are being studied, form-fitted meshes can now be used in lieu of cubic meshes to gain computational speedup.	atom	M. Lee;Kenneth W. Leiter;C.

Numerical solution is then based on an original mathematical method. This method uses the Taylor series for solving ordinary differential equations with initial condition – initial value problems in a non-traditional way. Systems of ordinary differential equations are solved using variable order, variable step-size Modern Taylor Series Method. The Modern Taylor Series Method is based on a recurrent calculation of the Taylor series terms for each time interval. The second part of paper presents the solution of linear problems which comes from the model of telegraph line. All experiments were performed using MATLAB software, the newly developed linear solver that uses Modern Taylor Series Method. Linear solver was compared with the state of the art solvers in MATLAB and SPICE software.

WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) integration is used to compute the numerical fluxes based on the point values of the solution, and the principles of residual distribution schemes are adapted to obtain steady state solutions. In two space dimension, the computational cost of our scheme is comparable to that of a high order WENO finite difference scheme and is therefore much lower than that of a high order WENO finite volume scheme, yet the new scheme does not have the restriction on mesh smoothness of the traditional high order conservative finite difference schemes. A Lax–Wendroff type theorem is proved for convergence towards weak solutions in one and two dimensions, and extensive numerical experiments are performed for oneand two-dimensional scalar problems and systems to demonstrate the quality of the new scheme, including high order accuracy on non-smooth meshes, conservation, and non-oscillatory properties for solutions with shocks and other discontinuities. ! 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The space H(curl;Ω) ∩ H(div;Ω) of square integrable vector fields whose weak curl and weak divergence are also square integrable plays an important role in many applications, such as the cavity resonance problem and the acoustic fluid–structure interaction problem. However, a finite element vector field belonging to H(curl;Ω) ∩ H(div;Ω) is necessarily continuous across element boundaries and hence actually belongs to [H1(Ω)]d. Furthermore, it is known [1,6] that under certain boundary conditions the H1 vector fields form a closed subspace of H(curl;Ω) ∩ H(div;Ω). Consequently, unless the solution of the continuous problem belongs to [H1(Ω)]d (which is not always the case), it can never be captured by H(curl;Ω) ∩ H(div;Ω) conforming finite element vector fields. On the other hand, problems involving H(curl;Ω) ∩ H(div;Ω) can be solved numerically by nonconforming finite element methods. For example, the source problem (deterministic problem) and the eigenproblem (cavity resonance problem) for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations in two dimensions were solved in [4,3,2,5] using the Crouzeix–Raviart [7] weakly continuous P1 vector fields. In this note we present a two-dimensional quadratic nonconforming vector finite element that can be used to solve problems involving H(curl;Ω) ∩ H(div;Ω). This vector element is fundamentally different from the quadratic element of Fortin and Soulie [8], which can be applied to the Laplace equation and the Stokes problem. We also discuss general nonconforming vector finite elements for H(curl;Ω)∩H(div;Ω) in two and three dimensions in terms of two conjectures. First we introduce some notation. We will use boldfaced letters to represent vectors. The space of polynomials of total degree ≤ k in d variables will be denoted by Pk(R), and the space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree k in d variables will be denoted byHk(R). It is well-known [9, page 445] that the dimension ofHk(R) is 2 for k ≥ 1, while the dimension ofHk(R) is 2k+ 1 for k ≥ 1. Let T be a d-dimensional simplex (triangle if d = 2 and tetrahedron if d = 3). The barycentric coordinates of T will be denoted by λi for 1 ≤ i ≤ d + 1, i.e., λj ∈ P1(R) and λi(pj) = δij, where pj is the j-th vertex of T , δij = 1 if i = j and δij = 0 if i 6= j. The canonical basis vectors ofRd will be denoted by ei for 1 ≤ i ≤ d, where the j-th component of ei equals δij. Note that the subscript i (or j) is to be interpreted as an integer modulo d+ 1, i.e., d+ k+ 1 is treated the same as k. The two-dimensional quadratic vector finite element has a triangle T as the element domain, P2 = [P2(R)] ⊕∇H4(R) I This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant no.

Let ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, be the edge of T opposite the vertex pi. We define, for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and v ∈ P2, M4(i−1)+1(v) = ∫ ei λi+1(v · e1)ds, M4(i−1)+2(v) = ∫ ei λi+2(v · e1)ds, M4(i−1)+3(v) = ∫ ei λi+1(v · e2)ds, M4(i−1)+4(v) = ∫ ei λi+2(v · e2)ds, and M13(v) = ∫ T v · e1dx, M14(v) = ∫ T v · e2dx. In other words, M4(i−1)+k for 1 ≤ k ≤ 4 are the linear functionals that define the moments of order ≤ 1 on edge Ei for the two components of v, andM13,M14 are the linear functionals that define the moments of order 0 on the triangle for the two components of v. Note that the definition of P2 implies that for any v = [ v1 v2 ] ∈ P2 we have ∇ × v = ∂v2 ∂x1 − ∂v1 ∂x2 ∈ P1(R) and ∇ · v = ∂v1 ∂x1 + ∂v2 ∂x2 ∈ P1(R). (1) Wewant to establish that (T ,P2,N2) is a finite element. Since dimP2 = 14, we only need to show thatP2 is determined byN2 (or P2 is unisolvent underN2). The following lemma is useful for this purpose. Lemma 1. Let φ ∈ P3(R). If ∆φ = 0, M2(i−1)+k(φ) := ∫ ei λi+kφds = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2, and M7(φ) = ∫ T φdx = 0, then φ = 0. Proof. Observe first that the momentsM` (1 ≤ ` ≤ 7) are linearly independent as functionals on P3(R). Indeed, we can construct seven polynomials q` ∈ P3(R) such thatM`(qk) = δ`k as follows. Consider the polynomial q = λi+1λi+2(αλi+1 + βλi+2)+ γ λ1λ2λ3. Clearly q vanishes on the two edges defined by λi+1 = 0 and λi+2 = 0. On the edge ei defined by λi = 0, by choosing appropriate α and β , we can ensure either ∫ ei λi+1qds = 1 and ∫	acoustic cryptanalysis;barycentric subdivision;basis (linear algebra);degree (graph theory);degree of a polynomial;finite element method;geographic coordinate system;maxwell (microarchitecture);modulo operation;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;omega;raviart–thomas basis functions;resonance;curl	Susanne C.

This fully Lagrangian advection algorithm introduces no artificial numerical dissipation or interpolation of parcel values. In the zero-viscosity limit, it preserves all of the Casimir invariants associated with parcel rearrangement. In the two-dimensional case presented here, these invariants are arbitrary piecewise continuous functions of the vorticity and concentration fields. The initial parcel centroids are evolved in a Lagrangian frame, using the method of characteristics. At any time this Lagrangian solution may be viewed by projecting it onto an Eulerian grid using a rearrangement map. The resulting rearrangement of initial parcel values is accomplished with a weighted Bresenham algorithm, which identifies quasioptimal, distributed paths along which chains of parcels are pushed to fill in nearby empty cells. The error introduced by this rearrangement does not propagate to future time steps.	augmented lagrangian method;bresenham's line algorithm;interpolation;numerical method;parcel mule scam	John C.

The PDE-domain and the Data-domain are tightly coupled, as the PDE solution is driven by the collected data, while the information gathered from its associated sensors is influenced by the PDE solution. Our overall methodology is based on the Schwarz alternating method and on recent advances in Gaussian process regression (GPR) using multi-fidelity data. The effectiveness of the proposed domain decomposition algorithm is demonstrated by examples of Helmholtz equations in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) domains.	bi-directional text;data domain;sensor	Dongkun Zhang;Liu Yang;George Em Karniadakis	2018	J.

This paper establishes an adaptive refinement strategy based on some equivalent refinement indicators. Since the first-order div LSFEMmeasures the flux errors inH(div), the data resolution error measures the L2 norm of the right-hand side f minus the piecewise polynomial approximation Πf without a mesh-size factor. Hence the data resolution term is neither an oscillation nor of higher order and consequently requires a particular treatment, e.g., by the thresholding second algorithm due to Binev and DeVore. The resulting novel adaptive LSFEM with separate marking converges with optimal rates relative to the notion of a nonlinear approximation class.	algorithm;approximation;computable function;error detection and correction;finite element method;first-order predicate;item unique identification;least squares;nonlinear system;polynomial;refinement (computing);span and div;thresholding (image processing)	Carsten Carstensen;Eun-Jae Park	2015	SIAM J.

This interest in partly due to advances in areas of technology which require the solution of PDEs, but is primarily due to the need to apply modern optimization and identification techniques to the spatially continuous systems that are best modeled by PDEs. The parallel organization of the analog subsection of a hybrid computer facilitates extremely rapid solutions of complicated systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Therefore, techniques to find a system of ODEs that can be solved to obtain a rapid approximate solution to a PDE on the hybrid computer have become the subject of intensive investigation.	algebraic equation;apply;approximation algorithm;galerkin method;hybrid computer;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;system identification	Donald J.

411e4418b35f2a0dd1ceff28f8dd2ea340186b9c	singularity formation in a model for the vortex sheet with surface tension	vortex sheet;singularities;surface tension	In a recent analytical study, the author has proved well-posedness of the vortex sheet with surface tension. This work included using a formulation of the problem introduced by Hou, Lowengrub, and Shelley for a numerical study of the same problem. The analytical study required identification of a term in the evolution equations which can be viewed as being responsible for the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability; this term is of lower order than the surface tension term. In the present work, the author introduces a simple model for the vortex sheet with surface tension which maintains the same dispersion relation and the same destabilizing force as in the vortex sheet with surface tension. For the model problem, it is found that finite-time singularities can form when the initial data is taken from a certain class. For the vortex sheet with surface tension, the only observed singularities thus far in numerical work have coincided with self-intersection of the fluid interface. There is no analogue of self-intersection in the model problem, and thus the singularities observed in the present work may well be related to a previously unobserved singularity for the full vortex sheet problem. © 2009 IMACS.

Therefore, the solutions of a DAEs can be considered as the limit of the solutions of the corresponding stiff ODEs in some sense. Some similar results with M.

When the solution domain is unbounded, the diffusion operator no longer has a compact resolvent, which makes the Hermite spectral methods unstable. To overcome this difficulty, a time-dependent scaling factor is employed in the Hermite expansions, which yields a positive bilinear form. As a consequence, stability and spectral convergence can be established for this approach. The present method plays a similar role in the stability of the similarity transformation technique proposed by Funaro and Kavian [Math. Comp., 57 (1991), pp. 597–619]. However, since coordinate transformations are not required, the present approach is more efficient and is easier to implement. In fact, with the time-dependent scaling the resulting discretization system is of the same form as that associated with the classical (straightforward but unstable) Hermite spectral method. Numerical experiments are carried out to support the theoretical stability and convergence results.	bilinear filtering;control theory;discretization;experiment;image scaling;nonlinear system;numerical method;parabolic antenna;resolution (logic);spectral method	Heping Ma;Weiwei Sun;Tao Tang	2005	SIAM J.

In this formulation, the WENO interpolation of the solution and its derivatives are used to directly construct the numerical flux, instead of the usual practice of reconstructing the flux functions. Even though this formulation is more expensive than the standard formulation, it does have several advantages. The first advantage is that arbitrary monotone fluxes can be used in this framework, while the traditional practice of reconstructing flux functions can be applied only to smooth flux splitting. The second advantage, which is fully explored in this paper, is that a narrower effective stencil is used compared with previous high order finite difference WENO schemes based on the reconstruction of flux functions, with a Lax--Wendroff time discretization. We will describe the scheme formulation and present numerical tests for one- and two-dimensional scalar ...	discretization;finite difference	Yan Jiang;Chi-Wang Shu;Mengping Zhang	2013	SIAM J.

efb3a9a83740ba0122a31ac601da79d5d4330846	a 3d, fully eulerian, vof-based solver to study the interaction between two fluids and moving rigid bodies using the fictitious domain method	fluid structure interaction;moving rigid bodies;volume of fluid;multi material reconstruction;multi phase	We present a three-dimensional (3D) and fully Eulerian approach to capturing the interaction between two fluids and moving rigid structures by using the fictitious domain and volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods. The solid bodies can have arbitrarily complex geometry and can pierce the fluid-fluid interface, forming contact lines. The three-phase interfaces are resolved and reconstructed by using a VOF-based methodology. Then, a consistent scheme is employed for transporting mass and momentum, allowing for simulations of three-phase flows of large density ratios. The Eulerian approach significantly simplifies numerical resolution of the kinematics of rigid bodies of complex geometry and with six degrees of freedom. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is computed using the fictitious domain method. The methodology was developed in a Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel framework accelerated with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The computationally intensive solution of the pressure Poisson equation is ported to GPUs, while the remaining calculations are performed on CPUs. The performance and accuracy of the methodology is assessed using an array of test cases, focusing individually on the flow solver and the FSI in surface-piercing configurations. Finally, an application of the proposed methodology in simulations of the ocean wave energy converters is presented. ∗Corresponding author Email addresses: apathak@umassd.edu (Ashish Pathak), mraessi@umassd.edu (Mehdi Raessi) Preprint submitted to Journal of Computational Physics January 25, 2016	3d computer graphics;central processing unit;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computational physics;computer simulation;email;fictitious domain method;graphics processing unit;hpc challenge benchmark;ibm notes;interaction;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;message passing interface;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical stability;pierce oscillator;simulation;six degrees of separation;solver;stanford university centers and institutes;test case;topography;volume of fluid method;wireless experimental centre	Ashish Pathak;Mehdi Raessi	2016	J.

d45dd09df4981f7b243a276e55d1bfa1b194f46f	robust contact generation for robot simulation with unstructured meshes		This paper presents a numerically stable method for rigid body simulation of unstructured meshes undergoing forceful contact, such as in robot locomotion and manipulation. The key contribution is a new contact generation method that treats the geometry as having a thin virtual boundary layer around the underlying meshes. Unlike existing methods, it produces contact estimates that are stable with respect to small displacements, which helps avoid jitter or divergence in the simulator caused by oscillatory discontinuities. Its advantages are particularly apparent on non-watertight meshes and can easily simulate interaction with partially-sensed and noisy objects, such as those that emerge from low-cost 3D scanners. The simulator is tested on a variety of robot locomotion and manipulation examples, and results closely match theoretical predictions and experimental data.	3d scanner;cluster analysis;convex hull;graphics processing unit;interaction;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;numerical stability;out of the box (feature);point cloud;robot locomotion;simulation;stepping level;thickness (graph theory);thinking outside the box;unstructured grid;vergence	Kris Hauser	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-28872-7_21	robot locomotion;humanoid robot;experimental data;polygon mesh;boundary layer;control engineering;jitter;classification of discontinuities;computer science;rigid body	Robotics	93.92333733624126	5.906290839770788	128637

Given a system of differential equations possessing conservation laws, our approach is based on discretizing conservation law multipliers and their associated density and flux functions. We show that the proposed discretization is consistent for any order of accuracy when the discrete multiplier has a multiplicative inverse. Moreover, we show that by construction, discrete densities can be exactly conserved. In particular, the multiplier method does not require the system to possess a Hamiltonian or variational structure. Examples, including dissipative problems, are given to illustrate the method. In the case when the inverse of the discrete multiplier becomes singular, consistency of the method is also established for scalar ODEs provided the discrete multiplier and density are zero compatible.	finite difference method	Andy T.

edf3d0c3367eec00348153875caf8ec99614e511	a partition of unity finite element method for computational diffusion mri		Abstract The Bloch–Torrey equation describes the evolution of the spin (usually water proton) magnetization under the influence of applied magnetic field gradients and is commonly used in numerical simulations for diffusion MRI and NMR. Microscopic heterogeneity inside the imaging voxel is modeled by interfaces inside the simulation domain, where a discontinuity in the magnetization across the interfaces is produced via a permeability coefficient on the interfaces. To avoid having to simulate on a computational domain that is the size of an entire imaging voxel, which is often much larger than the scale of the microscopic heterogeneity as well as the mean spin diffusion displacement, smaller representative volumes of the imaging medium can be used as the simulation domain. In this case, the exterior boundaries of a representative volume either must be far away from the initial positions of the spins or suitable boundary conditions must be found to allow the movement of spins across these exterior boundaries. Many approaches have been taken to solve the Bloch–Torrey equation but an efficient high performance computing framework is still missing. In this paper, we present formulations of the interface as well as the exterior boundary conditions that are computationally efficient and suitable for arbitrary order finite elements and parallelization. In particular, the formulations are based on the partition of unity concept which allows for a discontinuous solution across interfaces conforming with the mesh with weak enforcement of real (in the case of interior interfaces) and artificial (in the case of exterior boundaries) permeability conditions as well as an operator splitting for the exterior boundary conditions. The method is straightforward to implement and it is available in FEniCS for moderate-scale simulations and in FEniCS-HPC for large-scale simulations. The order of accuracy of the resulting method is validated in numerical tests and a good scalability is shown for the parallel implementation. We show that the simulated dMRI signals offer good approximations to reference signals in cases where the latter are available and we performed simulations for a realistic model of a neuron to show that the method can be used for complex geometries.	finite element method	Dang Van Nguyen;Johan Jansson;Johan Hoffman;Jing-Rebecca Li	2018	J.

In this paper, we propose and study a fully implicit method which imposes no limit on the time step size, but requires the solution of a large sparse nonlinear system of equations at every time step. The focus of the paper is a parallel, fully coupled, Newton-Krylov-RAS algorithm with a Jacobian matrix explicitly calculated on a weakly non-matching cubed-sphere mesh. Here RAS is a restricted additive Schwarz method. We show numerically that with such a preconditioned nonlinearly implicit method the time step size is no longer constrained by the CFL condition and report superlinear speedup of the algorithm on machines with thousands of processors, and for problems with smooth and non-smooth solutions.	additive schwarz method;algorithm;central processing unit;climate model;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;domain decomposition methods;explicit and implicit methods;iterative proportional fitting;jacobian matrix and determinant;krylov subspace;langrisser schwarz;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;sparse matrix;speedup;utility functions on indivisible goods;water model	Chao Yang;Jianwen Cao;Xiao-Chuan Cai	2010	SIAM J.

The distinctive feature of this method is that the stabilization parameters associated with the numerical trace of the flux are identically equal to zero in the interior of the domain; this is why its dissipation is said to be minimal. We show that the orders of convergence of the approximations for the potential and the flux using polynomials of degree k are the same as those of all known discontinuous Galerkin methods for both unknowns, namely, (k + 1) and k, respectively. Our numerical results verify that these orders of convergence are sharp. The novelty of the analysis is that it bypasses a seemingly indispensable condition, namely, the positivity of the above mentioned stabilization parameters, by using a new, carefully defined projection tailored to the very definition of the numerical traces.	approximation;coefficient;degree (graph theory);discontinuous galerkin method;experiment;molecular dynamics;numerical analysis;polynomial;tracing (software)	Bernardo Cockburn;Bo Dong	2007	J.

The proposed method combines the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework [4,5] with the high order finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method in space and the total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge–Kutta (RK) method in time (WENO-RK) [18,10] by a high order coupling. Our goal is to realize mesh adaptivity in the AMR framework, while maintaining very high (higher than second) order accuracy of the WENO-RK method in the finite difference setting. The high order coupling of AMR and WENO-RK is accomplished by high order prolongation in both space (WENO interpolation) and time (Hermite interpolation) from coarse to fine grid solutions, and at ghost points. The resulting AMR-WENO method is accurate, robust and efficient, due to the mesh adaptivity and very high order spatial and temporal accuracy. We have experimented with both the third and the fifth order AMR-WENO schemes. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme using smooth test problems, and their quality and efficiency using several 1D and 2D nonlinear hyperbolic problems with very challenging initial conditions. The AMR solutions are observed to perform as well as, and in some cases even better than, the corresponding uniform fine grid solutions. We conclude that there is significant improvement of the fifth order AMR-WENO over the third order one, not only in accuracy for smooth problems, but also in its ability in resolving complicated solution structures, due to the very low numerical diffusion of high order schemes. In our work, we found that it is difficult to design a robust AMR-WENO scheme that is both conservative and high order (higher than second order), due to the mass inconsistency of coarse and fine grid solutions at the initial stage in a finite difference scheme. Resolving these issues as well as conducting comprehensive evaluation of computational efficiency constitute our future work. Recently high order (higher than second order) methods have attracted increasing attention from many computational fields of study. High order schemes are often considered expensive, unstable and unnecessary. However, it is argued in some studies that the expenses of high order schemes are compensated by their high order accuracy and very low numerical	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive mesh refinement;algorithm;aniruddha m. gole;chi;chebyshev polynomials;computation;control theory;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;dxl;finite difference method;finite volume method;hermite interpolation;incisive;initial condition;linux/rk;mass effect trilogy;matrix multiplication;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical diffusion;polynomial;precomputation;quintic function;randall j. leveque;refinement (computing);runge–kutta methods;simulation;total variation diminishing;truncation error (numerical integration)	Chaopeng Shen;Jing-Mei Qiu;Andrew J.

While it performs better in anisotropic media, it performs poorly in isotropic media because it is equivalent to four overlapping, uncoupled Yee grids. We propose to couple the four Yee grids and fix the Lebedev method using discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with higher-order Hodge duals. We find that higher-order Hodge duals do improve the performance of the Lebedev grid, but they also improve the Yee grid by a similar amount. The effectiveness of coupling overlapping Yee grids with a higher-order Hodge dual is thus questionable. However, the theoretical foundations developed to derive these methods may be of interest in other problems.	finite-difference time-domain method	C. Deimert;Mike E. Potter;Michal M.

Typical applications may concern remeshing, multigrid methods, domain decomposition, and multi-physics problems. For electromagnetic fields, one of the essential constraints in such transfers is to conserve energetic quantities such as magnetic energy and joule heating. Within the framework of Galerkin projection on overlapping domains, we introduce the definition of energetic norms for electromagnetic fields. The corresponding formulations we propose provide energy-conserving projection of electromagnetic fields between different meshes.	computation;domain decomposition methods;galerkin method;joule;multigrid method	Zifu Wang;Zuqi Tang;Thomas Henneron;Francis Piriou;Jean Claude Mipo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Magnetics		classical mechanics;transmission-line matrix method;electromagnetic field;discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method;galerkin method;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	92.50854551233974	9.149048301644742	130431

Elliptic hemivariational inequalities are equivalently expressed as a system consisting of one equation and one inclusion for a couple of unknowns, namely a primal variable u and an element belonging to a multivalued mapping at u. Both components of the solution are approximated independently each other by a finite element method. Parabolic inequalities are transformed into a system of elliptic ones by using an appropriate time discretization. A numerical experiment is realized by using non-smooth optimization methods.	approximation	Jaroslav Haslinger;M. Miettinen	2000	J.

The error analysis of the BLAGE method is discussed briefly. The performance of this more accurate BLAGE method is compared with the corresponding block successive over relaxation (BSOR) method by considering two test problems, wherein the significance of the role played by two parameters ω1 and ω2 of the BLAGE method becomes evident in providing both convergence and accuracy of the computed solution.	iterative method	R.

6126367b70bcaa9f3d73b57c2c430578128c8d48	analysis and application of high order implicit runge-kutta schemes for unsteady conjugate heat transfer: a strongly-coupled approach	implicit runge kutta;partitioned method;subiteration stability;unsteady conjugate heat transfer;strongly coupled;high order time integration;computational efficiency	Thermal interaction of fluids and solids, or conjugate heat transfer (CHT), is encountered in many engineering applications. Since time-accurate computations of unsteady CHT can be computationally demanding, we consider the use of high order implicit time integration schemes which have the potential to be more efficient relative to the commonly used second order implicit schemes. We present a strongly-coupled solution algorithm where the high order L-stable explicit first-stage singly diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (ESDIRK) schemes are used to advance the solution in time within each separate fluid and solid subdomains. Furthermore, the stability and rate of convergence of performing (Gauss–Seidel) subiterations at each stage of the ESDIRK schemes are analyzed. The results from solving a numerical example (an unsteady conjugate natural convection in an enclosure) show good agreement with the performed analytical stability analysis. In addition, the (computational) work-(temporal) precision character of several schemes in solving a strongly coupled CHT problem is compared over a range of accuracy requirements. From the efficiency investigation, it is observed that performing subiterations with the strongly-coupled ESDIRK algorithm is more efficient than lowering time-step size using a high order loosely-coupled IMEX algorithm. In addition, by using the ESDIRK schemes, gain in computational efficiency relative to Crank–Nicolson is observed for time-accurate solutions (a factor of 1.4 using the fourth order ESDIRK). The computational gain is higher for smaller tolerances.	runge–kutta methods	V. Kazemi-Kamyab;Alexander van Zuijlen;Hester Bijl	2014	J. Comput.

5e6ec6c4beb05fe632935dccada2626c54f64302	high-order finite element-integral equation coupling on embedded meshes		This paper presents a high-order method for solving an interface problem for the Poisson equation on embedded meshes through a coupled finite element and integral equation approach. The method is capable of handling homogeneous or inhomogeneous jump conditions without modification and retains high-order convergence close to the embedded interface. We present finite element-integral equation (FE-IE) formulations for interior, exterior, and interface problems. The treatments of the exterior and interface problems are new. The resulting linear systems are solved through an iterative approach exploiting the second-kind nature of the IE operator combined with algebraic multigrid preconditioning for the FE part. Assuming smooth continuations of coefficients and right-hand-side data, we show error analysis supporting high-order accuracy. Numerical evidence further supports our claims of efficiency and high-order accuracy for smooth data.		Natalie N. Beams;Andreas Klöckner;Luke N. Olson	2018	J. Comput.

Such materials occur e.g. in historic buildings, and the durability assessment of these therefore needs a reliable and probabilistic simulation of transport processes, which is related to the suitable identification of material parameters. In order to include expert knowledge as well as experimental results, one can employ an updating procedure such as Bayesian inference. The classical probabilistic setting of the identification process in Bayes’s form requires the solution of a stochastic forward problem via computationally expensive sampling techniques, which makes the method almost impractical. In this paper novel stochastic computational techniques such as the stochastic Galerkin method are applied in order to accelerate the updating procedure. The idea is to replace the computationally expensive forward simulation via the conventional finite element (FE) method by the evaluation of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Such an approximation of the FE model for the forward simulation perfectly suits the Bayesian updating. The presented uncertainty updating techniques are applied to the numerical model of coupled heat and moisture transport in heterogeneous materials ∗Corresponding author.

The main benefits of these methods are: good stability, accuracy and parallelizing. But these methods were developed for 1D case and stability and accuracy were investigated for 1D case too. In the present study we extend the new group explicit method [R. Tavakoli, P. Davami, New stable group explicit finite difference method for solution of diffusion equation, Appl. Math. Comput. 181 (2006) 1379–1386] to 2D with operator splitting method. The implementation of method is discussed in details.

ce43157911ac4cbf5d4be705a9cfe2f5a045c0ff	gpu-enhanced finite volume shallow water solver for fast flood simulations	parallel computing;gpu;shallow water;flood simulation;finite volume	In this paper a parallelization of a Shallow Water numerical scheme suitable for Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) architectures under the NVIDIA™'s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) framework is presented. In order to provide robust and accurate simulations of real flood events, the system features a state-of-the-art Finite Volume explicit discretization technique which is well balanced, second order accurate and based on positive depth reconstruction. The model is based on a Cartesian grid and boundary conditions are implemented by means of the implicit local ghost cell approach, which enables the discretization of a broad spectrum of boundary conditions including inflow/outflow conditions. A novel and efficient Block Deactivation Optimization procedure has also been adopted, in order to increase the efficiency of the numerical scheme in the presence of wetting-drying fronts. This led to speedups of two orders of magnitude with respect to a single-core CPU. The code has been validated against several severe benchmark test cases, and its capability of producing accurate fast simulations (with high ratios between physical and computing times) for different real world cases has been shown.	graphics processing unit;simulation;solver	Renato Vacondio;Alessandro Dal Palù;Paolo Mignosa	2014	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.02.003	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;waves and shallow water;theoretical computer science;finite volume method	EDA	92.64739640113984	11.136561511319277	131312

The DG method can be characterized as the fusion of finite elements with finite volumes. This DG formulation uses high-order Lagrange polynomials on the triangle using nodal sets up to 15th order. The finite element-type area integrals are evaluated using order 2N Gauss cubature rules. This leads to a full mass matrix which, unlike for continuous Galerkin (CG) methods such as the spectral element (SE) method presented in Giraldo and Warburton [A nodal triangle-based spectral element method for the shallow water equations on the sphere, J. Comput. Phys. 207 (2005) 129–150], is small, local and efficient to invert. Two types of finite volume-type flux integrals are studied: a set based on Gauss–Lobatto quadrature points (order 2N 1) and a set based on Gauss quadrature points (order 2N). Furthermore, we explore conservation and advection forms as well as strong and weak forms. Seven test cases are used to compare the different methods including some with scale contractions and shock waves. All three strong forms performed extremely well with the strong conservation form with 2N integration being the most accurate of the four DG methods studied. The strong advection form with 2N integration performed extremely well even for flows with shock waves. The strong conservation form with 2N 1 integration yielded results almost as good as those with 2N while being less expensive. All the DG methods performed better than the SE method for almost all the test cases, especially for those with strong discontinuities. Finally, the DG methods required less computing time than the SE method due to the local nature of the mass matrix.

The coarse operator of the MSFV method is presented as a multipoint flux approximation (MPFA) with numerical evaluation of the transmissibilities. The monotonicity region of the original MSFV coarse operator has been determined for the homogeneous anisotropic case. For grid-aligned anisotropy the monotonicity of the coarse operator is very limited. A compact coarse operator for the MSFV method is presented that reduces to a 7-point stencil with optimal monotonicity properties in the homogeneous case. For heterogeneous cases the compact coarse operator improves the monotonicity of the MSFV method, especially for anisotropic problems. The compact operator also leads to a coarse linear system much closer to an M-matrix.

After establishing a special quasi-orthogonality property for both the velocity and the pressure in this saddle point problem, we introduce a new prolongation operator to carry through the discrete reliability analysis for the error estimator. We then use a specially defined interpolation operator to prove that, up to oscillation, the error can be bounded by the approximation error within a properly defined nonlinear approximate class. Finally, by introducing a new parameter-dependent error estimator, we prove the convergence and optimality estimates.	navier–stokes equations	Jun Hu;Jinchao Xu	2013	J. Sci.

Assume that the corresponding Riemann problem to the compressible Euler equations can be solved by rarefaction waves (V-R, U-R, S-R)(t, x). If the initial data (v(0), u(0), s(0))(x) to the nonisentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations is a small perturbation of an approximate rarefaction wave constructed as in [ S. Kawashima, A. Matsumura, and K. Nishihara, Proc. Japan Acad. Ser. A, 62 (1986), pp. 249-252], then we show that, for the general gas, the Cauchy problem admits a unique global smooth solution (v, u, s)(t, x) which tends to (V-R, U-R, S-R)(t, x) as t tends to infinity. A global stability result can also be established for the nonisentropic ideal polytropic gas, provided that the adiabatic exponent gamma is close to 1. Furthermore, we show that for the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the corresponding global stability result holds, provided that the resulting compressible Euler equations are strictly hyperbolic and both characteristical fields are genuinely nonlinear. Here, global stability means that the initial perturbation can be large. Since we do not require the strength of the rarefaction waves to be small, these results give the nonlinear stability of strong rarefaction waves for the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations.	navier–stokes equations	Kenji Nishihara;Tong Yang;Huijiang Zhao	2004	SIAM J.

In this paper , we discuss the reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3-D) conductivity around a borehole in a highly deviated formation with invasion. At this moment, we have not included the borehole effect. To solve this problem, the full vector analysis is required. In most available algorithms, for the forward and inverse modeling of the resistivity data, the dipping bed environment is approximated using the staircase-discretization grid. In contrast, we have modeled the dipping-bed environment by introducing an oblique (nonorthogonal) coordinate system. By using the oblique coordinate system, we have gained some advantages over the usual approach. First, the use of the staircasing approximation for the dipping-bed environment can be avoided. This means that we reduce the discretization error, and we can suffice with less discretization points to obtain the results with the same degree of accuracy as the problem formulated in the Cartesian coordinate system. Secondly, the horizontally-symmetry constraints of the conductivity distribution can be included easily in the inversion procedure. Several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the inversion method using the synthetic “measured” data, which are generated by solving a forward-scattering problem numerically with the help of the conjugate gradient fast fourier transform (CGFFT) method.	approximation algorithm;conjugate gradient method;discretization error;fast fourier transform;inverse transform sampling;login;numerical analysis;oblique projection;synthetic data	Aria Abubakar;Peter M. van den Berg	2000	IEEE Trans.

Although previous meshless methods have done the similar simulations, there exists a problem that the moment matrix will be singular when the simulation points are co-planar or co-linear. The consequence is that the shape function cannot be constructed to finish the simulation and special work is needed to deal with the problem. In this paper, we propose a meshless method --- Local Radial Basis Point Interpolation Method (LRPIM) to carry out the simulation. The shape function is constructed using the radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial basis function, and it guarantees that the moment matrix is nonsingular without any other assistance.

The objective of the optimization is to maximize the buckling load of an elastically restrained column by optimally designing the cross-sectional area subject to a minimum cross-section or maximum stress constraint. The first approach involves solving the resulting integral equations iteratively taking into account the boundary conditions, the optimality criterion and the imposed constraints. In the second approach an iterative finite difference approximation scheme is developed.#R##N##R##N#The column is elastically restrained at both ends which produce the simple support and clamped end conditions for the limiting cases leading to the optimal design of columns under general boundary conditions. The above problems do not have analytical solutions due to the complexity of the boundary conditions, constraints and the optimality conditions necessitating the formulation of computational schemes for their solution. Several numerical results are given and compared with available results in the literature. Moreover the accuracy of the methods is studied by comparing the iterative solutions with finite element ones and with exact results when available.	algorithm;column (database);iterative method;optimal design	Sarp Adali;Izzet U.

The constraint for the velocity field is constructed from a combination of the discrete equations of continuity and scalar (e.g. energy) transport, imposing that the newly predicted state must be compatible, in agreement with the equation of state. This way, mass and scalar conservation are guaranteed and the equation of state is exactly fulfilled at every time step. For comparison reasons, two other types of well-known pressure-correction algorithms are also used. The first class, denoted as continuity-constraint pressure-correction, is based on a constraint for the velocity field that is derived solely from the continuity equation. The second class, denoted as analytical compatibility-constraint pressure-correction, constructs the constraint from an analytical combination of the material derivative of the equation of state and the continuity and scalar equations. The algorithms are tested for three example fluid configurations: a single-fluid ideal gas, a two-fluid inert mixture and a two-fluid reacting mixture. The latter is special in the sense that the equation of state is non-linear and not everywhere differentiable. The continuity-constraint pressure-correction algorithm yields unstable solutions if density ratios are high. The analytical compatibility-constraint pressure-correction algorithm yields stable results, but the predicted states do not correspond to the equation of state. The discrete compatibility-constraint pressure-correction algorithm performs well on all test cases: the simulation results are stable and exactly match the equation of state.	algorithm;simulation	Pieter Rauwoens;Jan A.

In this work, our goal is to obtain numerically the approximate solution of a parabolic equation with non-local conditions (on four boundaries) replacing the classical boundary specifications. Finite difference methods are given for solving this parabolic equation in two-dimensional space with non-standard boundary conditions. Several finite difference procedures are given and compared in terms of accuracy and computing time. Two fully explicit schemes, two fully implicit methods, an alternating direction implicit (ADI) formula and two explicit techniques of Saulyev are studied. The unconditional stability of the explicit procedures of Saulyev is significant. The unique advantage of the unconditionally stable implicit ADI method is that it needs only the solution of tridiagonal systems. A numerical integration procedure is employed to overcome the non-standard boundary specifications. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed finite difference methods.	approximation;numerical linear algebra;numerical method	Mehdi Dehghan	2005	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2004.06.066	explicit and implicit methods;crank–nicolson method;ftcs scheme;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;alternating direction implicit method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;boundary value problem;finite difference method;calculus;mathematics	Theory	85.3968337737532	13.814175311195758	132589

In the first half of the paper, we construct a variant of the Morley finite element method, which was originally developed for approximating the fourthorder biharmonic equation, for the bi-wave equation. It is proved that, unlike the biharmonic equation, it is necessary to impose a mesh constraint and to include certain penalty terms in the method to guarantee convergence. Nearly optimal order (off by a factor |lnh|) error estimates in the energy norm and in the H1-norm are established for the proposed Morley-type nonconforming method. In the second half of the paper, we develop a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method for the bi-wave equation using general meshes and prove optimal order error estimates in the energy norm. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to gauge the efficiency of the proposed methods and to validate the theoretical error bounds.	approximation;cubic function;experiment;finite element method;numerical analysis;quartic function	Xiaobing Feng;Michael Neilan	2011	Math.

Incorporating the boundary condition into a discretized system leads to an eigenvalue problem which is nonlinear in only one element. In fiber design one would like to determine the index profile which is involved in Maxwell’s equation so that certain optical properties, which sometimes involve derivatives of the eigenvalues, are satisfied. This contribution discusses how to handle the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and how to determine derivatives of the eigenvalue problem.	discretization;maxwell (microarchitecture);nonlinear system;optical fiber;passive optical network	Linda Kaufman	2006	SIAM J.

The class of problems considered includes problems of stress concentration along edges or crack fronts in general linear three-dimensional elasticity. Our method uses an incomplete construction of three-dimensional dual singular functions, based on explicitly known dual singular functions of two-dimensional problems tensorized by test functions along the edge and combined with complementary terms improving their orthogonality properties with respect to the edge singularities. Our method is aimed at the numerical computation of the stress intensity functions. It is suitable for a postprocessing procedure in the finite element approximation of the solution of the boundary value problem.	approximation;coefficient;computation;distribution (mathematics);duality (optimization);elasticity (data store);finite element method;lagrange multiplier;numerical analysis;polyhedron	Martin Costabel;Monique Dauge;Zohar Yosibash	2004	SIAM J.

Our approach is characterized by using the full Boltzmann equation for the kinetic regime, the Compressible Euler equations for equilibrium, with a buffer zone in which the BGK-ES equation is used to represent the transition between fully kinetic to equilibrium flows. In this fashion, the Boltzmann solver is used only when the collision integral is non-stiff, and the mean free path is of the same order as the mesh size needed to capture variations in macroscopic quantities. Thus, in principle, the same mesh size and time steps can be used in the whole computation. Moreover, the time step is limited only by convective terms. Since the Boltzmann solver is applied only in wholly kinetic regimes, we use the reduced noise DSMC scheme we have proposed in Part I of the present work. This ensures a smooth exchange of information across the different domains, with a natural way to construct interface numerical fluxes. Several tests comparing our hybrid scheme with full Boltzmann DSMC computations show the good agreement between the two solutions, on a wide range of Knudsen numbers.	algorithm;bhatnagar–gross–krook operator;boltzmann machine;computation;direct simulation monte carlo;domain decomposition methods;euler;gradient;lattice boltzmann methods;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;solver;stationary process;velocity (software development)	Alessandro Alaia;Gabriella Puppo	2012	J.

This method is based on first taking the truncated Taylor expansions of the solution function in the fractional Riccati differential equation and then substituting their matrix forms into the equation. Using collocation points, we have the system of nonlinear algebraic equation. Then, we solve the system of nonlinear algebraic equation using Maple 13, and we have the coefficients of the truncated Taylor sum. In addition, illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparing the methodology with some known techniques shows that the present approach is relatively easy and highly accurate.		Yalçin Öztürk;Ayse Anapali;Mustafa Gülsu;Mehmet Sezer	2013	J.

Comput. Math., 7(2) (2007), 245–269], we proved that an adaptive finite element method based on newest vertex bisection in two space dimensions for solving elliptic equations, which is essentially the method from [SINUM, 38 (2000), 466–488] by Morin, Nochetto, and Siebert, converges with the optimal rate.The number of triangles N in the output partition of such a method is generally larger than the number M of triangles that in all intermediate partitions have been marked for bisection, because additional bisections are needed to retain conforming meshes.A key ingredient to our proof was a result from [Numer. Math., 97(2004), 219–268] by Binev, Dahmen and DeVore saying that N −N0 ≤ CM for some absolute constant C, where N0 is the number of triangles from the initial partition that have never been bisected. In this paper, we extend this result to bisection algorithms of n-simplices, with that generalizing the result concerning optimality of the adaptive finite element method to general space dimensions.	algorithm;finite element method	Rob P.

A parallel algorithm based on a new direction splitting approach is developed. Here, the pressure equation is derived from a perturbed form of the continuity equation in which the incompressibility constraint is penalized in a negative norm induced by direction splitting. The scheme used in the algorithm is composed by: pressure prediction, velocity update, penalty step, and pressure correction. In order to achieve a good parallel performance the solution of the Poison problem for the pressure correction is replaced by solving a sequence of one-dimensional second order elliptic boundary value problems in each spatial direction.

The algorithm first computes a cheap, but inaccurate, solution using a coarse propagator (simulating an approximate slow macroscopic model), which is iteratively corrected using a fine-scale propagator (accurately simulating the full microscopic dynamics). This correction is done in parallel over many subintervals, thereby reducing the wall-clock time needed to obtain the solution, compared to the integration of the full microscopic model over the complete time interval. We provide a numerical analysis of the algorithm for a prototypical example of a micro-macro model, namely singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations. We show that the computed solution are better and better approximations of the full microscopic solution (when the parareal iterations proceed) only if special care is taken during the coupling of the microscopic and macroscopic levels of description. The error bound depends on the modeling error of the approximate macroscopic model. We illustrate these results with numerical experiments.	approximation algorithm;experiment;iteration;numerical analysis;parareal;propagator;simulation	Frédéric Legoll;Tony Lelièvre;Giovanni Samaey	2013	SIAM J.

Due to the unidirectional treatment for the intermediate density elements in the traditional topology optimization, we propose a Bi-Directional Interpolation Model (BDIM) that intermediate density elements are judged by a threshold, and establish optimization model. Besides, considering the generation of new hole boundary in the process of heat conduction enhancement topology optimization, we study the perturbation sensitivity analysis with respect to new hole, and present an adaptive dynamic boundary method for the new boundary in the optimization process. Furthermore, based on the domain perturbation technique and Lebesgue differential theory, the topological derivative formulas with different objective functions subjected to three kinds of boundary conditions are derived for the control system of Poisson equation. Finally, a number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for designing the heat conduction structure.	topology optimization	Jiachun Li;FengHua Jia;Yuewei Chen	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-018-5468-0	real-time computing;computer science;mathematical optimization;interpolation;boundary value problem;lebesgue integration;topological derivative;poisson's equation;perturbation (astronomy);thermal conduction;topology optimization	Mobile	92.04847625976264	13.098754526410227	133206

The method is based on Boyd's mapping of a semiinfinite interval to a finite interval, and it is extended to a variational setting which allows for an implementation using a spectral element method. By extending the method to a variational form, a straightforward implementation allows for high-order approximations over an infinite computational domain.#R##N#Methods to find a high-order approximation have been proposed by Funaro, Maday, Mavriplis, and many others. The proposed methods all have drawbacks, including restrictions on the behavior of the approximation at infinity.

It is an approximately periodic structure of domains, separated by walls perpendicular to the long axis of the element. In this paper, we give arguments in favor of our claim that the period is frozen-in at nucleation, i.e., at the critical external field. In prior work, R. Cantero-Alvarez and F. Otto, Journal of Nonlinear Science (2006), we argued that there are four qualitatively different regimes for nucleation. In one of these asymptotic regimes, the unstable mode displays an oscillatory behavior in the direction of the long axis. In this work, we derive a scaling limit of the micromagnetic energy near the bifurcation point in the above regime. We also prove that the scaling limit is coercive for all values of the reduced external field. Because of this coercivity, there exists a branch of nontrivial local minimizers. Numerical minimization of the scaling limit reveals that this branch is indeed a continuous branch of concertina pattern. The scaling limit is derived by Γ-convergence of the suitably rescaled micromagnetic energy. This robust procedure combines the limit of an asymptotic parameter regime with a zoom-in in configuration space. The coercivity of the scaling limit is derived by suitable nonlinear interpolation estimates.	bifurcation theory	Rubén Cantero-Álvarez;Felix Otto;J. Steiner	2007	J.

The proposed methodology improves the algorithm of aPC and extends the method, that was previously only introduced as tensor product expansion, to moderately high-dimensional stochastic problems. The fundamental idea of aPC is to use the statistical moments of the input random variables to develop the polynomial chaos expansion. This approach provides the possibility to propagate continuous or discrete probability density functions and also histograms (data sets) as long as their moments exist, are finite and the determinant of the moment matrix is strictly positive. For cases with limited data availability, this approach avoids bias and fitting errors caused by wrong assumptions. In this work, an alternative way to calculate the aPC is suggested, which provides the optimal polynomials, Gaussian quadrature collocation points and weights from the moments using only a handful of Corresponding author: e-mail address: r.ahlfeld14@imperial.ac.uk Preprint submitted to Journal of Computational Physics May 10, 2016 matrix operations on the Hankel matrix of moments. It can therefore be implemented without requiring prior knowledge about statistical data analysis or a detailed understanding of the mathematics of polynomial chaos expansions. The extension to more input variables suggested in this work, is an anisotropic and adaptive version of Smolyak’s algorithm that is solely based on the moments of the input probability distributions. It is referred to as SAMBA (PC), which is short for Sparse Approximation of MomentBased Arbitrary Polynomial Chaos. It is illustrated that for moderately high-dimensional problems (up to 20 different input variables or histograms) SAMBA can significantly simplify the calculation of sparse Gaussian quadrature rules. SAMBA’s efficiency for multivariate functions with regard to data availability is further demonstrated by analysing higher order convergence and accuracy for a set of nonlinear test functions with 2, 5 and 10 different input distributions or histograms.	algorithm;coefficient;collocation;computation;computational physics;curse of dimensionality;distribution (mathematics);email;gaussian quadrature;moment matrix;nonlinear system;numerical integration;polynomial;response surface methodology;samba tng;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;test case	R.

E-mail address: azsenalp@gyte.edu.tr The object of this paper is to investigate the effects of perturbation forces to buckling in pressure vessel heads. The pressure vessel heads in concern are confined to torispherical geometry with thin walls. Perturbation forces can alter not only the critical load for buckling but the buckled shape as well. In this paper in addition to previously used perturbation model, three more different perturbation force configurations are applied to the knuckle of the vessel. Internally pressurized three-dimensional torispherical pressure vessel head model that is previously used in literature is constructed and finite element program ANSYS Workbench is used for the solutions. First of all eigenvalue solutions are performed for each model. Then nonlinear instability solutions are conducted to obtain more realistic instability pressure values. For the nonlinear analyses not only large deformation static analyses but also large deformation transient analyses are conducted. For nonlinear analyses, perfectly plastic material model is used. It is concluded that instability pressures obtained by transient analyses are closer to plastic pressure values by PWC and ASME TES criteria and perturbation models increase instability pressure and equivalent plastic strain values. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model involves a standard conservation law supplemented by a local unilateral constraint on the flux at the point x = 0 (modelling a road light, a toll gate, etc.). We first show that the problem can be interpreted in terms of the theory of conservation laws with discontinuous flux function, as developed by Adimurthi et al. [AMG05] and Bürger et al. [BKT09]. We reformulate accordingly the notion of entropy solution introduced in [CG07], and extend the well-posedness results to the L∞ framework. Then, starting from a general monotone finite volume scheme for the non-constrained conservation law, we produce a simple scheme for the constrained problem and show its convergence. The proof uses a new notion of entropy process solution. Numerical examples modelling a “green wave” are presented.	finite volume method;numerical analysis;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link;monotone	Boris P.

We keep the size of the container finite in the dilute limit and consider boundary effects. Einstein’s formula is recovered as a first-order asymptotic expansion of the effective viscosity in the volume fraction. To rigorously justify this expansion, we obtain an explicit upper and lower bound on the effective viscosity. A lower bound is found using energy methods reminiscent of the work of Keller et al. An upper bound follows by obtaining an explicit estimate for the tractions, the normal component of the stress on the fluid boundary, in terms of the velocity on the fluid boundary. This estimate, in turn, is established using a boundary integral formulation for the Stokes equation. Our proof admits a generalization to other particle shapes and the inclusion of point forces to model self-propelled particles.	cubic function;first-order reduction;navier–stokes equations;self-propelled particles;velocity (software development)	Brian M.

Although existing control-oriented thermal models such as thermal equivalent circuits (TEC) are computationally efficient, they only predict average temperatures, and are unable to predict the spatially resolved temperature distribution throughout the cell. We present a low-order 2D thermal model of a cylindrical battery based on a Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin (SG) method, capable of predicting the full temperature distribution with a similar efficiency to a TEC. The model accounts for transient heat generation, anisotropic heat conduction, and non-homogeneous convection boundary conditions. The accuracy of the model is validated through comparison with finite element simulations, which show that the 2-D temperature field (r, z) of a large format (64 mm diameter) cell can be accurately modelled with as few as 4 states. Furthermore, the performance of the model for a range of Biot numbers is investigated via frequency analysis. For larger cells or highly transient thermal dynamics, the model order can be increased for improved accuracy. The incorporation of this model in a state estimation scheme with experimental validation against thermocouple measurements is presented in the companion contribution (Part II).	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;chebyshev polynomials;coefficient;computation;computer cooling;distribution (mathematics);equivalent circuit;expectation propagation;experiment;finite difference method;finite element method;frequency analysis;galerkin method;imaginary time;lambda lifting;matlab;natural user interface;net neutrality;polynomial;radial (radio);radial basis function;relative intensity noise;simulation;suicidegirls;transfer function	Robert R.

These instabilities arise from aliasing errors associated with the collocation projection of the flux corresponding to the numerical solution onto the polynomial basis of the numerical flux. In this paper, we obtain energy bounds on the numerical solution via FR to prove that stability can be ensured for any polynomial order by the addition of adequate artificial dissipation such that the solution is energy-stable beyond a critical grid resolution. This artificial viscosity is then approximately posed as a Fourier filtering operation which is implemented in the physical space via a strictly local convolution integral. The filter is selectively applied to u0027troubledu0027 cells as indicated by a discontinuity sensor based on the spectral concentration method. Numerous numerical tests in 1-D and 2-D have been performed. The proposed approach captures shock discontinuities while preserving accuracy in smooth regions of the solution, even for very high polynomial orders such as P = 119 . The filtered solution provides reduced total variation, reduced maximum overshoot/undershoot, and even allows sub-element shocks to be localized in the interior of an element.

Whereas explicit SSP Runge–Kutta methods have order at most four, we prove that explicit SSP TSRK methods have order at most eight. We present explicit TSRK methods of up to eighth order that were found by numerical search. These methods have larger SSP coefficients than any known methods of the same order of accuracy and may be implemented in a form with relatively modest storage requirements. The usefulness of the TSRK methods is demonstrated through numerical examples, including integration of very high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory discretizations.	coefficient;discretization;general linear methods;linear multistep method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;optimization problem;order of accuracy;requirement;runge–kutta methods;test case;total variation diminishing;variation diminishing property	David I.

Features include linear instability of basic solutions and weakly nonlinear evolution of small perturbations, as well as the complex dynamics of period doubling, quadrupling, and eventual chaotic oscillations. Both asymptotic and numerical methods are used for different solution regimes. First, multiscale weakly nonlinear analysis takes into account the cumulative effect of small nonlinearities to obtain a correct description of the evolution over long times. For a range of parameters, the asymptotic method with some dominant modes captures the formation of coherent structures. In other cases, numerical solutions reveal period-folding behaviors. In general, the oneand two-sided models agree qualitatively for all solution regimes, which is consistent with prior numerical comparisons and extends our results from [L. K. Gross and J. Yu, SIAM J.

The corresponding linear energy gradients and constant energy Hessians constitute an efficient model for computing bending forces and their derivatives, enabling fast time-integration of cloth dynamics with a two- to three-fold net speedup over existing nonlinear methods, and near-interactive rates for Willmore smoothing of large meshes.

The MTK’s design is based on a variant of the Castillo–Grone Method for the construction of discrete differential operators that mimic important properties of their continuous counterparts. The MTK is built as a collection of abstract and concrete classes, thus allowing for an extensible framework, which fosters code reutilization, while intuitively educating the user about the theoretical aspects of Mimetic Finite Differences. We present an overview to Mimetic Finite Differences, and we discuss the computational modeling of the related concepts; in this way, we explain how does the MTK implement these methods. By means of examples, we illustrate the MTK’s usage philosophy and, finally, we show the correctness of the implementation efforts in the MTK by comparing the attained results against previously studied reference solutions.	application programming interface;correctness (computer science);finite difference;mimesis (mathematics);numerical partial differential equations	Eduardo J.

Numerical analysis of the spectral Galerkin projection procedure used to compute the solutions and the eigenvalues of the linearization shows that the set of discrete eigenvalues converges in terms of its mean value. Further analysis shows that the spurious eigenvalues — those that are farthest from the mean value — correspond to eigenfunctions which produce the largest residual in the eigenvalue problem used to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.	approximation;discretization;galerkin method;numerical analysis;truncation	Raymond A.

The aim is to evidence the effect of the curved geometry on the aerodynamic efficiency. By means of an analytical-numerical integration methodology, leading asymptotically to an exponential convergence, we show that the influence of such a geometry on the overall aerodynamic performance must be considered as a first order issue also in the limits of a linear approach. o 1991 Academic Press.

Moreover, an efficient and accurate algorithm based on the Fourier–Galerkin approximations is developed and implemented in solving the differential equations related to the present problem. Also, the effects of non-Newtonian parameters on the flow characteristics are obtained and analyzed. The method developed here is so general that it can be used to study the mathematical models that involve the flow of viscous fluids with shear rate-dependent properties: For example, models dealing with polymer processing, tribology & lubrication, and food processing. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction and vorticity variables are solved simply with Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) method. Using a very fine grid mesh with 1025 × 1025 points, the steady driven cavity flow is solved for Re ≤ 20,000. For accuracy, the iterations are carried out on the streamfunction and vorticity variables until the steady streamfunction and vorticity equations are satisfied with a residual that were less than 10−10. Interesting features of the flow are presented in detail. The nature of the driven cavity flow at high Reynolds numbers is discussed in detail in terms of physical and mathematical and also numerical aspects, in an attempt to address the controversy on this flow problem at high Reynolds numbers.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computable function;direct numerical simulation;flow network;grid computing;iteration;left corner;linear programming relaxation;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical method;rate of convergence;relaxation (approximation);reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;scott continuity;steady state;successive over-relaxation;vortex	E.

In this paper, the global existence of transonic solutions to the HEP is established using the generalized Glimm method. New versions of Riemann and boundary-Riemann solvers are provided as building blocks of the generalized Glimm method by applying the contraction matrices to the homogeneous Riemann (or boundary-Riemann) solutions. The extended Glimm--Goodman wave interaction estimates are investigated for obtaining a stable scheme and positive gas velocity, which matches the physical observation. The limit of approximation solutions serves as an entropy solution of bounded variations. Moreover, the range of the feasible hydrodynamical region is also obtained.	planetary scanner	Bo-Chih Huang;Shih-Wei Chou;John M. Hong;Chien-Chang Yen	2016	SIAM J. Math.

216a02f74edce6f95adcf3c9b29d8ec3ff3b1dfd	geometrically exact finite element formulations for curved slender beams: kirchhoff-love theory vs. simo-reissner theory		The present work focuses on geometrically exact finite elements for highly slender beams. It aims at the proposal of novel formulations of Kirchhoff-Love type, a detailed review of existing formulations of Kirchhoff-Love and SimoReissner type as well as a careful evaluation and comparison of the proposed and existing formulations. Two different rotation interpolation schemes with strong or weak Kirchhoff constraint enforcement, respectively, as well as two different choices of nodal triad parametrizations in terms of rotation or tangent vectors are proposed. The combination of these schemes leads to four novel finite element variants, all of them based on a C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam centerline. Essential requirements such as representability of general 3D, large-deformation, dynamic problems involving slender beams with arbitrary initial curvatures and anisotropic cross-section shapes, preservation of objectivity and path-independence, consistent convergence orders, avoidance of locking effects as well as conservation of energy and momentum by the employed spatial discretization schemes, but also a range of practically relevant secondary aspects will be investigated analytically and verified numerically for the different formulations. It will be shown that the geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam elements proposed in this work are the first ones of this type that fulfill all these essential requirements. On the contrary, Simo-Reissner type formulations fulfilling these requirements can be found in the literature very well. However, it will be argued that the shear-free Kirchhoff-Love formulations can provide considerable numerical advantages such as lower spatial discretization error level, improved performance of time integration schemes as well as linear and nonlinear solvers or smooth geometry representation as compared to shear-deformable Simo-Reissner formulations when applied to highly slender beams. Concretely, several representative numerical test cases confirm that the proposed Kirchhoff-Love formulations exhibit a lower discretization error level as well as a considerably improved nonlinear solver performance in the range of high beam slenderness ratios as compared to two representative Simo-Reissner element formulations from the literature.	discretization error;finite element method;hermite interpolation;kirchhoff's theorem;lock (computer science);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;objectivity/db;requirement;solver;test case	Christoph Meier;Wolfgang A.

While Monte Carlo methods are typically used for simulations of the forward-peaked scattering behavior of electron beams, rough calculations suggest that grid-based discretizations can provide more efficient simulations if the discretizations can be made sufficiently accurate, and optimal solvers can be found for the resulting linear systems. The multigrid method for model two-dimensional transport problems presented in [C. Börgers and S. MacLachlan, J. Comput. Phys., 229 (2010), pp. 2914–2931] shows the necessary optimal scaling with some dependence on the choice of scattering kernel. In order to understand this behavior, local Fourier analysis can be applied to the two-grid cycle. Using this approach, expressions for the error-propagation operators of the coarse-grid correction and relaxation steps, projected onto the fine-grid harmonic spaces, can be found. In this paper, we consider easier problems of the form of generalized diffusion problems in space-time that are analogous to model two-dimensional transport problems. We present local Fourier analysis results for these space-time model problems and compare with convergence factors of Börgers and MacLachlan. Since one of our model problems is the diffusion equation itself, we also compare to convergence factors for the diffusion equation of [S. Vandewalle and G. Horton, Computing, 54 (1995), pp. 317–330]. The results presented here show that local Fourier analysis does not offer its usual predictivity of the convergence behavior of the diffusion equation and the generalized diffusion equations until we consider unrealistically long time intervals.	electron;fourier analysis;image scaling;linear programming relaxation;linear system;monte carlo method;multigrid method;numerical method;propagation of uncertainty;relaxation (approximation);simulation;software propagation	Stephanie Friedhoff;Scott P.

To describe the liquid phase dynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations are coupled to a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) model. Numerical simulations are performed with a modified version software OpenFOAM over a structured grid of hexaedra. Grid adaptation is carried out using an edge subdivision technique which results in non-conformal meshes. Grid convergence is assessed by monitoring integral parameters describing the dynamics of the post-impact free-surface waves. Starting from an initial grid spacing between D / 8 and D / 5 , with D drop diameter, a refinement level of three is found to be sufficient to describe the diverse flow feature and to identify the splashing regime.	oblique projection;simulation	Paola Brambilla;Alberto Guardone	2015	J.

Most intriguingly, we determine a branch of solutions that are not perturbations of solutions to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS); moreover, they are not monotone, but they are stable. Furthermore, these axisymmetric ring-like solutions exist over a broader parameter regime than the monotone profile.		Chris J. Budd;Vivi Rottschäfer;J. F. Williams	2005	SIAM J.

The mathematical model considers a viscous incompressible fluid under the effect of transverse magnetic field, taking into account the effect of Hall currents for a magneto-fluid with suspended particles between infinite parallel walls on which a sinusoidal traveling wave is imposed. A perturbation solution to the complete set of Navier–Stokes equations is found for the case in which the frequency of the traveling wave and that of the imposed pressure gradient are equal. The ratio of the traveling wave amplitude to channel width is assumed to be small. For this case a first order steady flow is found to exist, as contrasted to a second order effect in the absence of the imposed periodic pressure gradient. The effect of Hall parameter, Hartmann number and the various parameters included in the problem are discussed numerically. 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.	gradient;mathematical model;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;pipelines;transverse wave	N.

The transformation formulas of electromagnetic field components, space components and time variable are discussed by using Lorentz transformation between two inertial systems. The total-field scattering-field boundary condition is built to introduce an incident plane wave in the rest system of moving bodies. The reflection wave of one dimensional moving conducting surface is simulated with the proposed Lorentz-FDTD method. Numerical results show that the reflection wave suffers a frequency shift. Also, the range of frequency shift is a function of the moving velocity of bodies.	finite-difference time-domain method;incidence matrix;numerical method;velocity (software development)	Kui-Song Zhang;Jianzhou Li;Gao Wei;Jiadong Xu	2012	2012 8th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2012.6292653	frequency modulation;finite-difference time-domain method;reflection;surface wave;lorentz transformation;finite difference method;electrical conductor;geometry;scattering	Robotics	91.41567493569875	5.9020716410622684	136672

We use solid NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) to define vascular geometries as well to perform analysis. It is argued in this paper that this new approach is a viable alternative to the finite element method, which is a standard tool for analysis of vascular systems. Advantages of the new approach are discussed and the technique is demonstrated on a variety of patient-specific arterial models.	computational fluid dynamics;finite element method;isogeometric analysis;non-uniform rational b-spline	Yuri Bazilevs;Yongjie Zhang;Victor M.

Fundamental to the success of the method is the robust generation of bulk and surface meshes. For this purpose, we use a novel moving mesh partial differential equation (MMPDE) approach. The developed method is applied to model problems with known analytical solutions; these experiments indicate second-order spatial and temporal accuracy. Coupled bulk-surface problems occur frequently in many areas; in particular, in the modelling of eukaryotic cell migration and chemotaxis. We apply the method to a model of the two-way interaction of a migrating cell in a chemotactic field, where the bulk region corresponds to the extracellular region and the surface to the cell membrane.	approximation algorithm;awards;calculus of variations;cellular morphology;cellular phone;chemotactic factors;chemotaxis;computation (action);dimensions;epilepsies, partial;experiment;finite element method;gain;galaxy morphological classification;gentamicins;gradient;mechanics;mesh generation;migration, cell;neoplasms;normal (geometry);numerical analysis;persistence (computer science);plantago princeps;plasma membrane;polygon mesh;population model;science;seizures;simulation;solutions;velocity (software development);extracellular;polarity	G.

The two representations are coupled through a high-order asymptotic formula that takes into account the function values and the third derivative in the classical turning points. For various examples the convergence is analyzed for various physics problems that use an expansion in a large number of oscillator states. The results show significant improvement over the JM-ECS method [Y. Bidasyuk, W. Vanroose, J. Broeckhove, F. Arickx, V.

In this paper, we develop the Besjes inequality for identity maps with perturbations that are (i) at low-order resonance (periodic with short period) and (ii) far from low-order resonance in discrete time. We use these inequalities to prove corresponding first-order averaging principles, together with a principle of adiabatic invariance on extended timescales, and we generalize and apply these mathematical results to model problems in accelerator beam dynamics and to the Hénon map.	adiabatic invariant;first-order predicate;hénon map;iteration;recurrence relation;resonance;social inequality	H.

The nonlinear regimes of forced oscillations are analyzed with a semi-analytical approach, finding that the system exhibits features typical of Duffing-like nonlinear oscillators, such as jumps and multivalued frequency-response curves, with both stable and unstable periodic solutions. It is also proved that, for appropriate combinations of parameters, the system acts as a linear, damped oscillator, independently of the oscillation amplitude: in this case, the nonlinear coupling term reduces to a viscous-like term, physically interpretable as electromechanical damping. c © 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd	capacitive sensing;control theory;first-order predicate;frequency response;microelectromechanical systems;nonlinear system;semiconductor industry	Fabio Peano;Gianni Coppa;Cristina Serazio;Federico Peinetti;A.

Math. 2001; 88:559–579] and its modification in [Multilevel Block Factorization Preconditioners. Matrix-based Analysis and Algorithms for Solving Finite Element Equations. Springer: New York, 2008]. The new result imposes fewer restrictions on the aggregates that makes it easier to verify in practice. Also, we extend a result in [Appl. Math. 2011] that allows us to use aggressive coarsening at all levels. This is due to the properties of the special polynomial smoother that we use and analyze. In particular, we obtain bounds in the multilevel convergence estimates that are independent of the coarsening ratio. Numerical illustration is also provided.

The temporal evolution of the Cahn–Hilliard equation has multiple time scales. For spinodal decomposition simulation, an initial random perturbation evolves on a fast time scale, and later coarsening evolves on a very slow time scale. Therefore, if a small time step is used to capture the fast dynamics, the computation is quite costly. On the other hand, if a large time step is used, fast time evolutions may be missed. Hence, it is essential to use an adaptive time step method to simulate phenomena with multiple time scales. The proposed time adaptivity algorithm is based on the discrete maximum norm of the difference between two consecutive time step numerical solutions. Numerical experiments in one, two, and three dimensions are presented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the adaptive time-stepping algorithm.

This system is derived from the pseudostressvelocity formulation [11] of two-dimensional Stokes problems through the penalty method or natural time discretization for the respective steady or unsteady state problems. Here γ > 0 is a constant associated with either the penalty parameter or the time-step size and A is a singular map. In this paper, we develop a multigrid solver for the discrete problem using both the RT and the BDM finite elements. We show that the multigrid convergence rate is O( 1+γ −2 1+γ−2+m ), where m is the number of smoothings. This convergence rate is independent of the mesh size and the number of levels used in multigrid. Moreover, numerical results presented in this paper show that the multigrid convergence rate for the BDM elements does not depend on the parameter γ.	background debug mode interface;discretization;finite element method;multigrid method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;penalty method;rate of convergence;solver	Zhiqiang Cai;Yanqiu Wang	2007	SIAM J.

The problem domain, which can be rectangular or non-rectangular, is represented by a Cartesian grid. On stencils, which are three nodal points for one-dimensional problems and nine nodal points for twodimensional problems, the approximations for the field variable and its derivatives are constructed using integrated radial basis functions (IRBFs). Several pieces of information about the governing differential equation on the stencil are incorporated into the IRBF approximations by means of the constants of integration. Numerical examples indicate that the proposed technique yields a very high rate of convergence with grid refinement.	approximation;discretization;problem domain;radial (radio);radial basis function;rate of convergence;refinement (computing);regular grid	Nam Mai-Duy;Thanh Tran-Cong	2011	J.

Within a narrow region of parameter space, fronts connecting the two stable states are pinned to the underlying lattice. Localized solutions are formed by matching two such stationary fronts back-to-back; depending on the orientation relative to the lattice, the solution branch may “snake” back and forth within the pinning region via successive saddle-node bifurcations. Standard continuum approximations in the weakly nonlinear limit (equivalently, the limit of small mesh size) do not exhibit this behavior, due to the resultant leading-order reaction-diffusion equation lacking a periodic spatial structure. By including exponentially small effects hidden beyond all algebraic orders in the asymptotic expansion, we find that exponentially small but exponentially growing terms are switched on via error function smoothing near Stokes lines. Eliminating these otherwise unbounded beyond-all-orders terms selects the origin (modulo the mesh size) of the front, and matching two fronts together yields a set of equations describing the snaking bifurcation diagram. This is possible only within an exponentially small region of parameter space—the pinning region. Moreover, by considering fronts orientated at an arbitrary angle ψ to the x-axis, we show that the width of the pinning region is nonzero only if tanψ is rational or infinite. The asymptotic results are compared with numerical calculations, with good agreement.	algebraic equation;apache axis;approximation;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;coefficient;dos;http public key pinning;imaginary time;in-phase and quadrature components;lattice constant;linear algebra;maxwell (microarchitecture);modulo operation;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;os-tan;optic axis of a crystal;quantum superposition;recurrence relation;resultant;smoothing;soliton;stationary process;stepping level;technological singularity;time complexity;transformation matrix;triune continuum paradigm;truncation;vanish (computer science);velocity (software development)	A.

We are able to convert the question of the existence and uniqueness of a particular solution to this nonlinear boundary value problem into a question of whether a certain polynomial has positive real roots. Furthermore, if such a polynomial has at least two distinct positive roots, then the nonlinear boundary value problem will have multiple solutions. In certain special cases, these boundary value problems arise in the self-similar solutions for the flow of certain fluids over stretching or shrinking sheets; examples given include the flow of first and second grade fluids over such surfaces.	nonlinear system	Robert A.

4edc65c84d903259885e7da288ae9fd52081d721	approximation of the biharmonic problem using p1 finite elements		We study in this paper a P1 finite element approximation of the solution in H 0 (Ω) of a biharmonic problem. Since the P1 finite element method only leads to an approximate solution in H 0 (Ω), a discrete Laplace operator is used in the numerical scheme. The convergence of the method is shown, for the general case of a solution with H 0 (Ω) regularity, thanks to compactness results and to the use of a particular interpolation of regular functions with compact supports. An error estimate is proved in the case where the solution is in C(Ω). The order of this error estimate is equal to 1 if the solution has a compact support, and only 1/5 otherwise. Numerical results show that these orders are not sharp in particular situations.	approximation algorithm;calculus of variations;discrete laplace operator;finite element method;interpolation;numerical analysis;numerical method;regular expression	Robert Eymard;Raphaèle Herbin;M.

fb1ac55fcf7d9082a04a398a748f41940a63b087	a second-order sharp numerical method for solving the linear elasticity equations on irregular domains and adaptive grids - application to shape optimization	hybrid finite volume finite difference;quadtree octree data structure;level set;irregular domains;octree data structure;linear elasticity;non graded adaptive grid;second order discretization	We present a numerical method for solving the equations of linear elasticity on irregular domains in two and three spatial dimensions. We combine a finite volume and a finite difference approaches to derive discretizations that produce second-order accurate solutions in the L^~-norm. Our discretization is 'sharp' in the sense that the physical boundary conditions (mixed Dirichlet/Neumann-type) are imposed at the interface and the solution is computed inside the irregular domain only, without the need of smearing the solution across the interface. The irregular domain is represented implicitly using a level-set function so that this approach is applicable to free moving boundary problems; we provide a simple example of shape optimization to illustrate this capability. In addition, we provide an extension of our method to the case of adaptive meshes in both two and three spatial dimensions: we use non-graded quadtree (2D) and octree (3D) data structures to represent the grid that is automatically refined near the irregular domain's boundary. This extension to quadtree/octree grids produces second-order accurate solutions albeit non-symmetric linear systems, due to the node-based sampling nature of the approach. However, the linear system can be solved with simple linear solvers; in this work we use the BICGSTAB algorithm.	elasticity (data store);mathematical optimization;numerical method;shape optimization	Maxime Theillard;Landry Fokoua Djodom;Jean-Léopold Vié;Frédéric Gibou	2013	J.

This new method differs from the Numerov method only in one simple coefficient, by which we can extend the interval of periodicity from 6 to infinit obtain an embedded correct factor to improve the accuracy. We compare the new method with the original Numero by the well-known problem of Woods–Saxon potential. The numerical results show that the new method has great adv accuracy over the original. Particularly for the resonant state, the accuracy is improved with four orders overall, and ev seven orders for the highest oscillatory solution. Surely, this method will replace the original Numerov method and be used in various area.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

5780619c38cbb0a14d5417a98a47636ec4c6fb2b	a dual iterative substructuring method with a penalty term in three dimensions	dual substructuring method;penalty term;feti dp;augmented lagrangian	The FETI-DP method is one of the most advanced dual substructuring methods, which introduces Lagrange multipliers to enforce the pointwise matching condition on the interface. In our previous work for two dimensional problems, a dual iterative substructuring method was proposed, which is a variant of the FETI-DP method based on the way to deal with the continuity constraint on the interface. The proposed method imposes the continuity not only by the pointwise matching condition on the interface but also by using a penalty term which measures the jump across the interface. In this paper, a dual substructuring method with a penalty term is extended to three dimensional problems. A penalty term with a penalization parameter @h is constructed by focusing on the geometric complexity of an interface in three dimensions caused by the coupling among adjacent subdomains. For a large @h, it is shown that the condition number of the resultant dual problem is bounded by a constant independent of both subdomain size H and mesh size h. From the implementational viewpoint of the proposed method, the difference from the FETI-DP method is to solve subdomain problems which contain a penalty term with a penalization parameter @h. To prevent a large penalization parameter from making subdomain problems ill-conditioned, special attention is paid to establish an optimal preconditioner with respect to a penalization parameter @h. Finally, numerical results are presented.	domain decomposition methods;iterative method	Chang-Ock Lee;Eun-Hee Park	2012	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2012.04.011	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;augmented lagrangian method;calculus;mathematics	Metrics	89.63181734080261	12.97404127273879	139623

Relative to classical Runge–Kutta methods, methods with an effective order of accuracy are designed to satisfy a relaxed set of order conditions but yield higher order accuracy when composed with special starting and stopping methods. We show that this allows the construction of four-stage SSP methods with effective order four (such methods cannot have classical order four). However, we also prove that effective order five methods—like classical order five methods— require the use of nonpositive weights and so cannot be SSP. By numerical optimization, we construct explicit SSP Runge–Kutta methods up to effective order four and establish the optimality of many of them. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of these methods in practice.	coefficient;experiment;general linear methods;linear algebra;linear multistep method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;numerical analysis;order of accuracy;rosenbrock methods;runge–kutta methods;strong duality	Yiannis Hadjimichael;Colin B.

5b24f3f8a25d26b3a52b29e8c79281138bf94ff2	numerical method for solving the time-fractional dual-phase-lagging heat conduction equation with the temperature-jump boundary condition		This article proposes a new nanoscale heat transfer model based on the Caputo type fractional dual-phase-lagging (DPL) heat conduction equation with the temperature-jump boundary condition. The model is proved to be well-posed. A finite difference scheme based on the L1 approximation for the Caputo derivative is then presented for solving the fractional DPL model. Unconditional stability and convergence of the scheme are proved by using the discrete energy method. Three numerical examples are given to verify the accuracy of the scheme. Results show the convergence order to be (O(tau ^{2-alpha }+h^2)) , which coincides with the theoretical analysis. A simple nanoscale semiconductor silicon device is illustrated to show the applicability of the model. It is seen from the numerical result that when (alpha =1), the fractional DPL reduces to the conventional DPL and the obtained peak temperature is almost identical to those obtained in the literature. However, when (alpha u003c1), the model predicts a higher peak temperature level than that when (alpha =1). In particular, when (alpha = 0.7) and 0.9, an oscillatory temperature at the beginning is observed. This indicates that the fractional DPL model can be an excellent candidate for analyzing the temperature instability appearing in electronic nano-semiconductor devices.	numerical linear algebra;numerical method	Cui-Cui Ji;Weizhong Dai;Zhi-Zhong Sun	2018	J.

This property, also called the positive transmissibility (PT) condition, is a prerequisite for the existence of an M -matrix and ensures that nonphysical local extrema are not present in the solution. For tetrahedral elements, it has already been shown that the linear Galerkin approach does not in general satisfy the PT condition. We propose a modification of the three-dimensional Galerkin scheme that, if a Delaunay triangulation is used, satisfies the PT condition for internal edges and, if further conditions on the boundary are specified, yields an M -matrix. The proposed approach can also be extended to the general diffusion operator with nonconstant or anisotropic coefficients.		Mario Putti;Christian Cordes	1998	SIAM J.

To solve it numerically, an upwind finite difference scheme is applied. The mesh used has a fixed number (N+1) of nodes and is initially uniform, but its nodes are moved adaptively using a simple algorithm of de Boor based on equidistribution of the arc-length of the current computed piecewise linear solution. It is proved for the first time that a mesh exists that equidistributes the arclength along the polygonal solution curve and that the corresponding computed solution is first-order accurate, uniformly in ε, where ε is the diffusion coefficient. In the case when the boundary value problem is linear, if N is sufficiently large independently of ε, it is shown that after O(ln(1/ε)/lnN) iterations of the algorithm, the piecewise linear interpolant of the computed solution achieves firstorder accuracy in the L∞[0, 1] norm uniformly in ε. Numerical experiments are presented that support our theoretical results.	coefficient;de boor's algorithm;equidistributed sequence;experiment;finite difference method;first-order reduction;interpolation;iteration;numerical analysis;numerical method;order of accuracy;piecewise linear continuation	Natalia Kopteva;Martin Stynes	2001	SIAM J.

In the case of overcompressive shock waves, these orbits occur in multi-parameter families. We propose a numerical method to compute families of heteroclinic orbits in general systems of ODE. The key point is a special parameterization of the heteroclinic manifold which can be understood as a generalized phase condition; in the case of shock profiles, this phase condition has a natural interpretation regarding their stability. We prove that our method converges and present numerical results for several systems of conservation laws. These examples include traveling waves for the Navier-Stokes equations for compressible viscous, heat-conductive fluids and for the magnetohydrodynamics equations for viscous, heat-conductive, electrically resistive fluids that correspond to shock wave solutions of the associated ideal models, i.e., the Euler, resp.

Such method provides automatically—this is the key point—the best polynomial interpolation of the basic state the stability of which is studied. It turns out that the whole procedure is needed to obtain reliable results. The method is first validated against results available in the literature (both viscous incompressible and inviscid compressible Rayleigh–Taylor configurations). The efficiency of the numerical method is illustrated with results on the linear stability of the compressible viscous diffusive Rayleigh–Taylor flow where no analytical or numerical results are available.

09e3b78f50ff890c5607ea24615ff1dca4e71837	numerical approaches for linear left-invariant diffusions on se(2), their comparison to exact solutions, and their applications in retinal imaging		Left-invariant PDE-evolutions on the roto-translation group SE(2) (and their resolvent equations) have been widely studied in the fields of cortical modeling and image analysis. They include hypo-elliptic diffusion (for contour enhancement) proposed by Citti & Sarti, and Petitot, and they include the direction process (for contour completion) proposed by Mumford. This paper presents a thorough study and comparison of the many numerical approaches, which, remarkably, is missing in the literature. Existing numerical approaches can be classified into 3 categories: Finite difference methods, Fourier based methods (equivalent to SE(2)-Fourier methods), and stochastic methods (Monte Carlo simulations). There are also 3 types of exact solutions to the PDEevolutions that were derived explicitly (in the spatial Fourier domain) in previous works by Duits and van Almsick in 2005. Here we provide an overview of these 3 types of exact solutions and explain how they relate to each of the 3 numerical approaches. We compute relative errors of all numerical approaches to the exact solutions, and the Fourier based methods show us the best performance with smallest relative errors. We also provide an improvement of Mathematica algorithms for evaluating Mathieu-functions, crucial in implementations of the exact solutions. Furthermore, we include an asymptotical analysis of the singularities within the kernels and we propose a probabilistic extension of underlying stochastic processes that overcomes the singular behavior in the origin of time-integrated kernels. Finally, we show retinal imaging applications of combining left-invariant PDE-evolutions with invertible orientation scores.	algorithm;asymptote;finite difference;image analysis;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical method;resolution (logic);simulation;station hypo;stochastic process;wolfram mathematica	Jiong Zhang;Remco Duits;Bart M. ter Haar Romeny	2014	CoRR	10.4208/nmtma.2015.m1411	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;algorithm;statistics;algebra	HPC	93.01846531273164	14.73622642607061	140970

The method consists in approximating the domains by polygonal domains, transferring the boundary data in a natural way, and then applying a finite element method to the perturbed problem on the approximate polygonal domains. It is shown that the error in the finite element approximation is of optimal order for linear elements on a quasiuniform triangulation. As such the method is robust in the regularity of the data in the original problem.	finite element method	James H. Bramble;J. Thomas King	1996	Adv. Comput.

246dc9f5b19bdc10f0265a8766f035c88ec0629d	steady-state, nonlinear analysis of large arrays of electrically actuated micromembranes vibrating in a fluid		This paper describes a robust and efficient method to obtain the steady-state, nonlinear behaviour of large arrays of electrically actuated micromembranes vibrating in a fluid. The nonlinear electromechanical behaviour and the multiple vibration harmonics it creates are fully taken into account thanks to a multiharmonic finite element formulation, generated automatically using symbolic calculation. A domain decomposition method allows to consider large arrays of micromembranes by efficiently distributing the computational cost on parallel computers. Two- and three-dimensional examples highlight the main properties of the proposed method.	3d modeling;algorithmic efficiency;bibliothèque des ecoles françaises d'athènes et de rome;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;computer;consortium;domain decomposition methods;finite element method;linear algebra;microtransaction;nonlinear system;parallel computing;pin grid array;polygonal modeling;speedup;steady state;supercomputer;symbolic computation;transducer	Alexandre Halbach;Christophe Geuzaine	2017	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-017-0560-8	mathematics;steady state;mathematical optimization;domain decomposition methods;nonlinear system;acoustics;finite element method;harmonics;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;vibration;multiphysics	HPC	86.93868646107981	9.5471496346328	141186

Given a diffusion process Xt and a probability distribution q on [0,∞), does there exist a boundary b(t) such that q(t) = P[τ ≤ t], where τ is the first hitting time of Xt to the time dependent level b(t). A free boundary problem for a parabolic partial differential operator is associated with the inverse first passage time problem. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a viscosity solution to this equation. We also investigate the small time behavior of the boundary b(t), presenting both upper and lower bounds.

Fourier stability analysis of the linearized scheme shows that it is a marginally stable. Also, the local truncation error of the method is investigated. Three invariants of motion are evaluated to determine the conservation properties of the problem, and the numerical scheme leads to accurate and efficient results. Moreover, interaction of two and three solitary waves is shown. The development of the Maxwellian initial condition into solitary waves is also shown and we show that the number of solitons which are generated from the Maxwellian initial condition can be determined. Numerical results show also that a tail of small amplitude appears after the interactions. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Are these true mathematical solutions or just numerical artifacts? To answer the question, this article investigates all traveling wave solutions in the parameter space for three typical nonlinear wave equations from a theoretical viewpoint of dynamical systems. Dynamical analysis shows that all these loopand inverted-loop-solutions are merely visual illusion of numerical artifacts. To reveal the nature of such special phenomena, this article also offers the mathematical parametric representations of these traveling wave solutions precisely in analytic forms.	dynamical system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;ringing artifacts;soliton	Jibin Li;Yi Zhang;Guanrong Chen	2009	I.

In this context, an isogeometric function is a function defined on a B-spline domain, whose graph surface also has a B-spline representation. We consider constructions along one interface between two patches. We restrict ourselves to a special case of planar B-spline patches of bidegree (p,p)(p,p) with p≥3p≥3, so-called analysis-suitable G1G1 geometries, which are derived from a specific geometric continuity condition. This class of two-patch geometries is exactly the one which allows, under certain additional assumptions, C1C1 isogeometric spaces with optimal approximation properties (cf. Collin et al., 2016).#R##N##R##N#Such spaces are of interest when solving numerically fourth-order PDE problems, such as the biharmonic equation, using the isogeometric method. In particular, we analyze the dimension of the C1C1-smooth isogeometric space and present an explicit representation for a basis of this space. Both the dimension of the space and the basis functions along the common interface depend on the considered two-patch parameterization. Such an explicit, geometry dependent basis construction is important for an efficient implementation of the isogeometric method. The stability of the constructed basis is numerically confirmed for an example configuration.

The method uses a step-doubling extrapolation scheme in time based on backward Euler and a Galerkin approximation in space. The technique is shown to be a second-order correct approximation in time. Since step-doubling can be used as a mechanism for step-size control, the analysis is done for variable time steps. The stability properties of step-doubling are contrasted with those of Crank-Nicolson, as well as those of more general extrapolated theta-weighted schemes. We provide an example computation that illustrates both the use of step-doubling for adaptive time step control and the application of step-doubling to a nonlinear system.	algorithm;approximation;computation;crank (person);crank–nicolson method;discretization;euler;extrapolation;finite difference;galerkin method;linear function;lumpers and splitters;nonlinear system;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;numerical partial differential equations;parabolic antenna;period-doubling bifurcation;piecewise linear continuation;stepping level	Bruce P.

The presence of holes in the material can be approximated using a weak material; that is, the relative density of material ρ is set to 0 < = ρ 1 in the hole region. The weak material approach is a standard technique in the so-called material distribution approach to topology optimization, in which the inhomogeneous relative density of material is designated as the design variable in order to optimize the spatial distribution of material. The use of a weak material ensures that the elasticity problem is uniquely solvable for each admissible value ρ ∈ [ , 1] of the design variable. A finiteelement approximation of the boundary-value problem in which the weak material approximation is used in the hole regions can be viewed as a nonconforming but convergent approximation of a version of the original problem in which the solution is continuously and elastically extended into the holes. The error in this approximation can be bounded by two terms that depend on . One term scales linearly with with a constant that is independent of the mesh size parameter h but that depends on the surface traction required to fit elastic material in the deformed holes. The other term scales like 1/2 times the finite-element approximation error inside the hole. The condition number of the weak material stiffness matrix scales like −1, but the use of a suitable left preconditioner yields a matrix with a condition number that is bounded independently of . Moreover, the preconditioned matrix admits the limit value → 0, and the solution of corresponding system of equations yields in the limit a finite-element approximation of the continuously and elastically extended problem.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;condition number;decision problem;elasticity (data store);mathematical optimization;preconditioner;stiffness matrix;topology optimization;traction teampage	Martin Berggren;Fotios Kasolis	2012	SIAM J.

These representations can be employed to design novel h , p , and h p energy-norm and goal-oriented adaptive algorithms. Numerical results in 1D show that, for wave propagation problems, the advantages of this new representation are notorious when selecting the Laplace equation as the dual problem. Specifically, the computed upper bounds of the new error representation are sharper than the classical ones used in both energy-norm and goal-oriented adaptive methods, especially when the dispersion (pollution) error is significant.

For unsteady flows however, they require a costly algebra to extract the time-derivative occurring at several places in the scheme. A new high-order time formulation has been recently proposed 13 for simplifying the RBC schemes and increasing their temporal accuracy. The present paper goes much further in this direction and deeply reconsiders the method. An avatar of the RBC schemes is presented that greatly reduces the computing time and the memory requirements while keeping the same type of successful numerical dissipation. Two and three-dimensional linear stability are analyzed and the method is extended to the 3-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The new compact scheme is validated for several unsteady problems in two and three dimension. In particular, an accurate DNS at moderate cost is presented for the evolution of the Taylor-Green Vortex at Reynolds 1600 and Prandtl 0.71. The effects of the mesh size and of the accuracy order in the approximation of Euler and viscous terms are discussed.	euler;navier–stokes equations	Alain Lerat	2016	J. Comput.

908ca4dc2c840cbfcecddd7b245543c8bd9c8a9e	ihdg: an iterative hdg framework for partial differential equations		We present a scalable iterative solver for high-order hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretizations of linear partial differential equations. It is an interplay between domain decomposition methods and HDG discretizations, and hence inheriting advances from both sides. In particular, the method can be viewed as a Gauss-Seidel approach that requires only independent element-by-element and face-by-face local solves in each iteration. As such, it is well-suited for current and future computing systems with massive concurrencies. Unlike conventional Gauss-Seidel schemes which are purely algebraic, the convergence of iHDG, thanks to the built-in HDG numerical flux, does not depend on the ordering of unknowns. We rigorously show the convergence of the proposed method for the transport equation, the linearized shallow water equation and the convectiondiffusion equation. For the transport equation, the method is convergent regardless of mesh size h and solution order p, and furthermore the convergence rate is independent of the solution order. For the linearized shallow water and the convection-diffusion equations we show that the convergence is conditional on both h and p. Extensive steady and time-dependent numerical results for the 2D and 3D transport equations, the linearized shallow water equation, and the convection-diffusion equation are presented to verify the theoretical findings.	algorithm;bellman equation;canonical account;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;domain decomposition methods;finite element method;galerkin method;gauss–seidel method;iteration;iterative method;multigrid method;numerical analysis;preconditioner;rate of convergence;scalability;solver	Sriramkrishnan Muralikrishnan;Minh-Binh Tran;Tan Bui-Thanh	2017	SIAM J.

One considers $${\eta:=\Vert\phi_{h/2}-\phi_h\Vert}$$ to estimate the error $${\Vert\phi-\phi_h\Vert}$$ , where $${\phi_h}$$ is a Galerkin solution with respect to a mesh $${\mathcal{T}_h}$$ and $${\phi_{h/2}}$$ is a Galerkin solution with respect to the mesh $${\mathcal{T}_{h/2}}$$ obtained from a uniform refinement of $${\mathcal{T}_h}$$ . This error estimator is always efficient and observed to be also reliable in practice. However, for boundary element methods, the energy norm is non-local and thus the error estimator η does not provide information for a local mesh-refinement. We consider Symm’s integral equation of the first kind, where the energy space is the negative-order Sobolev space $${\widetilde{H}^{-1/2^{\vphantom{H}}}(\Gamma)}$$ . Recent localization techniques allow to replace the energy norm in this case by some weighted L 2-norm. Then, this very basic error estimation strategy is also applicable to steer an h-adaptive algorithm. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D show that the proposed method works well in practice. A short conclusion is concerned with other integral equations, e.g., the hypersingular case with energy space $${\widetilde{H}^{1/2}(\Gamma)}$$ and $${H^{1/2}_0(\Gamma)}$$ , respectively, or a transmission problem.	2d computer graphics;adaptive algorithm;adaptive mesh refinement;aharonov–bohm effect;boundary element method;energy minimization;error detection and correction;experiment;finite element method;galerkin method;interpolation;navier–stokes equations;nestedness;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical method;overhead (computing);refinement (computing);social inequality;surround sound;video projector;whole earth 'lectronic link	Samuel Ferraz-Leite;Dirk Praetorius	2008	Computing	10.1007/s00607-008-0017-4	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;boundary element method;calculus;galerkin method;mathematics;energy minimization;integral equation	Robotics	89.2786543280017	14.024661767864636	143241

Many of the aspects of hyperbolic conservation laws have direct consequences in the kinematics of these materials, thus providing an illustrative guide to the theory.

New methods for the estimates of first order space derivatives of the solution are also derived. These methods are fourth order accurate in space and second order accurate in time, and involve only nine spatial grid points of a single compact cell. We further develop the alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme for a general linear parabolic equation which is shown to be unconditionally stable for the heat equation in polar coordinates. The proposed methods are directly applicable to singular problems without the need of any special technique, which is the main advantage of this work. The method is effectively applied to the time dependent Navier–Stokes’ model equations in polar coordinates.

This article is the first comprehensive review of the 50-year long history of the mimetic methodology and describes in a systematic way the major mimetic ideas and their relevance to academic and real-life problems. The supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes. Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point systems.	finite difference method	Konstantin Lipnikov;Gianmarco Manzini;Mikhail J.

Error vector analysis was carried out on a generalized discrete interval for each of the first and second order vector numerical integration methods (Known in literature [9]) and also for the proposed third and fourth order vector numerical integration methods. The results from error vector analysis suggested that accuracy increases in the order; first, second, third and fourth order vector numerical integration methods. The suggestion was verified with both numerical rate of convergence and stability analysis of both 1 degree of freedom (1DOF) and 2 degree of freedom (2DOF) milling processes. The advantage of the proposed high-order vector numerical integration methods in terms of accuracy and their disadvantage in terms of computational time relative to recent methods are highlighted.

The scope is general and treats the case of rough coefficients, i.e. coefficients with values in L∞(Ω). This class of coefficients includes as examples media with micro-structure as well as media with multiple non-separated length scales. The approach taken here is based on the the generalized finite element method (GFEM) introduced in [6], and elaborated in [4], [5] and [26]. The GFEM is constructed by partitioning the computational domain Ω into to a collection of preselected subsets ωi, i = 1, 2, ..m and constructing finite dimensional approximation spaces Ψi over each subset using local information. The notion of the Kolmogorov n-width is used to identify the optimal local approximation spaces. These spaces deliver local approximations with errors that decay almost exponentially with the degrees of freedom Ni in the energy norm over ωi. The local spaces Ψi are used within the GFEM scheme to produce a finite dimensional subspace S N of H(Ω) which is then employed in the Galerkin method. It is shown that the error in the Galerkin approximation decays in the energy norm almost exponentially ( i.e., super-algebraicly) with respect to the degrees of freedom N . When length scales “separate” and the microstructure is sufficiently fine with respect to the length scale of the domain ωi it is shown that homogenization theory can be used to construct local approximation spaces with exponentially decreasing error in the pre-asymtotic regime.

The flow is supposed to be uniform in the exterior domain far from the object, and potential in the interior domain close to the object. Our key idea is the reformulation of the original problem using the Prandtl-Glauert transformation on the whole flow domain, yielding (i) the classical Helmholtz equation in the exterior domain and (ii) an anisotropic diffusive PDE with skew-symmetric first-order perturbation in the interior domain such that its transmission condition at the coupling boundary naturally fits the Neumann condition from the classical Helmholtz equation. Then, efficient off-the-shelf tools can be used to perform the BEM-FEM coupling, leading to two novel variational formulations for the convected Helmholtz equation. The first formulation involves one surface unknown and can be affected by resonant frequencies, while the second formulation avoids resonant frequencies and involves two surface unknowns. Numerical simulations are presented to compare the two formulations.	boundary element method;finite element method	Fabien Casenave;Alexandre Ern;Guillaume Sylvand	2014	J. Comput.

Using asymptotics, we show that when the frequency parameter converges to the bifurcation gap edge, the size of the allowed jump in $\Gamma$ converges to 0 for SGSs centered at any $x_c\in\mathbb{R}$. Linear stability of SGSs is next determined via the numerical Evans function method, in which the stable and unstable manifolds corresponding to the 0 solution of the linearized spectral ODE problem are evolved up to a common location where the determinant of their bases, i.e., the Evans function, is evaluated.

The methods are applied to a one-dimensional model problem and an alternative and superior method is presented. This is generalised to higher spatial dimensions by reformulating it as a finite-volume or finite-element method on a moving triangulation. It is shown that when solving the heat equation on triangular meshes with Dirichlet data, it is important to use a certain type of triangulation for the methods to possess maximum principles. This triangulation (known as the locally Delaunay triangulation) is shown to be unique. Moreover, it possesses a """"minimum-energy"""" property: hence it may be generated from an arbitrary given triangulation by a sequential process of mesh reconnection. This is important for the convection-diffusion algorithm, as using the transported triangulation from the last time level as an initial guess results in a very efficient mesh generation procedure.

The scheme is designed for general interface problems in which the coefficients, the source term, the solution, and its normal flux may be discontinuous across the interface. The originality of the scheme lies in the use of additional values at interfacial points (points at which grid lines intersect the interface) as nodes in the stencil, which allows straightforward use of the standard finite difference approximations. Appropriate interpolation techniques are used on both sides of the interface to determine the interfacial values. Numerical tests are carried out to validate the scheme for solving elliptic equations in both two and three dimensions, which show that the proposed scheme has overall second-order accuracy. The scheme thus developed is also applied to solve incompressible, two-dimensional Stokes flows. In this process, we compar...	finite difference	H. V. R. Mittal;Rajendra K. Ray	2018	SIAM J.

In the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. 0 < ε 1, the solution exhibits highly oscillatory propagating waves with wavelength O(ε2) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. Due to the rapid temporal oscillation, it is quite challenging in designing and analyzing numerical methods with uniform error bounds in ε ∈ (0, 1]. We present the MTIFP method based on properly adopting a multiscale decomposition of the solution of the Dirac equation and applying the exponential wave integrator with appropriate numerical quadratures. By a careful study of the error propagation and using the energy method, we establish two independent error estimates via two different mathematical approaches as hm0 + τ 2 ε2 and hm0 + τ2 + ε2, where h is the mesh size, τ is the time step and m0 depends on the regularity of the solution. These two error bounds immediately imply that the MTI-FP method converges uniformly and optimally in space with exponential convergence rate if the solution is smooth, and uniformly in time with linear convergence rate at O(τ) for all ε ∈ (0, 1] and optimally with quadratic convergence rate at O(τ2) in the regimes when either ε = O(1) or 0 < ε . τ . Numerical results are reported to demonstrate that our error estimates are optimal and sharp. Finally, the MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically the convergence rates of the solution of the Dirac equation to those of its limiting models when ε→ 0+.

We also compare the efficiency of the spectral collocation and finite difference methods, and give numerical results that show spectral methods to be competitive for problems with smooth terminal conditions.	algorithm;collocation;computation;crank (person);crank–nicolson method;discretization;finite difference method;numerical analysis;spectral method;stepping level	Robert Piché;Juho Kanniainen	2007			mathematical optimization;computer science;calculus;mathematics;mathematical economics;differential equation	HPC	85.30010163662601	15.385233530804506	144590

The main idea is that we apply the adaptive local iterative filtering (ALIF) algorithm, an EMD-like nonlinear signal analysis strategy which decomposes a signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), to extract essential information, and then use it in the HMM framework to compute the coarse scale behavior without fully resolving the fine scale solutions. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the new method has a number of advantages over the existing ones: (1) The effective rate of change for the slow dynamics is calculated as the result of the local solution decomposition by ALIF, and an effective ordinary differential equation is obtained on the fly by analyzing the trend of the dynamics. (2) ALIF can find hidden intermediate time scales, with possible noninteger exponents, and the method can treat multiple (> 2) time scale systems hierarchically. (3) The time-frequency analysis in ALIF allows us to identify some frequency related slow variables, such as the relative phase. This is especially useful for the systems where the slow variables are not explicitly known.	algorithm;authorization;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;computation;dual ec drbg;dynamical system;error analysis (mathematics);exponential hierarchy;frequency analysis;hidden markov model;hilbert–huang transform;iterative method;left 4 dead 2;nl (complexity);nonlinear system;numerical aperture;numerical method;on the fly;signal processing;time–frequency analysis;ut-vpn	Seong Jun Kim;Haomin Zhou	2016	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/15M1023038	mathematical optimization;simulation;time–frequency analysis;theoretical computer science;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	91.99780889378899	14.612754290776028	144620

It consists in reconstructing the initial pressure from the boundary measurements of the acoustic wave. Our goal is to extend versatile time reversal techniques to the case when the boundary of the domain is perfectly reflecting, effectively turning the domain into a reverberant cavity. Standard time reversal works only if the solution of the direct problem decays in time, which does not happen in the setup we consider. We thus propose a novel time reversal technique with a nonstandard boundary condition. The error induced by this time reversal technique satisfies the wave equation with a dissipative boundary condition and, therefore, decays in time. For larger measurement times, this method yields a close approximation; for smaller times, the first approximation can be iteratively refined, resulting in a convergent Neumann series for the approximation.

4ba64083ea8583a5b72a47bc40aef72ebc7ec853	numerical analysis and simulation of a bio-thermal model for the human foot		This paper analyses the numerical convergence and the approximation of the finite element method applied to a biothermal nonlinear model for the bare foot. As far as we know, there is not a previous finite element analysis of this well-known bioheat equation. Thus, this work can be seen as a first step to study the coupling with energy and mass transfer models (water, vapor and gas) at the textiles surrounding the foot. The model is posed as a steady partial differential equation for the temperature field, and a non-linear boundary condition on the external boundary, where heat losses due to convection, radiation and evaporation are considered. The existence and the uniqueness of the solution is proved for the weak formulation and also for its finite element approximation by using arguments of monotone operators. Then, numerical convergence and an a priori error estimates result are obtained. Some numerical simulations are presented to show the accuracy of the numerical method and the behavior of the solution, being qualitatively acceptable and, in some cases, validated against experimentation, being quantitatively correct too. Interesting conclusions are followed from the analysis of the model parameters as well as from the comparison of 2D and 3D solutions.	british informatics olympiad;numerical analysis;simulation	M. I.

Regarding the frequency of particle motion to be a function of the wave steepness and using a successive Taylor series expansion to the path and the period of particle motion, the explicit parametric equation of water particles and the Lagrangian wave frequency up to third-order could be obtained. In particular, the Lagrangian mean level which differs from that in the Eulerian approach is also found as a part of the solutions. The variations in the wave profile and the water particle orbits for the nonlinear standing waves are also investigated. Comparison on the thirdorder wave profiles given by the Eulerian and Lagrangian solution with the experiments reveals that the latter is more accurate than the former in describing the shape of the wave profile. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Integration is often accomplished through the application of ordinary differential equation (ODE) integrators-integrators whose error characteristics are predicated on the smoothness of the field through which the streamline is being integrated, which is not available at the interelement level of finite volume and finite element data. Adaptive error control techniques are often used to ameliorate the challenge posed by interelement discontinuities. As the root of the difficulties is the discontinuous nature of the data, we present a complementary approach of applying smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving filters to the data prior to streamline integration. We investigate whether such an approach applied to uniform quadrilateral discontinuous Galerkin (high-order finite volume) data can be used to augment current adaptive error control approaches. We discuss and demonstrate through a numerical example the computational trade-offs exhibited when one applies such a strategy.	acclimatization;adaptive quadrature;adobe streamline;algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational fluid dynamics;dna integration;differential diagnosis;discretization;error detection and correction;error-tolerant design;feature extraction;finite element method;finite volume method;galerkin method;gradient;hearing loss, high-frequency;imagery;isosurface;mathematics;mechanics;numerical analysis;preprocessor;refinement (computing);simulation;verification of theories;curl;fluid flow	Michael Steffen;Sean Curtis;Robert Michael Kirby;Jennifer K.

30890bfc754f94914ba29ac256c370a80a542650	a numerical methodology for enforcing maximum principles and the non-negative constraint for transient diffusion equations		Transient diffusion equations arise in many branches of engineering and applied sciences (e.g., heat transfer and mass transfer), and are parabolic partial differential equations. It is well-known that, under certain assumptions on the input data, these equations satisfy important mathematical properties like maximum principles and the non-negative constraint, which have implications in mathematical modeling. However, existing numerical formulations for these types of equations do not, in general, satisfy maximum principles and the non-negative constraint. In this paper, we present a methodology for enforcing maximum principles and the non-negative constraint for transient anisotropic diffusion equation. The method of horizontal lines (also known as the Rothe method) is applied in which the time is discretized first. This results in solving steady anisotropic diffusion equation with decay equation at every discrete time level. The proposed methodology can handle general computational grids with no additional restrictions on the time step. We illustrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed formulation using representative numerical examples. We also perform numerical convergence of the proposed methodology. For comparison, we also present the results from the standard single-field semi-discrete formulation and the results from a popular software package, which all will violate maximum principles and the non-negative constraint.	anisotropic diffusion;discretization;mathematical model;numerical analysis;numerical method;parabolic antenna;semiconductor industry	K.

A popular mixed multiscale finite element has basis functions which can be defined only over pairs of elements, so we call it a “dual-support” element. We show by example that it can fail to reproduce constant flow fields, and so fails to converge in any meaningful way. The problem arises when the coefficient is an anisotropic tensor. A new approach to multiscale finite elements based on the microscale structure theory of homogenization is presented to avoid the problems with anisotropy. Five numerical test cases are presented to evaluate and contrast the methods. The first involves anisotropy, and the second is similar in that, although it has an isotropic coefficient, its heterogeneity leads to an anisotropic homogenized coefficient. As expected, the popular method has difficulty—while the new method shows no difficulty —with either anisotropy or macroscale implied anisotropy. The final three tests involve heterogeneous and channelized cases, and features of the new method are shown to be important for good approximation. Finally, for a two-scale coefficient, a proof of convergence is presented for standard mixed multiscale finite elements that reduces to four simple steps. From its simplicity, one can easily see that the popular elements fail only the step related to the counterexample, and we conjecture, but do not prove, that the new homogenization-based elements converge.	anisotropic diffusion;approximation;basis function;channelization (telecommunications);coefficient;converge;finite element method;heterogeneous computing;numerical method;test case	Todd Arbogast	2011	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/100788677	mathematical optimization;convergence;calculus;mathematics;geometry;mixed finite element method;ellipse	Graphics	92.08694802896657	11.237126926224303	145269

A modified Levenberg–Marquardt minimization algorithm provides for a robust and efficient calibration of complex models. The optimization framework is based on the parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis tool iTOUGH2, which we have parallelized using the Message Passing Interface in order to address the main computational burden of assessing parameter sensitivities. An underlying layer of hydrological and geophysical forward simulation operators use domain decomposition and parallel iterative Krylov solver techniques. The geophysical forward simulation operators originate from parallel algorithms for electrical and electromagnetic data types that have proven successful in solving largescale imaging problems arising in geothermal as well as oil and gas exploration applications. We have pursued a consequent merge of the hydrological optimization framework with the geophysical component in order to maximize the efficiencies of the Message Passing Interface. The method offers new possibilities by combining hydrological data with geophysical measurements that involve, for example, time-harmonic electromagnetic fields. We first show improved model resolution capabilities on a synthetic joint inversion example where controlled-source electromagnetic observations are combined with hydrological data simulated from a conservative tracer injection experiment. Next, the method is applied to a 3-D joint inversion of field data from a CO2 injection experiment, where the required multiphase, multi-component flow and transport simulations are highly computationally demanding. Overall improved data fits are achieved for both CO2 gas mole fractions and observed relative changes in electrical conductivity derived from geophysical measurements. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, a flexible local grid refinement technique is employed to achieve high resolution near the immersed body and in other high-flow-gradient regions at a fraction of the cost required by a uniformly fine grid. The method is validated versus well documented steady and unsteady test problems, for a wide range of both Reynolds and Mach numbers. Finally, and most importantly, for the case of the laminar compressible steady flow past an NACA-0012 airfoil, a thorough mesh-refinement study shows that the method is second-order accurate. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

An important property of SGWs is that they can be custom designed by selecting appropriate lifting coefficients depending on the application. As a typical problem of SGW algorithm, the calculation of the connection coefficients is described, based on the equivalent filters of SGWs. The formulation of SGW-based finite element equations is derived and a multiscale lifting algorithm for the SGW-based finite elementmethod is developed. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method is an accurate and effective tool for the solution of PDEs, especially ones with singularities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2d656f5b3a92305d5c7860f2646503718acd0b32	numerical solution of lyapunov equations related to markov jump linear systems		We suggest and compare different methods for the numerical solution of Lyapunov like equations with application to control of Markovian jump linear systems. First, we consider fixed point iterations and associated Krylov subspace formulations. Second, we reformulate the equation as an optimization problem and consider steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and a trust-region method. Numerical experiments illustrate that for large-scale problems the trust-region method is more effective than the steepest descent and the conjugate gradient methods. The fixedpoint approach, however, is superior to the optimization methods. As an application we consider a networked control system, where the Markov jumps are induced by the wireless communication protocol.		Tobias Damm;Kazuhiro Sato;Axel Vierling	2018	Numerical Lin.

This work is motivated by the """"stable fluids"""" method, developed by Stam [1999], to handle gaseous fluids. We extend this technique to water, which calls for the development of methods for modeling multiphase fluids and suppressing dissipation. We construct a multiphase fluid formulation by combining the Navier--Stokes equations with the level set method. By adopting constrained interpolation profile (CIP)-based advection, we reduce the numerical dissipation and diffusion significantly. We further reduce the dissipation by converting potentially dissipative cells into droplets or bubbles that undergo Lagrangian motion. Due to the multiphase formulation, the proposed method properly simulates the interaction of water with surrounding air, instead of simulating water in a void space. Moreover, the introduction of the nondissipative technique means that, in contrast to previous methods, the simulated water does not unnecessarily lose mass, and its motion is not damped to an unphysical extent. Experiments showed that the proposed method is stable and runs fast. It is demonstrated that two-dimensional simulation runs in real-time."""	computational fluid dynamics;contour advection;experiment;interpolation;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;real-time clock;simulation	Oh-Young Song;Hyuncheol Shin;Hyeong-Seok Ko	2005	ACM Trans.

In particular, we consider the magnetic ray transform of the combinations of tensors of different orders due to the nature of magnetic flows. We show that such magnetic ray transforms can be stably inverted, up to natural obstructions, near a strictly convex (with respect to magnetic geodesics) boundary point. Moreover, a global invertibility result follows on a compact Riemannian manifold with strictly convex boundary assuming that some global foliation condition is satisfied.		Hanming Zhou	2018	SIAM J.

In fact treating singularity and near singularity of the boundary integrals using complex space C is the main aim of this paper. The integrals are computed for linear, quadratic, cubic and other higher order elements when the geometry of the boundary elements is curved. The main advantages of the new algorithm are its applicability, simplicity and high accuracy which enable the conventional higher order BEM to solve Poisson’s problems, accurately. The potentials at the interior points very close to boundary can be evaluated by the scheme developed in this report. Some test problems are given and numerical simulations are presented. Numerical results demonstrate that the new algorithm proposed in the current paper can effectively handle singular and near singular boundary integrals of BEM, specially for solving partial differential equations which arise in thin body problems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The quantum wave function can sometimes tunnel through significant obstacles. However it can also sometimes get stuck in local minima, even for fairly simple problems. An initial Hamiltonian which insufficiently mixes computational basis states is analogous to a poorly mixing Markov transition rule. We study a physical system -- the Ising quantum chain with alternating sector interaction defects, but constant transverse field -- which is equivalent to applying the quantum adiabatic algorithm to a particular SAT problem. We prove that for a constant range of values for the transverse field, the spectral gap is exponentially small in the sector length. Indeed, we prove that there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close to the ground state energy. Applying the adiabatic theorem therefore takes exponential time, even for this simple problem.	adiabatic quantum computation;algorithm;exptime;ground state;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);interpolation;ising model;markov chain;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;quantum mechanics;selection rule;time complexity;transverse wave	Ben Reichardt	2004		10.1145/1007352.1007428	adiabatic invariant;quantum annealing;quantum operation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;amplitude damping channel;quantum discord;quantum capacity;maxima and minima;principal quantum number;mathematics;quantum dissipation;ground state;quantum process;quantum algorithm;quantum phase estimation algorithm;adiabatic quantum computation;quantum error correction	Theory	83.65709023406406	5.647154773559018	147291

The vorticitystream function formulation of these equations is used, and spatially the vorticity and stream functions are expressed as Fourier–Chebyshev expansions. The Poisson and Helmholtz equations which arise from the implicit-explicit time marching scheme are solved as banded systems using a postconditioned spectral τ -method. The polar coordinate singularity is handled by expanding fields radially over the entire diameter using a parity modified Chebyshev series and building partial regularity into the vorticity. The no-slip boundary condition is enforced by transferring one of the two boundary conditions imposed on the stream function onto the vorticity via a solvability constraint. Significant gains in run times were realized by parallelizing the code in message passage interface (MPI).	algorithm;automatic parallelization;chebyshev polynomials;navier–stokes equations;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations	David J.

The implicit scheme was based on updating the melt–air interface. The time steps of implicit algorithm were controlled by injection ratio and local mesh information of flow front to achieve “one time step, one element-layer” for filling simulation; the sub-time steps of computing temperatures were calculated for each node according to local courant number, and the thermal simulation was conducted by the filled order of nodes. Both analysis and case studies showed that the computing complexity of flow simulation was second-order of mesh size (nodal number) and one of thermal simulation was 1.5-order. As a result, the computing times and complexity of solving temperature were less than those of solving pressure.	finite element method;simulation	Shunliang Jiang;Zhiguo Wang;Goufa Zhou;Weimin Yang	2007	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2006.12.001	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;finite element method;mathematics;computational complexity theory;engineering drawing;second-order logic	DB	93.01904416568894	7.815645499323501	147473

It is shown that the rotation of a 3D object in a viscous fluid, regardless of the mechanical property and shape of the object, is defined by a common and simple differential equation, dQ=dt1⁄4 e HQ , where Q is a matrix defined by the orientation of the object and e H is the angular velocity tensor of the object. The difference between individual cases lies only in the formulation for the angular velocity. Thus the above equation, together with Jeffery’s theory for the angular velocity of rigid ellipsoids, describes the motion of rigid ellipsoids in viscous flows. The same equation, together with Eshelby’s theory for the angular velocity of deformable ellipsoids, describes the motion of deformable ellipsoids in viscous flows. Both problems are solved here numerically by a general approach that is much simpler conceptually and more economic computationally, compared to previous approaches that consider the problems separately and require numerical solutions to coupled differential equations about Euler angles or spherical (polar coordinate) angles. A Runge–Kutta approximation is constructed for solving the above general differential equation. Singular cases of Eshelby’s equations when the object is spheroidal or spherical are handled in this paper in a much simpler way than in previous work. The computational procedure can be readily implemented in any modern mathematics application that handles matrix operations. Four MathCad Worksheets are provided for modeling the motion of a single rigid or deformable ellipsoid immersed in viscous fluids, as well as the evolution of a system of noninteracting rigid or deformable ellipsoids embedded in viscous flows. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

9e5a66387f451ac0be2359d519147c6e8d1bdaca	the m1 angular moments model in a velocity-adaptive frame for rarefied gas dynamics applications		Abstract. In the present work the M1 angular moments model in a velocity-adaptive frame is presented for rarefied gas dynamics applications. First of all, the derivation of the angular M1 moments model in the particle mean velocity frame is introduced. The choice of the mean velocity framework in order to enforce the Galilean invariance property of the model is highlighted. In addition, it is shown that the model rewritten in terms of the entropic variables is Friedrichs-symmetric. Also, the derivation of the associated conservation laws and the zero mean velocity condition are detailed.

It is shown that the solution is the sum of the temperature distribution in the absence of phase change and a temperature correction due to the phase change at the interface. Assuming that the speed of the moving boundary remains sufficiently small and slowly varying in time, an analytical approximate solution of the current Stefan problem may thus be constructed as a function of the boundary data.

The equations are first written in vorticity–divergence form, in order to exploit the fact that time-derivatives then appear implicitly in the divergence equation only. A nonlinear equation must then be solved at each time-step in order to determine the divergence tendency. The nonlinear equation is solved by means of a simultaneous iteration in spectral space to determine each Fourier component. The key to the rapid convergence of the iteration is the use of a good initial guess for the divergence tendency, which is obtained from polynomial extrapolation of the solution obtained at previous time-levels. The algorithm is therefore best suited to be used with a standard multi-step time-stepping scheme (e.g. leap-frog). Two test cases are presented to validate the algorithm for initial value problems on a square periodic domain. The first test is to verify cnoidal wave speeds in one-dimension against analytical results. The second test is to ensure that the Miles–Salmon potential vorticity is advected as a parcel-wise conserved tracer throughout the nonlinear evolution of a perturbed jet subject to shear instability. The algorithm is demonstrated to perform well in each test. The resulting numerical model is expected to be of use in identifying paradigmatic behavior in mesoscale flows in the atmosphere and ocean in which both vortical, nonlinear and dispersive effects are important.  2010 Elsevier Inc.

We use new superconvergent Nyström and degenerate kernel approximating operators based on interpolatory projection at Gauss points onto the space of (discontinuous) piecewise polynomials of degree 6 r 1. We show that for the eigenvalue iterates the Elementary Iteration scheme exhibits order ðkþ 4Þr while the Double Iteration scheme exhibits order ð3kþ 4Þr, where k 1⁄4 0;1;2; . . . denotes the iteration step. We show that these orders of convergence are preserved in the corresponding discrete methods obtained by replacing the integration by a numerical quadrature formula. Similar improvement is observed for eigenvector iterates. Our results are extended to the case of discontinuous kernels along the diagonal for which superconvergence results are also obtained. Finally, numerical validation is given. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike standard Euler equations, the model takes into account wall friction, variable height and heat transfer between the pipe and the environment which are source terms. The case of one single pipe was considered in a previous reference by the authors,   [8]  , where a finite volume method with upwind discretization of the flux and source terms has been proposed in order to get a well-balanced scheme. The main goal of the present paper is to go a step further by considering a network of pipes. The main issue is the treatment of junctions for which container-like 2D finite volumes are introduced. The couplings between pipes (1D) and containers (2D) are carefully described and the conservation properties are analyzed. Numerical tests including real gas networks are solved showing the performance of the proposed methodology.	finite volume method	Alfredo Bermúdez;Xián López;M. Elena Vázquez-Cendón	2017	J. Comput.

It does not require discretization and consequently of massive computation. In this scheme the solution is performed in the form of a convergent power series with easily computable components. This paper is particularly concerned with the Adomian decomposition method and the results obtained are compared to those obtained by a conventional finite-difference method and the Sinc method. The numerical results demonstrate that the new method is relatively accurate and easily implemented.	numerical linear algebra;parabolic antenna	Kamel Al-khaled;Dogan Kaya;Muhammad Aslam Noor	2004	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2003.08.079	differential operator;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;calculus;mathematics;adomian decomposition method;quantum mechanics	HPC	83.34954170568784	14.113958134184852	149538

In this paper we address this problem for the case involving Earth and a coplanar comet, and we offer a detailed discussion of a novel tandem application of two well-known rootfinding methods to solve it. Our results illustrate the important fact that the minimum distance between two such orbiting bodies occurs in general when neither body is at an orbital intersection. The numerical approach we devise provides a framework that will be used in future work that addresses the more general minimization problem that arises when the coplanar restriction is removed, and may serve as a model for addressing other related minimization problems.	numerical method	I.

314d6a8673559611ffdf246563f699dd57b51911	a numbering algorithm for finite element on extruded meshes which avoids the unstructured mesh penalty		We present a generic algorithm for numbering and then efficiently iterating over the data values attached to an extruded mesh. An extruded mesh is formed by replicating an existing mesh, assumed to be unstructured, to form layers of prismatic cells. Applications of extruded meshes include, but are not limited to, the representation of 3D high aspect ratio domains employed by geophysical finite element simulations. These meshes are structured in the extruded direction. The algorithm presented here exploits this structure to avoid the performance penalty traditionally associated with unstructured meshes. 5 We evaluate our algorithm on a range of low compute intensity operations which constitute worst cases for data layout performance exploration. The experiments show that having structure along the extruded direction enables the cost of the indirect data accesses to be amortized after 10-20 layers as long as the underlying mesh is well-ordered. We characterise the resulting spatial and temporal reuse in a representative set of both continuous-Galerkin and discontinuous-Galerkin discretisations. On meshes with realistic numbers of layers the performance achieved is between 70% and 90% of a theoretical hardware-specific 10 limit.	algorithm;amortized analysis;experiment;finite element method;generic programming;polygon mesh;simulation;unstructured grid	Gheorghe-Teodor Bercea;Andrew T.

Currently many important mechanisms of roughnessinduced transition are not well understood. In recent years, direct numerical simulation (DNS) has been extensively applied for investigating instability and transition mechanisms of hypersonic boundary layers. Most of the past DNS studies, however, have been based on body-fitted grids for smooth surfaces without roughness. Due to complex geometry of embedded roughness, the use of body-fitted grids can be very difficult for flow with arbitrary surface roughness. In this paper, we present a new high-order cut-cell method to overcome the natural complexities in grid generation around arbitrary surface of roughness. The new method combines a non-uniform-grid finite-difference method for discrete grid points near the solid boundary and a shock-fitting method for the treatment of the bow shock. The non-uniform-grid finite-difference formulas are expressed in a general explicit form so that they can be applied to different multi-dimensional problems without any modification. The computational accuracy of new algorithms of up to O(h) are tested on several oneand two-dimensional elliptic equations in irregular domains. In addition, the new method is applied to the simulation of the receptivity process of a Mach 5.92 flow over a flat plate under the combined effect of an isolated surface roughness element and surface blow and suction. A good agreement is found between the unsteady flow results and those obtained by a Linear Stability Theory (LST). 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In doing so, we propose a new, ‘‘genuinely multidimensional,” non-oscillatory reconstruction—the minimum-angle plane reconstruction (MAPR). The MAPR is based on the selection of an interpolation stencil yielding a linear reconstruction with minimal angle with respect to the horizontal. This means that the MAPR does not bias the solution by using a coordinate direction-by-direction approach to the reconstruction, which is highly desirable when unstructured meshes consisting of elements with (almost) arbitrary geometry are used. To show the ‘‘black-box solver” capabilities of the proposed schemes, numerical results are presented for a number of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws (in two spatial dimensions) with convex and non-convex flux functions. In particular, it is shown that, even though the MAPR is neither designed with the goal of obtaining a scheme that satisfies a maximum principle in mind nor is total-variation diminishing (TVD), it provides a robust non-oscillatory reconstruction that captures composite waves accurately. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

High-speed impact of thin plates and the ultimate development of penetration holes is an important problem for the practical design of impact/shield/armor systems. Though computational and empirical models provide information concerning plate penetration, a theoretical, late time model provides the convenience and efficiency (computation of the full time history of the impact process is not necessary) of a closed form model with the rational basis of a physics based mathematical relationship. To model the decidedly unsteady behavior of impact and penetration a time dependent lower order solution, i.e. 1-d damped kinematic wave, is used to estimate temporal behavior in the more complete 2-d unsteady stagnation point problem, giving a completely time independent stagnation point model. Shear behavior in the stagnation point model, as well as, damping in the 1-d kinematic wave model are modeled using a nonlinear resistance model which draws upon classical viscous fluid flow relationships. No empirical constants are introduced in the associated resistance relationship. Having obtained the late time stagnation point flow equation, a self-similar solution is sought by posing a separation type solution form. Self-similarity of the stagnation point flow is admitted by treating the penetration coincident flow in the same manner as the 1-d kinematic wave solution. The associated self-similar cross-steam flow equation is solved approximately and combined with the separation solution form to yield late time penetration flow velocity field. Examination of the eigenvalues of the velocity solution gives an explicit relationship for the size of the plate penetration hole. The plate penetration hole diameter solution shows good agreement with CTH simulations (a well validated hydrocode) and experimental data.	velocity (software development)	Lawrence J.

It is rather comprehensive in that it applies to a wide variety of boundary value problems; here, we treat the Neumann and Dirichlet problems as well as the boundary value problem arising from acoustic scattering at the interface of two fluids. It achieves high accuracy, is applicable to large-scale problems and, perhaps most importantly, does not require asymptotic estimates for solutions. Instead, the singularities of solutions are resolved numerically. The approach is efficient, however, only in the lowand mid-frequency regimes. Once the scatterer becomes more than several hundred wavelengths in size, the performance of the algorithm of this paper deteriorates significantly. We illustrate our method with several numerical experiments, including the solution of a Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation given on a domain with nearly 10000 corner points. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a stochastic asymptotic-preserving (s-AP) scheme in the generalized polynomial chaos stochastic Galerkin (gPC-sG) framework, which allows the efficient computation of the problem in both kinetic and hydrodynamic regimes. The s-AP property is proved by deriving the equilibrium of the gPC version of the Fokker–Planck operator. The coefficient matrices that arise in a Helmholtz equation and a Poisson equation, essential ingredients of the algorithms, are proved to be positive definite under reasonable and mild assumptions. The computation of the gPC version of a translation operator that arises in the inversion of the Fokker–Planck operator is accelerated by a spectrally accurate splitting method. Numerical examples illustrate the s-AP property and the efficiency of the gPC-sG method in various asymptotic regimes.	two-phase locking	Shi Jin;Ruiwen Shu	2017	J. Comput.

b768b76a4f989f2b20a653d3f0e079e99094873e	on a two-grid finite element scheme for the equations of motion arising in kelvin-voigt model	backward difference scheme;two grid method;kelvin voigt model;65m60;optimal error estimates;65m12;65m15	In this paper, we study a two level method based on Newton’s iteration for the nonlinear system arising from the Galerkin finite element approximation to the equations of motion described by the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic fluid flow model. The two-grid algorithm is based on three steps. In the first step, the nonlinear system is solved on a coarse mesh TH to obtain an approximate solution uH . In the second step, the nonlinear system is linearized around uH based on Newton’s iteration and the linear system is solved on a finer mesh Th. Finally, in the third step, a correction to the results obtained in the second step is achieved by solving a linear problem with a different right hand side on Th. Optimal error estimates in L∞(L2)-norm, when h = O(H 2−δ) and in L∞(H1)-norm, when h = O(H 5−2δ) for velocity and in L∞(L2)-norm, when h = O(H 5−2δ) for pressure are established, where δ > 0 is arbitrarily small for two dimensions and δ = 2 for three dimensions.	approximation algorithm;finite element method;galerkin method;iteration;linear programming;linear system;newton;nonlinear system;velocity (software development)	Saumya Bajpai;Neela Nataraj;Amiya Kumar Pani	2014	Adv.

The solution of such a problem is shown in general to have a weak singularity near the initial time $t=0$, and sharp pointwise bounds on certain derivatives of this solution are derived. A new analysis of a standard finite difference method for the problem is given, taking into account this initial singularity. This analysis encompasses both uniform meshes and meshes that are graded in time, and includes new stability and consistency bounds. The final convergence result shows clearly how the regularity of the solution and the grading of the mesh affect the order of convergence of the difference scheme, so one can choose an optimal mesh grading. Numerical results are presented that confirm the sharpness of the error analysis.	finite difference method	Martin Stynes;Eugene O'Riordan;Jose L. Gracia	2017	SIAM J.

Frequently, an implicit level set type representation of these surfaces is the most effective and computationally advantageous approach. This paper addresses the computational problem of how to solve partial differential equations on highly resolved level sets with an underlying very high-resolution discrete grid. These high-resolution grids are represented in a very efficient dynamic tubular grid encoding format for a narrow band. A reaction diffusion model on a fixed surface and surface evolution driven by a nonlinear geometric diffusion approach, by isotropic or truly anisotropic curvature motion, are investigated as characteristic model problems. The proposed methods are based on semi-implicit finite element discretizations directly on these narrow bands, require only standard numerical quadrature, and allow for large time steps. To combine large time steps with a very thin and thus storage inexpensive narrow band, suitable transparent boundary conditions on the boundary of the narrow band and a nested iteration scheme in each time step are investigated. This nested iteration scheme enables the discrete interfaces to move in a single time step significantly beyond the domain of the narrow band of the previous time step. Furthermore, algorithmic tools are provided to assemble finite element matrices and to apply matrix vector operators via fast, cache-coherent access to the dynamic tubular grid encoded data structure. The consistency of the presented approach is evaluated, and various numerical examples show its application potential.	boundary case;cache coherence;coherence (physics);computation;computational problem;data (computing);data structure;finite element method;geometric modeling;geometry processing;image resolution;implicit surface;iteration;iterative method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;obedience (human behavior);polygon mesh;semiconductor industry;simulation	Oliver Nemitz;Michael Bang Nielsen;Martin Rumpf;Ross T.

Perfectly Matched Layers are often employed for that purpose, especially in high contrast layered materials where absorbing boundary conditions are difficult to design. In here, we define a Perfectly Matched Layer that automatically adjusts its parameters without any user interaction. The user only has to indicate the desired decay in the surrounding layer. With this Perfectly Matched Layer, we show that even in the most complex scenarios where the material contrast properties are as high as sixteen orders of magnitude, we do not introduce numerical reflections when truncating the domain, thus, obtaining accurate solutions.	computation;numerical analysis;perfectly matched layer;reflection (computer graphics);self-tuning;simulation;software propagation;truncation	Julen Álvarez-Aramberri;David Pardo;Helene Barucq	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.087	perfectly matched layer;computer science	AI	93.70287182868442	9.12165176848081	150867

The model, which can be derived by an energy principle, gives valuable insight into the coupling mechanism and features a saddle point structure with the elastic displacement and magnetic scalar potential as independent variables. As main results, the existence and uniqueness of the solution are proven for the continuous and discrete cases and special properties of the corresponding bilinear forms are shown. In particular, the coupled magneto-elastic bilinear form satisfies an inf–sup condition for a certain class of magnetostrictive materials, that is essential for the stability of the problem.

The MIB method smoothly extends the solution across the interface so that standard high order central finite difference schemes can be used without the loss of accuracy. One feature of the MIB is that it disassociates the discretization of the elliptic equation from the enforcement of interface jump conditions. The other is to make iterative use of only the lowest order jump conditions to determine the fictitious values on extended domains. It is of arbitrarily high order in convergence, in principle. However, its applicability was hindered by the lack of sufficiently many grid points to determine all the fictitious values required for high order schemes at the location where the curvature of the interface is relatively large. We remove this obstacle by introducing a new concept, the disassociation between the discretization and the domain extension. We show that the improved MIB method is robust for handling general irregular interfaces by extensive numerical experiments on the Poisson equation and the Helmholtz equation. To better understand the MIB method and other potential high order interface schemes, we propose an alternative interpolation formulation of the MIB method and show that the new formulation is essentially equivalent to the improved one. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

00151de4b7a98d30a93cc56462f04e87c31ed59c	novel fluid detail enhancement based on multi-layer depth regression analysis and flip fluid simulation		Funding information National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 61190120, 61190125, 61190124, 61300067, 61672077, 6167214, 61602341 and 61532002 Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel integrated method for effective modeling and realistic enhancement of scale-sensitive fluid simulation details. The core of our method is the organic of multi-layer depth image regression analysis and fluid implicit particle fluid simulation of which the regression analysis induces the criterion where the fluid details should be produced. First, we capture the depth buffer of the fluid surface dynamically from the top of scene. Second, we employ depth peeling technique to decompose the target fluid volume into multiple depth layers and conduct time-space analysis over surface layers. Third, we propose a logistic regression-based model to rigorously pinpoint the complex interacting regions, wherein multiple detail-relevant factors are taken into account based on the captured multiple depth layers. Finally, details are enhanced by animating extra diffuse materials and augmenting the air-fluid mixing phenomenon. It is evident that, with depth peeling technology, we can afford rigorous analysis not only across surface layers at different fluid depth but along the depth direction as well. After integrating the analysis results from these two sources, we are capable of performing detail enhancement both on the fluid surface and inside the fluid to obtain a great visual effect, even when large occlusion exists. Directly benefiting from the flexibility of image-space-dominant processing, our unified framework can be entirely implemented on graphics processing units and thus achieves interactive performance. For various fluid phenomena with different diffuse materials (e.g., spray, foam, and bubble), comprehensive experiments and evaluations have demonstrated its superiority in high-fidelity fluid detail enhancement and its interaction with surrounding environment.	algorithm;cuda;computational fluid dynamics;computer graphics;depth peeling;dynamical simulation;experiment;fltk;fluid animation;graphics processing unit;hidden surface determination;information;interaction;layer (electronics);logistic regression;simula;unification (computer science);unified framework;visual effects;z-buffering	Yuxing Qiu;Lipeng Yang;Shuai Li;Qing L.

e3af5d42126828f2ddf925541b0676b9432167e4	a hierarchy of discrete integrable coupling system with self-consistent sources	mathematics	Many physical problemsmay bemodeled by soliton equation. The Hamiltonian structures of many systems have been obtained by the famous trace identity [1–6]. The study of integrable couplings of integrable systems has become the focus of common concern in recent years. It originates from the investigations on the symmetry problems and associated centerless Virasoro algebras [7]. Many integrable coupling systems have been constructed by using the methods of a direct method [8], perturbations [9], enlarging spectral problems [10, 11], creating new loop algebras [12, 13], and semidirect sums of Lie algebras [14, 15]. The Hamiltonian structures of the integrable couplings of lattice equations can be constructed by means of the discrete quadratic-form identity [16, 17]. Since Mel’Nikov proposed a new kind of integrable model whichwas called soliton equations with self-consistent sources [18] in 1983, many soliton equations with selfconsistent sources [19–23] have been presented in recent years. For applications, these kinds of systems are usually used to describe interactions betweendifferent solitarywaves. In this paper, we deduce a hierarchy of discrete integrable coupling system with self-consistent sources which are few compared with the continuous ones. The paper will be organized as follows. We first get a hierarchy of integrable lattice soliton equation with self-consistent sources in Section 2. In Section 3, a hierarchy of discrete integrable coupling system is derived by making use of the discrete zero curvature representation. By means of the discrete quadratic-form identity we establish the Hamiltonian structures of the hierarchy. Further, the resulting Hamiltonian equations are all proved to be integrable in Liouville sense. Finally, we give the integrable coupling systems with self-consistent sources.

Because we are interested in model order reduction (MOR) techniques for unsteady non-linear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, which involve moving waves and discontinuities, we explore the parametertime framework and in the same time we deal with nonlinearities using a POD-EIM-Greedy algorithm [18]. We provide under some hypothesis an error indicator, which is also an error upper bound for the difference between the high fidelity solution and the reduced one.	enterprise information management;greedy algorithm;model order reduction;moniliophthora roreri;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;quantitation;sampling (signal processing);uncertainty quantification;whole earth 'lectronic link	D.

be281f92caea68a5e05cc3405cd69cf0901b7e74	unconditionally optimal error analysis of crank-nicolson galerkin fems for a strongly nonlinear parabolic system		In this paper, we present unconditionally optimal error estimates of linearized Crank–Nicolson Galerkin finite element methods for a strongly nonlinear parabolic system in Rd (d = 2, 3). However, all previous works required certain time-step conditions that were dependent on the spatial mesh size. In order to overcome several entitative difficulties caused by the strong nonlinearity of the system, the proof takes two steps. First, by using a temporal-spatial error splitting argument and a new technique, optimal L2 error estimates of the numerical schemes can be obtained under the condition τ ≥ h, where τ denotes the time-step size and h is the spatial mesh size. Second, we obtain the boundedness of numerical solutions by mathematical induction and inverse inequality when τ ≤ h. Then, optimal L2 and H1 error estimates are proved in a different way for such case. Numerical results are given to illustrate our theoretical analyses.	crank (person);crank–nicolson method;entity;finite element method;galerkin method;mathematical induction;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;parabolic antenna;social inequality	Dongfang Li;Jilu Wang	2017	J.

The details of the convergence proof are given for a sinc{collocation method for two-point boundary-value problems when the original domain is divided into two subdomains. The extension to multiple domains is then straightforward. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical examples that exhibit the exponential convergence rate.	algorithm;discrete system;domain decomposition methods;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;sinc function;time complexity	Anne C.

Global existence and blow up in finite time of solutions will be obtained for arbitrary initial energy. To be a little more precise, we will give a threshold result for the solutions to exist globally or to blow up in finite time when the initial energy is subcritical and critical, respectively. The decay rate of the L 2 ( Ω ) norm is also obtained for global solutions in these cases. Moreover, some sufficient conditions for the existence of global and blow-up solutions are also derived when the initial energy is supercritical.	kirchhoff's theorem	Yuzhu Han;Qingwei Li	2018	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2018.01.047	kirchhoff integral theorem;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;geometry	Vision	84.18385763468059	8.232126694514342	153452

The formulation in a multiple grid formulation differs from the conventional algorithm in that, at a constant time period, the equations are solved across different grid levels, so as to facilitate faster propagation of the boundary condition. This results in a faster convergence of the solution to the desired time level. Focus in this paper is split across both testing the accuracy of the end solution and in quantifying the resultant computational savings. Tests conducted for flows with shocks indicate that the solution from current formulation is inline with the theoretical predictions. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

First, numerical issues encountered with popular extended finite element approximation spaces are pointed out. Then, the paper gives indications on how to circumvent those issues. The very originality of the paper relies on questioning the theoretical approximation spaces with respect to numerical results and to modify accordingly their design. The relationship between the new design and the previous designs is clearly established, in order to highlight the very small implementation cost of the modifications exposed here. Hence with minimal additional computational cost, gains in accuracy can be significant as shown later in the paper.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;finite element method;gene ontology term enrichment;numerical analysis	M.

Problems are formulated on a mesoscopic basis. In a side condition, the dynamics of a Newtonian fluid is described by a family of simplified Boltzmann-like equations, namely BGK-Boltzmann equations, which are linked to an incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. It is proposed to solve the non-linear optimisation problem by a line search algorithm. The needed derivatives are obtained by deriving the adjoint equations, referred to as adjoint BGK-Boltzmann equations. The primal equations are discretised by standard lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) while for the adjoint equations a novel discretisation strategy is introduced. The approach follows the main ideas behind LBM and is therefore referred to as adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods (ALBM). The corresponding algorithm retains most of the basic features of LB algorithms. In particular, it enables a highly-efficient parallel implementation and thus solving large-scale fluid flow control and optimisation problems. The overall solution strategy, the derivation of a prototype adjoint BGK-Boltzmann equation, the novel ALBM and its parallel realisation as well as its validation are discussed in detail in this article. Numerical and performance results are presented for a series of steady-state distributed control problems with up to approximately 1.6 million unknown control parameters obtained on a high performance computer with up to 256 processing units.	flow control (data);lattice boltzmann methods;mathematical optimization	Mathias J.

a63420e03af8ea334e88315e9a89fe5fab39ff57	numerical artifacts in the generalized porous medium equation: why harmonic averaging itself is not to blame		Abstract The degenerate parabolic Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME) poses numerical challenges due to self-sharpening and its sharp corner solutions. For these problems, we show results for two subclasses of the GPME with differentiable k ( p ) with respect to p , namely the Porous Medium Equation (PME) and the superslow diffusion equation. Spurious temporal oscillations, and nonphysical locking and lagging have been reported in the literature. These issues have been attributed to harmonic averaging of the coefficient k ( p ) for small p , and arithmetic averaging has been suggested as an alternative. We show that harmonic averaging is not solely responsible and that an improved discretization can mitigate these issues. Here, we investigate the causes of these numerical artifacts using modified equation analysis. The modified equation framework can be used for any type of discretization. We show results for the second order finite volume method. The observed problems with harmonic averaging can be traced to two leading error terms in its modified equation. This is also illustrated numerically through a Modified Harmonic Method (MHM) that can locally modify the critical terms to remove the aforementioned numerical artifacts.		Danielle C.

Numerical simulation of mantle convection is one of the most powerful tools to resolve the thermal and mechanical evolution in the earth’s mantle. The developments in numerical techniques and increases in computational power over the last 10–15 years have facilitated great progress in simulation studies of mantle convection. In addition, with increases in computational resolution, one can expect greater focus on the use of three-dimensional (3D) visualization of mantle convection in gaining a deeper understanding of mantle dynamics. This paper presents simulations of the present-day, instantaneous global mantle flow based on geophysical observations such as seismic tomography models and 3D visualizations of present-day mantle convection. Numerical results are summarized in terms of two aspects of geodynamics: (1) the mixing properties and topological structure of the mantle interior, and (2) the presence of strong mantle upwelling beneath the South Pacific enhanced by the low-viscosity D00 layer.	computation;mantle;numerical analysis;numerical method;simulation;tomography	Masaki Yoshida	2013	J.

Contrary to the conventional finite element analysis, the error between exact solution and finite element solution is split into two parts (temporal error and spatial error) by introducing a corresponding time-discrete system. This can lead to the spatial error independent of  τ  (time step). Secondly, based on the above technique, optimal error estimates in  L  2  and  H  1 -norms of TGM solution are deduced unconditionally, while previous works always require a certain time step size condition. Finally, a numerical experiment is provided to confirm the theoretical analysis.	commutation theorem;parabolic antenna	Dongyang Shi;Huaijun Yang	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.04.010	discretization error;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;round-off error;calculus;mathematics	Theory	89.46190002659742	12.798395941250316	154684

0d348477b42cb097073d378661b1fcd938485b56	a nearest-neighbour discretisation of the regularized stokeslet boundary integral equation		Abstract The method of regularized stokeslets is extensively used in biological fluid dynamics due to its conceptual simplicity and meshlessness. This simplicity carries a degree of cost in computational expense and accuracy because the number of degrees of freedom used to discretise the unknown surface traction is generally significantly higher than that required by boundary element methods. We describe a meshless method based on nearest-neighbour interpolation that significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to discretise the unknown traction, increasing the range of problems that can be practically solved, without excessively complicating the task of the modeller. The nearest-neighbour technique is tested against the classical problem of rigid body motion of a sphere immersed in very viscous fluid, then applied to the more complex biophysical problem of calculating the rotational diffusion timescales of a macromolecular structure modelled by three closely-spaced non-slender rods. A heuristic for finding the required density of force and quadrature points by numerical refinement is suggested. Matlab/GNU Octave code for the key steps of the algorithm is provided, which predominantly use basic linear algebra operations, with a full implementation being provided on github. Compared with the standard Nystrom discretisation, more accurate and substantially more efficient results can be obtained by de-refining the force discretisation relative to the quadrature discretisation: a cost reduction of over 10 times with improved accuracy is observed. This improvement comes at minimal additional technical complexity. Future avenues to develop the algorithm are then discussed.	discretization	David J. Smith	2018	J. Comput.

It is shown that both methods are implicit and provide explicit maps, but they do not preserve the energy in conservative systems. It is also shown that time-linearized methods preserve both the ®xed points and the linear stability of the original ordinary dierential equation, whereas linearized htechniques do preserve the ®xed points and the linear stability of attractors, but the stability of the repellers depends on the time step and the implicitness parameter. The results clearly indicate that the linearized h-techniques which more faithfully reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the original ordinary dierential equation are second-order accurate in time.

The sufficient condition for convergence of the method is addressed. Sincemathematicalmodeling of numerous scientific and engineering experiments lead to Brusselator and Burgers’ system of equations, it is worth trying new methods to solve these systems. We construct a new efficient recurrent relation to solve nonlinear Burgers’ and Brusselator systems of equations. Comparison of the results obtained by homotopy perturbation method with those of Adomian’s decomposition method and dual-reciprocity boundary element method leads to significant consequences. Two standard problems are used to validate the method. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In reaction problems, when the reaction time scale is very small, e.g., orders of magnitude smaller than the fluid dynamics time scales, the governing equations will become very stiff. Wrong propagation speed of discontinuity may occur due to the underresolved numerical solution in both space and time. The present proposed method is a modified fractional step method which solves the convection step and reaction step separately. In the convection step, any high order shockcapturing method can be used. In the reaction step, an ODE solver is applied but with the computed flow variables in the shock region modified by the Harten subcell resolution idea. For numerical experiments, a fifth-order finite-difference WENO scheme and its anti-diffusion WENO variant are considered. A wide range of 1D and 2D scalar and Euler system test cases are considered. Studies indicate that for the considered test cases, the new method maintains high order accuracy in space for smooth flows, and for stiff source terms with discontinuities, it can capture the correct propagation speed of discontinuities in very coarse meshes with reasonable CFL numbers.	courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;euler;experiment;finite difference method;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;reflections of signals on conducting lines;software propagation;solver;system testing;test case;total variation diminishing	Wei Wang;Chi-Wang Shu;H.

The method works for both deformable and rigid solids and for arbitrary equations of state. The method exploits the formulation of [11] which solves compressible fluid in a semi-implicit manner, solving for the advection part explicitly and then correcting the intermediate state to time t using an implicit pressure, obtained by solving a modified Poisson system. Similar to previous fluid-structure interaction methods, we apply pressure forces to the solid and enforce a velocity boundary condition on the fluid in order to satisfy a no-slip constraint. Unlike previous methods, however, we apply these coupled interactions implicitly by adding the constraint to the pressure system and combining it with any implicit solid forces in order to obtain a strongly coupled, symmetric indefinite system (similar to [17], which only handles incompressible flow). We also show that, under a few reasonable assumptions, this system can be made symmetric positive-definite by following the methodology of [16]. Because our method handles the fluidstructure interactions implicitly, we avoid introducing any new time step restrictions and obtain stable results even for high density-to-mass ratios, where explicit methods struggle or fail. We exactly conserve momentum and kinetic energy (thermal fluid-structure interactions are not considered) at the fluid-structure interface, and hence naturally handle highly non-linear phenomenon such as shocks, contacts and rarefactions.	c date and time functions;interaction;nonlinear system;numerical stability;semiconductor industry;velocity (software development)	Jon Gretarsson;Nipun Kwatra;Ronald Fedkiw	2011	J.

Inpainting with the help of Cahn–Hilliard models has been particularly successful, and it turns out that Cahn–Hilliard inpainting with the double obstacle potential can lead to better results compared to inpainting with a smooth double well potential. However, a mathematical analysis of this approach is missing so far. In this paper we give first analytical results for a Cahn–Hilliard double obstacle inpainting model regarding existence of global solutions to the time-dependent problem and stationary solutions to the time-independent problem without constraints on the parameters involved. With the help of numerical results we show the effectiveness of the approach for binary and grayscale images.	bitwise operation;grayscale;inpainting;numerical analysis;stationary process	Harald Garcke;Kei Fong Lam;Vanessa Styles	2018	CoRR			Vision	93.88345540719803	14.892404198839397	155400

A database representing the turbulent statistically steady state of the velocity field through 10 viscous time units is assembled and the different vortex-identification techniques are applied to the database. It is shown that the method of the “imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue pair of the velocity-gradient tensor” gives the best results in identifying hairpin-like vortical structures in the wall region of turbulent channel flow.	algorithm;direct numerical simulation;finite difference;gradient;imaginary time;longest common subsequence problem;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical method;steady state;turbulence;velocity (software development);vortex	Giancarlo Alfonsi;Leonardo Primavera	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72584-8_2	turbulence;mathematical optimization;law of the wall;chézy formula;geometry;flow separation;particle-laden flows	Visualization	92.73079382329473	6.973888865106778	155501

A key feature of this method is a cut-cell meshing technique, in which the triangles are not required to conform to the boundary. This approach permits anisotropic adaptation without the difficulty of constructing meshes that conform to potentially complex geometries. A quadrature technique is proposed for accurately integrating on general cut cells. In addition, an output-based error estimator and adaptive method are presented, appropriately accounting for high-order solution spaces in optimizing local mesh anisotropy. Accuracy on cut-cell meshes is demonstrated by comparing solutions to those on standard, boundary-conforming meshes. Robustness of the cut-cell and adaptation technique is successfully tested for highly anisotropic boundary-layer meshes representative of practical high Re simulations. Furthermore, adaptation results show that, for all test cases considered, p 1⁄4 2 and p 1⁄4 3 discretizations meet desired error tolerances using fewer degrees of freedom than p 1⁄4 1. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The SPFD approach is commonly used to compute the currents induced by an externally applied magnetic field in regions with weak, heterogeneous conductivities such as, e.g., the human body. We present the extended scalar-potential finite-difference (Ex-SPFD) approach as a two step algorithm. In the first step, the excitation is computed by solving the magnetoquasistatic curl-curl equation on a coarse grid that is well adapted for the field sources. In the second step, the magnetic vector potential is prolongated onto a finer grid and a divergence correction inside the conductor is applied. Using the Maxwell-grid-equations (MGEs) of the finite integration technique, a geometric discretization scheme for Maxwell's equations, this new approach has been implemented in a parallel environment in order to account for the memory-demanding high-resolution anatomy models used for the calculation of induced currents inside the human body. We demonstrate the validity and the improved numerical performance of the new approach for a test case. Finally, an application example of a human exposed to a realistic electromagnetic field source is presented.		Andreas Barchanski;Markus Clemens;Herbert De Gersem;Thomas Weiland	2006	J. Comput.

Among other things, the PDE describes freezing of foodstuff, and is closely related to the (potential) Burgers’ equation. We show that for certain forms of coefficient functions, the PDE converges to a stationary solution given by (fixed) boundary conditions that make physical sense. These boundary conditions are either symmetric or asymmetric of Dirichlet type. Furthermore, we present an observer design based on the PDE model for estimation of inner-domain temperatures in block-frozen fish and for monitoring freezing time. We illustrate the results with numerical simulations.	requirements analysis	Christoph Josef Backi;Jan Dimon Bendtsen;John Leth;Jan Tommy Gravdahl	2016	Int. J.

The conformal factor indicates the local scaling introduced by such a mapping. This process could be used to compute geometric quantities in a simplified flat domain with zero Gaussian curvature. For example, the computation of geodesic distances on a curved surface can be mapped into solving an eikonal equation in a plane weighted by the conformal factor. Solving an eikonal equation on the weighted plane can then be done by regular sampling of the domain using, for example, the celebrated fast marching method (FMM). The connection between the conformal factor on the plane and the surface geometry can be justified analytically. Still, in order to construct consistent numerical solvers that exploit this relation, one needs to prove that the conformal factor is bounded. We provide theoretical bounds of the conformal factor and introduce optimization formulations that control its behavior. It is demonstrated that without such restrictions the numerical results are unboundedly inaccurate. Putting all ingredients in the right order, we introduce a method for computing geodesic distances on a two-dimensional manifold by using the FMM on a weighted flat domain. It is also shown how a metric on a curved domain can be reconstructed by reformulating the nonflat metric restoration problem into a weighted flat domain, again, with bounded weights for consistent results.	circuit restoration;computation;fast marching method;fast multipole method;image scaling;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing)	Yonathan Aflalo;Ron Kimmel;Michael Zibulevsky	2013	SIAM J.

After giving a phase space formulation of the high frequency limit using the Wigner distribution, we derive a nonlinear diffusion equation for the evolution of the wave energy density when random inhomogeneities are present. We show that this equation is linearly stable even in the case of a focusing nonlinearity, provided that it is not too strong. The linear stability condition is related to the variance identity for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation in an unexpected way. We carry out extensive numerical computations to get a better understanding of the interaction between the focusing nonlinearity and the randomness.

The original model of Bertalmı́o, Bertozzi, and Sapiro [Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2001, pp. 355–362] is reformulated as a variational principle based on the minimization of a well-chosen functional by a steepest descent method using Sobolev gradients. This new theoretical framework offers an alternative to the direct solving of a high-order PDE, with the practical advantage of an easier and more flexible computer implementation. In particular, the proposed algorithm does not require any constant tuning or advanced knowledge of numerical methods for Navier–Stokes equations (slope limiters, dynamic relaxation for Poisson equation, anisotropic diffusion steps, etc.). Using a straightforward finite difference implementation, we demonstrate, through various examples for image inpainting and image interpolation, that the novel algorithm is faster than the original implementation of the Navier–Stokes model, while providing results of similar quality. This paper also provides the mathematical theory for the analysis of the algorithm. Using an evolution equation in an infinite dimensional setting, we obtain global existence and uniqueness results as well as the existence of an ω-limit. This formalism is of more general interest and could be applied to other image processing models based on variational formulations.	algorithm;anisotropic diffusion;computer vision;dynamic relaxation;finite difference;formal system;gradient descent;gradient method;image gradient;image processing;inpainting;interpolation;linear programming relaxation;navier–stokes equations;numerical method;pattern recognition;proceedings of the ieee;variational principle	Parimah Kazemi;Ionut Danaila	2012	SIAM J.

A stable TDBEM scheme was presented and good agreements with conventional wake field analysis of the FDTD method were obtained. On the other hand, the TDBEM scheme still contains difficulty of initial value setting on interior region problems for infinitely long accelerator beam pipe. To avoid this initial value setting, we adopted a numerical model of beam pipes with finite length and wall thickness on open scattering problems. But the use of such finite beam pipe models causes another problem of unwanted scattering fields at the beam pipe edge, and leads to the involvement of interior resonant solutions. This paper presents a modified TDBEM scheme, Scattered-field Time Domain Boundary Element Method (S-TDBEM) to treat the infinitely long beam pipe on interior region problems. It is shown that the S-TDBEM is able to avoid the excitation of the edge scattering fields and the involvement of numerical instabilities caused by interior resonance, which occur in the conventional TDBEM.	boundary element method;simulation	Kazuhiro Fujita;Hideki Kawaguchi;Shusuke Nishiyama;Satoshi Tomioka;Takeaki Enoto;Igor Zagorodnov;Thomas Weiland	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e90-c.2.265	electromagnetic field;optics;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	89.56355398684819	5.52410760486368	156941

It is known that the underlying saddle-point problem is well-posed in two function spaces, H(div) × L2 and L2 × H1, leading to the possibility of two distinct types of preconditioner. For homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, the discrete problems are identical. This motivates our use of Raviart--Thomas approximation in both frameworks, yielding a nonconforming method in the second case. The focus is on linear algebra; we establish the optimality of two parameter-free block-diagonal preconditioners using basic properties of the finite element matrices. Uniform eigenvalue bounds are established and the impact of the PDE coefficients is explored in numerical experiments. A practical scheme is discussed, the key building block for which is a fast solver for a scalar diffusion operator based on algebraic multigrid. Trials of preconditioned minres illustrate that both preconditioning schemes are optimal with respect to the discretization parameter and robust with respect to the PDE coefficients.	preconditioner;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Catherine Elizabeth Powell;David J.

The general governing partial differential equations are transformed into a set of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations using unique similarity transformation. Numerical solutions of the similarity equations are obtained using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) method. Three different types of nanoparticles are considered, namely, Cu, Al2O3, and TiO2, by using water as a base fluid with Prandtl number Pr=6.2. The effects of the nanoparticle volume fraction φ and the constant exponent m on the flow and heat transfer characteristics are obtained and discussed.

455aec2c4e2771278473ef082de3a4a5e544a0de	an incompressible, depth-averaged lattice boltzmann method for liquid flow in microfluidic devices with variable aperture	porous media;microfluidics;permeability;lattice boltzmann	Two-dimensional (2D) pore-scale models have successfully simulated microfluidic experiments of aqueous-phase flow with mixing-controlled reactions in devices with small aperture. A standard 2D model is not generally appropriate when the presence of mineral precipitate or biomass creates complex and irregular three-dimensional (3D) pore geometries. We modify the 2D lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to incorporate viscous drag from the top and bottom microfluidic device (micromodel) surfaces, typically excluded in a 2D model. Viscous drag from these surfaces can be approximated by uniformly scaling a steady-state 2D velocity field at low Reynolds number. We demonstrate increased accuracy by approximating the viscous drag with an analytically-derived body force which assumes a local parabolic velocity profile across the micromodel depth. Accuracy of the generated 2D velocity field and simulation permeability have not been evaluated in geometries with variable aperture. We obtain permeabilities within approximately 10% error and accurate streamlines from the proposed 2D method relative to results obtained from 3D simulations. In addition, the proposed method requires a CPU run time approximately 40 times less than a standard 3D method, representing a significant computational benefit for permeability calculations.	approximation algorithm;central processing unit;experiment;image scaling;lattice boltzmann methods;parabolic antenna;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;steady state;velocity (software development)	Artin Laleian;Albert J.

Successful particle sizing using spectroscopic techniques requires an accurate scattering theory. Single particle scattering theory, first developed by Rayleigh and refined by Epstein and Carhart, is an exact theory for an isolated particle suspended in a medium. The theory involves expansion of the scattered fields as a series of Hankel functions, which, when solved in the far field, give the scattering coefficients. However, the numerical solution for these coefficients is badly conditioned and as a result, it is not possible to guarantee under all circumstances accurate results for calculation of the scattering coefficients. It is also difficult to solve the scattering problem for shapes other than ellipsoids and to account for scattering by more than one particle.

Moreover, model reduction by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is applied and compared with the numerical solution of the full problem. To solve the optimal control problems numerically, the performance of different versions of the nonlinear conjugate gradient method is studied.

We follow the established framework of FFT-based Ewald summation, but obtain a method with an important decoupling of errors: it is shown, for the proposed method, that the error due to frequency domain truncation can be separated from the approximation error added by the fast method. This has the significance that the truncation of the underlying Ewald sum prescribes the size of the grid used in the FFT-based fast method, which clearly is the minimal grid. Both errors are of exponential-squared order, and the latter can be controlled independently of the grid size. We compare numerically to the established SPME method by Essmann et al. and see that the memory required can be reduced by orders of magnitude. We also benchmark efficiency (i.e. error as a function of computing time) against the SPME method, which indicates that our method is competitive. Analytical error estimates are proven and used to select parameters with a great degree of reliability and ease.	ewald summation;simulation	Dag Lindbo;Anna-Karin Tornberg	2011	J. Comput.

The technique also applies to high order accurate finite volume schemes. For the Euler equations with various source terms (e.g., gravity and chemical reactions), it is more difficult to design high order schemes which do not produce negative density or pressure. In this paper, we first show that our framework to construct positivity-preserving high order schemes in [16, 17] can also be applied to Euler equations with a general equation of state. Then we discuss an extension to Euler equations with source terms. Numerical tests of the third order Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) method for Euler equations with different types of source terms are reported.

d9116cbeac969822b9a0299dec6fea6551b9d197	uncertainty propagation in elasto-plastic material		Macroscopically heterogeneous materials, characterised mostly by comparable heterogeneity lengthscale and structural sizes, can no longer be modelled by deterministic approach instead. It is convenient to introduce stochastic approach with uncertain material parameters quantified as random fields and/or random variables. The present contribution is devoted to propagation of these uncertainties in mechanical modelling of inelastic behaviour. In such case the Monte Carlo method is the traditional approach for solving the proposed problem. Nevertheless, convergence rate is relatively slow, thus new methods (e.g. stochastic Galerkin method, stochastic collocation approach, etc.) have been recently developed to offer fast convergence for sufficiently smooth solution in the probability space. Our goal is to accelerate the uncertainty propagation using a polynomial chaos expansion based on stochastic collocation method. The whole concept is demonstrated on a simple numerical example of uniaxial test at a material point where interesting phenomena can be clearly understood.	propagation of uncertainty;software propagation	Jan Sýkora;Anna Kucerová	2014	CoRR		econometrics;mathematical optimization;stochastic optimization;calculus;mathematics;statistics	NLP	95.59288439037985	8.764094923441597	158357

The aim is to determine the wave number which leads to the maximum growth rate of the amplitude of the wave. This requires the solution of a large number of PDE eigenvalue problems. Since we are only interested in a smooth eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue with largest imaginary part, the Jacobi–Davidson method can be applied. Unfortunately, a naive implementation of this method is much too expensive for the large number of problems that have to be solved. In this paper we will present a multilevel approach for the construction of an appropriate initial search space. We will also discuss the efficient solution of the correction equation, and we will show how optimal scaling helps to accelerate the convergence.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;computation;cubic function;image scaling;imaginary time;jacobi method;matrix polynomial;microsoft outlook for mac;numerical analysis;plasma active;simulation;solver;the matrix;time complexity	Marlis Hochbruck;Dominik Löchel	2010	SIAM J.

We first invoke the projection framework with different projections (the so-called natural-i.e. Galerkin-and volume-averaging projections-NP and VAP, respectively) and different basis sets (even monomials and eigenfunctions of the PDE) to arrive at different reduced models, which we then benchmark in a dimensionless frequency-domain setting. Surprisingly, we find that VAP of an even monomial basis yields an unstable reduced model for anything but the lowest order; however, NP yields suitable results for the basis sets and orders considered. Furthermore, we find that the NP-eigenfunction combination makes for a slow convergence when compared to NP with even monomials; however, room for further improvement is seen when compared with a balanced truncation, which is not applicable in the nonlinear setting of concentration-dependent diffusivity.	approximation algorithm;basis function;basis set (chemistry);benchmark (computing);computation;computational complexity theory;condition number;control theory;galerkin method;list of code lyoko episodes;monomial basis;nonlinear system;rate of convergence;simulation;state-space representation;truncation	Christopher G.

We consider the Cauchy problem for a flow on a reducible network; that is, a network represented by a diagraph which is not strongly connected. In particular, such a network can contain sources and sinks. We prove well-posedness of the problem with generalized Kirchhoffu0027s conditions, which allow for amplification and/or reduction of the flow at the nodes, on such reducible networks with sources but show that the problem becomes ill-posed if the network has a sink. Furthermore, we extend the existing results on the asymptotic periodicity of the flow to such networks. In particular, in contrast to previous papers, we consider networks with acyclic parts and we prove that such parts of the network become depleted in a finite time, an estimate of which is also provided. Finally, we show how to apply these results to open networks where a portion of the flowing material is allowed to leave the network.

The solution is in terms of the Bessel function expressed by complex variables. The present solution is suitable for arbitrary bottom configurations described by a power function with two independent parameters. For the case of the paraboloidal shoal, there exists a singular point α 2 which can be removed using Frobenius series, where α is a real constant. The present solution is reduced to Yu and Zhang’s 2003 solution for impermeable circular shoal. The numerical results show some special features of the combined effect of wave refraction and diffraction caused by a porous circular island. The effect of key parameters of the island dimension, the shoal slope, and permeability on wave scattering was discussed based on the analytic solution.

For this stage, we need only few properties about the nonlinear Cauchy problem, namely, local well-posedness for very smooth data.

The method is based on a linear approximation of spatial gradients expressed with the volumetric tensor, which is a 3 × 3 matrix determined by a geometric distribution of the points. The coarse grained gradient can be considered as a low pass filtered gradient, whose cutoff is estimated with the eigenvalues of the volumetric tensor. The present method, the volumetric tensor approximation, is tested for velocity and passive scalar gradients in incompressible planar jet and mixing layer. Comparison with a finite difference approximation on a Cartesian grid shows that the volumetric tensor approximation computes the coarse grained gradients fairly well at a moderate computational cost under various conditions of spatial distributions of points. We also show that imposing the solenoidal condition improves the accuracy of the present method for solenoidal vectors, such as a velocity vector in incompressible flows, especially when the number of the points is not large. The volumetric tensor approximation with 4 points poorly estimates the gradient because of ∗Corresponding author (+81-052-789-3279) Email address: watanabe.tomoaki@c.nagoya-u.jp (Tomoaki Watanabe) Preprint submitted to Journal of Computational Physics August 29, 2017 anisotropic distribution of the points. Increasing the number of points from 4 significantly improves the accuracy. Although the coarse grained gradient changes with the cutoff length, the volumetric tensor approximation yields the coarse grained gradient whose magnitude is close to the one obtained by the finite difference. We also show that the velocity gradient estimated with the present method well captures the turbulence characteristics such as local flow topology, amplification of enstrophy and strain, and energy transfer across scales.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational physics;discriminant;email;emoticon;finite difference;image gradient;linear approximation;low-pass filter;randomness;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;sparse matrix;turbulence;velocity (software development)	Tomoaki Watanabe;Koji Nagata	2017	J.

In particular, we focus on the effect of the downstream boundary condition. For prescribed velocity, it is well known that an instability known as draw resonance occurs at draw ratios in excess of about 20.2. We shall revisit this problem. Using the closed form solution of the differential equation, we shall show that an infinite family of eigenvalues exists and discuss its asymptotics. We also discuss other boundary conditions. If the force in the filament is prescribed, no eigenvalues exist, and the problem is stable at all draw ratios. If the area of the cross section is prescribed downstream, on the other hand, the problem is unstable at any draw ratio. Finally, we discuss the stability when the drawing speed is controlled in response to changes in cross section or force.	boundary case;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;control theory;cross section (geometry);downstream (software development);dual ec drbg;instability;numerical aperture;offset binary;resonance;time complexity;ut-vpn;velocity (software development)	Michael Renardy	2006	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/050634268	closed-form expression;mathematical optimization;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;boundary value problem;calculus;mathematics;cross section;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	86.73444194278757	5.094077058175748	160481

In this work a mixed method and its DG formulation are proposed to solve Naghdi’s equations for a thin linearly elastic shell. The unknowns of the problem are the displacement of the points of the middle surface, the rotation field of the normal vector to the middle surface of the shell and a Lagrange multiplier which is introduced in order to enforce the tangency requirement on the rotation. In addition to existence and uniqueness results of solutions of the continuous and the discrete problems we derive an a priori error estimate. We further propose an a posteriori estimator that yields an upper bound and a lower bound of the error. Numerical tests that validate and illustrate our approach are given.	cartesian closed category;discontinuous galerkin method;displacement mapping;finite element method;lagrange multiplier;normal (geometry)	Serge Nicaise;Ismail Merabet	2017	Math.

It is assumed that the cooling rate is perturbed by a small spatially sinusoidal heat flux at the shell–mold interface. This leads to a corresponding undulation of the solidified shell thickness. Approximate analytical results are obtained for the solid/melt moving interface as a function of time and for the temperature field in the shell. The approximate analytical solution is compared with a numerical solution, and a very good agreement has been found. A limiting analytical solution in which diffusivity of the solidified shell material is assumed to be infinitely large is also obtained, and compared with the numerical predictions to establish the validity of the model and the numerical approach. It is demonstrated that solidified shell materials with higher thermal diffusivities may result in irregular growth of the shell thickness which, generally, causes cracking near the surface. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In one-dimensional form, the literature in the area gives account of the existence of analytical solutions for bothmodels, in the form of traveling-wave fronts boundedwithin an interval I of the real numbers. Motivated by this fact, we propose a finite-difference methodology that guarantees that, under certain analytical conditions on the model and computer parameters, estimates within I will evolve discretely into new estimates which are likewise boundedwithin I . Additionally, we establish the preservation in the discrete domain of the skew-symmetry of the solutions of the models under study. Our computational implementation of the method confirms numerically that the properties of positivity and boundedness are preserved under the analytical constraints derived theoretically. Our simulations show a good agreement between the analytical solutions derived in the present work and the corresponding numerical approximations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The problem is complicated when convection dominates the heat transfer so that the diffusion coefficient is small compared to the convection coefficient. We employ the full flux physics model, which means the model is defined by convection-diffusion equations and the parabolic equations are viewed as a perturbation of the zero diffusion model. We show that by proper formulation of the boundary conditions and employing combined finite element-finite volume schemes one can estimate the small diffusion term. Moreover, by employing constrained optimization one can obtain physically meaningful results. We compare constrained and unconstrained nonlinear least squares approaches. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the ideas and some open questions are discussed.	coefficient;constrained optimization;estimation theory;finite element method;finite volume method;mathematical optimization;non-linear least squares;numerical method;parabolic antenna	John A.

By combining the analytic and numeric stability investigation results we obtain an analytic formula for stability condition. The results of numerical solution of a number of internal and external fluid dynamics problems are presented, which confirm the correctness of the obtained stability condition. It is shown that the incorporation of the artificial dissipation terms into the Runge–Kutta scheme does not impose additional restrictions on time step in cases of smooth flows or flows with weak shocks. In cases of strong shocks, the use of artificial viscosity leads to the reduction of the maximum time step allowed by stability in comparison with the case of the absence of artificial viscosity.	euler;navier–stokes equations;runge–kutta methods	Victor G.

In this method, the equation is first discretized with respect to the spatial variable, transforming the original problem into a set of ordinary differential equations, and then the resulting system is integrated in time by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. Spatial discretization is done by using the Chebyshev pseudospectral collocation method. Before describing the method, we review a finite difference-based method by Salkuyeh [D. Khojasteh Salkuyeh, On the finite difference approximation to the convection–diffusion equation, Appl. Math. Comput. 179 (2006) 79–86], and, contrary to the proposal of the author, we show that this method is not suitable for problems involving time dependent boundary conditions, which calls for revision. Stability analysis based on pseudoeigenvalues to determine the maximum time step for the proposed method is also carried out. Superiority of the proposed method over a revised version of Salkuyeh’s method is verified by numerical examples. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we study thermomechanical behavior of a truss component; namely, a triangular frame consisting of two thin-walled circular beams connected through a joint. Transverse and axial mechanical motions of the beams are coupled though a mechanical joint. The nature of the external solar load suggests a decomposition of the temperature fields in the beams leading to two heat equations for each beam. One of these fields models the circumferential average temperature and is coupled to axial motions of the beam, while the second field accounts for a temperature gradient across the beam and is coupled to beam bending. The resulting system of partial and ordinary differential equations formally describes the coupled thermomechanical behavior of the joint-beam system. The main work is in developing an appropriate state-space form and then using semigroup theory to establish well-posedness and exponential stability.	time complexity	Eugene M. Cliff;B.

It extends the work of [12], where the FOSLL∗ methodology was first introduced. One focus of that paper was to develop FOSLL∗ formulations that allow the use of H1-conforming finite element spaces and optimal multigrid solution techniques to construct L2 approximations of the dependent variables in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. The problems for which this goal was achieved were limited to those with no reaction term and with Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries that were individually connected, that is, each had at most one component. Here, new FOSLL∗ formulations are developed to achieve the same goals on a wider class of problems, including problems with reaction terms, Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries with multiple components, reentrant corners, and points at which Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries meet with an inner angle greater than π/2. The efficiency of the improved FOSLL∗ formulations is illustrated by a series of numerical examples.	approximation;coefficient;definition;dirichlet kernel;duality (optimization);finite element method;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;galerkin method;ll parser;multigrid method;numerical analysis;numerical method;rate of convergence;reentrancy (computing);scalar processor;slack variable;variable (computer science)	Thomas A.

Denoting h the initial discretization parameter, we prove a quasi-optimal rate of convergence like hs−ε for all ε > 0 for an initial data in the Sobolev space W s,p when choosing appropriate initial integration rules and general convolution. As it is well known, this suboptimality is due to the form and width of the convolution kernel. In particular, it can be fixed by computing an additional quantity, the cell deformation. Then one can restore the optimal rate of convergence, up to the first order (s = 1), while keeping the built-in conservative aspect. To avoid these additional computations and move to higher order optimality, another strategy is introduced and analyzed. It is based on a discretization of the solution at initial time by local averages but differs from the usual particle methods: the local averages are viewed as point values of an approximation of the solution, and the regularization of the solution at time t > 0 is performed by interpolation rather than convolution. This strategy allows us to recover optimal error estimates in Lp or Sobolev norms (up to any prescribed order).	approximation;c date and time functions;computation;convolution;discretization;interpolation;matrix regularization;rate of convergence	Albert Cohen;Benoit Perthame	2000	SIAM J.

Assuming smoothness of the solutions, we study the order conditions of such methods. It appears that these conditions are of Runge–Kutta–Nyström type. In the one dimensional case, the order conditions can be further simplified, and efficient methods of order 6 with a reduced number of stages can be constructed. In the general case, high-order methods can also be constructed using explicit computations of commutators. Numerical results are performed and show the benefit of using high-order splitting schemes in that context.

It is shown that the conductivity equation on a 2-D disk is reduced to a couple of ordinary differential equations if the conductivity of the medium is the product of the angle and radius functions. Several important cases are discussed such as circular and a noncircular blob-like medium conductivity. We derive a closed form of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map that gives rise to a new family of symmetric matrices—we call it the magic Toeplitz matrix (a symmetric Toeplitz matrix with the rows and columns summing to the same value). The generalized Ohm’s law on the disk is derived, which relates the vector of the current density to the vector of voltages through the resistance matrix. We demonstrate how a separable Laplace PDE can be applied to electrical impedance tomography and breast cancer detection. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

23c2a96eacf29c683594b0aa0b74e41866fa3821	on the diffuse interface method using a dual-resolution cartesian grid	bubble;two phase flows;dual resolution grid;diffuse interface;droplet;interfacial instability	a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t We investigate the applicability and performance of diffuse interface methods on a dual-resolution grid in solving two-phase flows. In the diffuse interface methods, the interface thickness represents a cutoff length scale in resolving the interfacial dynamics, and it was found that an apparent loss of mass occurs when the interface thickness is comparable to the length scale of flows [24]. From the accuracy and mass conservation point of view, it is desirable to have a thin interface in simulations. We propose to use a dual-resolution Cartesian grid, on which a finer resolution is applied to the volume fraction C than that for the velocity and pressure fields. Because the computation of C field is rather inexpensive compared to that required by velocity and pressure fields, dual-resolution grids can significantly increase the resolution of the interface with only a slight increase of computational cost, as compared to the single-resolution grid. The solution couplings between the fine grid for C and the coarse grid (for velocity and pressure) are delicately designed, to make sure that the interpolated velocity is divergence-free at a discrete level and that the mass and surface tension force are conserved. A variety of numerical tests have been performed to validate the method and check its performance. The dual-resolution grid appears to save nearly 70% of the computational time in two-dimensional simulations and 80% in three-dimensional simulations, and produces nearly the same results as the single-resolution grid. Quantitative comparisons are made with previous studies, including Rayleigh Taylor instability, steadily rising bubble, and partial coalescence of a drop into a pool, and good agreement has been achieved. Finally, results are presented for the deformation and breakup of three-dimensional drops in simple shear flows.	cartesian closed category;coalescing (computer science);computation;computational complexity theory;instability;interpolation;numerical analysis;numerical method;point of view (computer hardware company);rayleigh–ritz method;regular grid;simulation;thickness (graph theory);time complexity;two-phase commit protocol;velocity (software development)	Hang Ding;Cheng-jun Yuan	2014	J.

There are three major technical ingredients in the proposed nonconformal DDM: (a) a true second order transmission condition (SOTC) to enforce fields continuities across domain interfaces; (b) a corner edge penalty term to account for corner edges between neighboring subdomains; and (c) a global plane wave deflation technique to further improve the convergence of DDM for electrically large problems. It has been shown previously that a SOTC, which involves two second order transverse derivatives, facilitates convergence in the conformal domain decomposition method for both propagating and evanescent electromagnetic waves across domain interfaces. However, the discontinuous nature of the cement variables across the corner edges between neighboring subdomains remains troublesome.

The problem is important since temperature governs a variety of geologic processes, including the generation of magmas and the deformation style of rocks. Since the thermal properties of rocks depend strongly on temperature the problem is non-linear.#R##N##R##N#The problem is formulated as an ill-posed operator equation, where the righthand side is the heat-flux at the surface level. Since the problem is ill-posed regularization is needed. In this study we demonstrate that Tikhonov regularization can be implemented efficiently for solving the operator equation. The algorithm is based on having a code for solving a well-posed problem related to the above mentioned operator. The algorithm is designed in such a way that it can deal with both 2D2D and 3D3D calculations.#R##N##R##N#Numerical results, for 2D2D domains, show that the algorithm works well and the inverse problem can be solved accurately with a realistic noise level in the surface data.	matrix regularization;well-posed problem	Fredrik Berntsson;Chen Lin;Tao Xu;Dennis Wokiyi	2017	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2017.04.010	well-posed problem;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	ML	90.09204575223734	8.563960022590292	162500

Magnetic buckling of a welded rod is found to be described by a surprisingly degenerate bifurcation, which is unfolded when both transverse anisotropy of the rod and angular velocity are considered. By solving the linearised equations about the (quasi-) stationary solutions, we find various secondary instabilities.

By constraining the form of the velocity profile across the vessel radius, the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations are reduced to one-dimensional equations governing conservation of mass and momentum. These equations are coupled to a pressure-radius relationship characterizing the elasticity of the vessel wall to describe the transient blood flow through a vessel segment. The two step Lax–Wendroff finite difference method is used to numerically solve these equations. The flow through bifurcations, where three vessel segments join, is governed by the equations of conservation of mass and momentum. The solution to these simultaneous equations is calculated using the multidimensional Newton–Raphson method. Simulations of blood flow through a geometric model of the coronary network are presented demonstrating physiologically realistic flow rates, washout curves, and pressure distributions.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;dots per inch;elasticity (data store);finite difference method;fractal;geometric modeling;lumped element model;navier–stokes equations;newton's method;numerical analysis;radial (radio);tails;velocity (software development)	Andrew J.

The numerical method is a Lie–Trotter splitting in time that is combined with a Fourier collocation in space to a fully discrete method. First-order convergence in time and high-order convergence in space depending on the regularity of the exact solution are shown for this method. The main challenge in the analysis is to exclude a loss of spatial regularity in the numerical solution. This is done by transforming the numerical method to new variables and by imposing a natural CFL-type restriction on the discretization parameters.	collocation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;error analysis (mathematics);first-order predicate;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;sid meier's alpha centauri;symplectic integrator	Ludwig Gauckler	2018	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-017-0942-2	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	ML	88.24104386409036	14.57979191115203	162872

Numerous applications in science and engineering show what a powerful instrument modeling and computing systems such as DAEs are.

We prove that the proposed method preserves the mass and energy conservation laws in semi-discrete formulations. Using the spectral differentiation matrices, the NLS equation is reduced to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The compact implicit integration factor (cIIF) method is later developed for the nonlinear ODEs. In this approach, the storage and CPU cost are significantly reduced such that the use of cIIF method becomes attractive for two-dimensional NLS equation.

With focus on large-scale applications such as monitoring of subsea oil production, CO2 sequestration, and geothermal systems, the proposed solution algorithm is designed to meet challenges related to low parameter sensitivity, nonuniqueness of the inverse solutions, nonlinearity in the mapping from the data to the parameter space, and costly numerical simulations. Motivated by earlier investigations on the relation between sensitivity, nonlinearity and scale, the proposed solution approach is based on a reduced, composite parameter representation. Though a reduced representation restricts the solution space, flexibility with respect to which parameter functions that can be represented is obtained by facilitating the estimation of the structure and smoothness of the representation itself. Moreover, the resolution of the parameter function is detached from the computational grid and determined as part of the estimation. The performance of the proposed solution algorithm is illustrated through numerical examples for identification of underground electric conductivity changes from time-lapse electromagnetic observations.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;coefficient;interpolation;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;refinement (computing);repeatability;self-information	Inga Berre;Martha Lien;Trond Mannseth	2011	J.

The method is based on the solution, at each interface between two control volumes, of the nonlinear elliptic two point boundary value problem (qf (v) + (φ(v))′)′ = 0 with Dirichlet boundary conditions given by the values of the discrete approximation in both control volumes. We prove the existence of a solution to this two point boundary value problem. We show that the expression for the numerical flux can be yielded without referring to this solution. Furthermore, we prove that the so designed finite volume scheme has the expected stability properties and that its solution converges to the weak solution of the continuous problem. Numerical results show the increase of accuracy due to the use of this scheme, compared to some other schemes.

The two methods applied for computing this matrix, which are compared in this study, are the boundary element method (BEM) and the finite element method (FEM). The performance of both methods using a spherical model was investigated. For a comparable discretization level, the BEM yields smaller relative errors compared to analytical solutions. The BEM needs less computation time, but a larger amount of memory. Inversely calculated myocardial activation times using either the FEM or BEM computed lead field matrices give similar activation time patterns. The FEM, however, is also capable of considering anisotropic conductivities. This property might have an impact for future development, when also individual myocardial fiber architecture can be considered in the inverse formulation.

We solve a sequence of charge systems based on the harmonic function theory and the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for designing the map with boundary and feature constraints. Compared to the previous harmonic volumetric mapping computation using MFS, this new scheme is more efficient and accurate, and can support feature alignment and adaptive refinement. Our harmonic volumetric mapping paradigm is therefore more effective for practical shape modeling applications and can handle heterogeneous volumetric data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this new framework on handling volumetric data with heterogeneous structure and nontrivial topological types.

47ba1af1d08bf0341b92a09c9803c923c973145b	high-order commutator-free quasi-magnus exponential integrators for non-autonomous linear evolution equations		The class of commutator-free quasi-Magnus (CFQM) exponential integrators provides a favourable alternative to standard Magnus integrators, in particular for large-scale applications arising in the time integration of non-autonomous linear evolution equations. The schemes are given by compositions of several exponentials that comprise certain linear combinations of the values of the defining operator at specified nodes. Due to the fact that previously proposed CFQM exponential integrators of order five or higher involve negative coefficients in the linear combinations, severe instabilities are observed for spatially semi-discretised parabolic equations or for master equations describing dissipative quantum systems. In order to remedy this issue, two different approaches for the design of efficient time integrators of orders four, five, and six are pursued: (i) the study of CFQM exponential integrators involving complex coefficients that satisfy a positivity condition, and (ii) the study of unconventional methods in the sense that an additional exponential involving a commutator of higher order with respect to the time stepsize occurs. Numerical experiments confirm that the identified novel time integrators are superior to other integrators of the same family previously proposed in the literature.	autonomous robot;coefficient;discretization;experiment;exponential integrator;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;parabolic antenna;quantum system;semiconductor industry;time complexity	Sergio Blanes;Fernando Casas;Mechthild Thalhammer	2017	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2017.07.016	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;schrödinger equation;mathematics;magnus expansion;exponential integrator;variational integrator;linear combination;master equation;exponential function;parabolic partial differential equation	SE	82.92530551465984	9.990563798519638	164160

Maxwell’s equations are written into a first-order differential (in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$z$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) equation concerning the transverse electric and magnetic field components in the spectral domain. The equation can be solved to obtain the EM fields in a homogeneous anisotropic medium. For fields in layered anisotropic media, the local transmission and reflection matrices, the global reflection matrices, and the recursion relations of the wave amplitudes at interfaces are derived and used to express the EM fields in arbitrary layers. The electric and magnetic dipole sources can locate in arbitrary layers, and the medium can have both full-tensor magnetic and dielectric anisotropy. The singular behavior of the solution in the close vicinity of the dipole source is subtracted to make the integrands decay rapidly as functions of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k_{x}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k_{y}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. The contributions of the subtracted part are calculated analytically. A three-layer anisotropic medium is modeled to show the convergence of the integrals with the singularity subtraction. To validate the algorithm for multilayered generalized anisotropic media, a five-layer medium is modeled and compared with finite element method results. The algorithm is also applied in geophysical EM well logging by modeling the triaxial induction logging tool. The responses in vertical and deviated wells are computed and compared with finite element results. The good agreement between the two results further validates the algorithm and demonstrates its capability to model induction logging tools in multilayered generalized anisotropic media."""	algorithm;converge;data logger;finite element method;first-order predicate;login;maxwell (microarchitecture);multitier architecture;recursion;solver;spectral method;system of linear equations;technological singularity;transverse wave	Yunyun Hu;Yuan Yi Fang;Dezhi Wang;Yu Zhong;Qing Huo Liu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2018.2825430	artificial intelligence;mathematical analysis;electromagnetic radiation;mathematics;computer vision;dipole;finite element method;magnetic field;dielectric;matrix (mathematics);magnetic dipole;magnetic domain	Visualization	90.13249179764254	6.562392562263818	164573

One goal is to simplify the analysis of large dielectric targets with translational symmetries taken advantage of their Toeplitz symmetry. Then, the matrix-fill stage of the Method of Moments is efficiently obtained because the number of coupling terms to compute is reduced. The Multilevel Fast Multipole Method is applied to solve the problem. Structured meshes are obtained efficiently for approximate the dielectric volumes. The regular mesh grid is achieved by using parallelepipeds whose centres have been identified as internal to the target. The ray casting algorithm is used to classify the parallelepiped centres. It may become a bottleneck when too many points are evaluated in volumes defined by parametric surfaces, so a hierarchical algorithm is proposed to minimize the number of evaluations. Measurements and analytical results are included for validation purposes.	algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;computation;cube;cuboid;multilevel fast multipole method;point in polygon;polygon mesh;ray casting;revision control system;simulation;the matrix;toeplitz hash algorithm;translational research informatics	Javier Moreno Garrido;Álvaro Somolinos;Gabriel A.

The solution depends on two arbitrary analytical vector functions and is analytical everywhere except a certain domain of the independent variables in which one of the arbitrary vector functions satisfies a simple explicitly given algebraic relation. As our main theoretical result, in addition to the construction of the solution, we proof its generality. Based on this observation, a hybrid semi-analytical solver for highly viscous two-way coupled fluid-rod problems is developed which allows for the interactive high-fidelity simulations of flagellated microswimmers as a result of a substantial reduction of the numerical stiffness.	elastic net regularization;linear algebra;numerical analysis;numerical method;semiconductor industry;simulation;solver	Dominik Ludewig Michels;Dmitry A.

A multidimensional model includes dimensions that are composed of levels. The levels of a dimension are organized in a hierarchy,e.g., salespersons are grouped into stores. Throughout its lifespan a member (instance) of a level can be associated with several members of a higher level of the hierarchy, e.g., the salespersons can rotate between the stores. This succession of associations enables the formulation of queries such as ”How much did a salesperson sell in his n–th season (stay) in the store X?” In this paper, we enrich this type of query, known as season queries, with spatial features. This enhancement enables the formulation of queries such as: “How much did a salesperson sell in his n–th season in a given geographic region?” (A region that covers a set of stores.) In order to facilitate the formulation of this type of query, we propose an operator called Spatial Season and present its formal specification.	algorithmic efficiency;co-simulation;code;computation;finite difference;finite volume method;invariant (computer science);numerical analysis;simulation	J.

To make the application of the finite element method practical in semiconductor device simulation, we have applied the Scharfetter-Gummel (S-G) scheme in conjunction with an accurate seven-point Gaussian Quadrature rule to the assembly of the finite-element stiffness matrices and right-hand side vector of the semiconductor equations, which has resulted in solutions with high accuracy even on coarse mesh as well as a significant speedup of convergence rate. I . INTRODUCTION HE Scharfetter-Gummel scheme [ 11 has been widely T used in the discretization of the continuity equations and has shown great suitability due to an inherent advantage of uniform convergence. However, to date the applications have been almost restricted to the finite difference method or its variants. The classical finite element method, by which the carrier densities are usually approximated in low order polynomial expansions [2], requires an excessively fine finite element mesh in order to achieve a reasonable approximation error. Additionally, it suffers a prohibitive convergence rate because of the large integration errors incurred due to the inaccurate low order polynomial approximations. Therefore, the classical finite element method is inferior to its finite difference counterpart employing the Scharfetter-Gummel (S-G) scheme in which the functional variation of carrier densities is exponential in nature, the so-called Box Integration Method (BIM-SG) [3], in the treatment of current continuity equations.

Recently, various upwind schemes [4] have been proposed for finite difference and finite element to achieve the upwind effect in order to avoid the spurious oscillation in solving the convection dominated flow equations. In essence, the optimal upwind formulation in one-dimensional case (without source terms) can reduce to a form equivalent to the S-G scheme. Nevertheless the flow direction not always being along the grid line, it is difficult to extend these formulations to two or three dimensions in a straightforward manner [ 5 ] . A simple and feasible finite element method consistent with the exponentially fitted scheme has not been developed for two-dimensional problems. In order to further exploit the promising usefulness of the S-G scheme in the finite-element method, we have developed in our generalpurpose two-dimensional Semiconductor Device Analysis program (SDA-1) a simple and accurate finite element discretization method (FEM-QSG), where the S-G scheme is embedded in the quadrature of finite element assembly of Poisson equation and continuity equations. The new method not only avoids the problem of flux direction in the discretization of flow term, but also extends the application of the S-G scheme to the discretization of source term in a consistent way. In Section 11, the basic governing equations in SDA-1 and the classical finite element discretization method are reviewed. Next, a new finite element discretization method employing the S-G scheme is presented in Section 111. In Section IV, some typical simulation results are discussed and are compared with the results obtained by the classical finite element method. 11. FORMULATION OF BASIC EQUATIONS In order to devise a general-purpose device simulator, which is capable of simulating various device structures including homojunctions and heterojunctions with arbitrary geometries under any operation condition, we based our analysis on a macroscopic description of semiconductors. In accordance with the quasi-Fermi level concept and in terms of normalized variables, the basic semiconductor equations governing device's operation with ($, U , U ) ( v = e-'"""", w = e'p) as dependent variables are the following [61, [71: v * (EV$) = ( n p N ; + N , ) (1) 0278-0070/89/0500-0468$0 1 .OO O 1989 IEEE TAN er a l . : DEVICE ANALYSIS BY S-G SCHEME 469"""	approximation algorithm;approximation error;basic;bim;computer engineering;discretization;electrical engineering;embedded system;finite difference method;finite element method;gaussian quadrature;general-purpose modeling;heterojunction;jolla;ku band;linear algebra;os-tan;polynomial;rate of convergence;scott continuity;semiconductor device modeling;simulation;speedup;suicidegirls;time complexity;upwind scheme	Gen-Lin Tan;Xiao-Li Yuan;Qi-Ming Zhang;Walter H.

The method, herein referred to as the bin integral method with Gauss quadrature (BIMGQ), makes use of two binwise moments, namely, the number and mass concentration in each bin. These two degrees of freedom define an extended linear representation of the number density distribution for each bin following Enukashvily (1980). Unlike previous moment-based methods in which the gain and loss integrals are evaluated for a target bin, the concept of source–bin pair interactions is used to transfer bin moments from source bins to target bins. Collection kernels are treated by bilinear interpolations. All binwise interaction integrals are then handled exactly by Gauss quadrature of various orders. In essence the method combines favorable features in previous spectral moment-based and bin-based pair-interaction (or flux) methods to greatly enhance the logic, consistency, and simplicity in the numerical method and its implementation. Quantitative measures are developed to rigorously examine the accuracy and convergence properties of BIMGQ for both the Golovin kernel and hydrodynamic kernels. It is shown that BIMGQ has a superior accuracy for the Golovin kernel and a monotonic convergence behavior for hydrodynamic kernels. Direct comparisons are also made with the method of Berry and Reinhardt (1974), the linear flux method of Bott (1998), and the linear discrete method of Simmel et al. (2002). 2007 Elsevier Inc.

High resolution characterizations of the mechanical properties of subsurface formations are essential for improving modeling predictions. Such detailed descriptions impose severe computational challenges and motivate the development of multiscale solution strategies. We propose a multiscale solution framework for the geomechanical equilibrium problem of heterogeneous porous media based on the finite-element method. After imposing a coarse-scale grid on the given fine-scale problem, the coarse-scale basis functions are obtained by solving local equilibrium problems within coarse elements. These basis functions form the restriction and prolongation operators used to obtain the coarse-scale system for the displacement-vector. Then, a two-stage preconditioner that couples the multiscale system with a smoother is derived for the iterative solution of the fine-scale linear system. Various numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the method.	finite element method	Nicola Castelletto;Hadi Hajibeygi;Hamdi A. Tchelepi	2017	J. Comput.

6eb419ffa25d3a192b094d9581abac51f9a2a711	cbs constants & their role in error estimation for stochastic galerkin finite element methods		Stochastic Galerkin finite element methods (SGFEMs) are commonly used to approximate solutions to PDEs with random inputs. However, the study of a posteriori error estimation strategies to drive adaptive enrichment of the associated tensor product spaces is still in its infancy. In this work, we revisit an error estimator introduced in [A. Bespalov, D. Silvester, Efficient adaptive stochastic Galerkin methods for parametric operator equations, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 38(4), 2016] for SGFEM approximations of the parametric reformulation of the stochastic diffusion problem. We show that the proven bound for that error estimator can be derived using classical theory that is well known for determinstic Galerkin FEMs. A key issue is that the bound involves a CBS (Cauchy-Buniakowskii-Schwarz) constant. If the approximation spaces associated with the parameter domain are orthogonal, then this CBS constant only depends on a pair of finite element spaces H1, H2 and their compatibility with respect to an inner product associated with a parameter-free problem. For fixed choices of H2, we investigate non-standard choices of H2 and the associated CBS constants, with the aim of designing efficient error estimators. When H1 and H2 satisfy certain conditions, we also prove theoretical estimates for the CBS constant using a novel linear algebra approach. Our results are also applicable to the design of adaptive finite element schemes for deterministic PDEs.	finite element method;galerkin method	Adam J. Crowder;Catherine Elizabeth Powell	2018	J. Sci.

This challenge requires to place optical elements (e.g., mirrors, lenses) and to steer light beams with subnanometer precision. Existing methods for beam direction computing in resonators, e.g., iterative ray tracing or generalized ray transfer matrices, are either computationally expensive or rely on overparameterized models of optical elements. By exploiting Fermat’s principle, we develop a novel method to compute the steady-state beam configurations in resonant optical cavities formed by spherical mirrors, as a function of mirror positions and curvature radii. The proposed procedure is based on the geometric Newton method on matrix manifold, a tool with second-order convergence rate, that relies on a second-order model of the cavity optical length.

This extends previous results where the same scheme was applied to the prime and to the adjoint equation. This extends previously known results where the same discretization scheme is applied to the primal and to the adjoint equation.	optimal control;runge–kutta methods	Nedka Pulova	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-78827-0_40	mathematical optimization;adjoint equation;mathematical analysis;optimal control;calculus;mathematics	Robotics	87.34083293533507	14.24759636254952	165999

We provide a construction of optimal schemes, based on the classical Euler scheme, which asymptotically attain the established minimal errors. It turns out that methods based on nonequidistant mesh are more efficient than those based on the equidistant mesh.	algorithm;approximation;euler method;polygon mesh;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);utility functions on indivisible goods	Pawel Przybylowicz	2016	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-016-0097-8	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;compound poisson process	ML	88.55755795893431	17.98741929978135	166367
0b2b698c028098f4066fc71e35539f0e686ba3ee	recent advances of isogeometric analysis in computational electromagnetics		In this communication the advantages and drawbacks of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) are reviewed in the context of electromagnetic simulations. IGA extends the set of polynomial basis functions, commonly employed by the classical Finite Element Method (FEM). While identical to FEM with Nédélec’s basis functions in the lowest order case, it is based on B-spline and NonUniform Rational B-spline basis functions. The main benefit of this is the exact representation of the geometry in the language of computer aided design (CAD) tools. This simplifies the meshing as the computational mesh is implicitly created by the engineer using the CAD tool. The curland div-conforming spline function spaces are recapitulated and the available software is discussed. Finally, several non-academic benchmark examples in two and three dimensions are shown which are used in optimization and uncertainty quantification workflows.	b-spline;basis function;benchmark (computing);boundary element method;computation;computational electromagnetics;computer-aided design;finite element method;fluid animation;in-game advertising;isogeometric analysis;mathematical optimization;polynomial basis;shape optimization;simulation;span and div;spline (mathematics);uncertainty quantification	Zeger Bontinck;Jacopo Corno;Herbert De Gersem;Stefan Kurz;Andreas Pels;Sebastian Schöps;Felix Wolf;Carlo de Falco;Jürgen Dölz;Rafael Vázquez;Ulrich Römer	2017	CoRR		isogeometric analysis;uncertainty quantification;mathematical optimization;mathematics;computer aided design;computational electromagnetics;finite element method;basis function;polynomial basis;spline (mathematics)	EDA	95.51064375374439	10.99258667168481	166504

The modified cubic-B-spline basis functions are used in differential quadrature to determine the weighting coefficients. The MCB-DQM is used in space, and the optimal four-stage, order three strong stability-preserving time-stepping Runge–Kutta (SSP-RK43) scheme is used in time for solving the resulting system of ordinary differential equations. To check the efficiency and accuracy of the method, four examples of Burgers’ equation are included with their numerical solutions, L2 and L1 errors and comparisons are done with the results given in the literature. The proposed method produces better results as compared to the results obtained by almost all the schemes available in the literature, and approaching to the exact solutions. The presented method is seen to be easy, powerful, efficient and economical to implement as compared to the existing techniques for finding the numerical solutions for various kinds of linear/nonlinear physical models. 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Strong stability preserving (SSP) high order time discretizations will keep the maximum principle. It is straightforward to extend the method to two and higher dimensions on rectangular meshes. We also show that the same limiter can preserve the maximum principle for DG or finite volume schemes solving two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in the vorticity stream-function formulation, or any passive convection equation with an incompressible velocity field.

8695645ccf20345bbee4cf7f6eb53a849d2787ac	exponential integrator methods for systems of non-linear space-fractional models with super-diffusion processes in pattern formation		Abstract Nonlocality and spatial heterogeneity of many practical systems have made fractional differential equations very useful tools in Science and Engineering. However, solving these type of models is computationally demanding. In this paper, we propose an exponential integrator method for space fractional models as an attractive and easy-to-code alternative for other existing second-order exponential integrator methods. This scheme is based on using a real distinct poles discretization for the underlying matrix exponentials. One of the major benefits of the proposed scheme is that the algorithm could be easily implemented in parallel to take advantage of multiple processors for increased computational efficiency. The scheme is established to be second-order convergent; and proven to be robust for nonlinear space fractional reaction–diffusion problems involving non-smooth initial data. Our approach is exhibited by solving a system of two-dimensional problems which exhibits pattern formation and has applications in cell-division. Empirically, super-diffusion processes are displayed by investigating the effect of the fractional power of the underlying Laplacian operator on the pattern formation found in these models. Furthermore, the superiority of our method over competing second order ETD schemes, BDF2 scheme, and IMEX schemes is demonstrated.	exponential integrator;nonlinear system;pattern formation	Olaniyi Samuel Iyiola;Bruce A.

This grid must be sufficiently large and fine to describe the distribution functions at every space position in the computational domain. For 3-dimensional hypersonic flows, like in re-entry problems, this induces much too dense velocity grids that cannot be practically used, for memory storage requirements. In this article, we present an approach to generate automatically a locally refined velocity grid adapted to a given simulation. This grid contains much less points than a standard Cartesian grid and allows us to make realistic 3-dimensional simulations at a reduced cost, with a comparable accuracy.	approximation;computation;reduced cost;regular grid;requirement;simulation;stationary process;velocity (software development)	C.

The numerical method again consists in implementing a spectral expansion of the amplitude in terms of a number of Chebyshev polynomials. The method is applied to a Morse-type potential, for energies in a resonance region, and for one energy below the resonance region, and a strong repulsive Coulomb potential. The results are compared with highly accurate direct solutions of the Schrodinger equation, and were found to be accurate to   1  :  1    0    −  6    .	tunneling protocol	George Rawitscher	2016	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2016.02.027	mathematics;quantum electrodynamics;quantum mechanics	Theory	88.99360775844488	7.605087243088561	167411

The three level operator finite difference schemes on nonuniform on time grids in llilbert spaces of finite dimension are consid­ ered. A priori estimates for uniform stability on the initial conditions are received under natural assumptions on operators and non uniform time grids. The results obtained here are applied to study stability o f the three levels weighted schemes of second order approximation О (/i2 + r „ ) for some hyperbolic and parabolic equations of the second order. It is es­ sential to note that the schemes of raised order of approximation are constructed here on standard stencils which are used in finite difference approximation techniques.	finite difference method;initial condition;order of approximation;parabolic antenna	Piotr P.

These representations have the advantage that the integrands of the integral operators have a reduced singular behaviour allowing one to choose the order of the numerical approximations much lower than for the classical formulations. Low-order discretisations for the single layer integral equations as well as for the classical double layer potential and the hypersingular integral equation are considered. We will present fully discrete Galerkin boundary element methods where the storage amount and the CPU time grow only linearly with respect to the number of unknowns.	approximation;boundary element method;central processing unit;cluster analysis;galerkin method;numerical analysis;numerical integration	Steffen Börm;Stefan A.

Most of these applications have no analytical solutions and need to be solved numerically, often an extremely challenging task. This paper offers an efficient multigrid/multiscale solver for the one-dimensional Schrödinger eigenvalue problem, a preliminary step toward developing solvers to application-rich two-dimensional problems. The solver employs a gradual multiscale eigenbasis representation that allows calculation and storage of only a small number of eigenfunction representatives on the expensive finest grids and a full eigenbasis representation and calculation on the coarsest grids. This structure not only allows calculation and storage of the entire eigenbasis in O(N logN) operations, but it is also beneficial for many applications. The algorithms will be eventually adapted for solving the Schrödinger equation as it appears in the Kohn–Sham formulation for calculating electronic structure, though in this paper the nonlinearity of the problem (dependence of potentials on low eigenfunctions) is not discussed.	algorithm;electronic structure;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);kohn–sham equations;multigrid method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;schrödinger;solver	Irene Livshits	2008	SIAM J.

The proposed scheme evolves a nonoscillatory numerical solution on a single grid, avoids the time consuming process of solving Riemann problems arising at the cell interfaces, and is second-order accurate both in time and space. Furthermore, the numerical scheme follows a well-balanced discretization that first discretizes the gravitational source term according to the discretization of the flux terms, and then mimics the surface gradient method and discretizes the density and energy according to the discretization of steady state density and energy functions, respectively. Finally, several numerical experiments demonstrating the performance of the well-balanced schemes in both one and two spatial dimensions are presented. The results indicate that the new scheme is accurate, simple, and robust.	euler	R. Touma;Ujjwal Koley;Christian Klingenberg	2016	SIAM J.

d0ad4ec07ae47b41f471b49f943b91d0b1031e73	an implicit method for numerical solution of singular and stiff initial value problems		An implicit method has been presented for solving singular initial value problems. The method is simple and gives more accurate solution than the implicit Euler method as well as the second order implicit Runge-Kutta (RK2) (i.e., implicit midpoint rule) method for some particular singular problems. Diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) method is suitable for solving stiff problems. But, the derivation as well as utilization of this method is laborious. Sometimes it gives almost similar solution to the two-stage third order diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK3) method and the five-stage fifth order diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK5) method. The advantage of the present method is that it is used with less computational effort.	explicit and implicit methods;numerical partial differential equations	Mohammad Kamrul Hasan;M. Suzan Ahamed;Md.

The domain where we state our problem is the intersection of a polyhedron with the exterior of a strictly contained obstacle with smooth boundary. The solution is then decoupled as a sum of an incident flow, defined on the polyhedron domain plus the response of the interior obstacle expressed as a single layer potential and constructed only on the exterior of the obstacle. The numerical algorithm follows closely this ansatz by replacing the continuous terms of this decomposition by a finite and a boundary element respectively. We prove that, under not very restrictive assumptions, the method is well defined and converges to the exact solution with the same order as the best approximation of the solution by the discrete spaces in the natural norms of the problem. Finally, in the last section we show how this method can be implemented, overcoming some of the difficulties appearing in the implementation, and demonstrating its applicability to practical problems.	algorithm;approximation;boundary element method;finite element method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;polyhedron	Víctor Domínguez;Francisco-Javier Sayas	2006	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2006.04.031	mathematical analysis;applied mathematics;finite element method;calculus;mathematics;geometry	Theory	87.89783200615244	8.572796103076588	168346

This paper examines the effects of pertinent parameters such as theRayleighnumber, the solid volume fraction, the heat source location, and the enclosure apex angle on the thermal performance of the enclosure. The thermal performance of the enclosure is improved with an increase in the Rayleigh number and solid volume fraction. The results also show that the variation of heat transfer rate with respect to the enclosure apex angle and heat source position and dimensions is different at low and high Rayleigh numbers. A comparison is also presented between the results obtained from the modified and original Maxwell models. The results show that the heat transfer is generally higher based on the modified Maxwell model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This set of formulas is derived on the basis of the generalized reflection and transmission coefficients. By expressing our new formulas by the ratios of Bessel or Hankel functions, rather than directly by these special functions, the notorious overflow problem for numerical computation is successfully obviated. Our formulas can be easily implemented for any number of layers, as well as for arbitrary locations and orientations of the transmitter and the receiver. Numerical experiments have demonstrated their correctness and stability. They are then utilized to investigate the influence of the eccentricity distance, the eccentricity angle, and the formation anisotropy on the response of a multicomponent induction logging tool.	bessel filter;computation;correctness (computer science);data logger;distance (graph theory);experiment;numerical analysis;reflection coefficient;transmitter	Decheng Hong;Wei-Feng Huang;Qing Huo Liu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2582535	magnetoresistance;transmitter;magnetic domain;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	90.30036929128015	6.354634551604174	168831

However, although the theory in principle applies to lumped as well as distributed parameter processes, it is in practice necessary to reduce the order of distributed (PDE) models prior to application of the theory. In this paper we consider the problem of determining an appropriate model reduction method for this task. We first show that simply applying some ad hoc discretization method, such as finite differences or finite elements, can result in spurious bifurcations and erroneous predictions of stability. To avoid this problem we propose a method for estimating the error introduced by the model reduction. Apart from simply providing a label of confidence in the obtained results, the estimated error can be used to improve the model reduction. We here propose a method based on moving the discretization mesh such as to spatially equidistribute the total error. The method is applied to the analysis of a heat-integrated fixed bed reactor.	bifurcation theory;computation;computational mathematics;continuation;discretization;finite difference;finite element method;hoc (programming language);nicolas jacobsen;nonlinear system;orthogonal collocation;process architecture;r language;reactor (software);springer (tank)	Yi Liu;Elling W.

We consider in this paper an open channel represented by the SaintVenant equations linearized around a non uniform steady flow regime. We use a frequency domain approach to fully characterize the open channel flow dynamics. The use of the Laplace transform enables us to derive the distributed transfer matrix, linking the boundary inputs to the state of the system. The poles of the system are then computed analytically, and each transfer function is decomposed in a series of eigenfunctions, where the influence of space and time variables can be decoupled. As a result, we can express the time-domain response of the whole canal pool to boundary inputs in terms of discharges. This study is first done in the uniform case, and finally extended to the non uniform case. The solution is studied and illustrated on two different canal pools.	complex dynamics;normal mode;transfer function;transfer matrix	Xavier Litrico;Vincent Fromion	2009	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2009.4.325	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;control theory;mathematics;shallow water equations;thermodynamics;physics	Robotics	86.9760774838999	7.442697023194413	169319

These methods are proven, both theoretically and numerically, to be of infinite order of accuracy. This infinite order is achieved if the solution is very regular. On the other hand, the Gibbs phenomenon prevents – a priori – the good convergence if the solution is discontinuous. Nevertheless, for systems of conservation laws, the spectral vanishing viscosity method leads to numerical solutions that are “spectrally” close to the projection of the exact solution on the set of polynomials. The idea is then to postprocess the numerical solution in order to extract pertinent physical information. The aim of this paper is to propose and analyse such a postprocessing method based on rational approximants that allows to circumvent the Gibbs phenomenon and can be used as an acceleration device for spectral numerical solution.	approximation;approximation theory;coefficient;computation;discretization;jacobi method;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;order of accuracy;physical information;polynomial;polynomial basis;rate of convergence;recursion;relevance;stellar classification	L.

Since the nodes are independent of the integral mesh, it is more suitable for the analysis of seepage with a free surface than the finite element method. In addition, its shape functions satisfy the Kronecker δ conditions, therefore, its boundary conditions can be dealt with much easily than those of such meshless method as element-free Galerkin method (EFGM). In this paper, the NEM was used in the seepage analysis of dams. The initial free surface was assumed first in the calculations, and the location of the free surface was adjusted according to the calculation results. The examples showed that the natural element method lead to satisfactory results.	nem (cryptocurrency)	Yu-xin Jie;Li-zhen Liu;Wen-jie Xu;Guang-xin Li	2013	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2013.03.006	mathematical optimization;regularized meshless method;voronoi diagram;soil mechanics;calculus;mathematics;geometry;free surface	Robotics	89.11868541066589	8.625247824581391	169750

6d4b4be75f3781dc183f01867a7112297003f500	model-free data-driven inelasticity		We extend the Data-Driven formulation of problems in elasticity of Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz [1] to inelasticity. This extension differs fundamentally from Data-Driven problems in elasticity in that the material data set evolves in time as a consequence of the history dependence of the material. We investigate three representational paradigms for the evolving material data sets: i) materials with memory, i. e., conditioning the material data set to the past history of deformation; ii) differential materials, i. e., conditioning the material data set to short histories of stress and strain; and iii) history variables, i. e., conditioning the material data set to ad hoc variables encoding partial information about the history of stress and strain. We also consider combinations of the three paradigms thereof and investigate their ability to represent the evolving data sets of different classes of inelastic materials, including viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity and plasticity. We present selected numerical examples that demonstrate the range and scope of Data-Driven inelasticity and the numerical performance of implementations thereof.	elasticity (data store);hoc (programming language);numerical analysis	Robert Eggersmann;Trenton Kirchdoerfer;Stefanie Reese;Laurent Stainier;Michael Ortiz	2018	CoRR		deformation (mechanics);viscoelasticity;mathematical optimization;mathematics;conditioning;plasticity;viscoplasticity;elasticity (economics);stress–strain curve;data set	ML	95.951027752095	9.855820927905397	170043

Two types of methods, namely height-function based and parameterization based polynomial fittings, are well founded mathematically and can be proven to deliver convergent results under reasonable assumptions. However, the numerical behaviors of these methods can differ drastically in practice, and no systematic analysis and comparison have been reported previously for these methods. In this paper, we describe a unified framework for these methods based on weighted least squares approximations, and on top of this framework we compare a number of methods in terms of numerical accuracy and stability as well as runtime efficiency and robustness through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Our analysis shows that the choice of parameterization and numerical solver for the least squares problem can have significant impact on the accuracy and stability of polynomial fittings. In addition, we show that the methods based on local orthogonal projection with a safeguard against folding delivers the best combination of simplicity, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.	approximation;computation;computer-aided design;experiment;geometric modeling;least squares;numerical analysis;polynomial;solver;unified framework	Duo Wang;Bryan Clark;Xiangmin Jiao	2009	Computer Aided Geometric Design	10.1016/j.cagd.2009.02.006	discrete geometry;parametrization;combinatorics;polynomial interpolation;computer aided design;calculus;mathematics;geometry;curvature;numerical stability;statistics;robustness	EDA	96.50028282391172	12.927654662033	170629
e44c4dd2c97979e863c9bd32a28347576ee1d4bd	blending modified gaussian closure and non-gaussian reduced subspace methods for turbulent dynamical systems	uncertainty quantification in reduced order subspaces;blended stochastic methods;modified quasilinear gaussian closure;dynamical orthogonality	Turbulent dynamical systems are characterized by persistent instabilities which are balanced by nonlinear dynamics that continuously transfer energy to the stable modes. To model this complex statistical equilibrium in the context of uncertainty quantification all dynamical components (unstable modes, nonlinear energy transfers, and stable modes) are equally crucial. Thus, order-reduction methods present important limitations. On the other hand uncertainty quantification methods based on the tuning of the non-linear energy fluxes using steady state information (such as the modified quasilinear Gaussian (MQG) closure) may present discrepancies in extreme excitation scenarios. In this paper we derive a blended framework that links inexpensive second-order uncertainty quantification schemes that model the full space (such as MQG) with high order statistical models in specific reduced-order subspaces. The coupling occurs in the energy transfer level by i) correcting the nonlinear energy fluxes in the full space using reduced subspace statistics, and ii) by modifying the reduced-order equations in the subspace using information from the full space model. The results are illustrated in two strongly unstable systems under extreme excitations. The blended method allows for the correct prediction of the second-order statistics in the full space and also the correct modeling of the higher-order statistics in reduced-order subspaces.	alpha compositing;approximation algorithm;control theory;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;dri;dynamical system;email;ibm notes;interaction;nonlinear system;rare events;statistical model;steady state;turbulence;uncertainty quantification	Themistoklis P.

The method is based on a spatiotemporal decomposition that makes use of any conventional spatial and temporal discretization schemes, and is applicable to either explicit or implicit time-integration. In the case of spatially localized source terms, the decomposition allows severe truncation of the resulting algebraic system. The technique and its variations are introduced in the context of the magnetohydrodynamical dynamo equations describing the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of the sun and stars, but they are of more general applicability. We offer a few examples showing the usefulness of this technique in the solar dynamo context, not only for the computation of numerical solutions per se, but also as an analysis tool to better understand the behavior of the solutions on long temporal scales. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The smoothing process is modeled using the heat transfer process. We start from the global equation of heat conservation and we decompose it into basic laws. The numerical scheme is derived directly from the discretization of the basic heat transfer laws using computation algebraic topological tools, thus providing a physical and topological explanation for each step of the discretization process. In such a way, the geometry, topology and physics are concurring together in a unified framework to define and simulate the diffusion process to reduce random noise on the surface of the object. Experimental results show a good performance in improvement of the proposed approach compared to existing smoothing methods.	computation;discretization;linear algebra;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;polygon mesh;simulation;smoothing;unified framework	Ahmed Fouad El Ouafdi;Djemel Ziou	2014	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-014-0922-9	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;geometry;anisotropic diffusion;smoothing	Vision	95.46460029672022	11.378333272342685	171109

For many thick prisms, emerging light rays are obscured at a boundary. The purpose of this paper is to show that particular light ray deviations can be approximated by polynomials of varying degree over a domain of incident angles. The angles of deviation depend on the apex angle, the direction of incidence with respect to the prism, and the material of the prism. For a prism in air, the incident direction is allowed to vary for a chosen range of apex angles. For each apex angle value and each incident direction, the corresponding ray deviation values are calculated. The theoretical equations for the extremes of angular deviation are nonlinear and awkward to use. Because of their ease of application and goodness of fit, polynomials of varying degree and nature are chosen to approximate these nonlinear equations. Graphical comparisons are made between these approximating polynomial equations and the corresponding exact nonlinear extrema of angular deviation equations. We show that these cumbersome nonlinear equations can very confidently be replaced by their much simpler specific polynomial least-squares approximating equations. The most accurate and easily computed of these approximating equations can then more readily be used in further computations. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An error analysis is made between the numerical wavenumber and the exact wavenumber, and a refined choice strategy based on minimizing the numerical dispersion is proposed for choosing weight parameters. A full-coarsening multigrid-based preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB method is developed for solving the linear system stemming from the Helmholtz equation with PML by the finite difference scheme. The shifted-Laplacian is extended to precondition the 3D Helmholtz equation, and a spectral analysis is given. The discrete preconditioned system is solved by the Bi-CGSTAB method, with a multigrid method used to invert the preconditioner approximately. Full-coarsening multigrid is employed, and a new matrix-based prolongation operator is constructed accordingly. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of both the new 27-point finite difference scheme with refined parameters, and the preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB method with the 3D full-coarsening multigrid.	approximation;arakawa grids;discretization;experiment;finite difference method;iterative method;jacobi method;krylov subspace;linear system;multigrid method;numerical analysis;numerical method;pin grid array;preconditioner;solver;sparse matrix;spectral density estimation;velocity (software development)	Zhongying Chen;Dongsheng Cheng;Tingting Wu	2012	J.

Recently, it has been applied for the first time to a fully-developed plasma turbulent simulation, and a qualitative understanding of how parareal converges exists for this case. In this paper, we construct an analytical framework of the process of convergence that should be applicable to parareal simulations of general turbulent systems. This framework allows one to gain a quantitative understanding of the dependence of the convergence on the physics of the problem and the choices that must be made to implement parareal. The analytical knowledge provided by this new framework can be used to optimize the implementation of parareal. We illustrate the inner workings of the framework and demonstrate its predictive capabilities by applying it to the modeling of the parareal convergence of drift-wave plasma turbulent simulations.	algorithm;glossary of computer graphics;parallel computing;parareal;simulation;turbulence	José Miguel Reynolds-Barredo;David E.

Information is given at two time instances, but inaccurate. The solution is to be constructed at some intermediate time. We provide the optimal error and present an algorithm which achieves this error level. The application of optimal recovery theory to problems of partial differential equations was started by J. F. Traub and H. Woźniakowski in [1]. In particular, this monograph considered optimal recovery of solutions of the heat equation from finitely many Fourier coefficients of the initial function. Several recovery problems for partial differential equation from noisy information were recently studied in [2]–[7]. The results considered in these papers were based on a general method for optimal recovery of linear operators developed in [8] and [9] (see also [10]). This method extended previous research from [11]. Various problems of optimal recovery from noisy information may be found in [12] (see also [13] where the complexity of differential and integral equations is discussed). Here we consider the optimal recovery problem for solutions of the generalized heat equation in the unit d-ball at the time τ from inaccurate solutions at the times t1 and t2.

For stability and accuracy reasons, we generalize the model through the introduction of four free parameters. One set of parameters is rigorously determined to obtain the high-order finite element solution. The other set of free parameters is determined from the underlying discrete maximum principle to obtain the monotonic solutions. The resulting two models are used in combination through the flux correct transport technique of Zalesak, thereby constructing a finite element model which has the ability to capture hydraulic discontinuities. In addition, this paper highlights the implementation of two Krylov subspace iterative solvers, namely, the bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (Bi-CGSTAB) and the generalized minimum residual (GMRES) methods. For the sake of comparison, the multifrontal direct solver is also considered. The performance characteristics of the investigated solvers are assessed using results of a standard test widely used as a benchmark in hydraulic modeling. Based on numerical results, it is shown that the present finite element method can render the technique suitable for solving shallow water equations with sharply varying solution profiles. Also, the GMRES solver is shown to have a much better convergence rate than the Bi-CGSTAB solver, thereby saving much computing time compared to the multifrontal solver.	benchmark (computing);conjugate gradient method;finite element method;frontal solver;galerkin method;generalized minimal residual method;iterative method;krylov subspace;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;simulation;software propagation	C.

This study investigates ferrofluid flow characteristics in an inclined channel under inclined magnetic field and constant pressure gradient. The ferrofluid considered in this work is comprised of Cu particles as the nanoparticles and water as the base fluid. The governing differential equations including viscous dissipation are non-dimensionalised and discretized with Generalized Differential Quadrature Method. The resulting algebraic set of equations are solved via Newton-Raphson Method. The work done here contributes to the literature by searching the effects of magnetic field angle and channel inclination separately on the entropy generation of the ferrofluid filled inclined channel system in order to achieve best design parameter values so called entropy generation minimization is implemented. Furthermore, the effect of magnetic field, inclination angle of the channel and volume fraction of nanoparticles on velocity and temperature profiles are examined and represented by figures to give a thorough understanding of the system behavior.	discretization;gradient;linear algebra;newton's method;velocity (software development)	Elgiz Baskaya;Guven Komurgoz;Ibrahim Özkol	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19070377	viscosity;classical mechanics;mathematical optimization;ferrofluid;mathematics;work (physics);nyström method;differential equation;magnetic field;dispersion (optics);dissipation;optics	HCI	90.73863510420409	4.345784668754166	172092

Specifically, we analyze high order space-time tensor product finite element discretizations, used in a method of lines approach coupled with mesh modification to solve linear partial differential equations. Mesh modification can be both continuous (moving meshes) and discrete (static rezone). These methods can lead to significant savings in computation costs for problems having solutions that develop steep moving fronts or other localized time-dependent features of interest. Our main result is a symmetric a priori error estimate for the finite element solution computed in this setting.	error analysis (mathematics);finite element method	Randolph E. Bank;Maximilian S.

Following Jin and Xin, we use as approximation of the scalar conservation law, a semi-linear hyperbolic system with a second stiff source term. This allows us to avoid the use of a Riemann solver in the construction of the numerical schemes. The convergence of the approximate solution toward a weak solution is established in the cases of first and second order accurate MUSCL relaxed methods.	approximation algorithm;linear programming relaxation;muscl scheme;numerical analysis;riemann solver;semiconductor industry	Abdallah Chalabi	1999	Math.

We simplify the problem by considering only equations with constant coefficients. The problem is described by a degenerate parabolic equation (a linearized Crocco-type equation) where phenomena of diffusion and transport are coupled. First we give a geometric characterization of the influence domain of a locally distributed con- trol. Then we prove regional null controllability results on this domain. The proof is based on an adequate observability inequality for the homogeneous adjoint problem. This inequality is obtained by decomposition of the space-time domain and Carleman-type estimates along characteristics. In the second part of this paper, we treat the case of a boundary control.

It has been shown that one can improve the numerical resolution of singularly perturbed problems involving boundary layers, by incorporating the structure of the boundary layers into the finite element spaces, when this structure is available; see e.g. [Cheng, W. and Temam, R. (2002). Comput. Fluid. V.31, 453–466; Jung, C. (2005). Numer. Meth. Partial Differ. Eq. V.21, 623–648]. This approach is developed in this article for a convection–diffusion equation. Using an analytical approach, we first derive an approximate (simplified) form of the parabolic boundary layers (elements) for our problem; we then develop new numerical schemes using these boundary layer elements. The results are performed for the perturbation parameter in the range 10−1–10−15 whereas the discretization mesh is in the range of order 1/10–1/100 in the x-direction and of order 1/10–1/30 in the y-direction.

In this paper, the scheme is analysed theoretically, and is shown to be only first order accurate for function interpolation and zeroth order accurate for spatial derivative approximation, in the general case. A number of special cases exist, however, where higher order accuracy may be obtained, and these are identified in this paper. Since the mesh used by Kim and Choi to demonstrate the accuracy of their scheme was one of these special cases, this explains their results. Finally, an improved version of Kim and Choi’s scheme is presented, which is shown to be truly second order accurate for function interpolation and first order accurate for spatial derivative approximation.	approximation;bilinear filtering;finite volume method;interpolation;navier–stokes equations;simulation;unstructured grid	Samuel K.

In the case of linear SDEs, using the Gaussianity of the underlying solutions, we derive an SDE which the numerical method solves exactly in the weak sense.

The computational algorithm has been shown to be stable and monotonously convergent, and allowed time marching steps that were 3-4 orders of magnitude larger than those employed in similar explicit approaches, resulting in an increase of 3-4 orders of magnitude in computing efficiency. Full solute and thermal coupling was achieved for metallic alloys with a realistic, high Lewis number of >10^4. The parallel multigrid computing scheme is shown to provide a scalable methodology that allowed the efficient use of distributed supercomputing resource to simulate the evolution of tens of complex shaped 2D dendrites in a computational domain containing tens or even hundreds of millions of grid points. The simulations have provided insight into the dynamic interplay of many growing dendrites in a more realistic fully coupled thermal-solute condition, capturing for the first time fine scale features such as dendrite splitting.	implicit parallelism;multigrid method	Zhengbin Guo;J.

0949d0e4e59aa0c8eee74272dda5e239919f96c8	heat balance integral methods applied to the one-phase stefan problem with a convective boundary condition at the fixed face		In this paper we consider a one-dimensional one-phase Stefan problem corresponding to the solidification process of a semi-infinite material with a convective boundary condition at the fixed face. The exact solution of this problem, available recently in the literature, enable us to test the accuracy of the approximate solutions obtained by applying the classical technique of the heat balance integral method and the refined integral method, assuming a quadratic temperature profile in space. We develop variations of these methods which turn out to be optimal in some cases. Throughout this paper, a dimensionless analysis is carried out by using the parameters: Stefan number (Ste) and the generalized Biot number (Bi). In addition it is studied the case when Bi goes to infinity, recovering the approximate solutions when a Dirichlet condition is imposed at the fixed face. Some numerical simulations are provided in order to estimate the errors committed by each approach for the corresponding free boundary and temperature profiles.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;user agent	Julieta Bollati;José A.

The proposed solution algorithm is based on the description of ADE by using the finite differences method in accordance with the Saulyev scheme. For the solution of the obtained equations, explicit spreadsheet simulation (ESS) technique is used instead of computer code.#R##N##R##N#In the numeric solution of ADE by using finite differences, either the small values of a Courant number such as 0.05–0.10 is used for oscillation free results or an artificial diffusion is used in order to reduce oscillation. In order to provide for small Courant numbers, it is necessary to choose a small time step and/or grid size; however this increases the computation time. While the proposed ADEESS solution technique uses an unconditional stable Saulyev scheme, it gives highly accurate results even for the values of the Courant numbers as high as 2–3.#R##N##R##N#By changing only the values of the temporal weighted parameter (θ) with a ADEESS implementation, solutions are obtained for the different θ values. The ADEESS only uses copy & paste property of spreadsheets. Thus, a solution of simultaneous equations for each time step using matrix algebra is not required provided the system converges by simply recalculating all iteratively. Two examples, which have numerical and analytical solutions in literature, are solved in order to test the ADEESS performance. Both examples are solved for three θ values, 0, 0.5 and 1, respectively. It is shown that the model results for both examples for the value of θ = 0 are in good agreement with the analytical solution.	explicit and implicit methods;finite difference;spreadsheet	Halil Karahan	2007	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2006.08.001	closed-form expression;mathematical optimization;finite difference;mathematical analysis;simultaneous equations;convection–diffusion equation;finite difference method;calculus;mathematics;thermodynamics;numerical diffusion;oscillation	SE	90.38395563883826	11.807974911751634	173707

Here we investigate the integrability properties of a generalized Fisher equation in both (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions. A Painlevé singularity structure analysis singles out a special case (m = 2) as integrable. More interestingly, a Bäcklund transformation is shown to give rise to a linearizing transformation for the integrable case. A Lie symmetry analysis again separates out the same m = 2 case as the integrable one and hence we report several physically interesting solutions via similarity reductions. Thus we give a group theoretical interpretation for the system under study. Explicit and numerical solutions for specific cases of nonintegrable systems are also given. In particular, the system is found to exhibit different types of travelling wave solutions and patterns, static structures and localized structures. Besides the Lie symmetry analysis, nonclassical and generalized conditional symmetry analysis are also carried out.	grammatical framework;legendre transformation;like button;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;onset (audio);prototype;the singularity	Parayil Sankaran Bindu;M.

In this paper we construct explicit solutions of the unregularized equation and suggest candidates for its weak solutions. We confirm these ideas by examining a fourth-order regularized equation in the limit of infinite aspect ratio. The stationary solutions of this equation include the minimizers of a free energy, and we show these minimizers are remarkably well-approximated by a second-order “self-dual” equation. Moreover, the self-dual solutions give upper bounds for the free energy which imply the existence of weak limits for the asymptotic minimizers. In certain cases, some recent results of Jin and Kohn [28] combined with these upper bounds enable us to demonstrate that the energy of the asymptotic minimizers converges to that of the self-dual solutions in a viscosity limit.	algebraic riccati equation;approximation algorithm;boundary element method;concave function;dendritic spine;distribution (mathematics);experiment;hessian;legendre transformation;numerical analysis;onset (audio);patterns in nature;simulation;software bug;stationary process;wavelet	Nicholas M.

Since the idea of OWE appeared in the 1970s, geophysicists have made great effort to improve the accuracy of the one-way wave equation extrapolators. In this paper, we present the idea of solving OWE using the Fourier integral method, which represents OWE as a Fourier integral equation and solves it in dual spaces (both space and wave-number domains). By doing this, we can propagate wave-fields up to nearly 901 angle from the vertical direction in the presence of lateral velocity variations. The proposed method is stable, does not suffer from the numerical dispersion, and overcomes the azimuthal anisotropy problem when extended to three dimensions. The computation cost of the Fourier integral method is too high and was considered impractical for a conventional computer. In this paper, we take advantages of the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and use the matrix multiplication technique to accelerate the algorithm. The speedup ratio we obtained is tens of hundreds times so that the method can be applied to a real project for pre-stack depth imaging. Crown Copyright & 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The PoliMIce (Politecnico di Milano Ice accretion software) library provides a general interface allowing different aerodynamic and ice accretion software to communicate. The built-in ice accretion engine moves from the well-known Myers approach and it includes state-of-the-art ice formation models. The ice accretion engine implements a fully three-dimensional representation of the two-phase flow over the solid body, accounting for both rime and glaze ice formation. As an improvement over the reference model, a parabolic temperature profile is assumed to guarantee the consistency with respect to the wall boundary conditions. Moreover, the mass balance is generalized to conserve the liquid fraction at the interface between the glaze and the rime ice types. Numerical simulations are presented regarding in-flight ice accretion over two-dimensional airfoils and three-dimensional straight- and swept-wings. The CFD open-source software OpenFOAM was used to compute the aerodynamic field and the droplet trajectories. Simulation results compare fairly well with available experiments on ice accretion.	simulation	Giulio Gori;M. Zocca;M.

Such parameters are frequently encountered in PDE-based models and correspond to quantities such as density or pressure fields, elasto-plastic moduli and internal variables in solid mechanics, conductivity fields in heat diffusion problems, permeability fields in fluid flow through porous media etc. The proposed model has all the advantages of traditional Bayesian formulations such as the ability to produce measures of confidence for the inferences made and providing not only predictive estimates but also quantitative measures of the predictive uncertainty. In contrast to existing approaches it utilizes a parsimonious, non-parametric formulation that favors sparse representations and whose complexity can be determined from the data. The proposed framework in non-intrusive and makes use of a sequence of forward solvers operating at various resolutions. As a result, inexpensive, coarse solvers are used to identify the most salient features of the unknown field(s) which are subsequently enriched by invoking solvers operating at finer resolutions. This leads to significant computational savings particularly in problems involving computationally demanding forward models but also improvements in accuracy. It is based on a novel, adaptive scheme based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling which is embarrassingly parallelizable and circumvents issues with slow mixing encountered in Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes. The capabilities of the proposed methodology are illustrated in problems from nonlinear solid mechanics with special attention to cases where the data is contaminated with random noise and the scale of variability of the unknown field is smaller than the scale of the grid where observations are collected. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To obtain approximate solutions we use theh-version Galerkin boundary element method. Furthermore we introduce two-level additive Schwarz operators for non-overlapping domain decompositions of Γ and we estimate the conditions numbers of these operators with respect to the mesh size. Based on these operators we derive an a posteriori error estimate for the difference between the exact solution and the Galerkin solution. The estimate also involves the error which comes from an approximate solution of the Galerkin equations. For uniform meshes and under the assumption of a saturation condition we show reliability and efficiency of our estimate. Based on this estimate we introduce an adaptive multilevel algorithm with easily computable local error indicators which allows direction control of the local refinements. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples for plane and curved surfaces.	additive schwarz method;approximation algorithm;boundary element method;computable function;galerkin method;numerical analysis;utility functions on indivisible goods	Patrick Mund;Ernst P.

The resulting coupled system, consisting of the physical PDE and a moving mesh PDE, is solved by a Schwarz waveform relaxation method. In particular, the computational space-time domain is decomposed into overlapping subdomains and the solution obtained by iteratively solving the system of PDEs on each subdomain. Dirichlet boundary conditions are used to pass solution information between neighboring regions. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated for some model problems. For problems where the solutions evolve on disparate time scales in different regions of the spatial domain, this approach demonstrates the significant savings in computational time and effort which are possible.	adaptive mesh refinement;computation;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrangian relaxation;langrisser schwarz;linear programming relaxation;numerical partial differential equations;refinement (computing);relaxation (approximation);relaxation (iterative method);time complexity;waveform	Ronald D.

Spectral elements are used to represent the poloidal plane. To permit the generation of spheromak and other compact equilibria, special consideration is given to ensure regularity at the geometric axis. The scalar field Λ = ψ/R is used as the dependent variable to express the Grad-Shafranov operator as a total divergence. With the correct gauge, regularity along the geometric axis is satisfied. The convergence properties of the spectral elements are investigated by comparing numerically generated equilibria against known analytic solutions. Equilibria accurate to double precision error are generated with sufficient resolution. Depending on the equilibrium, either geometric or algebraic convergence is observed as the polynomial degree of the spectral-element basis is increased.	algebraic equation;apache axis;code;degree of a polynomial;double-precision floating-point format;finite element method;frame rate control;gradient;mean squared error;numerical analysis;numerical error;optic axis of a crystal;solver;toroidal graph;truncation error	E.

It consists of a multi-scale system of partial differential equations coupling the electrical activity at the tissue scale with that at the cellular scale. It is common to solve the bidomain model by using a separate numerical procedure for each scale. Two well-known, first-order time-integration methods for solving the bidomain model are the semi-implicit method of Southern et al. (2009) and the Godunov operator-splitting method (as described in Sundnes et al., 2006). Both methods decouple the numerical procedure at the cellular scale from that at the tissue scale but in slightly different ways. The methods are analysed in terms of their accuracy, and their relative performance is compared on one-, two-, and three-dimensional test cases. As suggested by the analysis, the test cases show that the Godunov method is significantly faster than the semi-implicit method for the same level of accuracy, specifically, between 5 and 15 times in the cases presented.

The physical problem concerns the structure and stability properties of a combustion front that propagates in the axial direction along the surface of a cylindrical solid fuel element. Experimental observations suggest that the front may propagate in a number of different ways; the objective of the investigation is to describe these different modes of propagation. The analysis involves the study of a set of nonlinear partial differential equations which describe the structure and evolution of the combustion front. Because the location of the front is unknown and must be found as part of the,solution, thh problem is a free boundary value problera. The purpose of this article is to sh~Sv¢ how symbolic manipulation languages like MAPLE can be combined effectively with analysis and numerical computations for this type of investigation.	bifurcation theory;computation;maple;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;software propagation	Marc Garbey;Hans G.

469262f8f703c409f440acf3b441845803be4d1a	unstructured triangular cellular automata for modeling geographic spread	anisotropy;cellular automata;unstructured triangular grids	In this work we propose the use of a cellular automata defined on unstructured triangular grids to simulate geographic spread. A grid structure of a finite element implementation is adopted to cellular automata computations. This approach allow us to model and simulate with cellular automata on computational domains with complex geometries (polygonal boundaries), it still retains the easy implementation of cellular automata and does not present the anisotropy induced by regular grids. We show a comparison (storage and number of evaluations required) of our approach with the classical cellular automata implementations on regular grids: rectangular, equilateral triangulation and hexagonal. The geographical spread on unstructured triangular grids is presented by defining two simple cellular automata models a binary spread (two states) and a deforestation spread (three states). Using unstructured triangular grids no anisotropy effects induced by grid and neighborhood are presented; circular fronts spread as circular fronts. Moreover, the use of unstructured triangular grids for cellular automata can simplifies the coupling of cellular automata with other numerical techniques such as finite element or finite volume.	automata theory;cellular automaton	Gerardo M.

When the speed function F : Rn × [0, T ]→ R is prescribed, the non-linear advection equation φt + F |∇φ| = 0 is a HamiltonJacobi equation known as the level-set equation. It is argued that a small enough neighbourhood of the zero-level-setM of the solution φ : Rn × [0, T ]→ R is the image of ψ : Rn → R where ψ solves a Dirichlet problem of the form H(u, ψ(u),∇ψ(u)) = 0. A fast-marching algorithm is presented where each point is computed using a discretization of such a Dirichlet problem, with no restrictions on the sign of F . The output is a directed graph whose vertices evenly sample M. The convergence, consistency and stability of the scheme are addressed. Bounds on the computational complexity are established, and verified to be on par with the Fast Marching Method. Examples are presented where the algorithm is shown to be globally first-order accurate. The complexities and accuracies observed are independent of the monotonicity of the evolution.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;directed graph;discretization;fast fourier transform;fast marching method;first-order reduction;nonlinear system;order of accuracy;software propagation	Alexandra Tcheng;Jean-Christophe Nave	2016	SIAM J.

Given two sequences of vector fields of this type, converging weakly in L2 as the mesh width tends to 0, we prove that their scalar product converges in the sense of distributions when one of the sequences consists of so-called discrete divergence-free fields whereas the other has relatively compact curl in H−1. The proof uses a uniform norm equivalence related to discrete compactness properties of vector finite element spaces and a super-approximation property of scalar finite element spaces.	approximation;farkas' lemma;finite element method;span and div;turing completeness;curl	Snorre H.

Alternative strategies, both passive and active, have been proposed to enhance laminar mixing. In this study the effect of flow pulsatility on the dynamics of a laminar mixing surface formed between converging microchannel flows is studied numerically. The results indicate that complex wave-like interfacial distortions are possible for high-frequency pulsations and are more significant when the frequencies of the converging flows are related by and irrational ratio.	numerical linear algebra;simulation	Darren L.

A time discretization error representation is derived for the approximation of the associated value function. It concerns symplectic Euler solutions of the Hamiltonian system connected with the optimal control problem. The error representation has a leading-order term consisting of an error density that is computable from symplectic Euler solutions. Under an assumption of the pathwise convergence of the approximate dual function as the maximum time step goes to zero, we prove that the remainder is of higher order than the leading-error density part in the error representation. With the error representation, it is possible to perform adaptive time stepping. We apply an adaptive algorithm originally developed for ordinary differential equations. The performance is illustrated by numerical tests.	adaptive algorithm;approximation algorithm;bellman equation;computable function;discretization error;duality (optimization);euler–lagrange equation;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;optimal control;semi-implicit euler method;stepping level;symplectic integrator	Jesper Karlsson;Stig Larsson;Mattias Sandberg;Anders Szepessy;Raúl Tempone	2015	SIAM J.

Our objective is three-fold. First, we consider a McKean-Vlasov equation in [0, T ] × R with sufficiently smooth kernels, and the PDEs giving the distribution function and the density of the measure μt, the solution to the McKean-Vlasov equation. The simulation of the stochastic system with N particles provides a discrete measure which approximates μk∆t for each time k∆t (where ∆t is a discretization step of the time interval [0, T ]). An integration (resp. smoothing) of this discrete measure provides approximations of the distribution function (resp. density) of μk∆t. We show that the convergence rate is O ( 1/ √ N + √ ∆t ) for the approximation in L1(Ω× R) of the cumulative distribution function at time T , and of order O ( ε2 + 1 ε ( 1 √ N + √ ∆t )) for the approximation in L1(Ω×R) of the density at time T (Ω is the underlying probability space, ε is a smoothing parameter). Our second objective is to show that our particle method can be modified to solve the Burgers equation with a nonmonotonic initial condition, without modifying the convergence rate O ( 1/ √ N + √ ∆t ) . This part extends earlier work of ours, where we have limited ourselves to monotonic initial conditions. Finally, we present numerical experiments which confirm our theoretical estimates and illustrate the numerical efficiency of the method when the viscosity coefficient is very small.	approximation;coefficient;discretization;error analysis (mathematics);experiment;initial condition;interacting particle system;interaction;numerical analysis;particle filter;rate of convergence;simulation;smoothing;software propagation;stochastic process	Mireille Bossy;Denis Talay	1997	Math.

Therefore the Gibbs phenomena is controled for odd order finite volume schemes. Numerical experiments sustain the theoretical analysis. In particular the oscillations of the LaxWendroff scheme for small Courant numbers are correlated with its non stability in L. A scheme of order three is proved to be stable in L and L ∞.	courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;experiment;finite volume method;numerical method	Bruno Després	2008	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-007-0128-4	calculus;mathematics;geometry;oscillation;finite volume method;quantum mechanics	Vision	86.96819642166976	12.101188070515619	176075

The elliptic partial differential equation is transformed by introducing an exponential function to eliminate the convection terms in the equation. A fourth-order central differencing scheme and a second-order central differencing scheme are used to numerically solve the transformed elliptic partial differential equation. Analytical solutions of this equation are also given. Comparisons are made between the analytical solutions, the numerical results using the present schemes, and those using the four classical differencing schemes, namely, the first-order upwind scheme, hybrid scheme, power-law scheme, and exponential scheme. The comparisons illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the four classical differencing schemes.	numerical analysis	H.

2856c741ef982903be534c97f5057ac634fcd411	dns of the wall effect on the motion of bubble swarms		This paper presents a numerical study of the gravity-driven motion of single bubbles and bubble swarms through a vertical channel, using High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations. A systematic study of the wall effect on the motion of single deformable bubbles is carried out for confinement ratios CR = {2, 4, 6} in both circular and square channels, for a broad range of flow conditions. Then, the rising motion of a swarm of deformable bubbles in a vertical channel is researched, for void fractions α = {8.3%, 10.4%, 12.5%} and CR = {4, 6}. These simulations are carried out in the framework of a novel multiple marker interface capturing approach, where a conservative levelset function is used to represent each bubble. This method avoids the numerical and potentially unphysical coalescence of the bubbles, allowing for the collision of the fluid particles as well as long time simulations of bubbly flows. Present simulations are performed in a periodic vertical domain discretized by 2× 10 control volumes (CVs) up to 16.6× 10 CVs, distributed in 128 up to 2048 processors. The collective and individual behavior of the bubbles are analyzed in detail.	central processing unit;coalescing (computer science);common language infrastructure;computation;direct numerical simulation;discretization;dot-com bubble;experiment;interaction;mac os x 10.4 tiger;marker interface pattern;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical diffusion;numerical stability;solver;swarm;total variation diminishing;turbulence;velocity (software development)	Néstor Balcázar;Jesús Castro;Joaquim Rigola;Assensi Oliva	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.076	classical mechanics;mathematical optimization;periodic graph (geometry);bubble;theoretical computer science;discretization;marker interface pattern;computer science;flow conditions;direct numerical simulation;level set method;coalescence (physics)	Visualization	94.03265823342606	6.050113030378237	176529

In particular, the proposed schemes constitute a simple version of the classical Osher-Solomon Riemann solver, and extend in some sense the schemes proposed in Dumbser and Toro (2011) 19,20. The viscosity matrix of the numerical flux is constructed as a linear combination of functional evaluations of the Jacobian of the flux at several quadrature points. Some families of functions have been proposed to this end: Chebyshev polynomials and rational-type functions. Our schemes have been tested with different initial value Riemann problems for ideal gas dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics and multilayer shallow water equations. The numerical tests indicate that the proposed schemes are robust, stable and accurate with a satisfactory time step restriction, and provide an efficient alternative for approximating time-dependent solutions in which the spectral decomposition is computationally expensive.

They can be used to explore energy signals to study earthquakes, the distribution of telecommunications signals, and other uses. In particular, many problems formulated as mathematical models use integral equations with variable boundaries. The most interesting applications use integrals where the boundaries are symmetric functions. In the present study, to solve the Volterra integral equations with variable boundaries, we propose multi-step methods such as hybrids, and we construct some simple algorithms for their application where the order of accuracy is p⩽8(k=1).	refinement (computing)	Mehdiyeva Galina;Ibrahimov Vagif;Imanova Mehriban	2016	J.

We adopt the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT.

The emergence of this intricate and pervasive weblike structure of the Universe on Megaparsec scales can be approximated by a well-known equation from fluid mechanics, the Burgers' equation. The solution to this equation can be obtained from a geometrical formalism. We have extended and improved this method by invoking weighted Delaunay and Voronoi tessellations. The duality between these tessellations finds a remarkable and profound reflection in the description of physical systems in Eulerian and Lagrangian terms.  The resulting Adhesion formalism provides deep insight into the dynamics and topology of the Cosmic Web. It uncovers a direct connection between the conditions in the very early Universe and the complex spatial patterns that emerged out of these under the influence of gravity.	approximation algorithm;cosmic;computation;computational geometry;delaunay triangulation;emergence;pervasive informatics;semantics (computer science);sticky bit	Johan Hidding;Rien van de Weygaert;Gert Vegter;Bernard J.

A new feature of this work is the implementation of the local inextensibility condition in the diffuse interface context. Local inextensibility is enforced by using a local Lagrange multiplier, which provides the necessary tension force at the interface. We introduce a new equation for the local Lagrange multiplier whose solution essentially provides a harmonic extension of the multiplier off the interface while maintaining the local inextensibility constraint near the interface. We also develop a local relaxation scheme that dynamically corrects local stretching/compression errors thereby preventing their accumulation. Asymptotic analysis is presented that shows that our new system converges to a relaxed version of the inextensible sharp interface model. This is also verified numerically. To solve the equations, we use an adaptive finite element method with implicit coupling between the Navier-Stokes and the diffuse interface inextensibility equations. Numerical simulations of a single vesicle in a shear flow at different Reynolds numbers demonstrate that errors in enforcing local inextensibility may accumulate and lead to large differences in the dynamics in the tumbling regime and smaller differences in the inclination angle of vesicles in the tank-treading regime. The local relaxation algorithm is shown to prevent the accumulation of stretching and compression errors very effectively. Simulations of two vesicles in an extensional flow show that local inextensibility plays an important role when vesicles are in close proximity by inhibiting fluid drainage in the near contact region.	algorithm;application program interface;compression;computer simulation;finite element method;inhibition;interface device component;lagrange multiplier;linear programming relaxation;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;relaxation (iterative method);reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;small;tension;tree accumulation;vesicle (morphologic abnormality)	Sebastian Aland;Sabine Egerer;John S.

We revisit the method of Greengard et al. [1] devoted to the low frequency regime and based on the splitting of the Green’s function into a propagative and an evanescent part. More precisely, we give an explicit formula of the filtered translation function for the propagative part, we derive a new formula for the evanescent part and we provide a new interpolation algorithm. At all steps, we check the accuracy of the method by providing error estimates. These theoretical developments are used to propose a wideband FMM based entirely on plane wave expansions. The numerical efficiency and accuracy of this broadband PWFMM are illustrated with a numerical example.	algorithm;evanescent field;fast multipole method;interpolation;kernel (operating system);numerical analysis	Stéphanie Chaillat;Francis Collino	2015	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2015.05.019	mathematical optimization;broadband;fast multipole method;mathematics;optics;helmholtz equation;quantum mechanics	ML	90.903912480733	7.452212708350413	177529

In particular, we consider algorithms involving realand imaginary-time propagation based on a split-step Crank-Nicholson method.

In the two-space-variable form we consider the GP equation in two-dimensional anisotropic and three-dimensional axiallysymmetric traps. The fully-anisotropic three-dimensional GP equation is also considered. Numerical results for the chemical potential and root-mean-square size of stationary states are reported using imaginary-time propagation programs for all the cases and compared with previously obtained results. Also presented are numerical results of non-stationary oscillation for different trap symmetries using real-time propagation programs.

3974f062fb9327392d7736b0a02c3cdd4e0646e1	a new class of fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive green-naghdi models for efficient 2d simulations	splitting method;run up;green naghdi model;finite volume;nonlinear shallow water;high order scheme	We introduce a new class of two-dimensional fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive Green-Naghdi equations over varying topography. These new Green-Naghdi systems share the same order of precision as the standard one but have a mathematical structure which makes them much more suitable for the numerical resolution, in particular in the demanding case of two dimensional surfaces. For these new models, we develop a high order, well balanced, and robust numerical code relying on an hybrid finite volume and finite difference splitting approach. The hyperbolic part of the equations is handled with a high-order finite volume scheme allowing for breaking waves and dry areas. The dispersive part is treated with a finite difference approach. Higher order accuracy in space and time is achieved through WENO reconstruction methods and through a SSP-RK time stepping. Particular effort is made to ensure positivity of the water depth. Numerical validations are then performed, involving one and two dimensional cases and showing the ability of the resulting numerical model to handle waves propagation and transformation, wetting and drying; some simple treatments of wave breaking are also included. The resulting numerical code is particularly efficient from a computational point of view and very robust; it can therefore be used to handle complex two dimensional configurations.	computation;dispersive partial differential equation;finite difference;finite volume method;linux/rk;mathematical model;mathematical structure;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;point of view (computer hardware company);simulation;software propagation;stepping level;topography	D.

Linearization and application of an implicit time stepping scheme results in a linear stationary problem of Oseen type. In well-known solution techniques for this problem such as the Uzawa (or Schur complement) method, a subproblem consisting of a coupled nonsymmetric system of linear equations of diffusion-reaction type must be solved to update the velocity vector field. In this paper we analyze a standard finite element method for the discretization of this coupled system, and we introduce and analyze a multigrid solver for the discrete problem. Both for the discretization method and the multigrid solver the question of robustness with respect to the amount of diffusion and variation in the convection field is addressed. We prove stability results and discretization error bounds for the Galerkin finite element method. We present a convergence analysis of the multigrid method which shows the robustness of the solver. Results of numerical experiments are presented which illustrate the stability of the discretization method and the robustness of the multigrid solver.	discretization error;experiment;finite element method;galerkin method;linear equation;multigrid method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;schur complement method;solver;stationary process;stepping level;system of linear equations;velocity (software development)	Maxim A.

We propose a definition of weak solutions, that is particularly convenient for the treatment of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system on unbounded domains. We prove existence of weak solutions for arbitrary large initial data for potential forces with an arbitrary growth at large distances. We show, that any weak solution satisfies the so called relative entropy inequality. Finally we prove the weak-strong uniqueness principle, meaning that the weak solutions coincide with strong solutions emanating from the same initial data (as long as the latter exist), at least when the potential force vanishes at large distances.	kullback–leibler divergence;navier–stokes equations;social inequality	Didier Jesslé;Bum Ja Jin;Antonín Novotný	2013	SIAM J.

The object is of a finite collection of regions of a set of prescribed material classes of continuously varying material properties. These properties have a discontinuous change across the interface of the material regions. In this paper, we propose a level-set based variational approach for the design of this class of heterogeneous objects. Central to the approach is a variational framework for a well-posed formulation of the design problem. In particular, we adapt the Mumford-Shah model which specifies that any point of the object belongs to either of two types: inside a material region of a well-defined gradient or on the boundary edges and surfaces of discontinuities. Furthermore, the set of discontinuities is represented implicitly, using a multi-phase level set model. This level-set based variational approach yields a computational system of coupled geometric evolution and diffusion partial differential equations. Promising features of the proposed method include strong regularity in the problem formulation and inherent capabilities of geometric and material modeling, yielding a common framework for optimization of the heterogeneous objects that incorporates dimension, shape, topology, and material properties. The proposed method is illustrated with several 2D examples of optimal design of multi-material structures and materials.	2d computer graphics;algorithm;bounded variation;calculus of variations;gradient;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal design;variational principle;well-posed problem	Michael Yu Wang;Xiaoming Wang	2005	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2004.03.007	material properties;mathematical optimization;variational method;level set;optimal design;calculus;mathematics;geometry;partial differential equation;level set method	Graphics	96.395774501074	11.663851516191519	177975

We demonstrate that there is no travelling wave joining bounded strains in the different wells of this potential for a range of wave speeds significantly lower than the speed of sound.

These equations occur in various applications, e.  g., in combustion engines or chemical reactors. After modeling, discretization, and model reduction, important system properties as the energy conservation are usually lost which may lead to unphysical simulation results. In this paper, we introduce a port-Hamiltonian formulation of the one-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations for reactive flows. The port-Hamiltonian structure is directly associated with an energy balance, which ensures that a temporal change of the total energy is only due to energy flows through the boundary. Furthermore, the boundary ports may be used for control purposes.	navier–stokes equations	Robert Altmann;Philipp Schulze	2017	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2016.12.005	mathematical optimization;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;calculus;non-dimensionalization and scaling of the navier–stokes equations;mathematics;hagen–poiseuille flow from the navier–stokes equations	Robotics	89.4321717515108	9.211516049017266	178316

55c59515837789b815e0341b26eb9d739ecc9eb7	a new runge-kutta discontinuous galerkin method with conservation constraint to improve cfl condition for solving conservation laws	runge kutta discontinuous galerkin method;conservation laws;cfl condition	We present a new formulation of the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method [9, 8, 7, 6] for solving conservation Laws with increased CFL numbers. The new formulation requires the computed RKDG solution in a cell to satisfy additional conservation constraint in adjacent cells and does not increase the complexity or change the compactness of the RKDG method. Numerical computations for solving one-dimensional and two-dimensional scalar and systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws are performed with approximate solutions represented by piecewise quadratic and cubic polynomials, respectively. The hierarchical reconstruction [17, 33] is applied as a limiter to eliminate spurious oscillations in discontinuous solutions. From both numerical experiments and the analytic estimate of the CFL number of the newly formulated method, we find that: 1) this new formulation improves the CFL number over the original RKDG formulation by at least three times or more and thus reduces the overall computational cost; and 2) the new formulation essentially does not compromise the resolution of the numerical solutions of shock wave problems compared with ones computed by the RKDG method.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;cfl1 wt allele;computation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;cubic function;cure for lymphoma foundation;discontinuous galerkin method;discontinuous encopresis of nonorganic origin;experiment;limiter device component;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;polynomial;quadratic function;runge–kutta methods;shock;shockwave dosing unit;solutions	Zhiliang Xu;Xu-Yan Chen;Yingjie Liu	2014	Journal of computational physics	10.1016/j.jcp.2014.08.042	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;conservation law;physics;quantum mechanics	Comp.	91.39497766760073	14.032698133669863	179286

The error estimates of the respective approximations are also established. Numerical tests of the discussed schemes show that all schemes work well, and when the number of terms approximating the solution is increased, the desired solution is achieved. The accuracy of the numerical schemes with respect to the step size hh is analysed and illustrated through various tables. Finally, comparative performances of the schemes are discussed.	numerical analysis	Kamlesh Kumar;Rajesh K. Pandey;Shiva Sharma	2017	J.

We focus particularly on schemes of adaptive refinement, used to resolve the multiple length scales in a streamer discharge without a high computational cost. We then report recent results from these models, emphasizing developments that go beyond cylindrically symmetrical streamers propagating in homogeneous media. These include interacting streamers, branching streamers and sprite streamers in inhomogeneous media. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Integrators like Magnus expansions or commutator-free methods belong to the class of exponential methods showing high accuracy on stiff or oscillatory problems, but the computation of the exponentials or their action on vectors can be computationally costly. The first order differential equations to be solved present a special algebraic structure (associated with the companion matrix) which allows to build new methods (hybrid methods between Magnus and commutator-free methods). The new methods are of similar accuracy as standard exponentialmethodswith a reduced complexity. Additional parameters can be included into the scheme for optimization purposes. We illustrate how these methods can be obtained and present several sixth-order methods which are tested in several numerical experiments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

790683ef2c7ded44ea1075cb2eca40e3aad9c0d6	mathematical model of pipeline abandonment and recovery in deepwater		In offshore oil and gas engineering the pipeline abandonment and recovery is unavoidable and its mechanical analysis is necessary and important. For this problem a third-order differential equation is used as the governing equation in this paper, rather than the traditional second-order one. The mathematical model of pipeline abandonment and recovery is a moving boundary value problem, which means that it is hard to determine the length of the suspended pipeline segment. A novel technique for the handling of the moving boundary condition is proposed, which can tackle the moving boundary condition without contact analysis. Based on a traditional numerical method, the problem is solved directly by the proposed technique. The results of the presented method are in good agreement with the results of the traditional finite element method coupled with contact analysis. Finally, an approximate formula for quick calculation of the suspended pipeline length is proposed based on Buckingham&#x2019;s Pi-theorem and mathematical fitting.	mathematical model	Xia-Guang Zeng;Menglan Duan;Chen An	2014	J.

In the case of non-negative vorticities, we obtain results that extend, in a natural way, the cubic-root growth of the diameter of the support of vorticity proved rst by C.

Using the minimum Lp-norm approach, we apply three different nonlinear multigrid algorithms for reconstructing surfaces from their “wrapped” values—two classical approaches and a novel Multilevel Nonlinear Method (MNM). The methods prove to be efficient even for difficult problems with noisy and discontinuous original images. The new method, MNM, exhibits the fastest convergence of the three for all the problems, given an appropriate choice of a damping parameter.

Poor quality meshes can produce inaccurate finite element analysis; their improvement is important. The algorithm improves mesh quality by adjusting the position of the mesh's internal nodes based on optimization of a torsion spring system using a Gauss-Newton-based approach. The approach obtains a reasonably optimal location of each internal node by optimizing the spring system's objective function. The improvement offered by applying the algorithm to real meshes is also exhibited and objectively evaluated using suitable metrics.	program optimization;smoothing	Hongtao Xu;Timothy S.

We propose two extensions of the conforming Nitsche’s extended finite element method to the nonconforming case. The first one is obtained by adding stabilisation terms on the cut edges, and the second one by modifying the Crouzeix–Raviart basis functions on the cut cells. Both discrete problems are uniformly stable and yield optimal  a priori  error estimates, uniformly with respect to the diffusion parameters. Moreover, we show that they exhibit the same robustness with respect to the position of the interface as the classical conforming method. We then validate these results numerically. Finally, we propose a nonconforming approximation of the interface Stokes problem based on the modified Crouzeix–Raviart elements and we illustrate it numerically.	finite element method	D.

This method has shortcomings when applied to-transformed grids, a grid type having strongly sheared cells, commonly used in hydrodynamic simulations. This paper describes an improved decomposition method into 6 tetrahedra. It is shown that this method is robust in-transformed grids, however large the shearing. Results are presented of applying the technique to a real world simulation. Comparisons are made between the accuracy and speed of the 5-decomposition and the 6-decomposition methods.	hexahedron;monte carlo method;robustness (computer science);simulation	I.

Often the topology of such surfaces cannot be accurately described in all of its relevant details due to either insufficient data or measurement errors or both. In such cases, this topological uncertainty can be efficiently handled by treating rough boundaries as random fields, so that an underlying physical phenomenon is described by deterministic or stochastic differential equations in random domains. To deal with this class of problems, we use a computational framework, which is based on stochastic mappings to transform the original deterministic/stochastic problem in a random domain into a stochastic problem in a deterministic domain. The latter problem has been studied more extensively and existing analytical/numerical techniques can be readily applied. In this paper, we employ both a generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo simulations to solve the transformed stochastic problem. We use our approach to describe transport of a passive scalar in Stokes’ flow and to quantify the corresponding predictive uncertainty. 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

e5c3735ec160179c469cb5bb8fb2865abb65f515	on the full and global accuracy of a compact third order weno scheme	65m08;510 mathematik;weighted essentially nonoscillatory schemes;order reduction;conservation laws;accuracy analysis;65m12	Recently, Aràndiga et al. showed in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 49 (2011), pp. 893–915] for a class of weighted ENO (WENO) schemes that the parameter ε occurring in the smoothness indicators of the scheme should be chosen proportional to the square of the mesh size, h2, to achieve the optimal order of accuracy. Unfortunately, these results cannot be applied to the compact third order WENO reconstruction procedure introduced in [D. Levy, G. Puppo, and G. Russo, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 22 (2000), pp. 656–672], which we apply within the semidiscrete central scheme of [A. Kurganov and D. Levy, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 22 (2000), pp. 1461–1488], a commonly used scheme for the numerical solution of conservation laws and convection-diffusion equations. The aim of this paper is to close this gap. In particular, we will show that we achieve the optimal order of accuracy in the WENO reconstruction (h3 in the smooth case and h2 near discontinuities) for ε = Khq with q ≤ 3 and pq ≥ 2, where p ≥ 1 is the exponent used in the computation of the weights in the WENO scheme. Numerical examples showing the predicted order of convergence of the analyzed WENO reconstruction procedure are given as well as results for the presented semidiscrete scheme combined with a third order TVD–Runge–Kutta scheme from [S. Gottlieb and C.-W. Shu, Math. Comp., 67 (1998), pp. 73–85] for the time integration.	computation;comstock–needham system;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;numerical partial differential equations;order of accuracy;rate of convergence;runge–kutta methods;total variation diminishing;weighted round robin	Oliver Kolb	2014	SIAM J.

The method is developed for simulating unsteady viscous incompressible flows with complex immersed boundaries. A finite-volume formulation based on globally second-order accurate central-difference schemes is adopted here in conjunction with a two-step fractional-step procedure. The key aspects that needed to be considered in developing such a nested grid solver are proper imposition of interface conditions on the nested-block boundaries, and accurate discretization of the governing equations in cells that are with block-interface as a control-surface. The interpolation procedure adopted in the study allows systematic development of a discretization scheme that preserves global second-order spatial accuracy of the underlying solver, and as a result high efficiency/accuracy nested grid discretization method is developed. Herein the proposed nested grid method has been widely tested through effective simulation of four different classes of unsteady incompressible viscous flows, thereby demonstrating its performance in the solution of various complex flow-structure interactions. The numerical examples include a lid-driven cavity flow and Pearson vortex problems, flow past a circular cylinder symmetrically installed in a channel, flow past an elliptic cylinder at an angle of attack, and flow past two tandem circular cylinders of unequal diameters. For the numerical simulations of flows past bluff bodies an immersed boundary (IB) method has been implemented in which the solid object is represented by a distributed body force in the Navier-Stokes equations. The main advantages of the implemented immersed boundary method are that the simulations could be performed on a regular Cartesian grid and applied to multiple nested-block (Cartesian) structured grids without any difficulty. Through the numerical experiments the strength of the solver in effectively/accurately simulating various complex flows past different forms of immersed boundaries is extensively demonstrated, in which the nested Cartesian grid method was suitably combined together with the fractional-step algorithm to speed up the solution procedure.	autoregressive integrated moving average;cartesian closed category;central processing unit;circular polarization;coefficient;colocation centre;cylinder seal;discretization;experiment;finite difference method;immersed boundary method;interpolation;numerical analysis;numerical method;regular grid;simulation;solver;taylor–green vortex;zero suppression	Yih-Ferng Peng;Rajat Mittal;Amalendu Sau;Robert R.

By analyzing the eigenvalue distribution of the domain decomposition preconditioned system, we prove that only a small number of eigenvalues may deteriorate with respect to the discontinuous jump or mesh size, and all the other eigenvalues are bounded below and above nearly uniformly with respect to the jump and mesh size. As a result, we prove that the convergence rate of the preconditioned conjugate gradient methods is nearly uniform with respect to the large jump and mesh size.

The new strategy is to solve an equivalent first-order hyperbolic system instead of the second-order diffusion equation, introducing solution gradients as additional unknowns. We show that schemes developed for the first-order system allow O(h) time step instead of O(h) and converge very rapidly toward the steady state. Moreover, this extremely fast convergence comes with the solution gradients (viscous stresses/heat fluxes for the Navier-Stokes equations) simultaneously computed with the same order of accuracy as the main variable. The proposed schemes are formulated as residual-distribution schemes (but can also be identified as finite-volume schemes), directly on unstructured grids. We present numerical results to demonstrate the tremendous gains offered by the new diffusion schemes, driving the rise of explicit schemes in the steady state computation for diffusion problems.	computation;converge;first-order predicate;gradient;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;order of accuracy;steady state;unstructured grid	Hiroaki Nishikawa	2007	J.

The method overcomes the numerical noise inherent in particle-based methods by periodically remapping the distribution function on a hierarchy of locally refined grids in phase space. Remapping on phase-space grids also provides an opportunity to integrate a collisional model and an associated grid-based solver. The positivity of the distribution function is enforced by redistributing excess phase-space density in a local neighborhood. We demonstrate the method on a number of standard plasma physics problems. It is shown that remapping significantly reduces the numerical noise and results in a more consistent second-order method than the standard PIC method. An error analysis is presented which is based on prior results of Cottet and Raviart's work [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 21 (1984), pp. 52-76].	particle-in-cell	Bei Wang;Gregory H.

This paper aims to address this problem and presents a novel, computationally efficient, generalised mathematical framework and accompanying algorithms based on an analytic solution to the problem. The approach is shown to extend seamlessly to the problem of computing mass, damping and forcing matrices, and importantly, can handle variable mass, damping, and stiffness coefficients. The capabilities of the algorithms are illustrated and their respective performances verified through detailed analysis of the computational efficiency, accuracy and stability in several practical case studies. The main benefit of the proposed approach is a reduction in computation times required for the evaluation of the stiffness matrix by up to a factor of 4, over the standard Gaussian Quadrature approach, for the practical cases considered, while preserving a high degree of accuracy and stability. Additionally, no assumptions regarding the problem complexity, degree, or regularity of the knot vector are imposed upon the solution in order to achieve the computational saving.	non-uniform rational b-spline	P.

8acd94845656030ad7a610e8c9aea22dc9e00581	a deep material network for multiscale topology learning and accelerated nonlinear modeling of heterogeneous materials		In this paper, a new data-driven multiscale material modeling method, which we refer to as deep material network, is developed based on mechanistic homogenization theory of representative volume element (RVE) and advanced machine learning techniques. We propose to use a collection of connected mechanistic building blocks with analytical homogenization solutions which avoids the loss of essential physics in generic neural networks, and this concept is demonstrated for 2-dimensional RVE problems and network depth up to 7. Based on linear elastic RVE data from offline direct numerical simulations, the material network can be effectively trained using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation algorithm, further enhanced by model compression methods. Importantly, the trained network is valid for any local material laws without the need for additional calibration or micromechanics assumption. Its extrapolations to unknown material and loading spaces for a wide range of problems are validated through numerical experiments, including linear elasticity with high contrast of phase properties, nonlinear history-dependent plasticity and finitestrain hyperelasticity under large deformations. By discovering a proper topological representation of RVE with fewer degrees of freedom, this intelligent material model is believed to open new possibilities of high-fidelity efficient concurrent simulations for a largescale heterogeneous structure. It also provides a mechanistic understanding of structure-property relations across material length scales and enables the development of parameterized microstructural database for material design and manufacturing.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;computation;distortion;elasticity (data store);experiment;extrapolation;machine learning;material design;mathematical morphology;mathematical optimization;multiphysics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;online and offline;optical fiber;parallel computing;polymer;residual stress;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stochastic gradient descent;synergy;tree (data structure)	Zeliang Liu;C.

However isotropic metrics have always been used to induce the flow of the curve and potential steady states tend to be difficult to determine numerically, especially in noisy or low-contrast situations. Initial curves shrink past the steady state and soon vanish. In this paper, anisotropic metrics are considered which remedy the situation by taking the orientation of the feature gradient into account. The problem of shape recovery or segmentation is formulated as the problem of finding minimum cuts of a Riemannian manifold. Approximate methods, namely anisotropic geodesic flows and solution of an eigenvalue problem are discussed.

These methods employ a hierarchy of representations of the problem on successively coarser meshes. The coarse-grid operators are usually defined by (Petrov-)Galerkin coarsening, which is a projection of the original operator using the restriction and prolongation transfer operators. Therefore, these transfer operators determine the sparsity pattern and operator complexity of the multigrid hierarchy. In many scenarios the multigrid operators tend to become much denser as the coarsening progresses. Such behavior is especially problematic in parallel AMG computations where it imposes an expensive communication overhead. In this work we present a new algebraic technique for controlling the sparsity pattern of the operators in the AMG hierarchy, independently of the choice of the restriction and prolongation. Our method is based on the aggregation multigrid framework, and it “sparsifies” Smoothed Aggregation operators while preserving their right and left near nullspaces. Numerical experiments for problems of convection-diffusion and diffusion with discontinuous coefficients demonstrate the efficiency and potential of this approach.	chomsky hierarchy;coefficient;computation;discretization;experiment;galerkin method;kernel (linear algebra);linear algebra;linear system;multigrid method;numerical method;overhead (computing);parallel computing;smoothed analysis;smoothing;sparse matrix	Eran Treister;Irad Yavneh	2015	SIAM J.

The resulting procedures are demonstrated on general curved 3D domains where the anisotropic mesh size field is defined by either an analytic expression or by an adaptive correction indicator as part of a flow solution process.	parallel computing;polygon mesh	Frédéric Alauzet;Xiangrong Li;E.

The main idea is to cast the coupling of the atomistic and continuum models as a constrained optimization problem with virtual Dirichlet controls on the interfaces between the atomistic and continuum subdomains. The optimization objective is to minimize the error between the atomistic and continuum solutions on the overlap between the two subdomains, while the atomistic and continuum force balance equations provide the constraints. Splitting of the atomistic and continuum problems instead of blending them and their subsequent use as constraints in the optimization problem distinguishes our approach from the existing AtC formulations. We present and analyze the method in the context of a one-dimensional chain of atoms modeled using a linearized two-body next-nearest neighbor interactions.	alpha compositing;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);interaction;mathematical optimization;molecular dynamics;optimization problem;triune continuum paradigm	Derek Olson;Pavel B.

fdec4a1840a2d4e6076f3295fbcf63d8e14b5adb	a numerical layer resolving method for the flow over a curved surface	body of revolution;boundary layers;parameter robust	We investigate the model problem of flow of a viscous incompressible fluid past a symmetric curved surface when the stream is parallel to its axis. When the Reynolds number is large, this problem is known to exhibit boundary layers which grow downstream and eventually shows a ‘‘3-D character’’ because of the large curvature of the body in the transverse direction. This problem does not have solutions in closed form. We employ a direct layer resolving numerical method that provides solutions that are accurate and robust. To show the direct numerical method is a robust layer-resolving method for the sphere, we provide extensive experimental evidence. We show that all results obtained, such as velocity components and their scaled derivatives, are robust with respect to the viscosity. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Many types of RBFs used in these problems contain a shape parameter, and there is much experimental evidence showing that accuracy strongly depends on the value of this shape parameter. In this paper, we focus on PDE problems solved with a multiquadric based RBF finite difference (RBF-FD) method. We propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal value of the shape parameter that minimizes the approximation error. The algorithm is based on analytical approximations to the local RBF-FD error derived in [1]. We show through several examples in 1D and 2D, both with structured and unstructured nodes, that very accurate solutions (compared to finite differences) can be achieved using the optimal value of the constant shape parameter.	radial basis function	Victor Bayona;Miguel Moscoso;Manuel Kindelan	2011	J.

18e0ccb3768188296a02d947dcfa65e4c8a8e863	doubly quasi-consistent fixed-stepsize numerical integration of stiff ordinary differential equations with implicit two-step peer methods		Abstract The problem of accurate and efficient numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a key issue of computation science, which has a valued practical impact in various topics of research. In this respect, effective global error estimation and control strategies are of particular theoretical and practical significance. They allow many applied dynamic systems to be treated numerically for user-supplied accuracy conditions in automatic mode. The property of double quasi-consistency plays an outstanding role in the mentioned topic because the global (or true) error of a doubly quasi-consistent method is asymptotically equal to its local error. Therefore, this entails quite a nontrivial implication that the true error of numerical integration can be cheaply evaluated and regulated within a single solution run. The latter was considered to be impossible for decades. The property of double quasi-consistency goes back to 2009, when Kulikov studied it in the first time but failed to find doubly quasi-consistent numerical methods among Nordsieck formulas. Later on, Kulikov and Weiner proved the existence of doubly quasi-consistent numerical schemes among superconvergent explicit two-step parallel peer methods and examined their practical efficiency in comparison to explicit Matlab ODE solvers in 2010. The focus of the present research is on accurate numerical integration formulas for treating stiff ODEs, which often arise in practice and for which explicit methods are shown to be ineffective. Here, we make the first step towards an accurate and efficient numerical solution of stiff ODEs and prove existence of implicit doubly quasi-consistent formulas. We fulfill our investigation of double quasi-consistency within the family of fixed-stepsize implicit two-step peer schemes and construct two methods of convergence orders 3 and 4, which possess excellent stability properties. Our theoretical results are confirmed with numerical integration of both nonstiff and stiff test problems in this paper.	numerical analysis;numerical integration;stiff equation	Gennady Y.

The displacement function is defined in terms of the radial and circumferential components of displacements, which is governed by a single partial differential equation of equilibrium. Solution of the elastic field is obtained in terms of the displacement function, in which both the uniform and mixed mode of boundary conditions are treated with equal sophistication. The application of the single function computational method is demonstrated through the numerical solutions of a number of problems of curved beams and rings with mixed boundary conditions. The soundness and accuracy of the investigation is verified through the comparison of results with those obtained by conventional computational and analytical approaches where available.	approximation;computation;computer program;displacement mapping;elasticity (data store);extrapolation;finite difference;freedos;interpolation;mesh networking;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;numerical analysis;numerical method;particle filter;qualitative comparative analysis;radial (radio)	S.

23bc564729b27d59952c2a511f9605fc59e5f911	an efficient sleepy algorithm for particle-based fluids		We present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) based algorithm for efficiently simulating compressible and weakly compressible particle fluids. Prior particle-based methods simulate all fluid particles; however, in many cases some particles appearing to be at rest can be safely ignored without notably affecting the fluid flow behavior. To identify these particles, a novel sleepy strategy is introduced. By utilizing this strategy, only a portion of the fluid particles requires computational resources; thus an obvious performance gain can be achieved. In addition, in order to resolve unphysical clumping issue due to tensile instability in SPH based methods, a new artificial repulsive force is provided. We demonstrate that our approach can be easily integrated with existing SPH based methods to improve the efficiency without sacrificing visual quality.	algorithm;bus bunching;central processing unit;computation;computational resource;game physics;graphics processing unit;instability;manycore processor;multi-core processor;physics engine;simulation;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;smoothing;speedup	Xiao Nie;Leiting Chen;Tao Xiang	2014	Int.

Our proof is based on the comparison of u to the solutions of linearized equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions at the position of the minimal front, with and without the logarithmic delay. Our analysis also yields the large-time convergence of the solutions u along their level sets to the profile of the minimal travelling front.	emoticon;fisher information;kernel patch protection	François Hamel;James Nolen;Jean-Michel Roquejoffre;Lenya Ryzhik	2013	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2013.8.275	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	Arch	84.76435755816138	9.106381992905572	184100

The error associated with quadratic spline interpolation is fourth order locally at certain points and third order globally, but the standard quadratic spline collocation methods generate only second-order approximations. In contrast, the OQSC methods generate approximations of the same order as quadratic spline interpolation. In the one-step OQSC method, the discrete differential operators are perturbed to eliminate low-order error terms, and a high-order approximation is computed using the perturbed operators. In the two-step OQSC method, a second-order approximation is generated first, using the standard formulation, and then a high-order approximation is computed in a second phase by perturbing the right sides of the equations appropriately. In this implementation, the SWEs are discretized in time using the semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, and in space using the OQSC methods. The resulting methods are efficient and yield stable and accurate representation of the meteorologically important Rossby waves. Moreover, by adopting the Arakawa C-type grid, the methods also faithfully capture the group velocity of inertia-gravity waves. waves.	collocation;spline (mathematics)	Anita T. Layton;Christina C.

The performance of both schemes is compared in two case studies: a model system and a real-world model of a parallel-plate glow discharge. The results indicate that the usage of CFS allows a considerable reduction of the number of grid points that is required to obtain the same accuracy.

Methods, such as finite volume, multigrid finite element schemes, sparse grid, wavelet approaches, and particle methods or gridless discretizations, all carry data structures, which are tailored to the respective method. These data structures reflect the decomposition of the function space as well as the decomposition in physical space. In this paper an efficient multiresolutional visualization approach is described, which tries to reuse as much of the hierarchical structure in the numerical data as possible. The duality between grid and function space, both carrying an intrinsic hierarchical structure, is explained as the key issue of the approach. Furthermore, a general method of local error measurement is discussed, which allows a reliable representation of the desired multiresolutional data. Finally, the method of spatial, hierarchical subdivision combined with the procedural recovery of the local function spaces is presented to address fairly general numerical data. This leads to a visualization beyond prescribed data formats. Examples from various numerical methods and different data bases underline the applicability of the proposed concept. c ©1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

85df7b76f322a38af51092bf5d976f913c6c5527	parallel energy-stable phase field crystal simulations based on domain decomposition methods		In this paper, we present a parallel numerical algorithm for solving the phase field crystal equation. In the algorithm, a semi-implicit finite difference scheme is derived based on the discrete variational derivative method. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the scheme is unconditionally energy stable and can achieve second-order accuracy in both space and time. An adaptive time step strategy is adopted such that the time step size can be flexibly controlled based on the dynamical evolution of the problem. At each time step, a nonlinear algebraic system is constructed from the discretization of the phase field crystal equation and solved by a domain decomposition based, parallel Newton–Krylov– Schwarz method with improved boundary conditions for subdomain problems. Numerical experiments with several two and three dimensional test cases show that the proposed algorithm is second-order accurate in both space and time, energy stable with large time steps, and highly scalable to over ten thousands processor cores on the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer.	a new kind of science;algorithm;calculus of variations;discretization;domain decomposition methods;dynamical system;experiment;explicit and implicit methods;finite difference method;functional derivative;langrisser schwarz;linear algebra;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;powerbuilder foundation classes;preconditioner;scalability;semiconductor industry;simulation;solver;steady state;stepping level;sunway taihulight;supercomputer;test case	Ying Wei;Chao Yang;Jizu Huang	2019	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2018.08.006	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics;geometry	HPC	91.40886307635841	14.57662059020471	185019

Not only does the computational complexity of the ML_CNGTD algorithm scale far more favorably than that of its two-level counterpart, the scheme is easier to implement because it uses a Cartesian as opposed to a spherical interpolation grid. Contrary to other fast methods for evaluating transient fields, the ML_CNGTD algorithm applies uniformly to the lowand high-frequency regimes, and is remarkably simple to implement.	algorithmic efficiency;bandlimiting;computation;computational complexity theory;genetic algorithm;interpolation;norm (social);numerical analysis;radiate;regular grid;sampling (signal processing);seamless3d;simulation;sparse matrix;temporal logic	Jun Meng;Amir Boag;Vitaliy Lomakin;Eric Michielssen	2010	J.

eb7105b6e27a42f605b2e0e7799960e3e82ca0a1	on hanging node constraints for nonconforming finite elements using the douglas-santos-sheen-ye element as an example		On adaptively refined quadrilateral or hexahedral meshes, one usually employs constraints on degrees of freedom to deal with hanging nodes. How these constraints are constructed is relatively straightforward for conforming finite element methods: The constraints are used to ensure that the discrete solution space remains a subspace of the continuous space. On the other hand, for nonconforming methods, this guiding principle is not available and one needs other ways of ensuring that the discrete space has desirable properties. In this paper, we investigate how one would construct hanging node constraints for nonconforming elements, using the Douglas–Santos–Sheen–Ye (DSSY) element as a prototypical case. We identify three possible strategies, two of which lead to provably convergent schemes with different properties. For both of these, we show that the structure of the constraints differs qualitatively from the way constraints are usually dealt with in the conforming case.	conformity;converge;experiment;feasible region;finite element method;hexahedron;numerical analysis;polygon mesh	Wolfgang Bangerth;Imbunm Kim;Dongwoo Sheen;Jaeryun Yim	2017	SIAM J.

A recently proposed medial axis reduction is one such method, that is particularly well suited for analyzing thin solids, wherein a governing equation is reduced to the medial axis, leading to significantly smaller stiffness matrices. However, this method involves the non-trivial computation of a piece-wise C1 continuous medial axis that must closely approximate the exact medial axis.In this paper, we propose a new medial mesh reduction that is computationally more efficient than medial axis reduction in that it only requires a C0 continuous tessellation of the medial axis. However, the proposed method retains all the advantages of the explicit medial axis reduction including automation and guaranteed numerical convergence. Furthermore, as the medial mesh converges to the exact medial axis, the computed solution also converges to the exact dimensionally reduced solution. These claims are substantiated through numerical experiments in 2-D and 3-D.	apache axis;approximation algorithm;computation;experiment;level of detail;medial graph;numerical analysis;optic axis of a crystal;simulation	Murari Sinha;Krishnan Suresh	2005		10.1145/1060244.1060267	engineering analysis;medial axis;cad;mathematics;geometry	Robotics	95.97978595081071	11.443253251949786	185576

These difference equations can arise directly in the description of physical systems, e.g. crystal structures, or indirectly through the discretization of PDEs. In the analog to solving continuous inhomogeneous differential equations using Green’s functions, the proposed method uses the fundamental solution of the discrete operator on an infinite grid, or lattice Green’s function. Fast solutions O(N) are achieved by using a kernelindependent interpolation-based fast multipole method. Unlike other fast multipole algorithms, our approach exploits the regularity of the underlying Cartesian grid and the efficiency of FFTs to reduce the computation time. Our parallel implementation allows communications and computations to be overlapped and requires minimal global synchronization. The accuracy, efficiency, and parallel performance of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on the discrete 3D Poisson equation.	algorithm;computation;crystal structure;discretization;experiment;fast multipole method;interpolation;numerical analysis;recurrence relation;regular grid;tcp global synchronization;time complexity	Sebastian Liska;Tim Colonius	2014	J.

We study compatible relaxation type estimates for the quality of the coarse grid and derive a new sharp measure using optimal interpolation that provides a guaranteed lower bound on the convergence rate of the resulting two-grid method for a given grid. In addition, we design a generalized bootstrap algebraic multigrid setup algorithm that computes a sparse approximation to the optimal interpolation matrix. We demonstrate numerically that the BAMG method with sparse interpolation matrix (and spanning multiple levels) outperforms the two-grid method with the standard ideal interpolation (a dense matrix) for various scalar diffusion problems with highly varying diffusion coefficient.	interpolation;linear programming relaxation;multigrid method	James J.

The hybrid WENO method adopts the WENO reconstruction in the region where the jump discontinuity exists, while other high order reconstruction is adopted in the smooth region. Thus for the hybrid WENO method, the jump location should be identified before the adoption. Various edge detection methods have been developed mostly focusing on finding edges as accurately as possible utilizing as many stencils as possible. However, if the reconstruction in the smooth area is obtained with the fixed finite number of cells, it would suffice to examine whether the considered stencils need to adopt the WENO reconstruction instead of finding edges in a global manner. In this note, we compare the multi-resolution analysis with the local monotone polynomial method for the   5     5       th order hybrid WENO method. The monotone method uses the cell information within the given stencil only to decide whether to adopt the WENO reconstruction or not. In this sense, the local method is optimal. We provide a detailed numerical study and show that the monotone polynomial method is efficient and accurate.	edge detection;numerical analysis;polynomial;monotone	Jingyang Guo;Jae-Hun Jung	2017	J.

This problem is a popular and useful model problem for performance comparisons of iterative methods for the solution of linear systems. To use the successive overrelaxation (SOR) method in these comparisons, a formula for the optimal value of its relaxation parameter is needed. In standard texts, this value is only available for the case of two space dimensions, even though the model problem is also instructive in higher dimensions. This note extends the derivation of the optimal relaxation parameter to any space dimension and confirms its validity by test calculations in three dimensions.

The convolution integral is approximated by high order Gauss-Lobatto quadratures. A second order implicit/explicit (IMEX) approximation is used to integrate in time, with the convolution integral integrated explicitly. The method is spectrally accurate (exponentially convergent) in space for the solution and Greeks, and second-order accurate in time. The spectral element solution to the Black-Scholes equation is ten to one hundred times faster than commonly used second order finite difference methods.	spectral element method	Wuming Zhu;David A.

Prastaro, Extended crystal PDE's (submitted for publication)]. In fact, their integral bordism groups can be considered as extensions of subgroups of crystallographic groups. This allows us to identify a characteristic class that measures the obstruction to the existence of global solutions. In part I [A. Prastaro, Extended crystal PDE's stability, I: The general theory, Math. Comput. Modelling, 49 (9-10) (2009) 1759-1780] we identified criteria to recognize PDE's that are stable (in extended Ulam sense) and in their regular smooth solutions, finite time instabilities do not occur (stable extended crystal PDE's). Here, we study in some detail, a new PDE encoding anisotropic incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. Stable extended crystal MHD-PDE's are obtained, where in their smooth solutions, instabilities do not occur in finite time. These results are considered first for systems without a body energy source, and later, by also introducing a contribution from an energy source, in order to take into account nuclear energy production. A condition in order that solutions satisfy the second principle of thermodynamics is given.

A viscoelastic model of the brain parenchyma with pulsatile ventricular pressure The classical theory of consolidation has been used in Tenti et al. [1] to study some of the biomechanical properties of the brain which are of importance in hydrocephalus research. A complementary approach which is equally of relevance in the study and understanding of hydrocephalus is the determination of the viscoelastic behaviour of the brain parenchyma and this has been examined in Sivaloganathan et al. [2]. The simplified model used in [1] and [2] represents the brain as a thickwalled tethered cylindrical tube so that the strain distribution is planar. The inside wall of the tube is kept at a constant pressure pi while the outside wall is kept at a lower constant pressure p0. In this paper we consider an extension of the work presented in [2] which is possibly of more physical relevance. We replace the constant pressure at the inner wall by a pulsatile pressure. Physically, the beating of the heart is felt as a periodic pulse within the ventricular cavity. An analysis of this kind allows for the distinct possibility of determining relevant mechanical parameters from the data obtained from dynamic load experiments many of which have been reported in the literature (see [3–5]). We follow standard practice (see [6,7]) in assuming that the deviatoric parts of the stress and strain tensors behave in accordance with the standard viscoelastic models, whilst the dilatational part still obeys Hooke s law. This simplifies the mathematics, and the number of mechanically significant parameters is kept to a reasonable minimum. However it is possible with a little further effort to model both deviatoric and dilatational responses as viscoelastic, and to solve the problem where the displacement on the outer boundary is zero (this corresponds to the case of adult hydrocephalus where the skull or outer boundary is rigid). 2. Mathematical formulation For a review of the basic elements of linear viscoelasticity theory, we refer the reader to [6] and [8]. An important question to be considered in modelling the brain parenchyma concerns the most appropriate choice of viscoelastic model that would realistically model the behaviour of the brain tissue. Clearly, the Maxwell and Kelvin–Voigt models are unsuitable in light of the objections raised in [2], and thus we use the ‘‘standard solid’’ as a more appropriate model than the Maxwell or Kelvin–Voigt model. The constitutive equation for the standard solid is given by (see [2]) 1 E1 þ 1 E2 rþ g E1E2 dr dt 1⁄4 eþ g E2 de dt : ð1Þ S. Sivaloganathan et al. / Appl. Math. Comput. 165 (2005) 687–698 689 As in [2], we assume that the brain can be represented as a thick-walled tube, the inside of which is kept at a pressure pi (representing the ventricular pressure) whilst the outer wall is kept at a lower constant pressure p0 (i.e. the superior sagittal sinus pressure). Without loss of generality, we set p0 = 0.

In a channel of nite width, this problem is the crystalline analog of the classic Saaman-Taylor smooth nger in Hele-Shaw ow. By a combination of analysis and numerical Schwarz-Christooel mapping methods, we show that, as for solutions of the smooth problem, for each choice of Wull shape there is a critical maximum value of the magnitude of surface tension above which no convex steady-state solutions exist. We then exhibit convergence of convex crystalline solutions to convex smooth solutions as the Wull shape approaches a circle. We also consider the open dendrite geometry, and show that there are no steady-state solutions having a nite number of sides for any crystalline surface energy. This is in striking contrast to the smooth case, and is an indication that the time-dependent behavior may be more complicated for crystalline surface energies.	algorithm;converge;langrisser schwarz;mathematical optimization;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical analysis;parallels desktop for mac;steady state;whole earth 'lectronic link	Robert Almgren	1995	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S0036139993259908	mathematical optimization;morphology;calculus;mathematical model;mathematics;geometry;physics	Vision	88.58623682648363	4.5621354349468515	186681

The key idea is to use trial functions satisfying the underlying boundary conditions of the differential equations and test functions satisfying the “dual” boundary conditions. The method leads to linear systems which are sparse for problems with constant coefficients and well-conditioned for problems with variable coefficients. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results indicate that the proposed method is extremely accurate and efficient, and most suitable for the study of complex dynamics of higher odd-order equations.	coefficient;complex dynamics;condition number;discretization;distribution (mathematics);galerkin method;lagrange multiplier;linear system;numerical analysis;sparse matrix	Jie Shen	2003	SIAM J.

The two systems have different closure laws and are coupled through a thin fixed interface. Following the work of [5], we propose to couple these systems by a bounded vector-valued Dirac measure, concentrated at the coupling interface, which in the applications may have a physical meaning. We show that the proposed framework allows to control the coupling conditions and we propose an approximate Riemann solver based on a relaxation approach preserving equilibrium solutions of the coupled problem. Numerical experiments in constrained optimization problems are then presented to assess the performances of the present method.	approximation algorithm;constrained optimization;euler;experiment;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;performance;riemann solver	Frédéric Coquel;Edwige Godlewski;Khalil Haddaoui;Claude Marmignon;Florent Renac	2016	Math.

In this paper, we introduce dimensionless function, called rate of multiplicity, which estimates the order of multiplicity of the roots, as a dynamic global concept, in order to accelerate iterative processes. This rate works not only with integer but also fractional order of multiplicity and even with poles (negative order of multiplicity).	iterative method;nonlinear system	Vicente F. Candela;R.

The convergence of the introduced iterative algorithm is proved using the contraction principle. The method is supported by considering a number of numerical examples that correspond to different cases of eigenvalues. The procedure underlying the strategy reduces calculations and provides highly accurate results in comparison with the exact solution and/or numerical solutions provided in the literature. The current method overcomes the difficulty of treating the problem for eigenvalues near and at the critical value, such as λ = 3 and λ = 3.51, and handles them reliably and very efficiently.	algorithm;fixed point (mathematics);iteration;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method	H.

Such problems can be described by a time dependent variational inequality, where the displacement and the plastic strain fields serve as primal variables. After discretization in time, one variational inequality of the second kind is obtained per time step and can be reformulated as each one minimization problem with a convex energy functional which depends smoothly on the displacement and non-smoothly on the plastic strain. There exists an explicit formula how to minimize the energy functional with respect to the plastic strain for a given displacement. By substitution, the energy functional can be written as a functional depending only on the displacement. The theorem of Moreau from convex analysis states that the energy functional is differentiable with an explicitly computable first derivative. The second derivative of the energy functional does not exist, hence the plastic strain minimizer is not differentiable on the elastoplastic interface, which separates the continuum in elastically and plastically deformed parts. A Newton-like method exploiting slanting functions of the energy functional’s first derivative instead of the nonexistent second derivative is applied. Such method is called a slant Newton method for short. The local super-linear convergence of the slant Newton method in the discrete case is shown and sufficient regularity assumptions are formulated, which would guarantee the local super-linear convergence also in the continuous case.	algorithm;calculus of variations;computable function;convex analysis;discretization;displacement mapping;newton;newton's method;rate of convergence;smoothing;social inequality;triune continuum paradigm;variational inequality	Peter Gruber;Jan Valdman	2009	SIAM J.

70d2459dfd7b6bb74a4cde964efcac8267a9d0a5	anisotropic masonry failure criterion using artificial neural networks		In the last decades, a plethora of advanced computational models and techniques have been proposed on the modeling, assessment and design of masonry structures. The successful application of such sophisticated models necessitates the development of reliable analytical models capable of describing the failure of masonry materials. Nevertheless, there is a lack of analytical models due to the anisotropic and brittle nature exhibited by the masonry materials. In the present paper, the use of neural networks (NNs) is proposed to approximate the failure surface of masonry materials in dimensionless form. The comparison of the derived results with experimental findings as well as analytical results demonstrates the promising potential of using NNs for the reliable and robust approximation of the masonry failure surface under biaxial stress.	analytical engine;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;computation;computational model	Panagiotis G.

First we derive a generalized spherical mean value relation which is an extension of the classical integral mean value relation for the Laplace equation. Next we give a probabilistic interpretation of the kernel. The distribution on the sphere generated by this kernel is then related to the von Mises–Fisher distribution on the sphere which can be efficiently simulated. The rigorous expressions are given for the case of constant velocity drift, but the algorithm is then extended to solve drift-diffusion problems with arbitrary varying drift velocity vector. Applications to cathodoluminescence and EBIC imaging of defects and dislocations in semiconductors are discussed.	walk-on-spheres method	Karl K.

Uniaxial deformations are considered for a material with linear constitutive law of strain second gradient elasticity. Applying tension on an elastic bar, necking is shown up in high strains. That means the axial strain forms two homogeneously deformed sections in the ends of the bars and a section in the middle with high variable strain. The interactions of the intrinsic (material) lengths with the non linear strain displacement relations develop critical states of bifurcation with continuous Fourier’s spectrum. Critical conditions and post-critical deformations are defined with the help of multiple scales perturbation method.	gradient	D. G. Bakogianni;K. A.

Comput. Phys., Vol. 255, 2013, pp 680-698] originally constructed for solving the BGK equation, to the more challenging case of the Boltzmann equation. The scheme combines a robust and fast method for treating the transport part based on an innovative Lagrangian technique supplemented with fast spectral schemes to treat the collisional operator by means of an operator splitting approach. This approach along with several implementation features related to the parallelization of the algorithm permits to construct an efficient simulation tool which is numerically tested against exact and reference solutions on classical problems arising in rarefied gas dynamic. We present results up to the 3D×3D case for unsteady flows for the Variable Hard Sphere model which may serve as benchmark for future comparisons between different numerical methods for solving the multidimensional Boltzmann equation. For this reason, we also provide for each problem studied details on the computational cost and memory consumption as well as comparisons with the BGK model or the limit model of compressible Euler equations.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the linearization of nonlinear failure criteria. The proposed method is based on an iterative procedure and the leastsquares regression is used for the linearization. The material is assumed to be elastic-perfectly plastic. By conducting analytical and finite element analyses of stresses and displacements around underground openings in rock mass governed by the generalized Hoek–Brown failure criterion, it is shown that the proposed method is convergent, efficient and effective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We formulate a variational setting in which the proposed energy functional admits minimizers, both in the case of free graphene layers and under back-gating. We further provide conditions under which those minimizers are unique and correspond to configurations consisting of inhomogeneous density profiles of charge carrier of only one type. The associated Euler–Lagrange equation for the charge density is also obtained, and uniqueness, regularity and decay of the minimizers are proved under general conditions. In addition, a bifurcation from zero to nonzero response at a finite threshold value of the external charge is proved. Communicated by Felix Otto. B Cyrill B.

The asymptotic behavior of such systems as the relaxation parameter vanishes is governed by a reduced parabolic system, and it is desirable to have schemes that are able to capture the correct diffusive limit. The hyperbolic part becomes stiff when the system relaxes towards the parabolic equation. For this reason, in previous works part of the hyperbolic terms are treated implicitly [S. Jin, L. Pareschi, and G. Toscani, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 35 (1998), pp. 2405--2439], [S. Jin and L. Pareschi, J. Comp. Phys., 161 (2000), pp. 312--330], [G. Naldi and L. Pareschi, SIAM J. Numer.

6ff751638348ef27f7aa8f847292b4c71e2596ca	a composite pseudospectral method for optimal control problems with piecewise smooth solutions		In this paper, we develop a composite collocation approximation scheme for solving optimal control problems governed by ordinary differential equations with piecewise smooth solutions. For this purpose, we divide the time interval of the problem into some nonequal subintervals and define a piecewise interpolating polynomial on the base of transformed Legendre-Gauss nodes in subintervals. According to the weak representations approach, we derive the corresponding operational matrix of derivative. Using the Legendre-Gauss quadrature formula and the obtained operational matrix, the optimal control problem is discretized as a nonlinear programming problem. In this approach, the time locations in which corners happen in the state and control functions, are considered as unknown parameters. Therefore, the problem can be solved as a nonlinear programming problem with respect to these parameters. Four examples are investigated to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed technique.	pseudo-spectral method;pseudospectral optimal control	Hamid Reza Tabrizidooz;Hamid Reza Marzban;Marzieh Pourbabaee;Mehrnoosh Hedayati	2017	J.

With the help of Computational Aided Design (CAD) software packages, the geometries of recycling cyclone, has been constructed. With the suitable domain decomposition for the cyclone geometry, multi-block structured mesh has been generated and exported to commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solver - TASCflow. After assembling these grids in the flow solver, duplicate elements at mating surfaces are eliminated through generalized grid interfaces. Incompressible viscous flow for the specified flow conditions are simulated and numerical results are interpreted through contour plots and streak lines. The velocity distribution pattern obtained from the analysis exhibits strong flow recirculation with large turbulent eddies in the cyclone outlet. The analysis also observed high pressure drop across the cyclone separator. To improve the velocity distribution and to reduce the pressure drop, geometry has been modified with the deflector plates in the outlet duct and repeated the simulation. The results obtained for modified geometry are encouraging and shown the improved velocity distribution pattern in the outlet duct. The calculation of particle trajectories depends upon Stokes number, relative velocity of fluid/particles and concentration of particles. If the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of particle response time to system response time is less than one, particles motion is inline with the fluid motion. If the Stokes number is greater than one, particle motion deviates the fluid streams. Effects of these particle impacts are significant on component surface, especially, when they reacts/rebounds the wall surfaces.	cyclone;industrial pc;simulation	C.

A complementarity algorithm enforces appropriate contact boundary conditions along the cracks so that variable friction and frictional strength can be included. This method accurately computes slip and opening distributions along the cracks, displacement and stress fields within the surrounding material, and stress intensity factors at the crack tips. The DDM with complementarity is a simple yet powerful tool to investigate many aspects of the mechanical behavior of faults and fractures in Earth's brittle crust.

Special treatment for these coordinate singularities is necessary in spectral approximations in order to avoid degradation of accuracy and efficiency. It has been observed numerically in the past that, for a scheme to attain high accuracy, it is unnecessary to impose all the pole conditions, the constraints representing the special solution behavior near singularities. In this paper we provide a theoretical justification for this observation. Specifically, we consider an existing approach, which uses a pole condition as the boundary condition at a singularity and solves the reformulated boundary value problem with a commonly used Gauss–Lobatto collocation scheme. Spectral convergence of the Legendre and Chebyshev collocation methods is obtained for a singular differential equation arising from polar and cylindrical geometries.	approximation;collocation;elegant degradation;numerical analysis;upwind scheme	Weizhang Huang;Heping Ma;Weiwei Sun	2003	SIAM J.

Thus complex geometries which even may vary in time can be treated efficiently using discretizations on a Cartesian grid. A mathematical analysis of the method is conducted first for the one-dimensional heat equation which yields estimates of the penalization error. The results are then confirmed numerically in one and two space dimensions. Simulations of two-dimensional incompressible flows with passive scalars using a classical Fourier pseudo-spectral method validate the approach for moving obstacles. The potential of the method for real world applications is illustrated by simulating a simplified dynamical mixer where for the fluid flow and the scalar transport no-slip and no-flux boundary conditions are imposed, respectively. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It is then possible to introduce w such that u curl w, and show that w is the solution of a biharmonic equation. The solution ofeach ofthese problems can be given a variational formulation and approximated by finite elements. It is not at all clear a priori why any one of these methods should be preferred. Although the stress can be recovered from each of the formulations, it may be preferable to have a method which solves directly for the physical variable of interest. Although many of the mixed and hybrid methods discussed in the book were developed in different contexts by both mathematicians and engineers, they all have a common mathematical framework, which the authors use to unify the presentation of results. In particular, all the methods are based on a variational principle expressing an equilibrium (saddle point) condition rather than a minimization principle. The theory developed is illustrated by application to four model problems: boundary value problems for Laplace’s equation, linear elasticity, the Stokes problem for viscous incompressible flow, and the deflection of a thin, clamped plate. After a brief review of variational formulations and finite element methods, the authors turn to the abstract approximation of saddle point problems. In the model problems, various function spaces arise in the variational formulation, and the authors then consider the construction of appropriate finite-dimensional approximating spaces. Both conforming (i.e., when the finite-dimensional subspaces are subspaces of the original space) and nonconforming spaces are considered. This theory is then applied to develop approximation schemes and error estimates for the model problems mentioned above. At the end ofthe book, the authors extend the theory to the ReissnerMindlin plate model, sometimes used to model plates of moderate thickness. In summary, this book presents a very readable and unified account of a large collection of results that show the richness and variety of the finite element methodology for the approximation of partial differential equations. The authors have been major contributors to the development of new mixed and hybrid finite methods and to their mathematical analysis, and that expertise is clearly reflected in the book in the variety of examples and methods of proof. Both new and long-time researchers in finite elements can gain substantial insight by reading this book, and I highly recommend it.	approximation algorithm;computer-aided design;elasticity (data store);finite element method;human-readable medium;navier–stokes equations;numerical integration;span and div;thickness (graph theory);variable (computer science);variational principle;curl	Gerald E.

The goal of such approach is to construct an interpolant in space that corresponds to the """"best M -terms"""" based on sharp a priori estimate of polynomial coefficients. In the past, SG methods have been successful in achieving this, with a traditional construction that relies on the solution to a Knapsack problem: only the most profitable hierarchical surpluses are added to the SG. However, this approach requires additional sharp estimates related to the size of the analytic region and the norm of the interpolation operator, i.e., the Lebesgue constant. Instead, we present an iterative SG procedure that adaptively refines an estimate of the region and accounts for the effects of the Lebesgue constant. Our approach does not require any a priori knowledge of the analyticity or operator norm, is easily generalized to both affine and non-affine analytic functions, and can be applied to sparse grids built from one dimensional rules with arbitrary growth of the number of nodes. In several numerical examples, we utilize our dynamically adaptive SG to interpolate quantities of interest related to the solutions of parametrized elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs, and compare the performance of our quasi-optimal interpolant to several alternative SG schemes."""	interpolation;sparse grid;sparse matrix	Miroslav Stoyanov;Clayton G.

We begin with a review of the fast and accurate NUFFT based method in [29] for nonlocal interactions where the singularity of the Fourier symbol of the interaction kernel at the origin can be canceled by switching to spherical or polar coordinates. We then extend the method to compute other nonlocal interactions whose Fourier symbols have stronger singularity at the origin that cannot be canceled by the coordinate transform. Many of these interactions do not decay at infinity in the physical space, which adds another layer of complexity since it is more difficult to impose the correct artificial boundary conditions for the truncated bounded computational domain. The performance of our method against other existing methods is illustrated numerically, with particular attention on the effect of the size of the computational domain in the physical space. Finally, to study the ground state and dynamics of the NLSE, we propose efficient and accurate numerical methods by combining the NUFFT method for potential evaluation with the normalized gradient flow using backward Euler Fourier pseudospectral discretization and time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method, respectively. Extensive numerical comparisons are carried out between these methods and other existing methods for computing the ground state and dynamics of the NLSE with various nonlocal interactions. Numerical results show that our scheme performs much better than those existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.	aharonov–bohm effect;discretization;euler;fast fourier transform;gradient;ground state;interaction;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;pseudo-spectral method;schrödinger;technological singularity	Weizhu Bao;Shidong Jiang;Qinglin Tang;Yong Zhang	2015	J.

Most of already existing subgrid closures used in LES-LBM are straightforward extensions of the most crudemodel developedwithin theNavier–Stokes equations, namely the Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model. In a first part, it is shown how to obtain an improved eddy-viscosity subgrid model for LBM. The original implementation of the Inertial-Range Consistent Smagorinsky model proposed by Dong and Sagaut for the D3Q19 scheme is used as an illustration. In a second step, an original extension of the Approximate Deconvolution Method proposed by Adams and Stolz for Navier–Stokes simulation is proposed. This new LBM-LES approach does not rely on the eddy-viscosity concept and is written directly within the LBM framework. It is shown that it can be implemented thanks to a trivial modification of the existing LBM solvers for Direct Numerical Simulation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The operational method was employed to construct particular solutions for them. Inverse differential operators and operational exponent as well as operational definitions and operational rules for generalized orthogonal polynomials were used together with integral transforms and special functions. Examples of an electric charge in a constant electric field passing under a potential barrier and of heat diffusion were compared and explored in two dimensions. Non-Fourier heat propagation models were studied and compared with each other and with Fourier heat transfer. Exact analytical solutions for the hyperbolic heat equation and for its extensions were explored. The exact analytical solution for the Guyer-Krumhansl type heat equation was derived. Using the latter, the heat surge propagation and relaxation was studied for the Guyer-Krumhansl heat transport model, for the Cattaneo and for the Fourier models. The comparison between them was drawn. Space-time propagation of a power–exponential function and of a periodic signal, obeying the Fourier law, the hyperbolic heat equation and its extended Guyer-Krumhansl form were studied by the operational technique. The role of various terms in the equations was explored and their influence on the solutions demonstrated. The accordance of the solutions with maximum principle is discussed. The application of our theoretical study for heat propagation in thin films is considered. The examples of the relaxation of the initial laser flash, the wide heat spot, and the harmonic function are considered and solved analytically.	3d film;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);bessel filter;emoticon;exponential polynomial;linear programming relaxation;monomial;numerical analysis;obedience (human behavior);operational definition;rectangular potential barrier;software propagation;term (logic);time complexity	Konstantin V.

A new FDTD/PBC-based algorithm is introduced to analyze general skewed grid periodic structures while another algorithm is developed to analyze dispersive periodic structures. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are successfully integrated with the generalized scattering matrix (GSM) technique, identified as the hybrid FDTD-GSM algorithm, to efficiently analyze multilayer periodic structures. All the developed algorithms are easy to implement and are efficient in both computational time and memory usage. These algorithms are validated through several numerical test cases.

In this paper, we introduce a general model of soft bodies with SPH fluid modeling as one of the components for interaction among particles. The fluid force in SPH depends on the density of neighboring fluid particles in the kernel of the considered particle. The fluid force is related to fluid attributes such as fluid density, fluid pressure, and fluid viscosity. Computation becomes faster if the neighboring fluid particles are known during the computations of the fluid attributes. In our simulation of soft body model, the kernels of the fluid attributes are identical, and hence we use the same neighboring fluid particles to evaluate the fluid attributes. In this paper we introduce partitioning and hashing schemes to identify the neighboring fluid particles for SPH to compute the fluid force in the soft body simulation. The suitable parameters for the partitioning and hashing schemes are presented for the modeling. Experimental results show that the grid based scheme can reduce time computation in SPH for fluid modeling in real time applications. We also present a result of a soft body in which the model includes all forces.	computation;computational fluid dynamics;cryptographic hash function;experiment;physics engine;real-time computing;simulation;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics	Jaruwan Mesit;Ratan K.

f206ba509547686fcb13b6e5a43714a09eb6a09a	exact diatomic fermi-pasta-ulam-tsingou solitary waves with optical band ripples at infinity		We study the existence of solitary waves in a diatomic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice. For monatomic FPUT the traveling wave equations are a regular perturbation of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation's but, surprisingly, we find that for the diatomic lattice the traveling wave equations are a singular perturbation of KdV's. Using a method first developed by Beale to study traveling solutions for capillary-gravity waves we demonstrate that for wave speeds in slight excess of the lattice's speed of sound there exists nontrivial traveling wave solutions which are the superposition an exponentially localized solitary wave and a periodic wave whose amplitude is extremely small. That is to say, we construct nanopteron solutions. The presence of the periodic wave is an essential part of the analysis and is connected to the fact that linear diatomic lattices have optical band waves with any possible phase speed.	fiber-optic communication	Timothy E.

We show that given any two positive integers K, L, for p sufficiently large, there exists a solution concentrating in K interior points and L boundary points.

8d0bfcf554b3660d24380798561d506610388483	a computational strategy to establish algebraic parameters for the reference resistance design of metal shell structures		The new Reference Resistance Design (RRD) method, recently developed by Rotter [1], for the manual dimensioning of metal shell structures effectively permits an analyst working with only a calculator or spreadsheet to take full advantage of the realism and accuracy of an advanced nonlinear finite element (FE) calculation. The method achieves this by reformulating the outcomes of a vast programme of parametric FE calculations in terms of six algebraic parameters and two resistances, each representing a physical aspect of the shell's behaviour.#R##N##R##N#The formidable challenge now is to establish these parameters and resistances for the most important shell geometries and load cases. The systems that have received by far the most research attention for RRD are that of a cylindrical shell under uniform axial compression and uniform bending. Their partial algebraic characterisations required thousands of finite element calculations to be performed across a four-dimensional parameter hyperspace (i.e. length, radius to thickness ratio, imperfection amplitude, linear strain hardening modulus).#R##N##R##N#Handling so many nonlinear finite element models is time-consuming and the quantities of data generated can be overwhelming. This paper illustrates a computational strategy to deal with both issues that may help researchers establish sets of RRD parameters for other important shell systems with greater confidence and accuracy. The methodology involves full automation of model generation, submission, termination and processing with object-oriented scripting, illustrated using code and pseudocode fragments.		Adam J.

The MFMFE methods are locally conservative with continuous normal fluxes, since they are developed within a variational framework as mixed finite element methods with special approximating spaces and quadrature rules. The latter allows for local flux elimination giving a cell-centered system for the scalar variable. We study two versions of the method: with a symmetric quadrature rule on smooth grids and a non-symmetric quadrature rule on rough grids. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate first order convergence for problems with full-tensor coefficients. Second order superconvergence is observed on smooth grids.	calculus of variations;coefficient;finite element method;flux limiter;geodesic grid;hexahedron;multipoint ground;numerical analysis;numerical integration;superconvergence;variable (computer science);video post-processing	Mary F.

The all-at-once methods were applied in recent years for optimal control problems governed by linear elliptic and parabolic equations. For space discretization, we use the Galerkin finite element method. The nonlinear Burgers equation is discretized in time using the semi-implicit discretization which results an effective linearization of the optimal control problem. An a priori error analysis is developed for the state, adjoint and control variables. This all-at-once approach leads to the solution of an indefinite saddle point problem, which is usually solved iteratively using preconditioners. Because the Burgers equation is one dimensional in space, the saddle point system can be solved efficiently by direct solvers. Numerical results for distributed unconstrained and control constrained problems illustrate the performance of all-at-once approach with semi-implicit time discretization.	computation;discretization;error analysis (mathematics);finite element method;galerkin method;magdeburg;nonlinear system;numerical method;open platform communications;optimal control;parabolic antenna;preconditioner;semiconductor industry	Fikriye Yilmaz;Bülent Karasözen	2014	J.

Then the simple central-upwind schemes based on central weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions are proposed in this paper for computing the oneand twodimensional steady and unsteady models. Since the non-uniform width of the different local Riemann fans is calculated more accurately, the central-upwind schemes enjoy a much smaller numerical viscosity as well as the staggering between two neighboring sets of grids is avoided. Synchronously, due to the central-upwind schemes are combined with the fourth-order central weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions, the schemes have the non-oscillatory behavior. The numerical results show the desired accuracy, high-resolution, and robustness of our methods. © 2005 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The equilibrium is computed from external magnetic fields that are calculated numerically using the Biot–Savart law applied to a complex set of coils. These fields must be evaluated on the plasma boundary, which evolves as the equilibrium converges. The improved efficiency of the present method results from dynamically building and storing a database of magnetic field components on a grid that is determined by the changing plasma boundary itself. When possible, field values on the plasma boundary for a particular iteration are interpolated from these grid values, thus eliminating the need for further time-consuming Biot–Savart calculations. New grid points are added to the database only when the boundary moves outside the spatial range of previously computed interpolation values. This dynamical method is particularly efficient when the equilibrium calculation is embedded in an optimization loop, where evolution of the coil set requires many reevaluations of the database.	computation;embedded system;interpolation;iteration;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;plasma active;requirement;time complexity	S.

A localisation argument involves a Lipschitz partition of unity such as nodal basis functions known from finite element methods. The abstract estimate does not use any property of the discrete solution, but simplifies for the Galerkin discretisation of Symm’s integral equation if piecewise constants belong to the test space. The estimate suggests an isotropic adaptive algorithm for automatic mesh-refinement. An alternative motivation from a two-level error estimate is possible but then requires a saturation assumption. The efficiency of an anisotropic version is discussed and supported by numerical experiments.	adaptive algorithm;basis function;discretization;experiment;finite element method;galerkin method;numerical analysis;refinement (computing)	Carsten Carstensen;Matthias Maischak;Ernst P.

1bc690f93fb42fbc2f05749bdc10b858c009049a	a multi-resolution multiscale finite volume method for simulation of fluid flows in heterogeneous porous media	finite volume method;multi point flux approximation;porous media;multi resolution grids;multiscale	This paper presents an extension of the multiscale finite volume (MsFV) method to multi-resolution coarse grid solvers for single phase incompressible flows. To achieve this, a grid one level coarser than the coarse grids used in the MsFV method is constructed and the local problems are redefined to compute the basis and correction functions associated with this new grid. To construct the coarse-scale pressure equations, the coarse-scale transmissibility coefficients are calculated using a new multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) method. The estimated coarse-scale pressures are utilized to compute the multiscale pressure solution. Finally a reconstruction step is performed to produce a conservative velocity field which is used to solve the transport equations. The computational cost of the proposed method is compared with that of the MsFV method and the relevant time complexity formulas are given. Several two-dimensional test cases with permeability fields ranging from two-scale to multi-scale problems are solved. The performance of the proposed method in handling problems with shale layers or discrete fractures is assessed. Also, a number of layers from the tenth SPE comparative study problem are used to examine general abilities of the method when facing realistic reservoir problems. The results are compared with fine-scale reference solutions to assess the accuracy of the proposed method.	finite volume method;simulation	Mehdi Mosharaf Dehkordi;Mehrdad Taghizadeh Manzari	2013	J.

In particular, the compressibility number κ := ρ′/ρ is regarded as essential in showing our stability results.	courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method;lp-type problem;navier–stokes equations;polynomial;steady state;velocity (software development)	Jae Ryong Kweon	2000	SIAM J.

The convergence of \(u_{{\mathcal D}}\) to u is shown as the size of the space and time steps tend to zero. In a first step, estimates on \(u_{{\mathcal D}}\) are used to prove the convergence, up to a subsequence, of \(u_{{\mathcal D}}\) to a measure valued entropy solution (called here an entropy process solution).

In order to capture the small scale heterogeneity, a new mixed multiscale finite element method is developed within the framework of the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) in the spatial domain. This new method ensures both local and global mass conservation. Starting from a specified covariance function, the stochastic log-permeability is discretized in the stochastic space using a truncated Karhunen-Loève expansion with several random variables. Due to the small correlation length of the covariance function, this often results in a high stochastic dimensionality. Therefore, a newly developed adaptive high dimensional stochastic model representation technique (HDMR) is used in the stochastic space. This results in a set of low stochastic dimensional subproblems which are efficiently solved using the adaptive sparse grid collocation method (ASGC). Numerical examples are presented for both deterministic and stochastic permeability to show the accuracy and efficiency of the developed stochastic multiscale method.	collocation method;discretization;finite element method;hidden markov model;numerical method;sparse grid;sparse matrix;stochastic gradient descent;uncertainty quantification	Xiang Ma;Nicholas Zabaras	2011	J.

The liquid bridge is bounded by solid parallel electrodes placed perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and held at a constant potential difference. The fluid is assumed to be nonconducting and has permittivity different from that of the passive surrounding medium. The problem reduces to the solution of two harmonic problems for the fluid and voltage potential inside the bridge and another harmonic problem for the voltage potential outside the bridge. The shape of the moving interface is determined by the imposition of stress, as well as kinematic and electric field boundary conditions, the former condition accounting for discontinuous electric stresses across the interface. We propose fast and highly accurate boundary integral methods based on fast summations of appropriate series representations of axisymmetric Green’s functions in bounded geometries. We implement our method to calculate equilibrium shapes for electrified liquid bridges in the absence and presence of gravity. Such calculations appear in the literature using finite element methods, and our boundary integral approach is a fast and accurate alternative.	approximation algorithm;boundary case;boundary element method;coefficient;computation;ewald summation;expanded memory;finite element method;gradient;interpolation;linear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;optic axis of a crystal;plateau's problem;polynomial;quadratic function;sandy bridge;singularity project;system of linear equations	Darko Volkov;Demetrios T.

fa9239b0e550a76b1257e4509f1f20b3135e303b	a multimaterial extension to subzonal reconstruction	ale methods;remapping	We present a new algorithm for reconstructing material-dependent subzonal information based on staggered primary/dual-mesh remapping of material-dependent conserved quantities. The algorithm is appropriate in the context of geometric, intersection-based overlay remapping methods, with specific application to staggered, total energy conserving, multi-material Lagrangian hydrodynamics schemes that discretize material masses on subzonal mesh elements. Our new approach avoids direct remapping of material-dependent subzonal variables; instead, the spatial profile of each variable is reconstructed using a combination of material-dependent zone (primary mesh) information, material-independent node (dual mesh) information, and discrete interface-reconstructed material concentration information. Conservation and convergence properties of the new algorithm are established through several challenging multi-material remapping and hydrodynamics tests.		David P. Starinshak;J. M. Owen	2016	J.

Over the past decade, the development of treecodes, such as the fast multipole method and Barnes--Hut method, has enabled large scale simulations in astrophysics, molecular dynamics, material science, etc. These methods use fixed-degree polynomial approximations of the potential at a point, due to a set of particles in a hierarchical representation of the particle system. In this paper, we present analysis and experiments to illustrate that fixed-degree multipole approximations can lead to large aggregate errors. We describe an alternate strategy based on careful selection of the multipole degree that leads to asymptotically lower errors while incurring minimal computation overhead. First, we estimate the error associated with each particle-cluster interaction and the aggregate error for each particle. Then we describe a technique for computing the multipole degree of each interaction with a view to reducing aggregate error, and establish the computational complexity of the new method. Following this, we discuss numerical experiments that demonstrate favorable error properties of the new method at the expense of marginal increase in computation. Finally, we report a parallel implementation on the SGI Origin 2000 that achieves excellent speedup for problems from domains such as astrophysics and boundary element solvers.

891cf7728cbe85110c42fcd1e2c65c09facc8ca1	monotonicity-preserving finite element schemes based on differentiable nonlinear stabilization	shock capturing;monotonicity;nonlinear solvers;finite elements;article;discrete maximum principle	In this work, we propose a nonlinear stabilization technique for scalar conservation laws with implicit time stepping. The method relies on an artificial diffusion method, based on a graph-Laplacian operator. It is nonlinear, since it depends on a shock detector. Further, the resulting method is linearity preserving. The same shock detector is used to gradually lump the mass matrix. The resulting method is LED, positivity preserving, and also satisfies a global DMP. Lipschitz continuity has also been proved. However, the resulting scheme is highly nonlinear, leading to very poor nonlinear convergence rates. We propose a smooth version of the scheme, which leads to twice dif-ferentiable nonlinear stabilization schemes. It allows one to straightforwardly use Newton's method and obtain quadratic convergence. In the numerical experiments, steady and transient linear transport , and transient Burgers' equation have been considered in 2D. Using the Newton method with a smooth version of the scheme we can reduce 10 to 20 times the number of iterations of Anderson acceleration with the original non-smooth scheme. In any case, these properties are only true for the converged solution, but not for iterates. In this sense, we have also proposed the concept of projected nonlinear solvers, where a projection step is performed at the end of every nonlinear iterations onto a FE space of admissible solutions. The space of admissible solutions is the one that satisfies the desired monotonic properties (maximum principle or positivity).	experiment;finite element method;iteration;lumped element model;mass matrix;newton;newton's method;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;rate of convergence;scott continuity;semiconductor detector;stepping level	Santiago Badia;Jesús Bonilla	2016	CoRR	10.1016/j.cma.2016.09.035	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;monotonic function;finite element method;calculus;mathematics;statistics;algebra	ML	88.59502823358862	12.59524717717915	192997

d123f9fced72e79c408fff238fb1db296a08907c	a penalty approach to the numerical simulation of a constrained wave motion	numerical simulation	Abstract — The main goal of this article is to investigate the numerical solution of a vector-valued nonlinear wave equation, the nonlinearity being of the Ginzburg-Landau type, namely (|~u|2 − 1)~u. This equation is obtained when treating by penalty a constrained wave-motion, where the displacement vector is of constant length (1 here, after rescaling). An important step of the approximation process is the construction of a time discretization scheme preserving in some sense the energy conservation property of the continuous model.The stability properties of the above scheme are discussed. The authors discuss also the finite element approximation and the quasi-Newton solution of the nonlinear elliptic system obtained at each time step from the time discretization. The results of numerical experiments are presented; they show that for the constraint of the original wave problem to be accurately verified we need to use a small value of the penalty parameter.	computer simulation;discretization;displacement mapping;experiment;finite element method;newton;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;polynomial-time approximation scheme	Roland Glowinski;Alexander Lapin;Sergey Lapin	2003	J.

This method is based on a finite differences scheme and is second order accurate in the whole domain. The originality of the method lies in the use of additional unknowns located on the interface, allowing to express the interface transmission conditions. The method is described and the details of its parallelization, performed with the PETSc library, are provided. Numerical validations of the method follow with comparisons to other related methods in literature. A numerical study of the parallelized method is also given. Then, the method is applied to solve elliptic irregular domain problems appearing in a three-dimensional continuous tumor growth model, the two-species Darcy model. The approach used in this application is based on the penalization of the interface transmission conditions, in order to impose homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on the border of an irregular domain. The simulations of model are provided and they show the ability of the method to impose a good approximation of the considered boundary conditions.	approximation error;cartesian closed category;coefficient;coupling (computer programming);discretization;finite difference method;numerical analysis;petsc;parallel computing;parallel programming model;population dynamics;scalability;vhdl-ams	Marco Cisternino	2012			calculus;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	HPC	90.56949029013194	15.2857442499944	193452

The key feature is the high order approximation, by means of a local Hermite interpolant, of a Neumann boundary condition for use in the numerical solution of the pressure Poisson system. The time updates of the velocity u and pressure p are decoupled as a result of treating the pressure gradient in the momentum equation explicitly in time. The pressure update is computed from a pressure Poisson equation. Extension of the overall methodology to the Boussinesq system is also described. The uncoupling of the pressure and velocity time updates results in a highly efficient scheme that is simple to implement and well suited for simulating moderate to high Reynolds and Rayleigh number flows. Accuracy checks are presented, along with simulations of the lid-driven cavity flow and a differentially heated cavity flow, to demonstrate the scheme produces accurate three-dimensional results at a reasonable computational cost.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;collocation;computation;gauss–hermite quadrature;gradient;interpolation;navier–stokes equations;numerical partial differential equations;periodic boundary conditions;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;velocity (software development)	Hans Johnston;Cheng Wang;Jian-Guo Liu	2014	J.

To avoid the non-differentiability due to the irreversibility constraint on the fracture growth, the phase-field fracture model is relaxed using a penalization approach. Existence of a solution to the penalized fracture model is shown and existence of at least one solution for the regularized optimal control problem is established. Moreover, the linearized fracture model is considered and used to establish first order necessary conditions as well as to discuss QP-approximations to the nonlinear optimization problem. A numerical example suggests that these can be used to obtain a fast convergent algorithm.	algorithm;approximation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;optimization problem;penalty method;software propagation	Ira Neitzel;Thomas Wick;W.

The numerical method is inspired by the Averaging Principle satisfied by this system, and fits to the framework of Heterogeneous Multiscale Methods. The slow and the fast components are approximated with two coupled numerical semi-implicit Euler schemes depending on two different timestep sizes. We derive bounds of the approximation error on the slow component in the strong sense approximation of trajectories and in the weak sense approximation of the laws. The estimates generalize the results of [12] in the case of infinite dimensional processes.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;discretization;fits;hidden markov model;numerical method;parabolic antenna;semi-implicit euler method;semiconductor industry;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Charles-Edouard Bréhier	2013	SIAM J.

Firstly, based on the Crank–Nicolson scheme in conjunction with L 1-approximation of the time Caputo derivative of order α  ∈ (1, 2), a fully-discrete scheme for 2D multi-term TFDWE is established. And then, the approximation scheme is rigorously proved to be unconditionally stable via processing fractional derivative skillfully. Moreover, the superclose result in broken H 1 -norm is deduced by utilizing special properties of quasi-Wilson element. In the meantime, the global superconvergence in broken H 1 -norm is derived by means of interpolation postprocessing technique. Finally, some numerical results illustrate the correctness of theoretical analysis on both regular and anisotropic meshes.	finite element method;polygon mesh	Z. G. Shi;Y. M. Zhao;Fawang Liu;F. L.

The dynamics may be modelled by Taylor’s one-dimensional model of shear dispersion. We discuss the creation and utility of models of the dispersion of the dye, using invariant manifold theory. The models are effective exponentially quickly. We describe a one-mode centre manifold and a two-mode and a three-mode invariant manifold model. From the analysis, we decide under what conditions these three models are valid. Using the geometric picture provided by the theory of invariant manifolds, we find a complete set of initial conditions for the models so that the evolution of the full and approximate systems are identical after a short time. Throughout, a comparison of the three models is made to identify the practical situations when each model will be preferred.		Simon D. Watt;Anthony J.

By using a unit step function as the test functions on small subdomains of circular shape in the local weak-form, the local integral equations (LIEs) are obtained for the problem. The mechanical properties are assumed to vary as nonlinear functions in volume fraction forms. The radial basis functions are used for approximation of the spatial variation of field variables in the analyzed domain. For treatment of time variations, the Laplace-transform technique is utilized. The molar concentration and elastic wave propagate with finite speeds through 2D-FGM domain. The effects of various grading patterns of FGMs on the propagation of molar concentration and elastic waves are discussed in details at various time instants. The profiles of molar concentration and displacements in two orthogonal directions are illustrated in FGM with various nonlinear grading patterns at various time instants. The presented results show that the MLPG method has a high capability to be employed for transient and wave propagation analysis in coupled problem of elasticity and diffusion. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

e4ec5688e2ccc1a5a035f9b1aa72b1e32b51cd29	combination of the meshless finite difference approach with the monte carlo random walk technique for solution of elliptic problems		Abstract This paper proposes a stochastic approach for the fast and effective numerical analysis of the second order elliptic differential equations. It is based upon the well-known Monte Carlo (MC) method with a random walk (RW) technique, carried out on the grid of points. This method allows for accurate estimation of the solution of the differential equation at selected point(s) of the domain and/or its boundary. It extends the standard formulation of the Monte Carlo–random walk (MC–RW) approach by means of its appropriate combination with the meshless version of the finite difference method. In this manner, the proposed approach may deal with elliptic equations in more general non-homogeneous form as well as boundary conditions of both essential and natural types. Moreover, arbitrarily irregular clouds of nodes may be used, with no a-priori imposed nodes structure. Therefore, the meshless MC/RW approach may be applied to the significantly wider class of problems with more complex geometry. This concept was examined on variety of 2D boundary value problems. Selected numerical results are presented and discussed. A simple Matlab code is included as well.	finite difference;meshfree methods;monte carlo method	Slawomir Milewski	2018	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2018.05.025	random walk;mathematical analysis;mathematical optimization;finite difference;finite difference method;numerical analysis;differential equation;complex geometry;boundary value problem;mathematics;monte carlo method	HPC	92.48836875043487	11.018643792527595	194475

We have developed a high-order finite difference method for the elastic wave equation that is able to efficiently handle varying temporal scales in a single, stand-alone framework. We apply this method to earthquake cycle models characterized by extremely long interseismic periods interspersed with abrupt, short periods of dynamic rupture. Through the use of summation-by-parts operators and weak enforcement of boundary conditions we derive a provably stable discretization. Time stepping is achieved through the implicit θ-method which allows us to take large time steps during the intermittent period between earthquakes and adapts appropriately to fully resolve rupture.	discretization;finite difference method;initial condition;norm (social);numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;simulation;steam rupture;stepping level	Brittany A.

We present a novel numerical algorithm to treat flooding and drying in a formally second-order explicit space discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretization of the one-dimensional or symmetric shallow-water equations. The algorithm uses fixed Eulerian flooded elements and a mixed Eulerian--Lagrangian element at each free boundary. When the time step is suitably restricted, we show that the mean water depth is positive. This time-step restriction is based on an analysis of the discretized continuity equation while using the HLLC flux. The algorithm and its implementation are tested in comparison with a large and relevant suite of known exact solutions. The essence of the flooding and drying algorithm pivots around the analysis of a continuity equation with a fluid velocity and a pseudodensity (in the shallow water case the depth). It therefore also applies, for example, to space discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretizations of the compressible Euler equations in which vacuum regions emerge, in analogy of the above dry regions. We believe that the approach presented can be extended to finite-volume discretizations with similar mean level and slope reconstruction.	galerkin method	Onno Bokhove	2005	J. Sci.

The proposed sixth-order accurate method preserves both the dispersion relation and the Hamiltonians of the CH equation. The CH equation in this study is written as an evolution equation, involving only the first-order spatial derivatives, coupled with the Helmholtz equation. We propose a two-step method that first solves the evolution equation by a sixth-order symplectic RungeKutta method and then solves the Helmholtz equation using a three-point sixth-order compact scheme. The first-order derivative terms in the first step are approximated by a sixth-order dispersion-relationpreserving scheme that preserves the physically inherent dispersive nature. The compact Helmholtz solver, on the other hand, allows us to use relatively few nodal points in a stencil, while achieving a higher-order accuracy. The sixth-order symplectic Runge-Kutta time integrator is preferable for an equation that possess a Hamiltonian structure. We illustrate the ability of the proposed scheme by examining examples involving peakon or peakon-like solutions. We compare the computed solutions with exact solutions or asymptotic predictions. We also demonstrate the ability of the symplectic time integrator to preserve the Hamiltonians. Finally, via a smooth travelling wave problem, we compare the accuracy, elapsed computing time, and rate of convergence among the proposed method, a second-order two-step algorithm, and a completely integrable particle method. keywords: Camassa-Holm equation; Hamiltonians; symplectic Runge Kutta; sixth-order; Helmholtz equation; dispersion-relation-preserving.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive mesh refinement;approximation algorithm;central processing unit;computation;dispersive partial differential equation;first-order predicate;iteration;iterative method;list of operator splitting topics;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;refinement (computing);runge–kutta methods;solver;stepping level;symplectic integrator	Pao-Hsiung Chiu;Long Lee;Tony W.

cf9e2bc8d4f848dd009e72d648e0f83158360be5	galerkin finite element methods for convection-diffusion problems with exponential layers on shishkin triangular meshes and hybrid meshes		In this work, we provide a convergence analysis for a Galerkin finite element method on a Shishkin triangular mesh and a hybrid mesh for a singularly perturbed convection–diffusion equation. The hybrid mesh replaces the triangles of the Shishkin mesh by rectangles in the layer regions. The supercloseness results are established that the computed solution converges to the interpolant of the true solution with 3/2 order and 2 order (up to a logarithmic factor) on the two kinds of mesh, respectively. These convergence rates are uniformly valid with respect to the diffusion parameter and imply that the hybrid mesh is superior to the Shishkin triangular mesh. Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical results.	finite element method;galerkin method;time complexity;triangle mesh;triangulated irregular network	Xiaowei Liu;Jin Zhang	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.03.003	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;geometry	HPC	88.54903196044866	13.288984436725157	195075

These methods depend on the values of the parameter $$\theta\in[-1,1]$$, where θ =  + 1 corresponds to the nonsymmetric and θ = −1 corresponds to the symmetric interior penalty methods when $${\rm a}(u,\nabla u)={\nabla}u$$ and f(u,∇u) = −f, that is, for the Poisson problem. The error estimate in the broken H 1 norm, which is optimal in h (mesh size) and suboptimal in p (degree of approximation) is derived using piecewise polynomials of degree p ≥ 2, when the solution $$u\in H^{5/2}(\Omega)$$. In the case of linear elliptic problems also, this estimate is optimal in h and suboptimal in p. Further, optimal error estimate in the L 2 norm when θ = −1 is derived.

Thus, when solving viscous flow problems on time-varying domains, an efficient and reliable solver is one of the prerequisites for a successful solution. For this reason, we provide a comparison of two time integration schemes in terms of numerical error and CPU time usage.The contribution of the paper lies in the mutual comparison of two different approaches for time integration of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) description that are spatially discretised by the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The computational ability of implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme and explicit three-step Runge-Kutta scheme, computational performance of which is improved by the local time-stepping technique, are tested on two flow problems: the propagation of an isentropic vortex, which has a known analytical solution, and the viscous flow around an oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil. All numerical simulations are carried out on unstructured triangular meshes by using a continuous mapping between the reference and time-varying domains.	galerkin method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations	Ondrej Bublík;Jan Vimmr;Alena Jonásová	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2015.03.063	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discontinuous galerkin method;calculus;mathematics	Theory	92.54363731941653	10.623902681491831	195558

Recently, the existence of single or multiple positive solutions to some third-order three-point boundary value problems (BVPs) has received much attention from many authors; see [2–7] and the references therein. However, all the above-mentioned papers are achieved when corresponding Green’s functions are nonnegative, which is a very important condition. A natural question is that whether we can obtain the existence of positive solutions to some third-order threepoint BVPs when corresponding Green’s functions are signchanging. In 2008, Palamides and Smyrlis [8] studied the existence of at least one positive solution to the singular third-order three-point BVP with an indefinitely signed Green’s function	iteration;multitier architecture	Ya-Hong Zhao;Xing-Long Li	2014	J.

Given the governing dimensionless physical parameters, such as the Reynolds or Peclet numbers, and the geometry of the computationalmesh, the numerical errors remain the same for any change of the transport coefficients only when the ‘‘free’’ (‘‘kinetic’’) antisymmetric rates and the boundary rules are chosen properly. The single-relaxation-time (BGK) model has no free collision rate and yields viscosity dependent errors with any boundary scheme for hydrodynamic problems. The simplest and most efficient collision operator for invariant errors is the two-relaxation-times (TRT) model. As an example, this model is able to compute viscosity independent permeabilities for any porous structure. These properties are derived from steady recurrence equations, obtained through linear combinations of the LB evolution equations, in which the equilibrium and non-equilibrium components are directly interconnected via finite-difference link-wise central operators. The explicit dependency of the non-equilibrium solution on the relaxation rates is then obtained. This allows us, first, to confirm the governing role of the ‘‘magic’’ combinations for steady solutions of the Stokes equation, second, to extend this property to steady solutions of the Navier–Stokes and anisotropic advection–diffusion equations, third, to develop a parametrization analysis of the microscopic and macroscopic closure relations prescribed via link-wise boundary schemes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the effective conductivity associated to thermal, electrical, or hydraulic transfers depends on its microstructure. In practice, it can be determined using some analytical formula working in limited configurations. More generally, it can be obtained numerically by solving a closure problem that maps the microscale to the macroscale. The resulting effective coefficient depends on the local properties as well on the geometry of the inclusions. The goal of this work is to give explicit formulae relating the sensitivity of large scale effective conductivity with respect to local microscale parameters directly using the solution of the mapping problem. The proposed formula is direct and does not imply solving any additional adjoint problem. It needs only evaluation of volume or surface integrals involving the mapping problem solution.

The system describes the interactions of the Riemann wave along y-axis and long wave along x-axis. Some explicit solutions of breaking soliton system are attained with appropriate choices of the arbitrary functions and making use of arbitrary constants involved in the infinitesimals. In order to obtain physically meaningful solutions, numerical simulation is performed. On the basis of graphical representation, the physical analysis of solutions reveals into multi-solitons, periodic, quadratic, asymptotic and stationary profiles.

The issue is addressed by considering the time in the same fashion as the space variables, reformulating the mathematical model in the entire space-time domain, and solving the problem on a near optimal computational mesh that automatically adapts to spatio-temporal structures of the solution. The compressed form of the solution eliminates the need to save or recompute data for every time slice as it is typically done in traditional time marching approaches to 4-dimensional variational data assimilation. The reduction of the required computational degrees of freedom is achieved using the compression properties of multi-dimensional second generation wavelets. The simultaneous space-time discretization of both the forward and the adjoint models makes it possible to solve both models either concurrently or sequentially. In addition, the grid adaptation reduces the amount of saved data to the strict minimum for a given a priori controlled accuracy of the solution. The proposed approach is demonstrated for the advection diffusion problem in two space-time dimensions.	adaptive mesh refinement;computer memory;data assimilation;discretization;grid (spatial index);ibm notes;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;refinement (computing);variational principle;wavelet	Innocent Souopgui;Scott A.

The compactly supported interpolating-type wavelets enjoys very fast wavelet transforms, and act as a piecewise constant function filter. These lead to fairly sparse computational grids, and very efficient algorithms for multi-phase image segmentation using piecewise constant level set methods (PCLSM).

The building block of this approach is a kinetic Boltzmann-type formulation for a model of turbulent thermal flows based on large-eddy simulation modelling. Discrete-velocity moments are taken in order to derive a relaxation system which is in turn solved by a relaxation scheme. High-order schemes are obtained by discretizing the relaxation system spatially with weighted non-oscillatory reconstruction and temporally using an implicit-explicit discretization. In the limit of small Mach and small Knudsen numbers one obtains a high-order relaxation scheme for large-eddy simulation of turbulent thermal flows.

Connecting the weights to the Jacobian of the map results in an intuitive means of controlling grid spacing, area, orthogonality, and grid-line directions.

These PDEs are high order in spatial derivatives, which motivates us to develop implicit or semi-implicit time marching methods to relax the severe time step restriction for stability of explicit methods. In addition, these PDEs are also highly nonlinear, fully implicit methods will incredibly increase the difficulty of implementation. In particular, we can not well separate the stiff and non-stiff components for these problems, which leads to traditional implicit-explicit methods nearly meaningless. In this paper, a high order semi-implicit time marching method and the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) spatial method are coupled together to achieve high order accuracy in both space and time, and to enhance the efficiency of the proposed approaches, the resulting linear or nonlinear algebraic systems are solved by multigrid solver. Specially, we develop a first order fully discrete LDG scheme for the Allen-Cahn/Cahn-Hilliard system and prove the unconditional energy stability.

Rather than modeling the numerically troublesome, and largely invisible blast wave, the method uses a relatively stable incompressible fluid model to account for the motion of air and hot gases. The fluid's divergence field is adjusted directly to account for detonations and the generation and expansion of gaseous combustion products. Particles immersed in the fluid track the motion of particulate fuel and soot as they are advected by the fluid. Combustion is modeled using a simple but effective process governed by the particle and fluid systems. The method has enough flexibility to also approximate sprays of burning liquids. This paper includes several demonstrative examples showing air bursts, explosions near obstacles, confined explosions, and burning sprays. Because the method is based on components that allow large time integration steps, it only requires a few seconds of computation per frame for the examples shown.		Bryan E. Feldman;James F.

The standard level set method is based on the description of the domain boundary as an isocountour of a scalar function of a higher dimensionality. The evolution of this boundary is governed by Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In the paper a piecewise constant level set method is used to represent interfaces rather than the standard method. The piecewise constant level set function takes distinct constant values in each subdomain of a whole design domain. Using a two-phase approximation and a piecewise constant level set approach the original structural optimization problem is reformulated as an equivalent constrained optimization problem in terms of the level set function. Necessary optimality condition is formulated.

8d4048acaf9602e81d71d1488f22c675abbba77c	efficient 3d inversions using the richards equation		Abstract Fluid flow in the vadose zone is governed by the Richards equation; it is parameterized by hydraulic conductivity, which is a nonlinear function of pressure head. Investigations in the vadose zone typically require characterizing distributed hydraulic properties. Water content or pressure head data may include direct measurements made from boreholes. Increasingly, proxy measurements from hydrogeophysics are being used to supply more spatially and temporally dense data sets. Inferring hydraulic parameters from such datasets requires the ability to efficiently solve and optimize the nonlinear time domain Richards equation. This is particularly important as the number of parameters to be estimated in a vadose zone inversion continues to grow. In this paper, we describe an efficient technique to invert for distributed hydraulic properties in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Our technique does not store the Jacobian matrix, but rather computes its product with a vector. Existing literature for the Richards equation inversion explicitly calculates the sensitivity matrix using finite difference or automatic differentiation, however, for large scale problems these methods are constrained by computation and/or memory. Using an implicit sensitivity algorithm enables large scale inversion problems for any distributed hydraulic parameters in the Richards equation to become tractable on modest computational resources. We provide an open source implementation of our technique based on the SimPEG framework, and show it in practice for a 3D inversion of saturated hydraulic conductivity using water content data through time.

This procedure uses the variational formulation of the differential equation in Ω1 and involves integral operators on the interface between Ω1 andΩ2. The finite elements are used to obtain approximate solutions of the differential equation in Ω1 and the boundary elements are used to obtain approximate solutions of the integral equations. For given piecewise analytic data we show that the Galerkin solution of this coupling procedure converges exponentially fast in the energy norm if the h-p version is used both for finite elements and boundary elements.	approximation algorithm;boundary element method;coefficient;finite element method;galerkin method;list of variational topics;polyhedron;rate of convergence	Benqi Guo;Ernst P.

A reformulation to a better posed problem is needed before solving it numerically. The sequential regularization method (SRM) is a reformulation which combines the penalty method with a stabilization method in the context of constrained dynamical systems and has the benefit of both methods. In the paper, we study the existence and uniqueness for the solution of the SRM and provide a simple proof of the convergence of the solution of the SRM to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. We also give error estimates for the time discretized SRM formulation.	discretization;dynamical system;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;penalty method	Xiliang Lu;Ping Lin;Jian-Guo Liu	2008	Math.

A previously proposed radial basis function (RBF) method, namely an integrated multiquadric scheme (IMQ), is applied to two-point boundary value problems whose solutions exhibit thin boundary layers. As frequently observed among RBF methods, the matrices arising are ill-conditioned, in this paper to the point of numerical singularity. The sensitivity of themethod to perturbations and round-off error is investigated, and evidence is provided that perturbations are not nearly as strongly amplified as suggested by the large condition numbers of the matrices used in the computation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

01d406cd3bc3c8b5b0d55529a68ceb2aba63d08f	efficient simulation of threshold behavior		The paper discusses a new method for the propagation of risk levels. This discretization takes place by considering the phase space of the state and its subdivision into boxes. In each time step, the method computes the probability of the state being in one box. We start with a variety of technical and physical problems by showing how discrete modeling under uncertainties is technically meaningful and often even problem inherent. Then we select the technical problem of contaminant spread in water grids, to which we apply the method of risk-level propagation in depth. Extensions of the method such as modeling of contaminant mixing at junctions in the discretized phase space and the applicability of conservation laws arise naturally along these lines and are discussed in the context of the general theory.	discretization;simulation;software propagation;subdivision surface;water cooling	Dominic Kohler;Johannes Müller;Birgit Obst;Utz Wever	2017	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060417000063	systems engineering;engineering	AI	94.37042471273539	9.158373630580728	198594

These techniques are global in that they attempt to solve field problems over an entire domain, and involve tedious pre-processing (meshing). In contrast, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are meshless techniques for estimating field values at discrete points. In these methods, one constructs random walks by repeated execution of few geometric tasks. These tasks, though robust, are perceived to be prohibitively expensive. Hence, in practice, MC methods are employed sparingly. In this paper, we briefly describe a well-established MC method based on interior random walks. We identify the underlying geometric task: computing the minimum distance from interior points to the boundary of a domain. We then show, through theoretical and numerical results, that this task can be performed swiftly using certain graph-structures that are derived from the Voronoi diagram of a domain. When these graph-structures are employed, the MC method is relatively insensitive to domain complexity, making it an attractive alternative to global techniques.	boundary element method;finite difference;finite element method;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;preprocessor;robustness (computer science);task computing;voronoi diagram	Krishnan Suresh;Jovan Zagajac	1997		10.1145/267734.267817	monte carlo method in statistical physics;mathematical optimization;finite difference;combinatorics;boundary element method;voronoi diagram;hybrid monte carlo;computer aided design;interior point method;finite element method;multi-agent system;monte carlo molecular modeling;mathematics;geometry;monte carlo integration;random walk;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	93.63151509019477	11.698493644861802	198665
5fc3cebba94b536bdc6654c766b702ced1422bf0	effect of slip conditions and entropy generation analysis with an effective prandtl number model on a nanofluid flow through a stretching sheet		This article describes the impact of slip conditions on nanofluid flow through a stretching sheet. Nanofluids are very helpful to enhance the convective heat transfer in a boundary layer flow. Prandtl number also play a major role in controlling the thermal and momentum boundary layers. For this purpose, we have considered a model for effective Prandtl number which is borrowed by means of experimental analysis on a nano boundary layer, steady, two-dimensional incompressible flow through a stretching sheet. We have considered γAl2O3-H2O and Al2O3-C2H6O2 nanoparticles for the governing flow problem. An entropy generation analysis is also presented with the help of the second law of thermodynamics. A numerical technique known as Successive Taylor Series Linearization Method (STSLM) is used to solve the obtained governing nonlinear boundary layer equations. The numerical and graphical results are discussed for two cases i.e., (i) effective Prandtl number and (ii) without effective Prandtl number. From graphical results, it is observed that the velocity profile and temperature profile increases in the absence of effective Prandtl number while both expressions become larger in the presence of Prandtl number. Further, numerical comparison has been presented with previously published results to validate the current methodology and results.	collocation method;comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;flow network;gnu nano;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;velocity (software development);vii	Mohammad Mehdi Rashidi;Munawwar Ali Abbas	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19080414	mathematics;prandtl number;boundary layer;film temperature;incompressible flow;classical mechanics;nusselt number;magnetic prandtl number;turbulent prandtl number;mixing length model	HPC	90.44469120587986	4.185993846758009	198886

The analytical solution for the linear case is introduced. The Wiener-Hermite expansion together with the perturbation method, the WHEP technique, is used to get approximate ensemble average of the stochastic solution process. Using Mathematica, the solution algorithm is tested through computing the first order approximation of the solution ensemble average. The method is illustrated through case studies which demonstrate the effects of the initial conditions as well as the input non-homogeneities.	initial condition	Magdy A. El-Tawil	2009	Trans.

If 1 + u(0, x) is bounded away from a positive constant, we can construct a local solution for smooth initial data. When 1+u(t, x) is going to 0 in finite time, the equation degenerates. We give a sufficient condition that the equation degenerates in finite time. A known result on global existence and our main theorem determine a threshold of ∫ R u1(x)dx separating the global existence of solutions and the occurrence of the degeneracy.	degeneracy (graph theory);emoticon	Yuusuke Sugiyama	2016	SIAM J.

a6ae6ee1ea31c0647eecef3ce2527fc5768f511d	singularities of the inertial flow map gradient		Inertial particles are finite-sized objects that are carried by flows, for example sand particles in air. In contrast to massless tracer particles, the trajectories of inertial particles can intersect in space-time. When this occurs, the inertial flow map gradient becomes singular. This has an impact on visualization concepts that require the flow map gradient to be invertible. An example are influence curves, which allow to move inertial particles backward in time and thereby avoid the numerically ill-posed inertial backward integration. In this paper, we show that singularities of the inertial flow map gradient can act as poles for influence curves, i.e., as structures that influence curves cannot cross. Influence curves thereby decay into disconnected pieces. We extract singularities in space-time and propose a simple approach to extract influence curves even when they are spatially disconnected. We demonstrate the extraction techniques and discuss the role of singularities in a number of 2D vector fields.	flow map;gradient	Tobias Günther;Holger Theisel	2016		10.2312/vmv.20161344	computer vision;mathematics;geometry;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	87.7672856652022	4.8526659727859025	199166

The objective is to use modal representations to build transparent conditions on some artificial boundaries of the computational domain. This cannot be achieved in a classical way, due to non-standard properties of elastic modes. However, a biorthogonality relation allows us to build an operator, relating hybrid displacement/stress vectors. An original mixed formulation is then derived and implemented, whose unknowns are the displacement field in the bounded domain and the normal component of the normal stresses on the artificial boundaries. Numerical validations are presented in the 2D case.		V. Baronian;Anne-Sophie Bonnet-Ben Dhia;E. Lunéville	2010	J.

The first one has applications to elliptic equations and incompressible fluid flow problems, while the second has applications to linear elasticity and compressible Stokes problems. These schemes are constructed through iteratively penalizing the mixed finite element scheme, of which iterated penalty method and augmented Lagrangian method are special cases. Convergence theorems are demonstrated in abstract formulations in Hilbert spaces, and applications to individual physical problems are considered as examples. Theoretical analysis and computational experiments both show that the proposed schemes have very fast convergence; a few iterations are normally enough to reduce the iterative error to a prescribed precision. Numerical examples with continuous and discontinuous coefficients are presented.	augmented lagrangian method;coefficient;computation;elasticity (data store);experiment;finite element method;hilbert space;iteration;navier–stokes equations;numerical method;penalty method	Daoqi Yang	2002	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/BF02679442	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;computer experiment;augmented lagrangian method;compressible flow;numerical analysis;boundary value problem;finite element method;calculus;penalty method;mathematics;iterative method;elliptic curve;mixed finite element method;linear elasticity;incompressible flow;partial differential equation;stokes flow;algebra;hilbert space	HPC	86.51195052810114	13.675455357318343	199657

We employ a semi-implicit time discretization which leads to the solution of a sequence of linear algebraic systems. We develop an efficient strategy for the solution of these systems. It is based on a simple adaptive technique for the choice of the time step and a relatively weak stopping criterion for iterative linear algebraic solvers. The presented numerical experiments show that the proposed strategy is efficient for steady-state problems using various grids, polynomial degrees of approximations and flow regimes. Finally, we apply this strategy with a minor modification to an unsteady flow.	discretization;galerkin method;navier–stokes equations;semiconductor industry	Vít Dolejsí;M. Holík;J. Hozman	2011	J.

b9c0880beba0a8377b3cbb39e3ba6535dc79ef55	efficient solution techniques for multi-phase flow in porous media		Multi-phase flow in porous media is relevant for many applications, e.g. geothermal energy production, groundwater remediation, CO(_2) sequestration, enhanced oil recovery or nuclear waste storage. The arising non-linear partial differential equations are highly non-linear and thus often solved in a fully implicit way. We present a Schur complement reduction method relying on algebraic multigrid methods for solving the arising linear systems. This method is compared to a classical Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR-AMG) approach. It turns out that the new method is competitive to the classical approach with the advantage that it relies only on scalable algebraic multigrid (AMG) and not on incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioning. Scaling results are presented for both methods on the Julich high performance computer JUQUEEN.

86aaf5bddc11b9c4f7e0ab71ab4427797041b4a1	vials: an eulerian tool based on total variation and the level set method for studying dynamical systems	dynamical systems;numerical methods for pdes;level set method;flow visualization	We propose a new Eulerian tool to study complicated dynamical systems based on the average growth in the surface area of a family of level surfaces represented implicitly by a level set function. Since this proposed quantity determines the temporal variation of the averaged surface area of all level surfaces, we name the quantity the Variation of the Integral over Area of Level Surfaces (VIALS). Numerically, all these infinitely many level surfaces are advected according to the given dynamic by solving one single linear advection equation. To develop a computationally efficient approach, we apply the coarea formula and rewrite the surface area integral as a simple integral relating the total variation (TV) of the level set function. The proposed method can be easily incorporated with a recent Eulerian algorithm for efficient computation of flow maps to speed up our approach. We will also prove that the proposed VIALS is closely related to the computation of the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) in the Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) extraction. This connects our proposed Eulerian approach to widely used Lagrangian techniques for understanding complicated dynamical systems.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;coherence (physics);computation;dynamical system;lagrangian coherent structure;lyapunov fractal;numerical integration;rewrite (programming)	Guoqiao You;Shingyu Leung	2014	J.
