One scheme involves biasing the PC Qubit at multiple flux bias points throughout the course of the algorithm. An implementation analogous to that done in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Quantum Computing is also developed. Errors due to a few key approximations utilized are discussed and differences between the PC Qubit and NMR systems are highlighted.	algorithm;approximation;biasing;flux qubit;lattice gas automaton;quantum computing;resonance	David M.

c70be55e92a02e14ea769cd746a94f1120bd75f4	two approaches for heat transfer simulation of current carrying multicables	joule heating;electric cables;finite element method;mathematical modelling;fixed point approach	Excessive temperatures in cable bundles integrated in cars can cause harms to connecting structures and essential components. To avoid hotspot generation already at the production of cable harnesses, reliable predictions of temperatures in cables under load are necessary. Two approaches for stationary heat transfer simulation in current carrying multicables, i.e. thick cables composed of several smaller ones, are compared in this work. An extensive model with partial differential equations, solved via the finite element method, is subject of the first approach. In the second one, formulas for temperatures at characteristic cable positions are derived and computed via a fixed point approach. The first approach provides a detailed temperature profile and thus enables the location of hotspots a priori, the second approach excels by very fast determination of average temperatures without time consuming geometry creation. Furthermore, accordance to realistic settings is demonstrated by comparison to measurement results.	simulation	Florian Loos;Karl Dvorsky;Hans-Dieter Liess	2014	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2014.01.008	joule heating;finite element method;mathematical model;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	HPC	88.7366473720323	-2.7530057154254854	87437

In the present study, both nuclear and electronic quantum effects are explicitly treated for the reacting system. The nuclear quantum effects are represented by bisection sampling centroid path integral simulations, while the potential energy surface is described by a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential. The accuracy essential for computing KIEs is achieved by a FEP technique that transforms the mass of a light isotope into a heavy one, which is equivalent to the perturbation of the coordinates for the path integral quasiparticle in the bisection sampling scheme. The PI-FEP/UM method is applied to the proton abstraction of nitroethane by acetate ion in water through molecular dynamics simulations. The rule of the geometric mean and the Swain-Schaad exponents for various isotopic substitutions at the primary and secondary sites have been examined. The computed total deuterium KIEs are in accord with experiments. It is found that the mixed isotopic Swain-Schaad exponents are very close to the semiclassical limits, suggesting that tunneling effects do not significantly affect this property for the reaction between nitroethane and acetate ion in aqueous solution.	acetate;computation (action);deuterium exchange measurement;experiment;free energy perturbation;ions;isoelectric point;isotopes;kinetics;molecular dynamics;molecular mechanics;path integral formulation;polytetrafluoroethylene;potential energy surface;protons;qm/mm;quantum hall effect;quantum mechanics;quasiparticle;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;semiclassical physics;simulation;tunneling protocol;umbrella sampling;nitroethane	Jiali Gao;Kin-Yiu Wong;Dan Thomas Major	2007	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20810	computer simulation;classical mechanics;path integral formulation;chemistry;computational chemistry;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	96.19061092712536	-4.943878861998843	87530
a6ee09289fddd695eda0eb5d14f24109aae589b3	stochastic stability of the inverted pendulum subjected to delta- correlated base excitation		Abstract   This paper is concerned with the stochastic stability of an inverted pendulum with a point mass at the top and a spring at the base; the bar is massless. The base is subjected at the base to a vertical acceleration  A ( t ) that is supposed to be a white noise (delta-correlated) stochastic process. Both Gaussian and Poissonian white noises are considered. A line-like structure excited by a vertical ground motion can be idealized in this way. It is assumed that during the motion the angle of rotation ϑ remains small so that sin ϑ≅ϑ. In this way, the motion equation assumes the classical form of the second order oscillator, but the excitation is parametric so that there is a possibility of stochastic instability. The almost sure (sample) stability and the stability in the second moments are considered herein. It is found that the two stability criteria lead to notable differences in the stability boundaries and the almost sure stability is not conservative. The mean square stability under the Poisson white noise is determined only by the arrival rate of underlying Poisson counting process and by the mean square amplitude of the pulses: the cumulants beyond the second order do not affect it.	inverted pendulum	Claudio Floris	2018	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2016.07.013	classical mechanics;calculus;control theory;physics;quantum mechanics	SE	83.08454620369434	2.780831167928731	87648

Analyses of dispersion curves of the complex dielectric response within existing phenomenological models are done. Relaxation processes are identified and their dynamics are traced. Activation energies of Arrhenius’ relaxation processes are obtained by fitting. Besides we have found a relaxation process described by Vogel-Fulcher law, indicating that in the system occurs freezing at 370 K.		Alexey Vl.

The phenomenon is augmented by initial rotation. The use of a vortex suppressor in a circular tank prevents vortexing. The reasons for the suppression of the vortexing are not clear. In this paper quantitative flow visualization results using PIV are presented which bring out the flow structure under various conditions.

One is the choice between allelectron and pseudopotential calculations and, if the latter, construction of the pseudopotential. Another is the stability, speed, and accuracy of solution algorithms. Underlying both is the fundamental issue of satisfactory quality of the approximate functionals (kinetic energy and exchange–correlation). We address both computational issues and illustrate them by some comparative performance testing of our recently developed modified-conjoint generalized gradient approximation kinetic energy functionals. Comparisons are given for atoms, diatomic molecules, and some simple solids. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its conceptual simplicity it involves many complexities related to the necessity of melting the thermoplastic at the interface tape-substrate, ensuring the consolidation that needs the diffusion of molecules and control the residual stresses installation responsible of the residual deformations of the formed parts. The optimisation of the process and the determination of the process window requires a plethora of simulations because there are many parameters involved in the characterization of the material and the process. The exploration of the design space cannot be envisaged by using standard simulation techniques. In this paper we propose the off-line calculation of rich parametric solutions that can be then explored on-line in real time in order to perform inverse analysis, process optimisation or on-line simulation-based control. In particular, in the present work, and in continuity with our former works, we consider two main extra-parameters, the first related to the line acceleration and the second to the number of plies laid-up.	line level;mathematical optimization;model order reduction;online and offline;ply (game theory);scott continuity;semiconductor consolidation;web-based simulation	Nicolas Bur;Pierre Joyot;Chady Ghnatios;Pierre Villon;Elías Cueto;Francisco Chinesta	2016	Adv.

The economic basis set in which the polarization function is added only to oxygen and nitrogen atoms of strong electronegativity can predict reliable geometric structures and dipole moment of nucleic acid base pairs, comparable to those obtained from the basis set of 6-31G* in B3LYP calculations. Combining single point calculations with the standard basis set on the geometric structures optimized by the economic basis set, the present approach has predicted accurate natural bond orbital charge, binding energy, electronegativity, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity index. The principle for basis selection presented in this study can be regarded as a general guideline in the computation of large biological systems with considerably high accuracy and low computational expense.	analysis of algorithms;base pairing;basis function;basis set (chemistry);biological system;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);cell nucleus;central processing unit;chronic multifocal osteomyelitis;computation (action);density functional theory;endianness;functional theories of grammar;hybrid functional;hydrogen bonding;interaction;mandibular right second molar tooth;molecular orbital;nucleic acids;oxygen;dipole moment	W.

A two-step sequential operator splitting method is applied to solve the coupled transport equations and the biogeochemical reaction equations. The geochemical module is based on the equilibrium speciation model (MINTEQA2), which uses ion-association equilibrium–constant approach to represent the various geochemical reactions. The biodegradation module describes the sequential biological degradation of organic compounds by multiple functional bacterial populations. Analytical equations based on macroscopic approach are used to model changes in porosity and permeability caused by biomass accumulation and mineral precipitation in soils. The model has been evaluated by comparing the model results with the widely used one-dimensional mixing-cell model PHREEQM for acidic mine tailings discharge in a carbonate aquifer. The composite leachate transport model is applied to a hypothetical landfill to simulate the effect of biological degradation of organic matter on the local inorganic geochemistry and also to demonstrate the effect of microbial activity on the evolution of porosity reduction of soils under the landfill.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein, we develop a fmctional J%Z Iaw relating solute flux at a given point to what might be called the complete (twosided) fractional derivative of the concentration distribution at the same point. The fractional derivative itself is then identified as a typical superposition integral over the spatial domain of the Levy diffusion process. While this interpretation does not obviously generalize to all applications, it does point toward the search for superposition principles when attempting to give physical meaning to fractional derivatives. @ 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

f6186f5ee64599ada5b537f5a2ffbbe4948035de	time-dependent density functional theory study on the electronic excited-state geometric structure, infrared spectra, and hydrogen bonding of a doubly hydrogen-bonded complex	hydrogen bond;hydrogen bond strengthening;excited states;infrared spectra;ivr;tddft;excited state;hydrogen bonding dynamics;time dependent density functional theory;geometric structure	The geometric structures and infrared (IR) spectra in the electronically excited state of a novel doubly hydrogen-bonded complex formed by fluorenone and alcohols, which has been observed by IR spectra in experimental study, are investigated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method. The geometric structures and IR spectra in both ground state and the S(1) state of this doubly hydrogen-bonded FN-2MeOH complex are calculated using the DFT and TDDFT methods, respectively. Two intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between FN and methanol molecules in the doubly hydrogen-bonded FN-2MeOH complex. Moreover, the formation of the second intermolecular hydrogen bond can make the first intermolecular hydrogen bond become slightly weak. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the spectral shoulder at around 1700 cm(-1) observed in the IR spectra should be assigned as the doubly hydrogen-bonded FN-2MeOH complex from our calculated results. The electronic excited-state hydrogen bonding dynamics is also studied by monitoring some vibraitonal modes related to the formation of hydrogen bonds in different electronic states. As a result, both the two intermolecular hydrogen bonds are significantly strengthened in the S(1) state of the doubly hydrogen-bonded FN-2MeOH complex. The hydrogen bond strengthening in the electronically excited state is similar to the previous study on the singly hydrogen-bonded FN-MeOH complex and play important role on the photophysics of fluorenone in solutions.	alcohols;discrete fourier transform;excited state;experiment;fibronectin type iii domain;functional theories of grammar;ground state;hydrogen bonding;methanol;personnameuse - assigned;pyschological bonding;time-dependent density functional theory	Yufang Liu;Junxia Ding;Ruiqiong Liu;Deheng Shi;Jinfeng Sun	2009	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21297	atomic physics;infrared spectroscopy;photochemistry;excited state;chemistry;time-dependent density functional theory;computational chemistry;physics;quantum mechanics	NLP	97.09978160112247	-6.246275101403302	89388

Chem. Phys. 132 (2010) 134705] illustrated the potential of the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004) 246401] for efficient first-principle accounts of structure and cohesion in molecular crystals. Since then, modifications of the original vdW-DF version (identified as vdW-DF1) have been proposed, and there is also a new version called vdW-DF2 [Phys. Rev. B 82 (2010) 081101(R)], within the vdW-DF framework. Here we investigate the performance and nature of the modifications and the new version for the binding of a set of simple molecular crystals: hexamine, dodecahedrane, C60, and graphite. These extended systems provide benchmarks for computational methods dealing with sparse matter. We show that a previously documented enhancement of non-local correlations of vdW-DF1 over an asymptotic atom-based account close to and a few A beyond binding separation persists in vdW-DF2. The calculation and analysis of the binding in molecular crystals require appropriate computational tools. In this paper, we also present details on our real-space parallel implementation of the vdW-DF correlation and on the method used to generate asymptotic atom-based pair potentials based on vdW-DF.	density functional theory	Kristian Berland;Øyvind Borck;Per Hyldgaard	2011	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2010.12.025	atomic physics;density functional theory;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	97.1900592654019	-3.3559076231791805	89871

The study concerns a wind turbine placed at the inlet of a divergent duct, a solution known as Diffuser-Augmented Wind Turbine. This type of wind energy converter has recently been an object of numerous studies at the Institute of Turbomachinery of Lodz University of Technology. The study focuses on the search of wind turbine evaluation method combining high accuracy and tolerable time-to-results factor. The examined models include: FRM (Fully-resolved Rotor Model), ADM (Actuator Disk Model) and authors' modified approach to ALM (Actuator Line Model). The study covers: the implementation of the above mentioned method(s) into a commercial solver ANSYS CFX 15.0, the comparison of the obtained results with available experimental data, the analysis of the results obtained from simulations and the discussion. The paper is characterised by the wide spectrum of actuator models compared with 3D accurate rotor modelling for the estimation of turbine performance, the authors' proposal of the ALM variant, and the comparison of the models also from the viewpoint of the numerical effort (computation time and resources necessary) they require.	application lifecycle management;computation;computer simulation;numerical method;r.o.t.o.r.;solver;time complexity	Lipian Michal;Maciej Karczewski;Krzysztof Jozwik	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793199	control engineering;simulation;engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	93.36901422678991	4.182987989848891	89910

Under two certain unitary transformations, the system is converted to a typical form of the Jaynes---Cummings model for two three-level atoms. The exact analytical solutions of the wave function for different considered atom---field systems are exactly obtained with the help of the Laplace transform technique, when the atoms are initially prepared in the topmost excited state and the quantized field is in a coherent state. In order to examine the nonclassicality features of the deduced states, the dynamics of the entanglement between subsystems is discussed via two well-known measures, namely, von Neumann entropy of the reduced state and negativity. In addition, we pay attention to the temporal behavior of quantum statistics of the photons of the field and squeezing phenomenon. Meanwhile, the influence of the external classical field on the latter physical quantities is analyzed in detail. The results show that the mentioned quantities can be sensitively controlled via the external classical field. Also, numerical computations imply the fact that the nonclassicality features in $$\varXi $$?-type three-level atomic system is more visible than the other two configurations. In addition, it is shown that in the particular case of $$\varLambda $$?-type atomic system, the rank of the reduced density matrix of the three-level atoms is no larger than three, so that negativity fully captures the entanglement of this system and that such entanglement is distillable.	quantization (signal processing)	H.

In accordance with the terminology of the QSSA theorem two of the protein concentrations are denoted as ‘fast varying‘, such that the corresponding kinetic equations form a system attached to the system for ‘slow‘ variables that consists of equations for the other four concentrations. We obtain analytic solutions related to the steady-state values of the fast varying concentrations and the slow varying ones, and the interpretation of these solutions are as restrictions on the regulatory role of microRNAs on the protein translation process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The hybrid model representing the cellular structure consists of a continuum representation of the lipid bilayer, from which the bending force is calculated through energetic variational approach, a discrete cytoskeleton model utilizing the worm-like chain to represent network filament, and area/volume constraints. For our computational scheme, a formally second-order accurate fractional step scheme is employed to decouple the entire system into three sub-systems: a fluid problem, a solid problem and a Lagrange multiplier problem. The flow problem is solved by the projection method; the solid problem based on the cell model is solved by a combination of level set method, ENO reconstruction, and the Newton method; and the Lagrange multiplier problem is solved by immerse boundary interpolation. The incompressibility of the material is implemented with the penalty function method. Numerical results compare favorably with previously reported numerical and experimental results, and show that our method is suited to the simulation of the cell motion in flow.	computation;fictitious domain method;flow network;interaction;interpolation;lagrange multiplier;newton's method;numerical analysis;numerical method;penalty method;simulation;triune continuum paradigm;variational principle	Wenrui Hao;Zhiliang Xu;Chun Liu;Guang Lin	2015	J.

In this article, we discuss the implementation of the velocity-gauge RT-TDDFT equations for electron dynamics within a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set framework. Numerical results obtained from our LCAO implementation, for the electronic response of periodic systems to both weak and intense laser fields, are compared to those obtained from established real-space grid and Full-Potential Linearized Augumented Planewave approaches. Potential applications of the LCAO based scheme in the context of extreme ultra-violet and soft X-ray spectroscopies involving core-electronic excitations are discussed.

The idea is to scavenge energy out of a vibrating host. Coupling energy harvesting with structural vibration control is a challenging task due to conflicting goals. But dynamic vibration absorbers (DVA) used to reduce vibrations in the primary structure has potential for energy harvesting capability. In this mechanism the host structure vibration is reduced by suitably shifting the motion to DVA. Vibration energy in DVA can be harvested. The harvested energy can be used to power low-powered wireless sensor systems. This paper analyses the prospect of using vibration absorbers for possible energy harvesting under random excitation. To achieve this goal, vibration absorber is supplemented with a piezoelectric stack for both vibration confinement and energy harvesting. The primary goal is to control the vibration of the host structure and the secondary goal is to harvest energy out of the dynamic vibration absorber simultaneously. It is shown that with a proper choice of harvester parameters a broadband energy harvesting can be obtained combined with vibration reduction in the primary structure. Analytical studies are carried out considering stationary Gaussian white noise excitation within the frequency band of interest. Finally a single storey building under seismic excitation is considered and numerical results of structural control and energy harvested are shown.	bioinformatic harvester;displacement mapping;frequency band;maximum power transfer theorem;numerical analysis;piezoelectricity;sensor web;stationary process;white noise	S.

We give exact conditions under which a population can persist in a finite domain in the presence of stream flow, as well as conditions under which a population can spread against the direction of the flow. We find a critical stream velocity above which a population cannot persist in an arbitrarily large domain.

During the design process, feature parameters are optimized to meet various design objectives including functionality, manufacturability, aesthetics, etc. This paper focuses on predicting the impact of parametric feature changes on quantities of interest, such as average stress within a given region, etc. When the parametric change is sufficiently small, one can rely on classic shape sensitivity and reanalysis methods to rapidly predict the desired quantity of interest. However, when the parametric changes are large, both methods are unreliable.  In this paper, we propose an alternate methodology for predicting the impact of large parametric feature changes on field problems, and thereby opening fundamentally new avenues for design exploration and parametric optimization. The proposed methodology is based on the novel concept of feature sensitivity, a generalization of topological sensitivity. Topological sensitivity captures the first-order change in quantities of interest when a small spherical hole is created within an existing geometry. This is generalized here to an arbitrary collection of internal or boundary features. Subsequently, we demonstrate its application to large parametric feature changes. The methodology is illustrated via numerical experiments involving a 2-D scalar field problem.	computer-aided design;design for manufacturability;experiment;first-order reduction;mathematical optimization;meteorological reanalysis;numerical analysis;solid modeling	Sankara Hari Gopalakrishnan;Krishnan Suresh	2007		10.1145/1236246.1236275	scalar field;mathematical optimization;design process;machine learning;first-order logic;mathematics;geometry;statistics	Vision	93.59233639027974	4.099369213634241	91624

It is shown that the solution to the ISP having minimum energy (socalled minimum energy source) can be obtained via a simple method of constrained optimization. This method is applied to the special case when the non-homogeneous background is spherically symmetric (n(r) = n(r)) and yields the minimum energy source in terms of a series of spherical harmonics and radial wave functions that are solutions to a Sturm-Liouville problem. The special case of a source embedded in a spherical region of constant index is treated in detail, and results from computer simulations are presented for this case.	angularjs;computer simulation;constrained optimization;embedded system;mathematical optimization;radial (radio);radiation pattern;semantics (computer science);sturm's theorem	Anthony J.

The limit and the validity of the method proposed were checked by utilizing data from 11 photoionization processes of five different diatomic molecules. The results show that both the observed ionic bond lengths and the corresponding Franck-Condon factors are well reproduced by the method. Hence, the iterative procedure can serve as a good alternative in the determination of bond lengths of diatomic molecules in various excited states if the vibrational intensity distributions of the corresponding electronic transitions are known.

The unsteady flow field induced by pulse disturbances was analyzed and compared with that under continuous disturbances. The temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of disturbances in the boundary layer were investigated and the propagation of different disturbance modes in the boundary layer was researched through the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. The effect of the roughness element on the receptivity characteristic of the hypersonic boundary layer under pulse entropy disturbances was explored. The results showed that the different mode disturbances near roughness in the boundary layer were enlarged in the upstream half of the roughness element and suppressed in the downstream half. However, the effect of roughness weakened gradually as the disturbance frequency increased in the boundary layer. A phenomenon of mode competition in the downstream region of the roughness element exited. As the disturbances propagated downstream, the fundamental mode gradually became the dominant mode. A certain promotion effect on the mode competition was induced by the roughness element and the effect was enhanced with the increase in the roughness element height.	computer simulation;cone;direct numerical simulation;downstream (software development);fast fourier transform;filter (signal processing);finite difference method;normal mode;numerical analysis;software propagation	Zhenqing Wang;Mingfang Shi;Xiaojun Tang;Hongqing Lv;Lidan Xu	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20060404	mathematical optimization;mechanics;fast fourier transform;hypersonic speed;flow (psychology);boundary layer;mathematics;finite difference method;mode (statistics);surface finish;pulse (signal processing)	Robotics	88.72620389390357	3.459076420070245	92214

Needle-free drug delivery device is a typical example of the application of the micro shock tube used in the field of medical science. Compared to the macro shock tube, the flow viscosity and micro scale effects considerably influence the shock wave propagation in the micro shock tube, which makes shock wave behaviors significant difference from the theoretical prediction. Boundary layers which develop behind the moving shock wave attenuate the shock wave propagation as well. Additionally, the gasparticle flows are also shown the different characteristics compared to the single gas flow in the micro shock tube. Particles are induced by the shock wave inside the micro shock tube and accelerated in the supersonic nozzle. Supersonic flows and particle velocity make experimental studies difficult to be performed in the micro shock tube. Even though micro shock tubes have been studied for decades, shock flow characteristics and particle dynamics inside the micro shock tube are not well known to date. For the present study, pressure measurements and optical visualization have been carried out in a micro shock tube. Static pressure measurements were used for investigating the shock wave propagation in the driven section, and Pitot pressure measurements were used for obtaining flow characteristics at the exit of nozzles. Two high sensitive pressure transducers were used for recording pressure changes as the shock wave moved through pressure transducers and the shock Mach number was calculated. Particle tracking velocimetry was conducted to analyze particle-gas two-phase flows. Particle distribution and velocity were obtained in the present experiment study.	apache wave;bbc micro;diaphragm (acoustics);futures studies;micro-operation;particle filter;software propagation;transducer;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking;velocity (software development);williams tube	Guang Zhang;Ikin Lee;Tokitada Hashimoto;Toshiaki Setoguchi;Heuy Dong Kim	2017	J.

Therefore, based on the dry and wet-bulb temperatures as the state variables the temporal moisture distribution in kiln-dried lumber is determined from numerical solutions of mathematical model for the wood drying systems. This computer model is represented by a set of several partial nonlinear differential equations coupled with the operating functions and a set of several calculating algorithms.

Multi-photon LIF finds applications in a broad range of topics; however, the interpretation of the LIF signal is plagued by the nonlinear effects caused by the ASE. Past work focused on developing one-dimensional (1D) models. Therefore, this work developed an MC method to solve the governing equations of ASE and LIF in multidimension. The results were validated using existing 1D data, both experimental and modeling. The results suggest that past 1D models cause noticeable error in the ASE signal even when the measurement volume has a large aspect ratio. We expect this work to facilitate the ongoing research of multi-photon LIF, and to stimulate new experiments that can provide data to validate the model in 2D.	monte carlo method;spontaneous order	Yan Zhao;Xuesong Li;Lin Ma	2012	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2012.02.027	simulation;laser-induced fluorescence;amplified spontaneous emission;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;monte carlo method	ML	92.60870221220745	-6.679978704743971	92347

However, the accurate numerical simulation of turbulent flow around a fully appended maneuvering vessel is a challenging task, because of the geometrical complexity of the appendages and of the complications connected to their movement during the computation. In addition, the accurate description of the flow within the boundary layer is important in order to estimate correctly the forces acting on each portion of the hull.To this aim, the use of overlapping multi-block body fitted grids can be very useful to obtain both a proper description of each particular region in the computational domain and an accurate prediction of the boundary layer, retaining, at the same time, a good mesh quality. Moreover, block-structured grids with partial overlapping can be fruitfully exploited to control grid spacing close to solid walls, without propagation of undesired clustering of grid cells in the interior of the domain. This approach proved to be also very useful in reducing grid generation time.In the present paper, some details of the flow simulation around a fully appended submarine is reported, with emphasis on the issues related to the complexities of the geometry to be used in the simulations and to the need to move the appendages in order to change the configuration of the various appendages.	glossary of sudoku;simulation	Stefano Zaghi;Andrea Di Mascio;Riccardo Broglia;Roberto Muscari	2015	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2014.11.003	simulation;computational fluid dynamics	HPC	91.28946274958628	-0.42370059314029396	92385

Here we study the performance of a non-empirical Tao-Mo (TM) density functional on binding energies and excitation energies of titanium dioxide and water clusters, as well as reaction barrier heights. To make a comparison, a combination of the TM exchange part with the TPSS (Tao–Perdew–Staroverov–Scuseria) correlation functional—called TMTPSS—is also included in this study. Our calculations show that the best binding energies of titanium dioxide are predicted by PBE0 (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof hybrid functional), TM, and TMTPSS with nearly the same accuracy, while B3LYP (Beck’s three-parameter exchange part with Lee-Yang-Parr correlation), TPSS, and PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) yield larger mean absolute errors. For excitation energies of titanium and water clusters, PBE0 and B3LYP are the most accurate functionals, outperforming the performance of semilocal functionals due to the nonlocality problem suffered by the latter. Nevertheless, TMTPSS and TM functionals are still good accurate semilocal methods, improving upon the commonly-used TPSS and PBE functionals. We also find that the best reaction barrier heights are predicted by PBE0 and B3LYP, thanks to the nonlocality incorporated into these two hybrid functionals, but TMTPSS and TM are obviously more accurate than SCAN (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed), TPSS, and PBE, suggesting the good performance of TM and TMTPSS for physically different systems and properties.	burke–fisher error repair;density functional theory;hybrid functional;norm (social);quantum nonlocality;tao framework;two-hybrid screening;william l. burke;yang	Guocai Tian;Yuxiang Mo;Jianmin Tao	2017	Computation	10.3390/computation5020027	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;chemistry;computational chemistry	HPC	96.97231916993479	-4.189351767374905	92624
df05d874f7bcfedcce389cde4c9bce1cb255da0a	implicit matrix representations of rational bézier curves and surfaces	implicitization;bezier patches;inversion problem;moving planes;intersection problems	We introduce and study a new implicit representation of rational Bézier curves and surfaces in the 3-dimensional space. Given such a curve or surface, this representation consists of a matrix whose entries depend on the space variables and whose rank drops exactly on this curve or surface. Our approach can be seen as an extension of the moving lines implicitization method introduced by Sederberg, from non-singular matrices to the more general context of singular matrices. In the first part of this paper, we describe the construction of these new implicit matrix representations and their main geometric properties, in particular their ability to solve efficiently the inversion problem. The second part of this paper aims to show that these implicitization matrices adapt geometric problems, such as intersection problems, to the powerful tools of numerical linear algebra, in particular to one of the most important: the singular value decomposition. So, from the singular values of a given implicit matrix representation, we introduce a real evaluation function. We show that the variation of this function is qualitatively comparable to the Euclidean distance function. As an interesting consequence, we obtain a new determinantal formula for implicitizing a rational space curve or surface over the field of real numbers. Then, we show that implicit matrix representations can be used with numerical computations, in particular there is no need for symbolic computations to use them. We give some rigorous results explaining the numerical stability that we have observed in our experiments. We end the paper with a short illustration on ray tracing of parameterized surfaces.	bézier curve;computation;euclidean distance;evaluation function;experiment;matrix representation;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;numerical stability;ray tracing (graphics);singular value decomposition	Laurent Busé	2014	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2013.08.014	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	ML	83.87714662766874	3.0237334278535815	92695

The main objective is to derive effective white-noise paraxial equations from Maxwell’s equations. We address the scaling regime in which (1) the carrier wavelength is small compared to the incident beam radius, which itself is small compared to the propagation distance; (2) the correlation length of the fluctuations of the random medium is of the same order as the beam radius, and the typical amplitude of the fluctuations is small. In this regime we prove that the wave field is characterized by a white-noise paraxial wave equation that has the form of a Schrödinger-type equation driven by a Brownian field. We identify the covariance function of the Brownian field in terms of the two-point statistics of the fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of the medium. We also study the case in which a strong interface is embedded in the random medium and study the reflected wave, which again is characterized by a Schrödinger-type equation. We discuss applications to enhanced backscattering, time reversal, and imaging.	approximation;boundary case;davis–putnam algorithm;embedded system;emoticon;image scaling;maxwell (microarchitecture);parabolic antenna;schrödinger;smoothing;software propagation;t-symmetry;time reversal signal processing;white noise	Josselin Garnier;Knut Sølna	2009	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/090746288	classical mechanics;electromagnetic radiation;electromagnetic wave equation;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;optical medium	Theory	88.16045040111464	2.567829338889886	92774

To this end two FORTRAN utility programs have been developed, aimed at estimating the seismicity on a fault in cases when this cannot be done directly, or as a comparison with observed data. The first program (''moment_slip'') is one in which seismicity is derived from the rate of seismic slip, based on published models for the connection between slip rates and seismic activity. The size of the fault is essential here, constraining the maximum magnitude. The slope of the frequency-magnitude distribution and its functional form are other important controlling parameters. The key physical concept in this connection is seismic moment release, which is related to magnitude through specified moment-magnitude relationships. For cases when slip rates are not available a second program (''moment_rate'') has been developed, aimed at computing the recurrence rate from an estimate of the moment release, inferred for example from historical and/or recent seismicity in the region in which the fault is located. A number of sensitivity tests demonstrate the relative importance of the different assumptions and parameters.	numerical method	Hilmar Bungum	2007	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2006.10.011	seismology;induced seismicity;data processing;maximum magnitude;geodesy;geology;computer science;frequency;slip;mathematics;seismic moment;magnitude;strain;fault;higher-order function;slope	AI	87.81200154048436	-3.8891966344240556	93575

For that, we propose a simple bioreactor model accounting for light attenuation in the reactor due to biomass density and obtain the control law that optimizes productivity over a single day through the application of Pontryagin's maximum principle, with the dilution rate being the control. An important constraint on the obtained solution is that the biomass in the reactor should be at the same level at the beginning and at the end of the day so that the same control can be applied everyday and optimizes the long term productivity. Several scenarios are possible depending on the microalgae's strain parameters and the maximal admissible value of the dilution rate: bang-bang or bang-singular-bang control or, if the growth rate of the algae is very strong in the presence of light, constant maximal dilution. A bifurcation diagram is presented to illustrate for which values of the parameters these different behaviors occur.	bang file;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;mathematical optimization;maximal set;optimal control;pontryagin's maximum principle;reactor (software);shadow volume	Frédéric Grognard;Andrei R.

By comparison of a series of atomic basis sets contraction, it is concluded that a balanced description of the Fe 7s6p5d3f2g1h and N 4s3p1d partners is needed to reach convergence upon the potential energy surface descriptions. Since the spin-crossover phenomenon involves the simultaneous change in the spin nature and expansion of the coordination sphere of the metal ion (i.e., lengthening of the Fe-N distances), the standard 10 electrons/12 orbitals complete active space is confronted to a chemically intuitive 18 electrons/15 orbitals picture. The role of a second d-shell is finally examined using the extended RAS strategy. Using a valence-bond type analysis, it is shown that the so-called d(') orbitals allow for a significant charge redistribution (approximately 0.5 electron) along the transition. Our calculations are compared to reference coupled-cluster estimations.	basis set (chemistry);coupled cluster;description;dietary iron;distance;electron shell;field electron emission;ions;multi-configurational self-consistent field;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);potential energy surface	Mikaël Kepenekian;Vincent Robert;Boris Le Guennic;Coen de Graaf	2009	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21236	chemistry;spectroscopy;computational chemistry;nuclear magnetic resonance;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	Vision	97.40425004415746	-5.7487782298109495	94060

Interfacing to the ab initio programs Games-US/UK and Gaussian and to the semi-empirical package MOPAC is provided. The emphasis is on computation and visualization of electronic and molecular properties but, e.g., reaction pathways can be simulated as well. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry programs, others are calculated in MOLDEN before display. The package features different options to display MOLecular electronic DENsity, each focusing on a different structural aspect: molecular orbitals, electron density, molecular minus atomic density and the Laplacian of the electron density. To display difference density, either the spherically averaged atomic density or the oriented ground state atomic density can be used for a number of standard basis sets. The quantum mechanical electrostatic potential or a distributed multiple expansion derived electrostatic potential can be calculated and atomic charges can be fitted to these potentials calculated on Connolly surface(s). Reaction pathways and molecular vibrations can be visualized. Input structures can be generated with a Z-matrix editor. A variety of graphics languages is supported: XWindows, postscript, VRML and Povray format.		G. Schaftenaar;Jan H.

The central idea is to utilize polynomial fitting schemes to approximate the thermodynamic integration data to improve the accuracy of the free energy difference estimates. Previously, we introduced the use of polynomial regression technique to fit thermodynamic integration data (Shyu and Ytreberg, J Comput Chem, 2009, 30, 2297). In this report we introduce polynomial and spline interpolation techniques. Two systems with analytically solvable relative free energies are used to test the accuracy of the interpolation approach. We also use both interpolation and regression methods to determine a small molecule solvation free energy. Our simulations show that, using such polynomial techniques and nonequidistant λ values, the solvation free energy can be estimated with high accuracy without using soft-core scaling and separate simulations for Lennard-Jones and partial charges. The results from our study suggest that these polynomial techniques, especially with use of nonequidistant λ values, improve the accuracy for ΔF estimates without demanding additional simulations. We also provide general guidelines for use of polynomial fitting to estimate free energy.

This effect arises when a monoenergetic electron beam bombards a solid target and some of the electrons are scattered without energy loss.The description of the flow can be written as an integral equation and may be solved by Monte Carlo methods.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we investigate the possibility of improving the convergence of the Monte Carlo algorithm by using scrambled low-discrepancy sequences. We demonstrate how by taking advantage of the smoothness of the differential elastic-scattering cross-section a significant decrease of the error is achieved. We show how the contribution of the first few collisions to the result can be evaluated by an appropriate integration method instead of direct simulation, which further increases the accuracy of our computations without increase of the computational time. In order to facilitate these techniques, we use spline approximation of the elastic cross-section, which is more accurate than the widely used tables of Jablonski.	electron;monte carlo method;quasi-monte carlo method	Emanouil I.

The validity of the novel uniform asymptotic solution has been confirmed by comparing with the reference solution. It has been shown that the transition beam plays an important role to connect two different solutions smoothly through the transition region. It becomes apparent that, near the critical angle of the total reflection, the Gaussian beam is displaced to either direction by the interference between the geometrically reflected beam and the lateral beam.

ef96b546830818e28c6231e5cc7b179e7bdc19b3	convergence in the qm-only and qm/mm modeling of enzymatic reactions: a case study for acetylene hydratase	convergence;quantum mechanics only;acetylene hydratase;quantum mechanics molecular mechanics;enzyme reactions	We report systematic quantum mechanics-only (QM-only) and QM/molecular mechanics (MM) calculations on an enzyme-catalyzed reaction to assess the convergence behavior of QM-only and QM/MM energies with respect to the size of the chosen QM region. The QM and MM parts are described by density functional theory (typically B3LYP/def2-SVP) and the CHARMM force field, respectively. Extending our previous work on acetylene hydratase with QM regions up to 157 atoms (Liao and Thiel, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012, 8, 3793), we performed QM/MM geometry optimizations with a QM region M4 composed of 408 atoms, as well as further QM/MM single-point calculations with even larger QM regions up to 657 atoms. A charge deletion analysis was conducted for the previously used QM/MM model (M3a, with a QM region of 157 atoms) to identify all MM residues with strong electrostatic contributions to the reaction energetics (typically more than 2 kcal/mol), which were then included in M4. QM/MM calculations with this large QM region M4 lead to the same overall mechanism as the previous QM/MM calculations with M3a, but there are some variations in the relative energies of the stationary points, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 2.7 kcal/mol. The energies of the two relevant transition states are close to each other at all levels applied (typically within 2 kcal/mol), with the first (second) one being rate-limiting in the QM/MM calculations with M3a (M4). QM-only gas-phase calculations give a very similar energy profile for QM region M4 (MAD of 1.7 kcal/mol), contrary to the situation for M3a where we had previously found significant discrepancies between the QM-only and QM/MM results (MAD of 7.9 kcal/mol). Extension of the QM region beyond M4 up to M7 (657 atoms) leads to only rather small variations in the relative energies from single-point QM-only and QM/MM calculations (MAD typically about 1-2 kcal/mol). In the case of acetylene hydratase, a model with 408 QM atoms thus seems sufficient to achieve convergence in the computed relative energies to within 1-2 kcal/mol.	charmm;convergence (action);duoxa1 gene;density functional theory;energy profile (chemistry);energy, physics;force field (chemistry);functional theories of grammar;greater than;hybrid functional;large;mad;mole, unit of measurement;molecular mechanics;phase i/ii trial;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;rpl10 gene;rate limiting;stationary process;acetylene hydratase;kilocalorie	Rong-Zhen Liao;Walter Thiel	2013	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23403	enzyme;photochemistry;chemistry;convergence;organic chemistry;computational chemistry	NLP	97.26667436327477	-4.506055793104818	96921

bb9d182ee54d790437d26465964a6a4998b9a896	a discretized population balance for particle formation from gas antisolvent process: the combined lax-wendroff and crank-nicholson method	gas;population balance;supercritical carbon dioxide;differential forms;crystal growth;particle size distribution;population balance model;phenanthrene;crystallization;numerical algorithm;particle formation;kinetics;population balance equations;particle formation kinetics;population balance equation;steady state	Population balance models describing particle formation kinetics in supercritical crystallization processes in general and of gas antisolvent crystallization (GAS) process in particular are rather complicated. Depending on the considered particle formation mechanism, population balance model of GAS process may include phenomena such as primary nucleation, secondary nucleation, crystal growth, as well as agglomeration and/or breakage (attrition) of crystals. The resulting equation is often of the integro-partial differential form. A powerful numerical algorithm for the treatment of the implemented population balance model structures is presented in this paper. The method/ algorithm is a combination of the Lax-Wendroff and Crank-Nicholson methods. Algorithm simulations were performed for changes in the main GAS process operating parameters, i.e., the antisolvent addition rate and saturation level. The simulations were performed at a process temperature of 25 °C, while the antisolvent addition rate,  Q   A  , was varied between 1 and 100 ml/min, and the initial solute concentration was varied between 25% and 100% of the concentration ratio. The numerical algorithm was successfully able to treat the implemented population balance model structures, producing smooth dynamic and steady state particle size distributions. Moreover, simulation findings were reasonably consistent with the experimentally obtained data.	crank (person);crank–nicolson method;discretization	Yousef Bakhbakhi	2009	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2008.12.013	supercritical carbon dioxide;chemistry;differential form;particle-size distribution;physical chemistry;crystallization;crystal growth;thermodynamics;steady state;physics;kinetics	HPC	91.84675401785022	-0.5120322371546782	97261

The original proposal concerned a simple way of doing this for Crank-Nicolson central time-difference schemes, and gave useful, but only approximate, agreement with theory in tests where the charge-coupling could also be calculated analytically. The new, slightly modified algorithm, when used with explicit (forward time-difference) modelling, gave analytically exact results for the charge interaction part of a similar trial calculation.	add-ons for firefox;approximation algorithm;crank (person);crank–nicolson method;finite difference;interaction;methamphetamine;scientific publication	G.

We investigated the effect of several substituents upon the relationship between the structure, spatial distribution of the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied pi-MOs, a concept of the global softness and the global hardness as well as both linear and nonlinear polarizabilities for the set of pi-electron chromophores represented by the short-chain model polyene (butadiene) carrying out p-methoxyphenyl group on the one end and several modified indanone groups on the opposite end of the molecule. As probing endocyclic groups used to modify the structure of indanone the following substituents: > CH2; > C=O; > SO2, > C=CH(NO2) and > C=C(CN)2 were selected. The cubic relationship between the polarizability and the global softness was found. The highest polarizabilities (alpha, beta, gamma) are predicted for the derivatives with > C=C(CN)2 group. It was found that the value of beta depends mainly on the difference between dipole moments in the excited and ground states of the molecules. In the case of > SO2 group the results of AMI calculations significantly deviate from relationships found for other derivatives. Experimental IR and Raman spectra of newly synthesized indandione derivative of cinnamaldehyde were compared with computed ones.	1,3-butadiene;amiodarone;angular defect;basis set (chemistry);ch2;cubic function;density functional theory;electron;electronic structure;energy, physics;functional theories of grammar;ground state;image scaling;large;mandibular right second molar tooth;molecular orbital;nonlinear system;polarizability;polyenes;raman scattering;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;sulfur dioxide;cinnamic aldehyde;indacrinone	Henryk Szymusiak;Ryszard Zielinski;Beata W.

Outside it flows with the electric field through the load resistor to which it supplies energy. The whole is well represented by a Bondgraph (BG) and we develop the associated equations, especially for the element SPAC (see Section 2), which affords the coupling of chemical and electric flows. So it is a case of coupled reactions, driven by the concentration gradients between the two battery compartments.

f4ea211c1e5ab39fe4920208ceb3584a036cb866	a model of the fad redox cycle describes the dynamics of the effect of the geomagnetic field on the human visual system	geomagnetic field and cryptochrome;redox cycle of fad;radical pair mechanism;fadh* as signalling state;geomagnetic field and light sensitivity	In experimental studies, we could show that the visual threshold of man is influenced by the geomagnetic field. One of the results was that the threshold shows periodic fluctuations when the vertical component of the field is reversed periodically. The maximum of these oscillations occurred at a period duration of 110 s. To explain this phenomenon, we chose the process that likely underlies the navigation of birds in the geomagnetic field: the light reaction of the FAD component of cryptochrome in the retina. The human retina contains cryptpochrome like the bird retina. Based on the investigations of Müller and Ahmad (J Biol Chem 286:21033–21040, 2011) and Solov’yov and Schulten (J Phys Chem B 116:1089–1099, 2012), we designed a model of the light-induced reduction and subsequent reoxidation of FAD. This model contains a radical pair, whose interconversion dynamics are affected by the geomagnetic field. The parameters of the model were partly calculated from the data of our experimental investigation and partly taken from the results of other authors. These parameters were then optimized by adjusting the model behaviour to the experimental results. The simulation of the finished model shows that the concentrations of all substances included show really oscillations with the frequency of the modelled magnetic field. After optimization of the parameters, the oscillations of FAD and FADH* show maximal amplitude at a period duration of 110 s, as was observed in the experiment. This makes it most likely that the signal, which influences the visual system, originates from FADH* (signalling state).	choose (action);cryptochromes;flavin-adenine dinucleotide;magnetic fields;mathematical optimization;maximal set;quantum fluctuation;retina;simulation;substance	Franz Thoss;Bengt Bartsch	2017	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-017-0725-y	control theory;periodic graph (geometry);visual threshold;quantum electrodynamics;magnetic field;mathematics;amplitude;earth's magnetic field;human visual system model;oscillation;optics;cryptochrome	ML	89.69597972651073	-6.436314822551431	98361

Previous results on this problem were confined to independent Brownian particles arriving at an absorbing sphere. The present paper extends these results to general diffusion processes, without any symmetries and without resorting to explicit expressions for solutions to the relevant equations. It is shown that for general absorbing boundaries and force fields, the steady stream of arrivals is Poissonian with rate equal to the total flux on the absorbing boundary, as calculated from the continuum theory of diffusion with transport. The considered arrival problem arises in the theory of Langevin simulations of ions in electrolytic solutions. In a Langevin simulation ions enter and exit the simulation region, and it is necessary to compute the probability laws for their entrance times into the simulation. While the simulated ions inside the small simulation region interact with each other and with the far field of the surrounding bath and the applied voltage, the physical chemistry continuum description of the surrounding bath implies independent diffusion in a mean field. Under these conditions the result of this paper applies to the stream of new ions that arrive from the continuum bath into the discrete simulation region. The recirculation problem, of ions that have already visited and exited the simulation region, as well as the integration of these results into a simulation of interacting ions will be studied in separate papers.	apache continuum;brownian motion;force field (chemistry);interaction;simulation;stationary process;triune continuum paradigm	Boaz Nadler;T.

Seismic damageability of bridges expressed in the form of fragility curves can easily be incorporated into the scheme of risk analysis of a highway network under the seismic hazard. In this context, this article focuses on a nonlinear static method of developing fragility curves for a typical type of concrete bridge in California. The method makes use of the capacity spectrum method (CSM) for identification of spectral displacement, which is converted to rotations at bridge column ends. To check the reliability of this current analytical procedure, developed fragility curves are compared with those obtained by nonlinear time history analysis. Results indicate that analytically developed fragility curves obtained from nonlinear static and time history analyses are consistent.	community climate system model;computation;displacement mapping;failure cause;hysteresis;it risk management;method (computer programming);nonlinear system;seismic analysis;static program analysis;transverse wave	S.

ca6317e2dae7dfb36f38ac1645fb28e0312be3ef	neural network for quantum brain dynamics: 4d cp ^1 1 +u(1) gauge theory on lattice and its phase structure		We consider a system of two-level quantum quasi-spins and gauge bosons put on a 3+1D lattice. As a model of neural network of the brain functions, these spins describe neurons quantum-mechanically, and the gauge bosons describes weights of synaptic connections. It is a generalization of the Hopfield model to a quantum network with dynamical synaptic weights. At the microscopic level, this system becomes a model of quantum brain dynamics proposed by Umezawa et al., where spins and gauge field describe water molecules and photons, respectively. We calculate the phase diagram of this system under quantum and thermal fluctuations, and find that there are three phases; confinement, Coulomb, and Higgs phases. Each phase is classified according to the ability to learn patterns and recall them. By comparing the phase diagram with that of classical networks, we discuss the effect of quantum fluctuations and thermal fluctuations (noises in signal propagations) on the brain functions.	artificial neural network;quantum	Shinya Sakane;Takashi Hiramatsu;Tetsuo Matsui	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46687-3_36	lattice gauge theory;quantum phase transition;quantum phases;quantum electrodynamics;condensed matter physics;quantum algorithm;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	91.3437461385686	-6.509305245104958	99197

The results showed that when air distribution was not taken into account, the flow of the two flue gases in the bag filter were not uniform. The flow field of coal flue gas was more disordered than that of biomass, but the majority of them moved upward directly. The uniformity was improved after the guide plate was added. Small particles and big ones of flue gas fell apart to two fractions in the middle of the guide plate, big ones on the left and small ones on the right, and both of them did circumferential motion in the bag filter. The results of the numerical simulation supplied reference to the operating and design of filtering bag-type collector for biomass plant.	circuit complexity;computational fluid dynamics;computer simulation	Manyin Hu;Qi Yin;Jinxing Yu;Jing Zhang	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2009.485	computer simulation;fluidized bed combustion;power station;atmospheric model;flow;computational fluid dynamics;numerical analysis;biomass;computer science;flue gas;mathematical model;computational model	Robotics	89.03653573913464	-3.9773487795607427	99235

The achieved hydrodynamic equations, where all inhomogeneous exchange rates take analytical closed form for simple collision models, are then used for the analysis of the steady shock problem. Results indicate that smooth shock profiles occurring for slightly supersonic flows bifurcate to weak solutions (jump discontinuity followed by a smooth tail) for increasing Mach number.	bifurcation theory;euler;linear programming relaxation;mathematical model;reflections of signals on conducting lines	Marzia Bisi;G.

Unstructured grid is employed for both liquid and solid regions and the water-cooling model is fully integrated with the gas flow dynamics where combustion, turbulent flow and free jet expansion are included. The numerical results indicate that the water flow direction has noticeable influence on the cooling efficiency due to the variation of heat capacity of water and the current cooling mechanism has no noticeable effect on the gas flow dynamics within the thermal spraying gun.	computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer cooling;thermal spraying;water cooling	Spyros Kamnis;Sai Gu	2007	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2007.014940	simulation;computational fluid dynamics;thermodynamics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	90.54814284576106	-2.66771645560249	99878

Of particular interest is the question of the behaviour of the functional as one passes from 1D to 3D; according to the basic principles of Density Functional Theory (DFT) the form of the universal functional should be independent of the dimensionality. However, in practice the straightforward use of current approximate functionals in different dimensions is problematic. Here, we show that going from the 3D to the 2D case the functional form is consistent (concave function) but in 1D becomes convex; such a drastic difference is peculiar of 1D electron systems as it is for other quantities. Given the interesting behaviour of the functional, this study represents a basic first-principle approach to the problem and suggests further investigations using highly accurate (though expensive) many-electron computational techniques, such as Quantum Monte Carlo.	approximation algorithm;concave function;density functional theory;electron;functional theories of grammar;higher-order function;interaction;monte carlo method;quantum monte carlo;sampling (signal processing)	A.

The predictions included determination of protonation states for both host and guests, docking pose generation, and binding free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration. We found a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.6 kcal mol(-1) from the reference experimental results, with an R(2) correlation of 0.51. The agreement with experiment for the largest contributor to this error, guest 6, is improved by 1.7 kcal mol(-1) when a periodicity-induced free energy correction is applied. The corrections for the other ligands were significantly smaller, and altogether the RMSE was reduced by 0.4 kcal mol(-1). We link properties of the host-guest systems during simulation to errors in the computed free energies. Overall, we show that charged host-guest systems studied here, initialized in unconfirmed docking poses, present a challenge to accurate alchemical simulation methods.	charge (electrical);dna integration;directed acyclic graph;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;energy, physics;largest;ligands;mean squared error;molecular dynamics;plant roots;quasiperiodicity;simulation;small;thermodynamic integration;thermodynamics;water model;free energy;kilocalorie	Morgan Lawrenz;Jeff Wereszczynski;Juan Manuel Ortiz-Sánchez;Sara E.

In multidimensional set-ups, perfect geometrical decoupling cannot be achieved. Remaining coupling can distort the trajectory and introduce artefacts, thus active decoupling is introduced at costs of high power consumption. This work uses a device with active coupling control to investigate the influence of different coupling levels on the image reconstruction.		Anselm von Gladiss;Matthias Graeser;Thorsten M.

The presence of both 3D and 2D electron gas is included along with the quantization in the transversal direction with respect to the oxide at the gate which gives rise to a subband decomposition of the electron energy. Both intra- and interparticle scatterings between the 2D and 3D electron gas are considered. In particular, a fictitious transition from the 3D to the 2D electrons and vice versa is introduced by adapting the approach used in [M. V. Fischetti and S. E. Laux, Phys. Rev.

The algorithm presented here is designed to perform the computation of the conformational partition and therefore it can be used for the prediction of experimentally available quantities such as NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants. The program is efficient in the sense that only dihedral angles and pseudorotational coordinates are handled in the first steps thus allowing a rapid sampling of a great number of points through the entire conformational space. The program provides options to choose between grid searches, energy minimization or both, using a reasonable amount of computer time.		F. J. Bermejo;M. Rico;Tapani Ryhänen;E. Martìnez;J. Garcìa;J.

In the mass transfer model, the dispersive flow is assumed to reduce the concentration gradient of dye liquor flowing through the package. This paper illustrates the influence of dispersion term on dye transport based on numerical simulation of dyebath. The transfer of dye through the package is described by a set of time-dependent partial differential equations, which govern convection, dispersion, and adsorption of dyes in the dyebath and across the yarn package.

Most of the analytical solutions for complex transport problems are closed-form series solutions. The convergence of these solutions depends on the eigenvalues obtained from a corresponding transcendental equation. Thus, the difficulty in obtaining exact solutions from analytical models encourages the use of numerical solutions for the parameter estimation even though, the later models are computationally expensive. In this paper a combination of two swarm intelligence based algorithms are used for accurate estimation of design transport parameters from the closed-form analytical solutions. Estimation of eigenvalues from a transcendental equation is treated as a multimodal discontinuous function optimization problem. The eigenvalues are estimated using an algorithm derived based on glowworm swarm strategy. Parameter estimation of the inverse problem is handled using standard PSO algorithm. Integration of these two algorithms enables an accurate estimation of design parameters using closed-form analytical solutions. The present solver is applied to a real world inverse problem in environmental engineering. The inverse model based on swarm intelligence techniques is validated and the accuracy in parameter estimation is shown. The proposed solver quickly estimates the design parameters with a great precision.	algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;computation;eigen (c++ library);estimation theory;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;solver;swarm intelligence	Tadikonda Venkata Bharat	2008	2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium	10.1109/SIS.2008.4668312	control engineering;mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics	EDA	93.70017392039635	3.9059351721965454	101687

70726c8ebcc1e742c0b71c918ed90a3ac466e96b	constitutive relation of engineering material based on sir model and ham		As an epidemic mathematical model, the SIR model represents the transition of the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. The profound implication of the SIR model is viewed as the propagation and dynamic evolutionary process of the different internal components and the characteristics in a complex system subject to external effect. The uniaxial stress-strain curve of engineering material represents the basic constitutive relation, which also represents the damage propagation in the units of the damaged member. Hence, a novel dynamic stress-strain model is established based on the SIR model. The analytical solution and the approximate solution for the proposed model are represented according to the homotopy analysis method (HAM), and the relationship of the solution and the size effect and the strain rate is discussed. In addition, an experiment on the size effect of confined concrete is carried out and the solution of SIR model is suitable for simulation. The results show that the mechanical mechanism of the parameters of the uniaxial stress-strain model proposed in this paper reflects the actual characteristics of the materials.The solution of the SIRmodel can fully and accurately show the change of the mechanical performance and the influence of the size effect and the strain rate.	approximation algorithm;complex system;electrical load;intension;mathematical model;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;simulation;sir dystic;software propagation	Haoxiang He;Enzhen Han;Maolin Cong	2014	J.

95690cf91541654c4cdb93cc6b4bfdb7e2f95e59	efficient determination of the markovian time-evolution towards a steady-state of a complex open quantum system		Master equations are commonly used to describe time evolution of open systems. We introduce a general method for calculating a Markovian solution of the Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized master equation. We do so for a time dependent transport of interacting electrons through a complex nano scale system in a photon cavity. The central system, described by 120 many-body states in a Fock space, is weakly coupled to the external leads. The very diverse relaxation times of the open system, reflecting radiative or non-radiative transitions, require information about the time evolution through many orders of magnitude. In our approach, the generalized master equation is mapped from a many-body Fock space of states to a Liouville space of transitions. We show that this results in a linear equation which is solved exactly through an eigenvalue analysis, which supplies information on the steady state and the time evolution of the system.	open quantum system;steady state	Thorsteinn H.

8b1a06beeec6e5d4404ac281f640a9c8b0b04353	thermodynamically consistent simulation of nonisothermal diffuse-interface two-phase flow with peng-robinson equation of state		Abstract. In this paper, we consider a diffuse-interface gas-liquid two-phase flow model with inhomogeneous temperatures, in which we employ the Peng-Robinson equation of state and the temperature-dependent influence parameter instead of the van der Waals equation of state and the constant influence parameter used in the existing models. As a result, our model can characterize accurately the physical behaviors of numerous realistic gas-liquid fluids, especially hydrocarbons. Furthermore, we prove a relation associating the pressure gradient with the gradients of temperature and chemical potential, and thereby derive a new formulation of the momentum balance equation, which shows that gradients of the chemical potential and temperature become the primary driving force of the fluid motion. It is rigorously proved that the new formulations of the model obey the first and second laws of thermodynamics. To design efficient numerical methods, we prove that Helmholtz free energy density is a concave function with respect to the temperature under certain physical conditions. Based on the proposed modeling formulations and the convex-concave splitting of Helmholtz free energy density, we propose a novel thermodynamically stable numerical scheme. We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, numerical tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed simulation method.		Jisheng Kou;Shuyu Sun	2018	J. Comput.

468a4be3016bccd552e5547da63e4a12d11dbfd0	model development and optimization base on generalized steady-state electrochemical equations for a pem fuel cell		The development of a generalized steady-state electrochemical model of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell or proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system is presented by R.F Mann et al. to predict the output voltage of a single Ballard Mark V cell as a function of the major variables like current density, pressure of the reactant gases and working temperature more efficiently (Mann et al. 2000). But this model cannot explain the behavior of the voltage at high current densities as well as the other ranges. In this research a new term that account for mass transfer losses is added to compensate the precision of the model particularity at high current densities. Using this model, the power density of a Ballard Mark V fuel cell system that consists of 35 cells is optimized by a hybrid optimization algorithm base on genetic algorithm and a gradient base algorithm that shows very good performance to reach the exact optimum point.	cell (microprocessor);genetic algorithm;gradient;harvard mark i;mathematical optimization;polymer;privacy-enhanced electronic mail;steady state	Amir Shokuhi-Rad;Nader Nariman-Zadeh;Mohammad Naghash-Zadegan	2009		10.7148/2009-0322-0327	current density;voltage;power density;electrochemistry;control theory;steady state;proton exchange membrane fuel cell;electrolyte;mass transfer;chemistry	ML	88.97665380032458	-3.7529869854608746	102788

This model is based on the volume averaging of the governing equations. Interstitial quantities are obtained through means of a pore-scale model. For flow through porous media, in the Darcy regime, the interstitial fluid–solid interaction component is written in terms of the interstitial wall shear stress. The wall shear stress is obtained by assuming simple velocity profiles in the interstitial channels. Approximations are made in order to obtain explicit expressions for the wall shear stress in terms of the average interstitial channel velocities. The final analytical expressions obtained for predicting the flow through porous media can easily be implemented numerically and allow for a wide variety of practical implementations. Generalized Newtonian fluids traversing a porous structure adjacent to a free-flow domain were modelled numerically. The results for Newtonian fluids were compared to an analytical model from literature.		M. Cloete;G. J. F.

Here, we study self-replicating structures in the 3D space-time continuous and physically grounded framework of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).

This method introduces a mass remedy procedure based on the local curvature at the interface, and in principle, can ensure the absolute mass conservation of the liquid phase in the computational domain. Three benchmark cases, including Zalesak's disk, a drop deforming in a vortex field, and the binary drop head-on collision, are simulated to validate the present method, and the excellent agreement with exact solutions or experimental results is achieved. It is shown that the present method is able to capture the complex interface with second-order accuracy and negligible additional computational cost. The present method is then applied to study more complex flows, such as a drop impacting on a liquid film and the swirling liquid sheet atomization, which again, demonstrates the advantages of mass conservation and the capability to represent the interface accurately.	computer simulation;liquid image	Kun Luo;Changxiao Shao;Jianren Fan	2015	J.

The paper provides a detailed explanation of the modeling of the electron beam gun properties, such as the absorption rate and the energy dissipation. Additionally, an algorithm for the construction of a realistic powder bed is discussed. Special emphasis is placed to a parallel, optimized implementation due to the high computational costs of 3D simulations. Finally, a thorough validation of the heat equation and the solid–liquid phase transition demonstrates the capability of the approach to considerably improve the electron beam melting process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The decrease of pressure will cause three areas, miscible flooding area, immiscible flooding area and transition area in reservoir (only miscible flooding area and immiscible flooding area are considered in this paper). At the same time, diffusion will be happen between CO2 and formation fluid. Base on the mass conservation and percolation theory, multi-phase, multi-component and division mathematical model was established. In this model, diffusion is considered in the process of miscible flooding and immiscible flooding. It is different from conventional mathematical model.

740471bf69a4299a5d6b27bf3908b1ab98cd09e8	spectral element methods for liquid metal reactors applications		Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program aims to develop an integrated multiphysics simulation capability “pellet to plant” for the design and analysis of future generations of nuclear power plants. NEAMS embraces a multiresolution hierarchy designing the code suite structure to ultimately span the full range of length and time scales present in relevant reactor design and safety analyses. Advanced reactors, such as liquid metal reactors, rely on innovative component designs to meet cost and safety targets. Heuristic assumptions typically employed in the safety analysis of the current fleet are not likely be sufficient. In order to span a wider design range, advanced modeling and simulation capabilities that rely on minimal assumptions (i.e., fewer closure models) plays an important role in optimizing the design. Over the past several years the NEAMS program has developed the integrated multiphysics code suite SHARP [1] aimed at streamlining the prototyping of such components. The goal of developing such a tool is to perform multiphysics neutronics, thermal/fluid, and structural mechanics modeling of various reactor components at user-specified fidelity, with a focus on first principles approaches (“high fidelity”). The thermal-hydraulic philosophy in NEAMS relies on a hierarchical multiscale approach (Fig. 1) consistent with other programs, such as THINS. SHARP focus on the high-fidelity end, aiming primarily at turbulence-resolving techniques such large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulation (DNS). The computational fluid dynamics code (CFD) selected for SHARP is Nek5000 [2], a state-of-the-art highly scalable tool employing the spectral element method (SEM). In the following we review the method and its implementation in Nek5000 (Section 2). We also examine several applications (Section 3).

The model is derived from direct use of Gauss's law, Drift Diffusion Approach (DDA) and effective Band Gap Widening (BGW). The Quantum Mechanical Effects (QMEs) are included in the model by taking the effects of BGW, which reduces the electron density in the subthreshold regime and reduces the subthreshold current consequently. The model explicitly shows how the oxide thickness, gate workfunction, and silicon thickness have an effect on the subthreshold current. The results obtained using proposed model is verified by comparison through SILVACO Atlas TCAD simulation; quite good agreement has been observed between model and numerical simulations results. & 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we concentrate on the structure in the vapor phase, especially the clustering of the water molecules. At the lower temperatures most vapor molecules were present as monomers and most “clusters” were dimers. At higher temperatures a larger fraction of the vapor molecules formed part of large clusters. The fraction of closed clusters of a given size decreased in favor of open chains with increasing temperatures.	simulation	Erik Johansson;Kim Bolton;Peter Ahlström	2005	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2005.03.014	water;water vapor;physical chemistry;physics;monte carlo method;cluster	AI	95.99787321051372	-5.253268894421107	104931

In order to assist its construction, a dynamic simulation of the thermal oil heated boiler has been developed by the Vienna University of Technology. Aim of this work is to assess how critical is the boiler behavior for the plant operation during a start-up phase, and especially to check if the natural water circulation starts correctly. After a description of the heat exchanger design, the different stages of the simulation build-up with the software APROS are described. As a result of the model validation, the improvement of the model discretization is outlined along with the calibration of the heat transfer coefficients. Further on, the observation of relevant parameters of the system (water circulation rate, steam mass fraction and critical heat flux) during the simulated start-up, allow characterizing the boiler. Thus, the natural circulation start can be described with a good fidelity. Findings about the economizer behavior and the occurrence of boiling crisis are also exposed. Eventually, a design optimization can be carried out through the applied method. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The phenomenon has been termed thixotropy of water due to the weak gel-like behaviour which may develop spontaneously over time where ions and contact with hydrophilic surfaces seem to play important roles. Thixotropy is a property of certain gels and liquids that under normal conditions are highly viscous, whereas during mechanical processing their viscosity diminishes. We found experiments indicating water’s self-organizing properties, long-lived inhomogeneities and time-dependent changes in the spectral parameters of aqueous systems. The large-scale inhomogeneities in aqueous solutions seem to occur in a vast number of systems. Long-term spectral changes of aqueous systems were observed even though the source of radiation was switched off or removed. And water was considered to be an active excitable medium in which appropriate conditions for self-organization can be established. In short, the thixotropic phenomenon of water is further indicated by different experimental techniques and may be triggered by large-scale ordering of water in the vicinity of nucleating solutes and hydrophilic surfaces.	design of experiments;excitable medium;experiment;organizing (structure);pollack's rule;self-organization	Nada Verdel;Peter Bukovec	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16042146	aqueous solution;water;thixotropy;physics	Metrics	91.49930252465306	-5.833720978849642	105207

The respective eigenvalue problems are particularly challenging because they require the high precision computation of all multiple complex roots of f (z) confined to the specified finite domain. Generally f (z), despite being holomorphic, does not have explicit analytical form thereby inhibiting evaluation of its derivatives.	computation;evaluation function;fortran	Charles Gillan;A.

The approach considers as alternatives from conventional sequences in which each final distillation column has a condenser and a reboiler, to fully thermally coupled distillation sequences going through all possible intermediate combinations. A two-stage procedure is proposed. In the first one, a sequence of tasks is selected and then in a second stage the best configuration of actual columns is extracted among all the thermodynamically equivalent configurations. The model uses the Underwood–Fenske–Gilliland approximation and is formulated as a generalized disjunctive programming problem. The model has proven to be very robust and reliable. This formulation also makes the model very flexible and allows the easy modification of the equations and even migration to other model types including rigorous tray-by-tray models. Rigorous simulations in HYSYS [AEA Technology, Hyprotech Ltd., Calgary, Canada, 2001] have shown good agreement with the shortcut model.		José Antonio Caballero;Ignacio E.

7f87c25b76471fa3ebae19fa48c2744d281ec0e5	symmetries in the wheeled inverted pendulum mechanism		The purpose of this article is to illustrate the role of connections and symmetries in the Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP) mechanism an underactuated system with rolling constraints popularized commercially as the Segway, and thereby arrive at a set of simpler dynamical equations that could serve as the starting point for more complex feedback control designs. The first part of the article views the nonholonomic constraints enforced by the rolling assumption as defining an Ehresmann connection on a fiber bundle. The resulting equations are the reduced Euler Lagrange equations, which are identical to the Lagrange d’Alembert equations of motion. In the second part we explore conserved quantities, in particular, nonholonomic momenta. To do so, we first introduce the notion of a symmetry group, whose action leaves both the Lagrangian and distribution invariant. We examine two symmetry groups SE(2) and SE(2)× S. The first group leads to the purely kinematic case while the second gives rise to nonholonomic momentum equations.	euler;euler–lagrange equation;feedback;inverted index;inverted pendulum;navier–stokes equations	Sneha Gajbhiye;Ravi N.

As a quasi-one-dimensional system, it also exhibits a rather interesting “phase behavior”: At low temperatures the stripe is either filled with “liquid” or “gas” and “densities” are similar to those in the bulk. When we approach a “pseudo-critical point” (below the critical point of the bulk) at which the correlation length becomes comparable to the length of the stripe, several interfaces emerge and the systems contains multiple “liquid” and “gas” domains. The transition depends on the size of the stripe and occurs at lower temperatures for larger stripes. Our results are corroborated by simulations of the three-dimensional Asakura–Oosawa model in cylindrical geometry, which displays qualitatively similar behavior. Thus our simulations explain the physical basis for the occurrence of “hysteresis critical points” in corresponding experiments.	algorithm;apple a5;blue (queue management algorithm);computer simulation;critical point (network science);emergence;experiment;hysteresis;ising model;magnetic stripe card;monte carlo method;simulation;stripes	D.

In this model, an additional damping function was introduced into the model of eddy viscosity, while the treatment of the turbulent kinetic energy (k) and its dissipation rate () is an extension of the model for Newtonian fluids. For constructing the damping function, we considered the influence of viscoelasticity on the turbulent eddy motion and its dissipative scale and investigated the frequency response for the constitutive equation based on the Giesekus fluid model. Assessment of the proposed model’s performance in several rheological conditions for drag-reduced turbulent channel flows demonstrated good agreement with DNS (direct numerical simulation) data.	turbulence	Takahiro Tsukahara;Yasuo Kawaguchi	2013	J.

Examples include iontophoretic and electroporation-mediated drug delivery. Here, we describe a robust method for characterizing electrodiffusive transport in physiologic aqueous media. Specifically, we treat the case of solute present in sufficiently low concentration as to negligibly contribute to the total ionic current within the system. In this limiting case, which applies to many systems of interest, the predominant electrical behavior due to small ions is decoupled from solute transport. Thus, electrical behavior may be characterized using existing methods and treated as known in characterizing electrodiffusive molecular transport. First, we present traditional continuum equations governing electrodiffusion of charged solutes within aqueous electrolytes and then adapt them to discretized systems. Second, we examine the time-dependent and steady-state interfacial concentration gradients that result from the combination of diffusion and electrical drift. Third, we show how interfacial concentration gradients are related to electric field strength and duration. Finally, we examine how discretization size affects the accuracy of these methods. Overall these methods are motivated by and well suited to addressing an outstanding goal: estimation of the net ionic and molecular transport facilitated by electroporation in biological systems.	biological system;body tissue;chloride ion;discretization;drug delivery systems;electricity;electrolytes;electroporation therapy;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;gradient;ionic;ions;iontophoresis;molecular transport;potassium;relevance;robustness (computer science);sodium;steady state;transportation theory (mathematics);triune continuum paradigm;solute	Kyle C.

The applications of parametric sensitivity analysis were used for detection of parametric sensitivity in a continuous stirred tank reactor using catalyses hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system. Also, theoretical investigation revealed that the effect of wall capacitance has definite influence on the dynamics of continuous stirred tank reactor.

87bae8216906ebc6f82fe0ba0cef547b8bee90d7	asymptotic-preserving monte carlo methods for transport equations in the diffusive limit		We develop a new Monte Carlo method that solves hyperbolic transport equations with stiff terms, characterized by a (small) scaling parameter. In particular, we focus on systems which lead to a reduced problem of parabolic type in the limit when the scaling parameter tends to zero. Classical Monte Carlo methods suffer of severe time step limitations in these situations, due to the fact that the characteristic speeds go to infinity in the diffusion limit. This makes the problem a real challenge, since the scaling parameter may differ by several orders of magnitude in the domain. To circumvent these time step limitations, we construct a new, asymptotic-preserving Monte Carlo method that is stable independently of the scaling parameter and degenerates to a standard probabilistic approach for solving the limiting equation in the diffusion limit. The method uses an implicit time discretization to formulate a modified equation in which the characteristic speeds do not grow indefinitely when the scaling factor tends to zero. The resulting modified equation can readily be discretized by a Monte Carlo scheme, in which the particles combine a finite propagation speed with a time-step dependent diffusion term. We show the performance of the method by comparing it with standard (deterministic) approaches in the literature.		Giacomo Dimarco;Lorenzo Pareschi;Giovanni Samaey	2018	SIAM J.

LICHEM can interface with Gaussian, PSI4, NWChem, TINKER, and TINKER-HP to enable QM/MM calculations using multipolar/polarizable force fields. LICHEM extracts forces and energies from unmodified QM and MM software packages to perform geometry optimizations, single-point energy calculations, or Monte Carlo simulations. When the QM and MM regions are connected by covalent bonds, the pseudo-bond approach is employed to smoothly transition between the QM region and the polarizable force field. A series of water clusters and small peptides have been employed to test our initial implementation. The results obtained from these test systems show the capabilities of the new software and highlight the importance of including explicit polarization. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.		Eric G.

74b599eee998f4d482cc61d73c1dfc041b945f1c	open system approach to the internal dynamics of a model multilevel molecule		A model multilevel molecule described by two sets of rotational internal energy levels of different parity and degenerate ground states, coupled by a constant interaction, is considered, by assuming that the random collisions in a gas of identical molecules, provoke transitions between adjacent energy levels of the same parity. The prescriptions of the continuous time quantum random walk is applied to the single molecule, interpreted as an open quantum system, and the master equation driving its internal dynamics is built for a general distribution of random collision times. Over estimated long time scales, the dynamics of the coherence terms and the populations of the energy levels is evaluated analytically for relevant classes of non-Poissonian distributions of the collision times. Inverse power law relaxations and the inverse Zeno effect emerge over estimated long time scales and the stable asymptotic equilibrium configuration results to be independent of the distribution of the collision times.	energy level;open quantum system;parity bit;population;quantum zeno effect;quantum decoherence;quantum walk	Filippo Giraldi;Francesco Petruccione	2012	Open Syst.

c85e4ad7224922532a006cbc996fdccdbb9455f1	entropy conditions involved in the nonlinear coupled constitutive method for solving continuum and rarefied gas flows		The numerical study of continuum-rarefied gas flows is of considerable interest because it can provide fundamental knowledge regarding flow physics. Recently, the nonlinear coupled constitutive method (NCCM) has been derived from the Boltzmann equation and implemented to investigate continuum-rarefied gas flows. In this study, we first report the important and detailed issues in the use of the H theorem and positive entropy generation in the NCCM. Importantly, the unified nonlinear dissipation model and its relationships to the Rayleigh–Onsager function were demonstrated in the treatment of the collision term of the Boltzmann equation. In addition, we compare the Grad moment method, the Burnett equation, and the NCCM. Next, differences between the NCCM equations and the Navier–Stokes equations are explained in detail. For validation, numerical studies of rarefied and continuum gas flows were conducted. These studies include rarefied and/or continuum gas flows around a two-dimensional (2D) cavity, a 2D airfoil, a 2D cylinder, and a three-dimensional space shuttle. It was observed that the present results of the NCCM are in good agreement with those of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method in rarefied cases and are in good agreement with those of the Navier–Stokes equations in continuum cases. Finally, this study can be regarded as a theoretical basis of the NCCM for the development of a unified framework for solving continuum-rarefied gas flows.	apache continuum;cylinder seal;direct simulation monte carlo;gradient;monte carlo method;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;rayleigh–ritz method;triune continuum paradigm;unified framework	Ke Tang;Hong Xiao	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19120683	computational physics;mathematics;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system	ML	90.8259921582877	3.400740204510467	108847

2568be32d7ae6e65bfce8e4a0007adda5a9d228f	importance of madelung potential in quantum chemical modeling of ionic surfaces		The importance of the inclusion of the Madelung potential in cluster models of ionic surfaces is the subject of this work. We have determined Hartree]Fock all electron wave functions for a series of MgO clusters with and without a large Ž . array of surrounding point charges PC chosen to reproduce the Madelung potential. The phenomena investigated include: the reactivity of surface oxygens toward CO , atomic hydrogen, and Hq; the geometry and adsorption energy of 2 water and the vibrational shift of CO adsorbed at Mg2q sites; the electronic structure and the hyperfine coupling constants of oxygen vacancies, the paramagnetic Fq centers. While some clusters give results which are virtually s independent of the presence of the PCs, other clusters, typically of small size, give physically incorrect results when the PCs are not included. The embedding of the cluster in PCs guarantees a similar response for clusters of different size, at variance with the bare clusters, where the long range coulombic interactions are not included.

The cubic crystalline anisotropy constant, K1, of these films has been measured at room temperature by a torque method. In the case of the Ni-Fe alloys, K1 was found to be the same for thin films as for bulk materials of the same composition. The measured anisotropy in the Ni-Co films differs quantitatively but has the same qualitative variation with composition as is reported for bulk crystals. The results of one magnetic annealing experiment on a 75% Ni - 25% Fe film lends support to the short-range ordering model of uniaxial anisotropy in alloys. Pure nickel films exhibit a pronounced uniaxial anisotropy superimposed on the crystalline anisotropy. This uniaxial term disappears after the film is removed from the substrate, indicating that its origin is in an anisotropic stress in the deposited film.		Edward L.

We first build a database of lithium clusters by optimizing several candidate structures for the ground state geometry for each size. The full polarizability tensor is determined for about 5-6 isomers of each cluster size using the finite-field method. All calculations are performed using large Gaussian basis sets, and within the generalized gradient approximation to the density functional theory, as implemented in the NRLMOL suite of codes. The average polarizability per atom varies from 11 to 9 Å within the 8-22 size range and show smoother decrease with increase in cluster size than the experimental values. While the average polarizability exhibits a relatively weak dependence on cluster conformation, significant changes in the degree of anisotropy of the polarizability tensor are observed. Interestingly, in addition to the expected even odd (0 and 1 μB) magnetic states, our results show several cases where clusters with an odd number of Li atoms exhibit elevated spin states (e.g. 3 μB).	approximation;atom;basis set (chemistry);code;computation;density functional theory;electron;functional theories of grammar;gradient;ground state;jellium;polarizability	Rajendra R.

d6db4c10b3ae4c5aa931f737321c3650185d3387	large-scale hydromagnetic dynamo by lehnert waves in nonresistive plasma		A new mechanism of large-scale magnetic fields generation is studied, which is based on creation of mean electromotive force through interactions between distinct Lehnert (magneto-Coriolis) waves. The crucial feature of this mechanism is that it does not require magnetic diffusivity to operate, in contrast to the hitherto known standard diffusive one. The hydromagnetic dynamo problem is studied at a fundamental level, with nonstationary spectrum tensor of the underlying turbulence, and the obtained results are discussed in the context of the standard theory of large-scale magnetic field generation. The significance of the new mechanism is found to manifest itself at $E_{eta}ll Rm^{-3/4}$, where $E_{eta}$ is the modified Ekman number based on magnetic diffusivity and $Rmgg1$ denotes the magnetic Reynolds number.	plasma active	Krzysztof A.

The population balance model that describes the nanocrystal synthesis consists of a population balance equation and a set of species concentration equations. In order to incorporate the effects of both reaction and diffusion limited growth conditions, a kinetic model with size-dependent growth and nucleation rate expressions are considered. An efficient finite element scheme based on Strang splitting that handles size-dependent particle diffusion and non-uniform growth expressions in the high dimensional popueywords: anocrystal synthesis icrofluidic reactor opulation balance model lation balance equation is proposed to solve the model equations. After the validation of the numerical scheme, an array of parametric studies is performed to study the effects of the flow condition and the growth environment on the nanocrystal synthesis in the microfluidic reactor.

3097665a641ff390d047a2b523fa9bc85c87193f	numerical method and simplified analytical model for predicting the blast load in a partially confined chamber		Abstract The paper presents a study aimed at understanding the characteristics of an internal explosion within a chamber with limited venting. The study includes numerical simulations and analytical derivations. An in-house 3D code employing an improved weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) conservative finite difference scheme was used to carry out the simulations. It is indicated that the proposed improved WENO scheme can resolve the shock waves with higher accuracy and resolution. Further, a simplified analytical model to predict the quasi-static overpressure was developed based on the conservation law of total energy and dimensional analysis theory. It is demonstrated that the proposed simplified approach for prediction of the quasi-static overpressure agrees well with simulation results for a wide range of explosive weights and venting hole sizes. The studies in this paper provide an efficient method to predict the blast load inside a partially confined chamber for the analysis of the consequences of explosion.	blast;numerical method	Weizheng Xu;Weiguo Wu;Yongshui Lin	2018	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2018.04.019	shock wave;mathematical optimization;finite difference;overpressure;numerical analysis;conservation law;mathematics;explosive material	HPC	91.36465216367922	3.5353388869497118	110045

For circularly polarized (CP) light directed normal to the orbit, very pronounced subharmonic resonance behavior is shown to occur with a variety of interesting properties. In particular, only if the amplitude of the CP light exceeds a critical value, will the resonance continue without radius and energy decay. A perturbation analysis is carried out to illustrate the main features of the behavior. The present phenomena adds to a growing list of other nonlinear dynamical behaviors of this simple system, that may well be important for more deeply understanding classical and quantum connections.	circular polarization;dynamical system;electron;hydrogen;nonlinear system;perturbation theory;resonance;stationary process	Daniel C.

672edf31fe3f11907587fa4e297cd961e690718f	study of electrochemical migration based transport kinetics of metal ions in sn-9zn alloy		Abstract In microelectronic circuit exposed to humid environment, the growth phenomenon of dendritic deposits due to the electrochemical migration (ECM) of metallic ions, generates a serious reliability issue. ECM of Sn and Zn ions in deionized water with Sn-9Zn electrodes, has been in-situ studied at gap potentials of 3 and 5 V. At 3 V, tin ions (with 15.61 wt%) dominate the composition of metallic dendrites whereas Zn ions (with 20.99 wt%) show greater presence in the experiment with 5 V. The Nernst-Planck transport equation has been solved using finite element method in order to describe the kinetics of ECM of Sn 2+ and Zn 2+ ions. The composition of resultant dendrites is governed by the competition between advection rate, transport time scale and anodic surface concentration of metallic species.	kinetics internet protocol;printed circuit board	Haoran Ma;Anil Kunwar;Jun Chen;Lin Qu;Yunpeng Wang;Xueguan Song;Peter Råback;Haitao Ma;Ning Zhao	2018	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2018.02.013	electronic engineering;engineering;tin;ion;electrode;alloy;metal ions in aqueous solution;electrochemical migration;phenomenon;metal;inorganic chemistry	HPC	92.48116569925062	-3.0037099898298676	110496

The 2-D velocity fields of the mixers measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are used to identify the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs). The results show that the LCSs separate the physical space into two portions. In the case of the center-blade mixer the portion bounded inside the LCS experiences a relatively slow mixing relative to the portion outside of the LCS boundary. However, when the blade position is located near the wall, the LCS becomes more complicated but it still separates regions of fast mixing from a slower one. We develop a heuristic dynamical system model of our mixers to understand how the vorticity strength at the blade tips influences the variation of the LCSs. Finally, we define an appropriate notion of mixing to study the mixing rate of our mixing devices.	coherence (physics);control theory;displacement mapping;dynamical system;heuristic;lagrangian coherent structure;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;mixing (mathematics);numerical analysis;particle filter;transverse wave;trapping region;velocity (software development)	Naratip Santitissadeekorn;D.

For a single free-standing pellet, comparisons are made between SPICE simulations using the proposed models and with numerical simulations carried out with Mathematica software. Results illustrate accuracy of the distributed parameter models and show how inappropriate it is to assume, in some cases, constant material parameters for an entire thermoelectric element.

Addressing first the image processing issues, electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) [2] relies heavily on image transformations of electron diffraction patterns. High energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) [3] also relies on thresholding of the diffractograms for peak identification [4]. By contrast to the standard finite element method, an image-based approach [5] that relies on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has started to be used for simulating plastic deformation because it offers a more efficient solution of the same equations (e.g. mechanical equilibrium). It is possible, for example, to import directly a measured 3D image from HEDM into the FFT simulation code and simulate with no need for the time-consuming step of creating a 3D mesh. Common filters applied to orientation maps in particular, include grain average strain, Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM), Grain Orientation Spread (GOS), Intragranular Grain Misorientation (IGM).	anti-grain geometry;electron diffraction;electron tomography;experiment;fast fourier transform;finite element method;image processing;map;simulation;thresholding (image processing)	Jonathan Lind;Anthony D.

Protections can be generated by capping the device: a piece of silicon is placed on top of it to create a cavity above it. Parametric finite element models are combined with dedicated verification experiments to address the reliability of four different capping concepts.

For the considered class of models, we establish existence of a new type of ultra-singular self-similar solutions. These solutions arise as limits of the solutions of the initial value problem with zero initial data and infinitely strong source at the boundary. We prove existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the suitable weighted energy spaces. Moreover, we prove that the obtained self-similar solutions are the longtime limits of the solutions of the initial value problem with zero initial data and a time-independent boundary source.	gradient;nonlinear system;self-similarity	Peter V.

Faver averaged flow field of the jet flame. The reference values used here are: velocity ur = 103.5 m/s; density r = 0.856 kg/m These figures show the simulation results of hydrogen jet flame in a vitiated coflow, which were realized by 2D DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) method with 9 species and 16 steps chemical kinetic mechanism. The diameter of the jet is d = 4.57 mm. The jet fuel is a mixture of 25 % H2 and N2 as dilution, by volume. The velocity of the jet is U1 = 107 m/s at 305 K. The coflow consisted of products from a lean premixed H2/air flame with a velocity of U2 = 3.5 m/s at 1045K. The composition is 15 % O2, 9.9 % H2O and 75 % N2, by volume. Based on the velocity of U1 -U2, jet diameter d and inlet fuel jet properties, the Reynold's number of the jet flame is 23000, Pr = 0.71. The autoignition phenomenon can be well captured and visualized. Figure 1 shows the transient mass fraction profiles of H2O and OH in the flow field, which were considered as the indicator of reaction as well as the heat release rate. The combustion mainly appears at the edge of the large scale vortex structures. At the end of the noncontinuous flame sheet or the positions with large curve rate, the combustion are always enhanced, as shown in Fig. 1(b). By accumulation of this kind of flame points, the fuel jet will be ignited automatically. Figure 2 shows the Faver-average results of velocity u, v, temperature and density in the flow field.	direct numerical simulation;flame (malware);hydrogen;numerical method;tree accumulation;velocity (software development);vortex	Zhihua Wang;Junhu Zhou;Kefa Cen	2007	J.

211dcfcae8baa6d2337ed4be96f860271ea7b22d	hierarchy of full band structure models for monte carlo simulation	band structure;monte carlo simulation	This paper discusses the various hierarchy levels that are possible when the full band structure is considered. At the highest level, the scatterings are treated using complete k-k’ transition rates, which entail extremely memory intensive computational applications. At the lowest level, the scattering anisotropy is neglected and the scattering rate is considered to be a constant average value on energy isosurfaces of the bandstructure. This model is more practical for device simulation. In between the two extremes, it is possible to design intermediate models which preserve some essential features of both. At all levels of the band structure hierarchy of models, there are similar issues of numerical noise, related to the sampling of real and momentum space that the Monte Carlo method necessarily performs with a relatively small number of particles. We discuss here computationally efficient approaches based on the assignment of variable weights to the simulated particles, in conjunction with careful gatherscatter procedures to split particles of large weight and combine particles of small weight.	electronic band structure;monte carlo method;simulation	Umberto Ravaioli;A.

A theory is developed based on a bundlet model for clusters, which enables describing the distribution function of clusters by size. Comparison of the calculated values of solubility with experiments would permit obtaining energetic parameters characterizing the interaction of an SWNT with its surrounding, in a solid or solution. Fullerenes and SWNTs are unique objects, whose behaviour in many physical situations is characterized by remarkable peculiarities. Peculiarities in solutions show up first in that fullerenes and SWNTs represent the only soluble forms of carbon, what is related to the originality in the molecular structure of fullerenes and SWNTs. The fullerene molecule is a virtually uniform closed spherical or spheroidal surface, and an SWNT is a smooth cylindrical unit. Both structures give rise to the relatively weak interaction between the neighbouring molecules in a crystal and promote interaction of the molecules with those of a solvent. Another peculiarity in solutions is related to their trend to form clusters, consisting of a number of fullerene molecules or SWNTs. The energy of interaction of a fullerene molecule or SWNT with solvent molecules is proportional to the surface of the former molecule and roughly independent of the orientation of solvent molecules. All these phenomena have a unified explanation in the framework of the bundlet model of a cluster, in accordance with which the free energy of an SWNT involved in a cluster is combined from two components, viz. a volume one proportional to the number of molecules n in a cluster, and a surface one proportional to n^1^/^2. Algorithms for classification are proposed based on the criteria information entropy and its production. Many classification algorithms are based on information entropy. When applying these procedures to sets of moderate size, an excessive number of results appear compatible with data, and this number suffers a combinatorial explosion. However, after the equipartition conjecture, one has a selection criterion between different variants resulting from classification between hierarchical trees. According to this conjecture, for a given charge or duty, the best configuration of a flowsheet is the one in which the entropy production is most uniformly distributed. Information entropy, cluster and principal component analyses agree.	entropy (information theory);set packing	Francisco Torrens;Gloria Castellano	2007	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2006.04.004	carbon nanotube;fullerene;nanotechnology;physics	Theory	95.80831444396446	-6.784690678674674	112148
829b127101822a34000808ffe4dc84a88953cb72	coordination number of zinc ions in the phosphotriesterase active site by molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics	coordination number;molecular dynamics;quantum mechanics;coordination number of zinc ion;phosphotriesterase;molecular dynamic;zinc;zinc containing enzyme;active site	We have run several molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on zinc-containing phosphotriesterase (PTE) with two bound substrates, sarin and paraoxon, and with the substrate analog diethyl 4-methylbenzylphosphonate. A standard nonbonded model was employed to treat the zinc ions with the commonly used charge of +2. In all the trajectories, we observed a tightly bound water (TBW) molecule in the active site that was coordinated to the less buried zinc ion. The phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate/inhibitor was found to be coordinated to the same zinc ion so that, considering all ligands, the less buried zinc was hexa-coordinated. The hexa-coordination of this zinc ion was not seen in the deposited X-ray pdb files for PTE. Several additional MD simulations were then performed using different charges (+1, +1.5) on the zinc ions, along with ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to evaluate the following possibilities: the crystal diffraction data were not correctly interpreted; the hexa-coordinated zinc ion in PTE is only present in solution and not in the crystal; and the hexa-coordinated zinc ion in PTE is an artifact of the force field used. A charge of +1.5 leads to a coordination number (CN) of 5 on both zinc ions, which is consistent with the results from ab initio and DFT calculations and with the latest high resolution X-ray crystal structure. The commonly used charge of +2 produces a CN of 6 on the less buried zinc. The CN on the more buried zinc ion is 5 when the substrate/inhibitor is present in the simulation, and increases to 6 when the substrate/inhibitor is removed prior to the simulation. The results of both of the MD and quantum mechanical calculations lead to the conclusion that the zinc ions in the PTE active site are both penta-coordinated, and that the MD simulations performed with the charge of +2 overestimate the CN of the zinc ions in the PTE active site. The overall protein structures in the simulations remain unaffected by the change in zinc charge from +2 to +1.5. The results also suggest that the charge +1.5 is the most appropriate for the molecular dynamics simulations on zinc-containing PTE when a nonbonded model is used and no global thermodynamic conclusion is sought. We also show that the standard nonbonded model is not able to properly treat the CN and energy at the same time. A preliminary, promising charge-transfer model is discussed with the use of the zinc charge of +1.5.		Jaroslav Koča;Chang-Guo Zhan;Robert C. Rittenhouse;Rick L.

This study has developed a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the cooling effect of large blood vessels during hyperthermia. Similar to previous formulations, heat transfer coefficients are used to calculate heat transfer of large blood vessels, and several typical vascular geometries are applied. The corresponding thermal model combines the Pennes bioheat transfer equation for perfused tissues and the energy equation for blood vessels with a constant Nusselt number. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, numerical analyses are performed to test the influences of large blood vessels to the temperature distributions of tissues. The results indicate that during hyperthermia the presence of large vessels can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible under-dosage. Reduction of blood flow through the large vessels is found to be an effective approach of reducing the localized cooling.	monte carlo method;simulation	Zhong-Shan Deng;Jing Liu	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30497-5_68	calculus;monte carlo method	EDA	92.11028069318485	3.109058589968899	112692

A theoretical mathematical model with nonlinear coupling for shock absorber is induced based on relative literature. The model considers the coupling of quadratic damping, viscosity damping, coulomb damping and nonlinear spring. Approximate computational solution is deduced by introducing harmonic balance method and Fourier transform method. These approximate theoretical solutions include output response of the system, absolute acceleration transmissibility in vibration or impact, and the maximum relative displacement in impact process, etc. The approximate computational results are compared with those obtained by numerical integration to confirm the validity of the mathematical model. In the meantime, an optimization design model for parameters is built. The design example is illustrated to confirm the validity of the modeling method and the theoretical solution.	approximation algorithm;computation;displacement mapping;harmonic balance;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;simulation;transmissibility (structural dynamics)	Ping Yang	2007	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-007-0074-x	harmonic balance;computer simulation;control engineering;fourier transform;mathematical optimization;numerical integration;engineering;optimal design;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;computational model;statistics	EDA	83.80263134591975	-3.000544750680971	112695

For five of the six descriptors, one set of 81 atom and functional group fragments is capable of reproducing experimentally derived results with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.95 to 0.99. However, one descriptor, Σα2H, required an entirely separate set of 51 fragments to be developed, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.97. Of particular importance is the speed of calculation (approximately 700 molecules/min), allowing so-called “high-throughput screening”. Several applications of this model for molecules containing intramolecular interactions are discussed.		James A. Platts;Darko Butina;Michael H.

The more expensive and more accurate microscopic model is used only for those species and in those regions in space where there is reason to believe that a microscopic model is needed to capture the dynamics correctly. The microscopic algorithm is extended to simulation on curved surfaces in order to model reaction and diffusion on membranes. The accuracy of the method on and near a spherical membrane is analyzed and evaluated in a numerical experiment. Two biologically motivated examples are simulated in which the need for microscopic simulation of parts of the system arises for different reasons. First, we apply the method to a model of the phosphorylation reactions in a MAPK signaling cascade where microscale methods are necessary to resolve fast rebinding events. Then a model is considered for transport of a species over a membrane coupled to reactions in the bulk. The new algorithm attains an accuracy similar to a full microscopic simulation by handling critical interactions on the microscale, but at a significantly reduced cost by using the mesoscale framework for most parts of the biological model.	algorithm;cell signaling;interaction;kinetics internet protocol;mesoscopic physics;numerical analysis;reduced cost;simulation	Andreas Hellander;Stefan Hellander;Per Lötstedt	2012	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/110832148	statistical physics;biophysics;chemical reaction;mesoscale meteorology;numerical analysis;stochastic simulation;mathematics;diffusion;computational physics;thermodynamics;physics	Comp.	92.3133327798796	0.7610106284225122	113067

The dynamic orbits of the system are observed using bifurcation diagrams plotted using the dimensionless rotational speed ratio as a control parameter. The onset of chaotic motion is identified from the phase diagrams, power spectra, Poincaré maps, Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension of the gear-bearing system. The numerical results reveal that the system exhibits a diverse range of periodic, subharmonic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic behaviors. The couple-stress fluid would be a useful lubricating fluid to suppress nonlinear dynamic responses and improve the steady of the systems. The results presented in this study provide some useful insights into the design and development of a gear-bearing system for rotating machinery that operates in highly rotational speed and highly nonlinear regimes.

The MEP of these molecules was calculated by ab initio methods. Mulliken atomic charges were erratic and gave root mean square (rms) relative errors of fit to the MEP ranging from 152 to 607% with the 6-31 + + g** basis set. Fitting the MEP with potential-derived net atomic charges (PD charges) gave errors ranging from 51 to 62% with the same basis set. The use of larger basis sets, inclusion of electron correlation, use of more MEP data points, or relaxation to optimal structural geometry did not improve significantly the representation of the MEP by net atomic charges. In many cases PD charges of hydrogen atoms were negative, and carbon atoms were positive. To improve the representation of the MEP of n-alkanes, augmentation of the model with nonatomic sites was investigated with the program PDM93. Models with additional charge sites located between hydrogens, on a line bisecting the CH2 group, achieved fits to the MEP with errors reduced to 8% or less, except for n-butane, where the fitting error was 16%. The PD models augmented with methylene bisector sites generally show positive hydrogen charges. They also show CH2 group charge alternation along the n-alkane chains. The augmented charge models were consistent with the observed quadrupole moment of ethane and gave satisfactory predictions for the crystal structures of pentane and octane. © 1994 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	partial charge	Donald E.

The results of the simulation experiment on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process demonstrated that without considering the exact compounds, DFKM can depict the reaction processes not only of the whole petroleum fraction but of any narrow cut we are interested in. Apparently, this kind of ability, which can be considered as the 'zoom in/out' function, is very useful for the further study on the processing techniques of the petroleum fraction.

In Part I, several tools for the theoretical prediction of the main features of the pseudoelastic loops of Shape Memory Devices (SMDs) have been proposed. In this Part II, the Method of Wandering Trajectories (MWT), that has already been validated as a systematic, yet affordable, numerical tool for the evaluation of the chaotic response of SMOs, is enhanced by complementing it with a quantitative indicator of chaoticity: the maximum value of the displacement normalized separation over a fixed time interval. The method is used to compute numerical 3D behavior charts for several model parameters sets, properly selected in order to highlight the influence of various model parameters on the nonlinear dynamical response of SMOs. From the numerical analyses it turns out that two main aspects of the SMD behavior do influence the robustness and strength of chaos, namely the hardening of the pseudoelastic plateaus and the area of the hysteresis loop, both of them being meaningfully affected by the model mechanical and thermal parameters. The numerical results are also interpreted by means of the theoretical indicators discussed in Part I, which provide a reliable framework for the prediction of the main features of dynamic response before actual computation of the trajectories.	anisotropic filtering;chaos theory;chart;coefficient;computation;computer simulation;discrepancy function;displacement mapping;helicon focus;hysteresis;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;phase-locked loop;relevance;sequential minimal optimization;service mapping description;synthetic intelligence	Davide Bernardini;Giuseppe Rega	2011	I.

The theory is validated by comparing hydrodynamic calculations with Monte Carlo simulations performed for bulk and submicron Si structures at 300 K. In the general framework of the moment theory a systematic study of small-signal response functions is provided.	principle of maximum entropy;semiconductor device	M.

A variational formulation is applied to derive the corresponding stability criteria. The maximal stability region and the stability region are represented in the favorable and canonical phase diagrams, providing a complete description of catenoid equilibrium and stability. All catenoids are stable with respect to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. For a fixed contact angle, there exists a critical volume below which catenoids are unstable to axisymmetric perturbations. Equilibrium solution multiplicity is discussed in detail, and we elucidate how geometrical symmetry is reflected in the maximal stability and stability regions.		Amir Akbari;Reghan J. Hill;Theo G.

Here we show that Holographic Dark Information Energy (HDIE), a dynamic dark energy model, achieves an optimal fit to the published datasets where Planck data is combined with other astrophysical measurements. HDIE uses Landauer’s principle to account for dark energy by the energy equivalent of information, or entropy, of stellar heated gas and dust. Combining Landauer’s principle with the Holographic principle yields an equation of state parameter determined solely by star formation history, effectively solving the “cosmic coincidence problem”. While HDIE mimics a cosmological constant at low red-shifts, z < 1, the small difference from a cosmological constant expected at higher red-shifts will only be resolved by the next generation of dark energy instrumentation. The HDIE model is shown to provide a viable alternative to the main cosmological constant/vacuum energy and scalar field/ quintessence explanations.	cosmic;data point;holographic principle;holography;landauer's principle;next-generation network;requirement;stellar (payment network)	Michael Paul Gough	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16041902	dark energy;classical mechanics;lambda-cdm model;physical cosmology;quintessence;planck energy;astrophysics;cosmological constant;dark fluid;equation of state;landauer's principle;scalar field dark matter;thermodynamics of the universe;physics;quantum mechanics;holographic principle	Metrics	93.86916879925323	-2.0603895212004746	115550

Particularly, we have investigated the quantum size, the core’s radius and the shell’s thickness, dependent optical nutation. It is shown from calculation results that the optical nutation signal is sensitive to the size and structure change.

To this end, we have performed initially blind free energy calculations to determine the free energies of binding for ligands of both the CB7 and OA hosts. A subset of the selected guest molecules were those included in the SAMPL4 prediction challenge. Using expanded ensemble simulations in the dimension of coupling host-guest intermolecular interactions, we are able to show that our estimates in most cases can be demonstrated to fully converge and that the errors in our estimates are due almost entirely to the assigned force field parameters and the choice of environmental conditions used to model experiment. We confirm the convergence through the use of alternative simulation methodologies and thermodynamic pathways, analyzing sampled conformations, and directly observing changes of the free energy with respect to simulation time. Our results demonstrate the benefits of enhanced sampling of multiple local free energy minima made possible by the use of expanded ensemble molecular dynamics and may indicate the presence of significant problems with current transferable force fields for organic molecules when used for calculating binding affinities, especially in non-protein chemistries.	aspartate transaminase;cations;checking (action);cluster analysis;computation (action);containers;converge;coupling (computer programming);duoxa1 gene;energy, physics;estimated;evaluation procedure;experiment;force field (chemistry);gene regulatory network;interaction;kinetics;ligands;maxima and minima;mole, unit of measurement;molecular dynamics;oxygen;personnameuse - assigned;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;subgroup;test set;thermodynamics;thioctic acid;turbulence kinetic energy;wang and landau algorithm;weight;benefit;cucurbit(7)uril;free energy;kilocalorie;statistical cluster	Jacob I.

978d4f37d5a238b80f1eee270e1e766cc6f0539e	phase transitions in the condition number distribution of gaussian random matrices		We study the statistics of the condition number κ=λ_{max}/λ_{min} (the ratio between largest and smallest squared singular values) of N×M Gaussian random matrices. Using a Coulomb fluid technique, we derive analytically and for large N the cumulative P(κx) distributions of κ. We find that these distributions decay as P(κx)≈exp[-βNΦ_{+}(x)], where β is the Dyson index of the ensemble. The left and right rate functions Φ_{±}(x) are independent of β and calculated exactly for any choice of the rectangularity parameter α=M/N-1>0. Interestingly, they show a weak nonanalytic behavior at their minimum 〈κ〉 (corresponding to the average condition number), a direct consequence of a phase transition in the associated Coulomb fluid problem. Matching the behavior of the rate functions around 〈κ〉, we determine exactly the scale of typical fluctuations ∼O(N^{-2/3}) and the tails of the limiting distribution of κ. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.	computer simulation;condition number;dyson (operating system);largest;normal statistical distribution;numerical analysis;phase transition;population parameter;rem sleep behavior disorder;singular;smallest;tail;tails	Isaac Pérez Castillo;Eytan Katzav;Pierpaolo Vivo	2014	Physical review.

This work presents a computational framework for investigating the influences of the wind flow over such sites. The wind flow is considered to be fully turbulent, isothermal and incompressible. The present framework employs three-dimensional Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations along with multi-block approach and non-conformal meshes to perform wind flow simulations over such sites with complex geometry. As a case study, the influences of wind flow over the ''Giza Plateau'', one of the most important Egyptian historical heritage sites, were studied for the Northwest wind (at average wind speed over the year) and the Southwest windstorms. The study addresses the less understood, yet important, influences of the wind flow structure on the site and its famous monuments: the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx. Qualitative and quantitative treatments of the results are carried out for estimating the wind loading on the different monuments within the plateau. Particular attention was paid to the Great Sphinx to investigate its most vulnerable parts to the wind, as one of the critical environmental factors that cause erosion of this colossal statue.

In most of those models an emphasis is placed on the effect of Bernoulli’s air underpressure during the air passage through the glottis. The author defines a principle of the vocal folds function with a working version name „principle of the compressed air bubble“. The paper deals with the experimental analysis of these artificial vocal folds and, first of all, with the properties and characteristics of the source voices generated by them. The main forces acting on the vocal folds during phonation are as follows : subglottal air pressure, elastic and inertia forces of the vocal folds structure.	bernoulli polynomials	Vojtech Misun	2005			human voice	Web+IR	83.32150604448735	-1.2064032950515882	116208
0dad59e31bdd2c44232b219603a21068623bee67	the physical interpretation of mean free path and the integral method	mean free path	In previous papers, general expressions for the linear electronic transport constants of solids were obtained in terms of a conjugate function ψ† related, by a linear inhomogeneous integral equation, to the function (of electron state) ψ measured by the “flux.” It is now shown that τψ†=∫0∞ψ|t) dt, where the integrand is the expectation of ψ for an electron which at time t earlier was in the specified state (of which ψ† is a function) and 1/τ is the collision frequency. In particular, the vector mean free path τv† is: “the limit, after a virtually infinite time, of the mean displacement, in Brownian motion, of the position of an electron initially in the specified state.” If there is a force (e.g. that due to a magnetic field) accelerating the electrons between collisions, then a linear transport constant is the same functional of an “extended conjugate” ψ† as it is of ψ† in the absence of the force. It is shown that τψ†e is obtained (instead of τψ† ) when the integrand in the integral above is replaced by the “expectation after time t ” as modified by the accelerations between collisions. The relation of the present formalism to the Shockley-Chambers theory is discussed.		Peter J.

The motion of a projectile is treated classically by integrating the relativistic equations of motion with account for the interaction between the projectile and crystal atoms. The probabilistic element is introduced by a random choice of transverse coordinates and velocities of the projectile at the crystal entrance as well as by accounting for the random positions of the atoms due to thermal vibrations. The simulated trajectories are used for numerical analysis of the emitted radiation. Initial approbation and verification of the code have been carried out by simulating the trajectories and calculating the radiation emitted by @e=6.7 GeV and @e=855 MeV electrons and positrons in oriented Si(110) crystal and in amorphous silicon. The calculated spectra are compared with the experimental data and with predictions of the Bethe-Heitler theory for the amorphous environment.	simulation	Gennady B. Sushko;Victor G.

The dispersion characteristics depend on the permittivity and thickness of the effective surface waveguide and the permittivity of the material below it. As for the analogous seismic case, the values of these parameters can be estimated by applying a scheme that includes calculating the phase-velocity spectra, picking dispersion curves from the spectra, and inverting the dispersion curves using a combined local and global minimization procedure. Here, this scheme is extended by incorporating higher order modes. Explicit expressions for the cutoff frequencies of the fundamental and higher order transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes are derived. These expressions demonstrate that the cutoff frequency decreases as the thickness and/or permittivity of the waveguide increase and/or the permittivity of the lower half-space decreases. In addition, the TE cutoff frequencies are shown to be generally lower than the TM cutoff frequencies. Numerical modeling of realistic models demonstrates the presence of the higher order modes with the correct cutoff frequencies. Application of the modified inversion scheme to synthetic and field data demonstrates its efficacy in providing the required physical property information. In particular, better-constrained models are obtained by including higher order modes in the inversion	dispersive partial differential equation;global optimization;higher-order function;kriging;synthetic intelligence;test engineer;thickness (graph theory);transcranial magnetic stimulation;transverse wave;velocity (software development)	Jan Van der Kruk	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2006.877286	waveguide;inverse problem;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics	Visualization	94.42003735043944	-7.417516404281869	117765

This program provides linear response coefficients: electrical and electronic thermal conductances, as well as the thermopower of molecular junctions in which electrons interact with the surrounding thermal environment. Calculations are performed based on the Buttiker probe method, which introduces decoherence, energy exchange and dissipation effects phenomenologically using virtual electrode terminals called probes. The program can realize different types of probes, each introducing various environmental effects, including elastic and inelastic scattering of electrons. The molecular system is described by an arbitrary tight-binding Hamiltonian, allowing the study of different geometries beyond simple one-dimensional wires. Applications of the program to study the thermoelectric performance of molecular junctions are illustrated. The program also has a built-in functionality to simulate electron transport in double-stranded DNA molecules based on a tight-binding (ladder) description of the junction.

[J. Comput. Phys. 198 (2004) 628–644] is applied to the problem of liquid-gas flows through solid bodies in a square duct. A wetting boundary condition is introduced so that partial wetting on solid surfaces is realized to agree with Cahn theory. Using this method, we investigate the characteristics of wettability in terms of dynamic contact angles between two fluids and a solid wall.

Direct combinatorial methods are applied and based on the ring-edge sum ( Σq ), viz. the sum of all edges in the  q -membered rings taken individually. Explicit expressions of  # I  are reported for two rings ( r  = 2) and three rings ( r  = 3). The latter case ( r  = 3) splits into structures without any internal carbon ( n i   = 0) and those with one internal carbon ( n i   = 1). Finally, the corresponding problem for  r  = 4,  n i   = 1 is solved by means of computer programming.		Jon Brunvoll;Bjørg N. Cyvin;Sven J.

631c234126e1ade6925dd451c0876ad59abddeed	solutions of a two-particle interacting quantum walk		We study the solutions of the interacting Fermionic cellular automaton introduced in Ref. [1]. The automaton is the analogue of the Thirring model with both space and time discrete. We present a derivation of the two-particles solutions of the automaton, which exploits the symmetries of the evolution operator. In the two-particles sector, the evolution operator is given by the sequence of two steps, the first one corresponding to a unitary interaction activated by two-particle excitation at the same site, and the second one to two independent one-dimensional Dirac quantum walks. The interaction step can be regarded as the discrete-time version of the interacting term of some Hamiltonian integrable system, such as the Hubbard or the Thirring model. The present automaton exhibits scattering solutions with nontrivial momentum transfer, jumping between different regions of the Brillouin zone that can be interpreted as Fermion-doubled particles, in stark contrast with the customary momentum-exchange of the one dimensional Hamiltonian systems. A further difference compared to the Hamiltonian model is that there exist bound states for every value of the total momentum, and even for vanishing coupling constant. As a complement to the analytical derivations we show numerical simulations of the interacting evolution.	bound state;brillouin scattering;cellular automaton;coupling constant;existential quantification;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hubbard model;interaction;numerical analysis;quantum walk;simulation	Alessandro Bisio;Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano;Nicola Mosco;Paolo Perinotti;Alessandro Tosini	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20060435	mathematical optimization;unitarity;hubbard model;thirring model;quantum walk;hamiltonian system;special case;mathematics;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);quantum mechanics;coupling constant	Theory	84.94993717460083	3.653806925136718	119305

The tricky pressure dependent visco-plastic behaviour within an incompressible flow solver has been overcome using a regularisation technique along with a complete derivation of the incremental formulation associated with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The computational accuracy and efficiency of the proposed numerical model have been assessed on two representative problems that have an analytical solution. Then, two application examples dealing with actual lab experiments have also been considered: the first one concerns a granular flow on a heap and the second one deals with the granular flow around a cylinder. In both configurations the obtained computational results are in good agreement with available experimental data.	computer simulation;mathematical model	Julien Chauchat;Marc Medale	2014	J. Comput.

Their ability to provide very efficient mixing performances is of paramount importance in the production of very fine particles. In fact, in many particle precipitation processes mixing plays a crucial role in determining the final particle size distribution and therefore the final product quality. Relevant examples are the production of polymeric nano-particles for pharmaceutical applications through solvent displacement, the production of many oxides through sol–gel processes, as well as standard reactive crystallization proonfined Impinging Jets Reactor arge Eddy Simulation robability Density Function, DQMOM-IEM arallel competitive reactions cesses. In order to develop reliable design and scale up rules and in order to understand and master the interaction between mixing and particle formation, it is of crucial importance to resort to modeling and simulation tools. In this work mixing and reaction in these devices is studied with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) by using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach coupled with a subgrid-scale mixing model, to take into account the effect of molecular mixing. The performance of the model is investigated through a sensitivity analysis and eventually predictions are compared with experimental data and with simulations obtained by using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) approach.	computation;computational fluid dynamics;displacement mapping;gnu nano;integrated enterprise modeling;large eddy simulation;n-jet;particle swarm optimization;performance;reactor (software);reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;sol-gel	Daniele L.

Regions where the electric current exceeds a critical threshold are declared to be ‘dissipative’ and endowed with super-Dreicer electric field EΩ = ηj. In this environment, test particles (electrons) are traced and their acceleration to relativistic energies is studied. As a main result we find that acceleration mostly takes place within the dissipation regions, and that the momentum increments have heavy (non-Gaussian) tails, while the waiting times between the dissipation regions are approximately exponentially distributed with intensity proportional to the particle velocity. No correlation between the momentum increment and the momentum itself is found.

In particular, one has to deal with linear, homogeneous integral equations which, in sophisticated model setups, use numerical representations of the solutions of other integral equations as part of their input. Analogously, inhomogeneous equations can be constructed to obtain off-shell information in addition to bound-state masses and other properties obtained from the covariant analogue to a wave function of the bound state. These can be solved very efficiently using well-known matrix algorithms for eigenvalues (in the homogeneous case) and the solution of linear systems (in the inhomogeneous case). We demonstrate this by solving the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equations and find, e.g. that for the calculation of the mass spectrum it is as efficient or even advantageous to use the inhomogeneous equation as compared to the homogeneous. This is valuable insight, in particular for the study of baryons in a three-quark setup and more involved systems.		M. Blank;A.

A dispersion relation has been developed by employing the finite difference (FD) method, which has been used to discuss the stability criteria and also for obtaining the relation for phase and group velocities in viscoelastic media. Furthermore, the effect of variation of stability parameter on phase and group velocities; effect on the wave propagation with increase in dispersion parameter; and change in the wave propagation at different locations from the source have also been studied. The SH waves are found to be dispersive in viscoelastic media. The phase velocity increases with decrease in stability parameter. Furthermore, the location of the source has an important effect on the strength of the wave propagation in that the intensity of wave and therefore its longevity is inversely proportional to the distance from the source, implying that the wave will progressively die out exponentially.	finite-difference time-domain method;software propagation	V.

Analytical representations of these PESs were obtained using a Legendre polynomial interpolation. In the ground state, the surfaces A′ and A″ show two linear wells at short distances (4.0–4.5 A) with energies between –67 and –135 cm–1. The surface A′, unlike that of A″, presents a T-shape well at –85 cm–1. To evaluate the influence of corrections for quadruple excitations on the topology of the Xe–NO(A 2 Σ + ) PES, calculations were performed with and without considering corrections for quadruple excitations. Both surfaces present two linear wells between 4.9 and 6.8 A but when considering corrections for quadruple excitations the wells are more than twice as deep (–64 and –40 cm–1) as when not considering these corrections (–25 and –20 cm–1).	potential energy surface	Juan Carlos Castro-Palacio;Keisaku Ishii;Jesús Rubayo-Soneira;Koichi Yamashita	2011		10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.121	quantum mechanics	HCI	97.0783022923802	-3.926901506064333	121624

badec202de17bc6d19624d704253df9c00ddf279	exergy dynamics of systems in thermal or concentration non-equilibrium		The paper addresses the problem of the existence and quantification of the exergy of non-equilibrium systems. Assuming that both energy and exergy are a priori concepts, the Gibbs “available energy” A is calculated for arbitrary temperature or concentration distributions across the body, with an accuracy that depends only on the information one has of the initial distribution. It is shown that A exponentially relaxes to its equilibrium value, and it is then demonstrated that its value is different from that of the non-equilibrium exergy, the difference depending on the imposed boundary conditions on the system and thus the two quantities are shown to be incommensurable. It is finally argued that all iso-energetic non-equilibrium states can be ranked in terms of their non-equilibrium exergy content, and that each point of the Gibbs plane corresponds therefore to a set of possible initial distributions, each one with its own exergy-decay history. The non-equilibrium exergy is always larger than its equilibrium counterpart and constitutes the “real” total exergy content of the system, i.e., the real maximum work extractable from the initial system. A systematic application of this paradigm may be beneficial for meaningful future applications in the fields of engineering and natural science.	boundary case;dead state;emoticon;energy level;enrico clementi;programming paradigm;velocity (software development)	Enrico Sciubba;Federico Zullo	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19060263	mathematical optimization;mathematics;boundary value problem;available energy;thermal;non-equilibrium thermodynamics;exponential growth;thermodynamics;exergy;exergy efficiency;ranking	AI	89.25373820632599	1.324787273784512	122276

793cfc0b6348bcd8325b34e75824d41583256075	on the stochastic modelling of surface reactions through reflected chemical langevin equations		Abstract Modelling of small-scale heterogeneous catalytic systems with master equations captures the impact of molecular noise, but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, the chemical Fokker–Planck approximation offers an excellent alternative from an efficiency perspective. The Langevin equation can generate stochastic realisations of the Fokker–Planck equation; yet, these realisations may violate the conditions 0 ≤  θ  ≤ 1 (where θ is surface coverage). In this work, we adopt Skorokhod’s formulations to impose reflective boundaries that remedy this issue. We demonstrate the approach on a simple system involving a single species and describing adsorption, desorption, reaction and diffusion processes on a lattice. We compare different numerical schemes for the solution of the resulting reflected Langevin equation and calculate rates of convergence. Our benchmarks should guide the choice of appropriate numerical methods for the accurate and efficient simulation of chemical systems in the catalysis field.	stochastic modelling (insurance)	Miguel Pineda;Michail Stamatakis	2018	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.05.003	stochastic modelling;fokker–planck equation;mathematical optimization;statistical physics;mathematics;lattice (order);numerical analysis;gillespie algorithm;langevin equation;master equation;convergence (routing)	Web+IR	92.44298575101244	1.969485807553261	123019

The density profile, RDF, FFV and XRD characterization have been calculated to investigate the aforementioned MMMs microstructure and also sorption and diffusion structural dependence of CO2–CH4 and CO2–N2 pairs. Sorption, diffusion, permeability and selectivity of natural gases including CO2, CH4 and N2 by PEBA polymeric membrane filled with nano-zeolite (MFI type) have been examined to study the influence of MFI nanomaterial and nanomaterial loading content on the performance of the MMMs. By increase of MFI loading from 10 to 20 wt.%, permeability for CO2, CH4 and N2 increases from 106.5 to 123.6, 4.75–4.74 and 1.28 to1.31, respectively. Structural analysis shows very good behavior for simulated membranes. Moreover, experiments show that simulation results for XRD and diffusivity are in good agreement with experiment results.	monte carlo method;simulation	Mostafa Dehghani;Morteza Asghari;Amir H.

Magnetically confined DC and microwave discharges have been sustained in a coaxial configuration. For DC discharges, the magnetic field needs to be strong enough to confine secondary electrons emitted from the cathode, i.e. the amplitude of the cycloidal motion described by secondary electrons has to be smaller than the discharge gap. For microwave excited discharges, the power absorption profile depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field. Power absorption beyond the sheath boundary in the plasma bulk and better confinement for magnetic fields below the ECR condition lead to maximum densities at ωc/ωrf ∼ 0.5. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The wavelength of the pulse is long in comparison to a typical layer thickness. The pulse shape changes on a depth scale that is large in comparison to the wavelength. The pulse broadens and attenuates due to multiple scattering by the layered structure. The authors find simple asymptotic formulas for the travel time and the pulse shape that account for fine layering effects. The limiting pulse shape is given by a convolution of the incident pulse shape with a Gaussian whose squared width is deterministic; i.e., it is independent of the particular realization of the random medium, and it depends on the second-order statistics of the random medium only. The new theory consolidates the localization phenomenon for waves with effective medium theory. Wave propagation in layered media is a phenomenon of great interest in seismics, ocean acoustics, electromagnetic remote sensing, borehole acoustics, and so on.	software propagation	Pawel Lewicki;Robert Burridge;Maarten V. de Hoop	1996	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S0036139994273661	attenuation;pulse shaping;plane wave;homogenization;borehole;wave propagation;bandwidth-limited pulse;optics;pulse wave;physics	Theory	87.98927655467351	2.487028871090172	124449

Phase boundaries are tracked by solving the multi-phase level set equations. Diffused interfaces are constructed from these tracked phase boundaries using the level set functions. Based on the assumed diffused interfaces, volume-averaging techniques are applied for energy, species and momentum transport. Microstructure evolution in multi-component alloy systems is predicted using realistic material parameters. The methodology avoids the difficulty of parameter identification needed in other diffused interface models, and allows easy application to various practical alloy systems. Techniques including fast marching, narrow band computing and adaptive meshing are utilized to speed up computations. Several numerical examples are considered to validate the method and examine its potential for modeling solidification of practical alloy systems. These examples include twoand three-dimensional solidification of a binary alloy in an undercooled melt, a study of planar/cellular/dendritic transition in the solidification of a Ni-Cu alloy, and eutectic and peritectic solidification of an Fe-C system. Adaptive mesh refinement in the rapidly varying interface region makes the method practical for coupling the microstructure evolution at the meso-scale with buoyancy driven flow in the macro-scale, which is shown in the solidification of a Ni-Al-Ta ternary alloy.	adaptive mesh refinement;computation;dendritic spine;fast marching method;mesoscopic physics;numerical analysis;refinement (computing);simulation	Lijian Tan;Nicholas Zabaras	2007	J.

The polar components such as asphaltenes in the oil-phase, which have been widely believed to be a major source of oil-wetting characteristics. The effect of light gaseous ends in crude oil on wetting is studied by depleting the pressure at regular intervals. The variation of contact angles observed with the pressure during the pressure depletion clearly showed the influence of light ends on wetting. The water-advancing contact angle of live crude oil gradually increased from 55/spl deg/ at bubble point pressure to 154/spl deg/ at ambient pressure. The de-asphaltened and the deresined crude oils showed strong oil-wet characteristics as stocktank crude oil. The light gaseous ends in oil phase appear to peptize the asphaltene molecules by surrounding them, thereby preventing their agglomeration and migration to the interface. The differences observed in the behavior of dynamic interfacial tensions between live and stocktank crude oils further substantiates the influence of light gaseous ends on the activity of polar components in live oil. The influence of solid surface roughness, mineralogy of rock substrates as well as the brine composition on wetting and contact angles have also been investigated. For highly smooth substrates, carbonate and silica showed relatively similar high water-advancing contact angles, while for rough substrates, the advancing contact angles on silica were much lower compared to the carbonates.	depletion region	Wei Xu;Subhash C.

It contributes to the physical component of our virtual reality-prototyping computer-aided design tool for microelectromechanical systems, with emphasis on fast calculations for virtual reality representations. In our model, the flow is segmented into layers and the pertinent models derived. We have achieved this by solving the Navier–Stokes equation, obtaining an analytical model for the circular and a numerical model for the rectangular channels. The resistances of the layers are obtained from the velocity profile of the flow. The electrical network model is implemented in Matlab Simulink.

The network is generated in response to tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs), which are released from hypoxic cells within a solid tumour. We first describe a refined model for tumour-induced angiogenesis, which aims to describe the capillary growth process at the cellular level by explicitly taking into account the effects of matrix degrading enzymes and the local properties of the host tissue during endothelial cell migration. We then incorporate blood rheological properties into the formulation and investigate the influence of wall shear stress induced by the blood flow during dynamic vascular growth. We then go on to examine a number of feedback mechanisms affecting vascular resistance and network architecture. The mechanisms considered include those proposed by Pries and co-workers [A.R. Pries, T.W. Secomb, P. Gaehtgens, Structural adaptation and stability of microvascular networks: theory and simulation, Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 44 (1998) H349–H360; A.R. Pries, B.

Reglin, T.W. Secomb, Structural adaptation of microvascular networks: roles of the pressure response, Hypertension 38 (2001) 1476–1479] and both haemodynamic (non-linear viscosity) and metabolic constraints are taken into account. Subsequent simulations of chemotherapeutic drug perfusion through the system show that vascular adaptation leads to a significant benefit in treatment delivery to the tumour. The results clearly demonstrate that the combined effects of network architecture and vessel compliance should be included in future models of angiogenesis if therapy protocols and treatment efficacy are to be adequately assessed. c © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Compact models which suggest nanopatterned oxide dots with Gaussian or Lorentzian profiles are implemented in a Monte Carlo simulator in a level set environment. An alternative to compact models is explored with a physics based Monte Carlo model, where the AFM tip is treated as a point charge and the silicon wafer as an infinite conducting plane. The strength of the generated electric field creates oxyions which accelerate towards the silicon surface and cause oxide growth and surface deformations. A physics based model is presented, generating an oxide dot based on the induced surface charge density. Comparisons to empirical models suggest that a Lorentzian profile is better suited to describe surface deformations when compared to the Gaussian profile.	atomic-force microscopy;monte carlo method;rejection sampling;simulation;topography;wafer (electronics)	Lado Filipovic;Siegfried Selberherr	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29843-1_50	materials science;computational chemistry;nanotechnology;optics	ML	89.57205494400417	-9.13776421684508	125601

b0d703c824d0be8ef970da87c4739bd93bfd306b	generation of opls-like charges from molecular electrostatic potential using restraints	opls;electrostatic potential;parameters	A new method for generating atom-centered charges for use in condensed phase computer simulations is presented, which is based on a Ž . restrained electrostatic potential RESP procedure. Charges are calculated from a least-squares fit to the quantum mechanical electrostatic potential with a restraint applied to reduce their magnitude. The restraint developed here offers advantages over that used in RESP. The magnitude of the restraint is optimized to yield charges as close to the equivalent OPLS values as possible while still reproducing the molecule’s electrostatic potential. A cross-validation analysis is used to show that the restraint is insensitive to the selection of OPLS molecules from which it is derived. Thus, with this method, OPLS-like charges may be produced from the electrostatic potential for atom types not in the OPLS force field.

At a microscopic level we propose a model coupling the Boltzmann equation in the gas phase, the heat equation on the solid phase, and appropriate interface conditions, including adsorption-desorption reactions. Several scalings are proposed, each one corresponding to a particular regime. Then an asymptotic expansion mixing homogenization and fluid limit leads to a system of coupled diffusion equations where the effective diffusion tensors are defined from the microscopic geometry of the material through auxiliary problems. Finally, we prove that the diffusion operator is elliptic, and we give algebraic and geometric conditions of degeneracy.

d3528d7eb5e8bcc0c293bedf3114d133777652a7	an efficient two-step monte carlo method for heat conduction in nanostructures	heat conduction;phonon monte carlo;nanostructure;effective thermal conductivity	Research on the heat conduction in nanostructures has drawn much attention due to their potential applications in thermoelectric devices. Although the phonon tracing Monte Carlo (MC) technique, where the trajectories of individual phonons are simulated independently, has been extensively used for simulating the heat conduction in nanomaterials, it cannot efficiently simulate the phonon transport in the large area periodic nanostructures yet, due to the demand of absorbing boundaries. In the present work, we develop a two-step phonon tracing MC method to solve this problem. At the first step, the initial phonon transmittance and the phonon emission distributions at the internal virtual boundary are obtained by simulating phonon transport in the initial simulation unit that is directly in contact with the phonon bath. At the second step, the internal phonon transmittance is calculated for the internal simulation units according to the internal boundary phonon emission distributions. Since the whole structure can be simplified as a one-dimensional phonon transport system, the total phonon transmittance can be readily calculated via the combination of initial and internal phonon transmittances, and the effective thermal conductivity is then derived. Furthermore, for verification, we calculate the effective thermal conductivities of three typical nanostructures, that is, the cross-plane and in-plane nanofilms and the periodic nanoporous structures, by using the theoretical models, the standard and the two-step MC simulations, respectively. The two-step MC method well predicts the results calculated by the standard MC simulations and the theoretical models. More importantly, the computation time of the two-step MC simulation is at least one order of magnitude less than that of the standard MC simulation, while its under-prediction can be less than 10% even 5%.	angular defect;computation;experiment;hidden markov model;information science;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;periodic boundary conditions;phonon;simulation;time complexity	Yu-Chao Hua;Bing-Yang Cao	2017	J.

Such an approach leads to a correction formula to the total energy of a charged periodic system and allows a comparison between the electronic band structure of the ionized defect to its corresponding neutral one. The correction formula can be related to the potential alignment method and Makov–Payne correction widely adopted in charged periodic systems. The new approach suggests both an alternative interpretation and improvements to the popular Makov–Payne and potential alignment scheme. P-doped Si, which has a shallow donor level, and an isolated vacancy in crystalline Si, which has a deep defect level within the Si energy gap, are chosen as prototypical systems to demonstrate our method.

cf44aa576b36facf17325951141a5c1ff7ce8990	a simple and bounded model of population dynamics for mutualistic networks		Dynamic population models are based on the Verhulst’s equation (logisitic equation), where the classic Malthusian growth rate is damped by intraspecific competition terms. Mainstream population models for mutualism are modifications of the logistic equation with additional terms to account for the benefits produced by the interspecies interactions. These models have shortcomings as the population divergence under some conditions (May’s equations) or a mathematical complexity that difficults their analytical treatment (Wright’s type II models). In this work, we introduce a model for the population dynamics in mutualism inspired by the logistic equation but cured of divergences. The model is also mathematically more simple than the type II. We use numerical simulations to study the model stability in more general interaction scenarios. Despite its simplicity, our results suggest that the model dynamics are rich and may be used to gain further insights in the dynamics of mutualistic interactions.	interaction;numerical analysis;population dynamics;simulation	Juan Manuel Pastor;Javier García-Algarra;Javier Galeano;Jose M.

The proposed method, which can be applied to the class of model equations whose  z -transform exists, is based upon a  z -transform inversion formula that has the form of an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform. A computer algorithm that employs the FFT to efficiently obtain numerical results from the derived formulas is summarized and an error analysis is given. An example problem that describes the polycondensation polymerization kinetics of bisphenol-A to polycarbonate is introduced as a realistic application of the proposed method. It is shown that for this example, both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed  z -transform inversion technique are superior to another independent method for obtaining the polymer chain length distribution that is based upon direct numerical integration. A methodology for identification of polymerization kinetic rate parameters from experimental polymer molecular weight distributions is also suggested.	kinetics internet protocol	Patrick L.

Here, by combining the method of characteristics with the standard grid discretization technique, a novel algorithm is introduced for solving a general blood-tissue transport and metabolism model governed by a large system of one-dimensional semilinear first order partial differential equations. The key part of the algorithm is to approximate the model as a group of independent ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems such that each ODE system has the same size as the model and can be integrated independently. Thus the method can be easily implemented in parallel on a large scale multiprocessor computer. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated for solving a simple blood-tissue exchange model introduced by Sangren and Sheppard (Bull. Math. Biophys. 15:387-394, 1953), which has an analytical solution. Numerical experiments made on a distributed-memory parallel computer (an HP Linux cluster) and a shared-memory parallel computer (a SGI Origin 2000) demonstrate the parallel efficiency of the algorithm.	approximation algorithm;body tissue;commutation theorem;computer cluster;differential diagnosis;discretization;distributed memory;experiment;linux;mathematical model;mathematics;multiprocessing;parallel computing;shared memory;simulation;speedup	Dexuan Xie;Ranjan K.

It is constructed as a weighted difference of two smooth probability densities using the Husimi function and first-order Hermite spectrograms. In contrast to the Wigner function, it is accessible by sampling strategies for positive densities. In the semiclassical regime, the new density allows to approximate expectation values to second order with respect to the high frequency parameter and is thus more accurate than the uncorrected Husimi function. As an application, we combine the new phase space density with Egorov’s theorem for the numerical simulation of time-evolved quantum expectations by an ensemble of classical trajectories.

It can operate in the stochastic regime where each channel is treated as an independent entity or in the deterministic regime where a population of channels is lumped together as a single continuous process. For extended cells, channels are given precise positions on the membrane before any spatial discretization is performed so exactly the same model can be computed at different spatial and temporal resolutions and with the various channel populations computed stochastically or deterministically. This enables a range of questions to be addressed concerning the influence of channel stochasticity and spatial discretization on the behavior of neurons.

Naive implementation will lead to electromagnetic precursor waves that can affect the simulation results. The problem is well-known and is described e.g. in Lemebege and Dawson 1987. Since then few papers have attempted to deal with this problem and no standard solution exists. rnIn this research note we suggest that the ad-hoc pulse shape that was used in the paper by Lemebege and Dawson 1987 can be replaces by a standard digital low pass filter. The cut off frequency of this filter should coincide with the gyro frequency in the magnetized plasma, to make use of (Doppler-broadend) resonant absorption caused by gyrating electrons. We illustrate this idea with a code example and demonstrate the efficency of this method throug sample simulations with our electromagnetic particle-in-cell code.	plasma active	Patrick Kilian;Felix Spanier	2018	J.

We show the photon subtraction may effectively generate non-Gaussian states only in case of small values of the mean values of the position and momentum operators. In particular, the photon-subtracted state can be made arbitrary close to Gaussian state in limiting case of large initial amplitude of displacement. Use of initial displacement in input Gaussian states opens wider prospects to manipulate them. In particular, realization of probabilistic Hadamard gate with input Gaussian states is discussed where photon subtraction is motive force able unevenly to increase measure of non-classicality of the output state. Subtraction of larger number of photons enables to increase fidelity and non-classical measure of the conditional states.	displacement mapping;hadamard transform;quantum gate;wave packet	Sergey A.

957766a5d2600e39298ac5a795a29ad8b4a3836e	a comparison of quantum chemical models for calculating nmr shielding parameters in peptides: mixed basis set and oniom methods combined with a complete basis set extrapolation	peptides;nmr shielding parameters;mixed basis set;complete basis set;oniom methods;quantum chemical models	This article compares several quantum mechanical approaches to the computation of chemical shielding tensors in peptide fragments. First, we describe the effects of basis set quality up to the complete basis set (CBS) limit and level of theory (HF, MP2, and DFT) for four different atoms in trans N-methylacetamide. For both isotropic shielding and shielding anisotropy, the MP2 results in the CBS limit show the best agreement with experiment. The HF values show quite a different tendency to MP2, and even in the CBS limit they are far from experiment for not only the isotropic shielding of carbonyl carbon but also most shielding anisotropies. In most cases, the DFT values differ systematically from MP2, and small basis-set (double- or triple-zeta) results are often fortuitously in better agreement with the experiment than the CBS ones. Second, we compare the mixed basis set and ONIOM methods, combined with CBS extrapolation, for chemical shielding calculations at a DFT level using various model peptides. From the results, it is shown that the mixed basis set method provides better results than ONIOM, compared to CBS calculations using the nonpartitioned full systems. The information studied here will be useful in guiding the selection of proper quantum chemical models, which are in a tradeoff between accuracy and cost, for shielding studies of peptides and proteins.

Ill-conditioning of the over-determined linear system associated with interpolation of synthetic data from [C. Bouchiat, M.D. Wang, J.-F. Allemand, T. Strick, S.M. Block, V. Croquette, Estimating the persistence length of a Worm-Like Chain molecule from force–extension measurements, Biophys. J. 76 (1) (1999) 409–413] is highlighted. Moreover, if the coefficients in the associated polynomial correction are considered as free parameters in the least squares fitting procedure for actual experimental data, then more than one solution with a low residual can be identified. For these reasons we propose modification of the interpolation formula in [C. Bustamante, J.F. Marko, E.D. Siggia, S. Smith, Entropic elasticity of lambda-phage DNA, Science 265 (1994) 1599. Technical comment] so that, for moderate extensions, quadratic contributions are included and no additional parameters are required. We show that relative errors for the fit of synthetically generated data are less than 2% and for actual data they are comparable with and sometimes better than those obtained by using polynomial WLC interpolation formulas. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

16a983a78de996804c4a9a561270e50c34c7ae7c	vector hysteresis model to describe micromagnetic structures	magnetic hysteresis;industries;indexes;decision support systems	We discuss about the possibility of reproducing the behavior of a magnetic material at micromagnetic scale with a phenomenological vector model of hysteresis based on the definition of a vector hysteron. Data computed by means of two different static magnetic models are compared. The former is based on the solution of Brown's equation (micromagnetic scale). The latter is a vector generalization of the Classical Scalar Preisach Model (macromagnetic scale). We show that the magnetization vs. applied field curves computed by both models are in good agreement, and that the macromagnetic-scale model is able to reproduce the physical behavior of the magnetic materials at micromagnetic scale. The vector model can also take into account of multidomains structures because each hysteron is associated to one domain of the nanostructure. The assembly of hysterons reproduces with satisfactory accuracy and extremely reduced computational time the hysteretic behavior of the nanostructure computed by micromagnetic simulations.	hysteresis;ising model;scalar processor;simulation;time complexity	M.

Three-dimensional structures of typical single-mode lasers with the goal of efficient fibre coupling are considered. These devices have buried waveguides with high indices of refraction. The so-called round-trip operator constructed by a beam propagation method is non-linear due to gain saturation and thermal effects. Thus, the problem for numerical modelling of lasing is the eigenvalue problem for the non-linear round-trip operator. Fox-Li iterative procedure is applied for calculation of a lasing mode. A large size 3D numerical mesh is employed to discretize a set of equations describing (a) propagation of two counter-propagating waves using Pade approximation, (b) lateral diffusion of charge carriers within a quantum well, and (c) thermal conductivity. So, many important non-linear effects are properly accounted for: gain saturation, self-focusing, and thermal lens. A serious problem arising for operation far above threshold is the appearance of additional lasing modes that usually cause degradation in optical beam quality. To calculate a critical electric current, at which additional modes appear, the numerical code incorporates a subroutine that calculates a set of competing modes using gain and index variations produced by the oscillating mode. The corresponding linear eigenproblem is solved by the Arnoldi method. The oscillating mode has an eigenvalue equal to 1, while higher-order modes have eigenvalues of amplitude less than 1, which grow with injection current. These eigenvalues are calculated at several values of electric current, and the eigenvalues of the sub-threshold modes are then extrapolated to 1, at which point the device becomes multimode. Results of numerical simulations for typical experimental conditions will be presented.	3d modeling;diode	Nikolay N. Elkin;Anatoly P. Napartovich;Alexander G. Sukharev;Dmitri V.

The rough surface of the nanowire is generated by randomly distributing the atoms at the InAs-Si/Oxide interface according to an Ando-like exponential auto-correlation function. Phonons are atomistically treated by means of the valence-force-field method. A full-band and atomistic quantum transport simulator based on the sp3d5s* tight-binding model and the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism is used to solve the quantum transport problem where the electron-phonon interactions are tackled within the self-consistent Born approximation. Phonon scattering is found to have no major effect on the device ON-state, while in the OFF-state the current is significantly increased. SR scattering has a detrimental impact on the TFET performance with a ON-current reduction by almost two orders of magnitude, but it induces limited variability. A direct comparison of both scattering mechanisms reveals the dominant behavior of SR over phonon scattering.	approximation;autocorrelation;electron;heart rate variability;interaction;molecular dynamics;phonon;randomness;semantics (computer science);simulation;spatial variability;tight binding;time complexity;transistor;transportation theory (mathematics)	Hamilton Carrillo-Nunez;Reto Rhyner;Mathieu Luisier;Andreas Schenk	2016	2016 46th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)	10.1109/ESSDERC.2016.7599618	materials science;ceramic materials;phonon scattering;optics;condensed matter physics	EDA	92.0540201138072	-7.6235933356203995	130892

For all cases, single point energy calculations were performed at the MP2/AUG-cc-pVDZ level of theory using the geometries optimised at the B3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ level. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure genuineness of all the calculated transition states. Effect of aqueous media was investigated by solvating all the species involved in the reactions using the polarizable continuum model. It is found that 2-chloroimidazole (2-ClIm) can be formed following three different reaction schemes while 2-oxoimidazole (2-oxoIm) can be formed following two different reaction schemes. The calculated barrier energies show that formation of 2-oxoIm would be less favored than that of 2-ClIm, which explains the experimental observations on relative yields of 8-chlorodeoxyguanosine and 8-oxodeoxyguanosine.

The plasmodium’s behaviour can be finely tuned in laboratory experiments by using herbal tablets. A single tablet acts as a fixed attractor: plasmodium propagates towards the tablet, envelops the tablet with its body and stays around the tablet for several days. Being presented with several tablets the plasmodium executes limit cycle like motions. The plasmodium performs sophisticated routines of movement around tablets: rotation, splitting, and annihilation. We use the two-variable Oregonator model to simulate the plasmodium behaviour in the presence of the herbal tablets. Numerical experiments confirm that using long-distance attracting and short-distance repelling fields we can organise arbitrary movement of plasmodia.	andrew adamatzky;slime	Andrew Adamatzky	2012	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2011.09.015	mathematical analysis;oregonator;acellular slime mould;mathematics;attractor;physarum polycephalum;pattern formation;physarum;biological system	Vision	84.46543748827249	1.6411156426771476	131314

In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical model for the onset of fish migration in the context of a stochastic optimal stopping theory, which is a new attempt to our knowledge. Finding the criteria of the onset of migration reduces to solving a variational inequality of a degenerate elliptic type. As a first step of the new mathematical modeling, mathematical and numerical analyses with particular emphasis on whether the model is consistent with the past observation results of fish migration are examined, demonstrating reasonable agreement between the theory and observation results. The present mathematical model thus potentially serves as a simple basis for analyzing onset of fish migration.	abnormal degeneration;calculus of variations;clarify;mathematical model;mathematics;numerical analysis;onset (audio);optimal stopping;process migration;social inequality;system migration;variational inequality	Hidekazu Yoshioka;Yuta Yaegashi	2018	Theory in Biosciences	10.1007/s12064-018-0263-8	mathematical optimization;biology;zoology;degenerate energy levels;variational inequality;fish migration;optimal stopping	AI	84.66810538980495	2.556261840315257	131473
1cee7a8921e7c39b77940ee48e72eb7dbcbe9fdf	numerical simulation of adiabatic shear-band formation in composites		The process of plastic flow localization in a composite material consisting of welded steel and copper plates under shear strain is considered. The mathematical model of this physical process is formulated. A new numerical algorithm based on the Courant–Isaacson–Rees scheme is proposed. The algorithm is verified using three test problems. The algorithm efficiency and performance are proved by the test simulations. The proposed algorithm is used for numerical simulation of plastic strain localization on composite materials. The influence of boundary conditions, the initial plastic strain rate, and the width of the materials forming the composite bar on the localization process is studied. It is demonstrated that at the initial stage, the shear velocity for the material layers varies. Theoretical estimates of the oscillation frequency and period are proposed; the calculations using these estimates agree completely with the numerical experiments. It is established that the deformation is localized in the copper part of the composite. One or two localization regions situated at a typical distance from the boundaries are formed, depending on the width of the steel and copper parts, as well as the initial plastic strain rate and the chosen boundary conditions. The dependence of this distance on the initial plastic strain rate is demonstrated and corresponding estimates for boundary conditions of two types are obtained. It is established that in the case of two localization regions, the temperature and deformation in one of them increase much faster than in the other, while at the initial stage these quantities are nearly equal in both regions.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;biological specimen;boundary case;computer simulation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;experiment;gareth rees (software developer);internationalization and localization;mathematical model;numerical analysis;situated;velocity (software development)	Nikolai A.

This article presents an approach for developing the PDF of lift-off speeds on the basis of the conventional experimental measurements of sand-flux and wind profile. After the measurements of sand-flux and wind profile in the saltation layer are conducted in a field wind tunnel, an optimization algorithm based on the experimental data is proposed by means of the multi-objective optimization and the simulation model of the quantities of saltation motion to numerically search for the PDF. Then the obtained numerical results are fitted by means of the least square method, and finally an empirical formula of the PDF is gained for the sample sand in the experiments. rived based on power series expansions of displacement components and the exact dynamic element stiffness matrix is determined using force-deformation relationships. In order to verify the accuracy of this study, the numerical solutions are presented and compared with the analytical solutions and the finite element solutions using the isoparametric beam elements. Particularly the influences of the coupled shear deformation on the vibrational behavior of non-symmetric beam on elastic foundation are investigated.	mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Ning Huang;Xiao Jing Zheng;You-He Zhou	2006	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2005.03.015	structural engineering;probability density function;simulation;data processing;computer science;engineering;wind tunnel;multi-objective optimization;simulation modeling;mathematics;geotechnical engineering;least squares;statistics	ML	92.60410985409078	4.042535445357697	131839
09f89d3794df6bd3bf3526eb55e3b856df6f0409	real-time visual animation of explosions		Realistic explosion effects can enhance the realism and immersion in virtual battlefield. The real-time explosion effects simulation of the explosion products and their interactions, such as explosive fireball, explosive smoke and explosive ash, will be exploded into two phases: explosions and fuel modeling. The explosions modeling describe the formation and spreading of the explosive fireball. The fuel modeling depicts rising of the explosive ash accompanied by the explosive smoke. The paper describes an Eulerian approach for animating explosions in the first phase. The divergence-free velocity field is computed on a grid. In order to ensure the quality of conservation, the velocity divergence in the local is joined to describe smoke diffusion. The particles with the respective attributes are updated in both two phases. Simplified Navier-Stokes (NS) equations modified according to the non-conservation of explosion energy is used to determine the fluid motion in whole simulation process. In order to further improve the fidelity and real-time of the simulation effect, small-scale swirl effect of explosion smoke with vorticity confinement is introduced to compensate for the loss of finite difference methods to solve the NS equations. The whole simulation process of explosion effects are realized on Visual Studio 2010 and OpenGL platform, including multiple explosions, explosions near obstacles. The temperature and velocity in the explosion center, explosive diameter and height, are analyzed to verify the high fidelity of this new simulation method. The high fidelity and computational efficiency of this new modified approach are verified with several experimental simulation results.	computation;finite difference method;immersion (virtual reality);interaction;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;microsoft visual studio;navier–stokes equations;opengl;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;simulation;velocity (software development);vorticity confinement	Wenhui Zhang;Feng Guo;Zhian Lin;Yanhao Zhang;Jiming Lin;Xinxiang Wei	2015	JSW	10.17706/jsw.10.3.331-343	simulation	Graphics	89.35407669412488	-4.66363569538288	132079

The author’s objectives of the book, using his own words, are “to provide a survey of computational chemistry its underpinnings, its jargon, its strengths and weaknesses that will be accessible to both the experimental and theoretical communities”. This design as a general introduction into computational chemistry makes it an alternative to Andrew R. Leach’s well-established “Molecular Modeling” (Prentice Hall) and Frank Jensen’s “Introduction to Computational Chemistry” (Wiley), although the latter focuses on the theory of electronic structure methods. Cramer’s “Essentials” covers force field and molecular orbital theory, Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations, thermodynamic and electronic (spectroscopic) property calculation, condensed phase treatment and a few more topics. Moreover, the book contains thirteen selected case studies sexamples taken from the literature sto illustrate the application of the just presented theoretical and computational models. This especially makes the text book well suited for both classroom discussion and self-study. Each chapter of “Essentials” covers a main topic of computational chemistry and will be briefly described here; all chapters are ended by a bibliography and suggested additional readings as well as the literature references cited in the text. In chapter 1 the author defines basic terms such as “theory”, “model”, and “computation”, introduces the concept of the potential energy surface and provides some general considerations about hardware and software. Interestingly, the first equation occurring in the text is not Schro ̈dinger’s equation, as is the case for most computational chemistry introductions, but the famous Einstein relation. The second chapter deals with molecular mechanics. It explains the different potential energy contributions, introduces the field of structure optimization, and provides an overview of the variety of modern force fields. Chapter 3 covers the simulation of molecular ensembles. It defines phase space and trajectories and shows the formalism of, and problems and difference between, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics. In chapter 4 the author introduces the foundations of molecular orbital theory. Basic concepts such as Hamilton operator, LCAO basis set approach, many-electron wave functions, etc. are explained. To illuminate the LCAO variational process, the Hu ̈ckel theory is presented with an example. Chapter 5 deals with semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theory. Besides the classical approaches (extended Hu ̈ckel, CNDO, INDO, NDDO) and methods (e.g., MNDO, AM1, PM3) and their performance, examples are provided from the ongoing development in that still fascinating area. Ab initio MO theory is presented in chapter 6; the basis set concept is discussed in detail, and, after some considerations from an user’s point of view, the general performance of ab initio methods is explicated. The next chapter covers the problem of electron correlation and gives the most prominent solutions for its treatment: configuration interaction, theory of the multiconfiguration self-consistent field, perturbation, and coupled cluster. Practical issues are also discussed. Chapter 8’s topic is density functional theory (DFT). Its theoretical foundation, methodology, and some functionals as well as its pros and cons compared to MO theory are presented together with a general performance overview. The next two chapters deal with charge distribution, derived and spectroscopic properties (e.g., atomic charges, polarizability, rotational, vibrational, and NMR spectra), and thermodynamic properties (e.g., zero-point vibrational energy, free energy of formation, and reaction). The modeling of condensed phases is addressed in chapters 11 (implicit models) and 12 (explicit models), which closes with a comparison between the two approaches. Chapter 13 familiarizes the reader with hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) models. Polarization as well as the problematic implications of unsaturated QM and MM components are discussed, and empirical valence bond methods are also presented. The treatment of excited states is the topic of chapter 14; besides CI and MCSCF as computational methods, transition probabilities and solvatochromism are discussed. The last chapter deals with reaction dynamics, mostly adiabaticskinetics, rate constants, reaction paths, and transition state theory are section topics here sbut also nonadiabatic, introducing curve crossing and Marcus theory in brief. The appendix is divided into four parts: an acronym glossary (which is very helpful), an overview of symmetry and group theory, an introduction to spin algebra, and finally a section about orbital localization. A rather detailed index ends the book. The “Essentials” writing style fits the fascinating topic: one reads on and on andssurprise! sanother chapter has been absorbed. The text is complemented by a large number of black and white figures and clear tables, mostly self-explanatory with descriptive captions. The use of equations and mathematical formulas in general is well-balanced, and the level of math should be understandable for every natural scientist with some basic knowledge of physics. There are only a few minor shortcomings: for example, a literature reference cited in the text (“Beck et al.”, p 142) is missing in the bibliography; “Kronecker” is mistyped with o ̈; and the author completely forgot to reference Leach’s text book when referring to other computational chemistry introductions. However, the author has established a specific errata web page (http://pollux.chem.umn.edu/ ∼cramer/Errors.html) with all known errors. These will be corrected in the next printing or next revised edition, respectively. With its emphasis, on one hand, on the basic concepts and applications rather than pure theory and mathematics, and on the other hand, coverage of quantum mechanical and classical mechanical models including examples from inorganic, organic, and biological chemistry, “Essentials” is a useful tool not only for teaching and learning but also as a quick reference, and thus will most probably become one of the standard text books for computational chemistry.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;austin model 1;basis set (chemistry);cndo/2;calculus of variations;computation;computational chemistry;computational model;configuration interaction;coupled cluster;density functional theory;electron;electronic structure;excited state;fits;force field (chemistry);functional theories of grammar;glossary;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hartree–fock method;holographic principle;indo;international standard book number;jargon;jensen's inequality;john d. wiley;linear combination of atomic orbitals;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;mndo;markov chain;mathematical optimization;molecular dynamics;molecular mechanics;molecular orbital;monte carlo method;multi-configurational self-consistent field;nddo;pm3 (chemistry);polarizability;potential energy surface;printing;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;semantics (computer science);simulation;web page	Robert E.

The stream function is used to describe the flow field and it is defined in terms of mass flux. The partial differential equations governing system is given by the mass conservation equation of the fluid phase written in terms of the massbased stream function, as well as by the advection–diffusion transport equations of the contaminant concentration and of the heat. The unknown variables are the stream function, the contaminant concentration and the temperature. The governing equations system is solved using a fractional time step procedure, splitting the convective components from the diffusive ones. In the case of existing scalar potential of the flow field, the convective components are solved using a finite volume marching in space and time (MAST) procedure; this solves a sequence of small systems of ordinary differential equations, one for each computational cell, according to the decreasing value of the scalar potential. In the case of variable-density groundwater transport problem, where a scalar potential of the flow field does not exist, a second MAST procedure has to be applied to solve again the ODEs according to the increasing value of a new function, called approximated potential. The diffusive components are solved using a standard Galerkin finite element method. The numerical scheme is validated using literature tests. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The dimension and the order of partial differential equation (PDE) are first used as a substitute of the scale parameter in the DFW transform and series, especially with the space and time-space potential problems. It is noted that the recursive multiple reciprocity formulation is the DFW series. The Green second identity is used to avoid the singularity of the zero-order fundamental solution in creating the DFW series. The fundamental solutions of various composite PDEs are found very flexible and efficient to handle a broad range of problems. We also discuss the underlying connections between the crucial concepts of dimension, scale and the order of PDE through the analysis of dissipative acoustic wave propagation. The shape parameter of the potential problems is also employed as the “scale parameter” to create the non-orthogonal DFW. This paper also briefly discusses and conjectures the DFW correspondences of a variety of coordinate variable transforms and series. Practically important, the anisotropic and inhomogeneous DFW’s are developed by using the geodesic distance variable. The DFW and the related basis functions are also used in making the kernel distance sigmoidal functions, which are potentially useful in the artificial neural network and machine learning. As or even worse than the preceding two reports, this study scarifies mathematical rigor and in turn unfetter imagination. Most results are intuitively obtained without rigorous analysis. Follow-up research is still under way. The paper is intended to inspire more research into this promising area.	acoustic cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;basis function;distance (graph theory);machine learning;recursion;sigmoid function;software propagation;technological singularity;wavelet	Weiteng Chen	2002	CoRR		acoustic wave;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;geodesic;fundamental solution;metric;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;geometry;shape parameter;partial differential equation;artificial neural network;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics;statistics	ML	84.18865438750517	2.574127896622554	132570

By measuring the modulation of the electric field produced by an object in the field these fish are able to accurately locate an object. Theoretical and experimental studies have focused on the amplitude modulations of EODs produced by resistive objects. However, little is known about the phase modulations produced by objects with complex impedance. The fish must be able to detect changes in object impedance to discriminate between food and nonfood objects. To investigate the features of electric images produced by objects with complex impedance, we developed a model that can be used to map the electric field around the fish body. The present model allows us to calculate the spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase shift in an electric image. This is the first study to investigate the changes in amplitude and phase shift of electric images induced by objects with complex impedance in wave-type fish. Using the model, we show that the amplitude of the electric image exhibits a sigmoidal change as the capacitance and resistance of an object are increased. Similarly, the phase shift exhibits a significant change within the object capacitance range of 0.1–100 nF. We also show that the spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase shifts of the electric image resembles a “Mexican hat” in shape for varying object distances and sizes. The spatial distribution of the phase shift and the amplitude was dependent on the object distance and size. Changes in the skin capacitance were associated with a tradeoff relationship between the magnitude of the amplitude and phase shift of the electric image. The specific range of skin capacitance (1–100 nF) allows the receptor afferents to extract object features that are relevant to electrolocation. These results provide a useful basis for the study of the neural mechanisms by which weakly electric fish recognize object features such as distance, size, and impedance.	characteristic impedance;discharger;distance;electric capacitance;electric image animation system;electric organ;exhibits as topic;fishes;fluorescent in situ hybridization;mexican hat wavelet;modulation;physical object;quantitative impedance;sigmoid function;electric impedance	Kazuhisa Fujita;Yoshiki Kashimori	2010	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-010-0381-y	electroreception;electronic engineering;neuroscience;engineering;electric field;electrical impedance;finite element method;phase modulation;phase;optics;communication;electric fish;physics;quantum mechanics	HCI	89.62009176390004	-6.525051433724193	132731

Recent small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data indicate that the density of water on the surface of lysozyme is significantly higher than in bulk water. Here, we provide an interpretation of the scattering results using a molecular dynamics simulation, which allows us to make quantitative predictions about density variations in the first hydration shell. The perturbation relative to bulk water involves statistically significant changes in the average water structure in the first hydration layer. The water density in the first hydration shell is increased by 5% with respect to the bulk. In regions of higher water density, the water dipoles align more parallel to each other and the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule is higher. Increased water density is found for water molecules interacting with hydrogen and carbon atoms in the backbone or with nonpolar or negatively charged side-chain groups.		Franci Merzel;Jeremy C.

We describe a hybrid method, based on graph theory and probability theory, which enables us qualitatively to model the statistics of global dynamics as parameters are varied. Direct numerical simulation reveals a sudden jump from no impacts within the system to many repeated impacts at a critical value of system parameters. We show that a simple model of the most likely number of impacts also possesses a sudden jump and gives good agreement with the numerical results for large impact probability. A refinement of this model improves the agreement at lower impact probability values.	coefficient;computer simulation;direct numerical simulation;graph theory;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;refinement (computing);system dynamics	Martin E.

We demonstrate that these helical gold nanorods are stable structures with a rather large HOMO-LUMO gap, a large binding energy per atom, a very large vertical dissociation energy, and an extremely large electron affinity. On the basis of the atomic charges and the nature of the frontier orbitals, they are also expected to have strong selective reactivity toward electrophiles and nucleophiles. Furthermore, we show that these helical Au(n) structures and, in particular, the helical Au(40) structure are competitive energetically and chemically with respect to alternate cage and compact Au(n) structures. We consider two fragmentations of the helical Au(40) structure and perform a density of states analysis to examine both charge transfer and electronic polarization.

The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index. Examples of application of the procedure are included.

The experiments have not been accompanied by a quantitative understanding of the underlying detection mechanism. The modeling of field-effect biosensors poses a multi-scale problem due to the different length scales in the sensors: the charge distribution and the electric potential of the biofunctionalized surface layer changes on the Ångström length scale, whereas the exposed sensor area is measured in micrometers squared. Here a multi-scale model for the electrostatics of planar and nanowire field-effect sensors is developed by homogenization of the Poisson equation in the biofunctionalized boundary layer. The resulting interface conditions depend on the surface charge density and dipole moment density of the boundary layer. The multi-scale model can be coupled to any charge transport model and hence makes the self-consistent quantitative investigation of the physics of field-effect sensors possible. Numerical verifications of the multi-scale model are given. Furthermore a silicon nanowire biosensor is simulated to elucidate the influence of the surface charge density and the dipole moment density on the conductance of the semiconductor transducer. The numerical evidence shows the conductance varies exponentially as a function of both charge and dipole moment. Therefore the dipole moment of the surface layer must be included in biosensor models. The conductance variations observed in experiments can be explained by the field effect and they can be caused by a change in dipole moment alone.	brownian motion;conductance (graph);experiment;field effect (semiconductor);gnu nano;multiscale modeling;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;real-time clock;semiconductor;semiconductor device;sensor;simulation;transducer;transistor;ångström	Clemens Heitzinger;Norbert J.

The casting process is strongly dependent on the conventionally true value of the temperature, and hence a high accuracy in the thermodynamic models is needed. The presented approach reaches this accuracy via the mathematical tool MATLAB. The coupled simulation of Plant Simulation and MATLAB models provides a possibility to combine a material flow simulation with a mathematical software. With the help of this tool even complex thermodynamic problems can be solved. Furthermore, this work examines different simulation scenarios and their results on the output and energy consumption of a foundry. The results show the influence of the charging intervals and the melt temperature on machine failure and hence on the casting part throughput.	matlab;material flow;mathematical software;simulation;throughput	Tim Peter;Sigrid Wenzel;Lionel Reiche;Martin Fehlbier	2017	2017 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)	10.1109/WSC.2017.8248091	throughput;material flow;foundry;simulation;casting;energy consumption;energy flow;computer science;control engineering;mathematical software	EDA	88.6729399415424	-3.1839175802337913	135356

I argue that if the demon and the system on which it operates without dissipation of external energy are made of atoms and molecules (gas, liquid or solid) in thermal equilibrium (whose behaviour is described by a canonical distribution), then the unavoidable reason why the demon cannot successfully operate resides in the ubiquity of thermal fluctuations and friction. Landauer’s principle appears to be unnecessary. I also suggest that if the behaviour of the demon and the system on which it acts is not always describable by a canonical distribution, as would happen for instance with the ballistic motion of electrons at early stages of thermionic emission, then a successful working demon cannot be ruled out a priori. A critical review of two recent experiments on thermionic emission Maxwell’s demons is also given.	experiment;landauer's principle;maxwell (microarchitecture)	Germano D'Abramo	2013	Entropy	10.3390/e15051916	statistical physics;vacuum tube;theoretical physics;second law of thermodynamics;maxwell's demon;thermionic emission;landauer's principle;thermodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	90.97690012923651	0.6050884661949884	135359

6127c3b4e669645d5e76674df2364be6e735191c	determining the coupling source on a set of oscillators from experimental data		Complex systems are a broad concept that comprises many disciplines, including engineering systems. Regardless of their particular behavior, complex systems share similar behaviors, such as synchronization.This paper presents different techniques for determining the source of coupling when a set of oscillators synchronize. It is possible to identify the location and time variations of the coupling by applying a combination of analytical techniques, namely, the source of synchronization. For this purpose, the analysis of experimental data from a complex mechanical system is presented. The experiment consisted in placing a 24-bladed rotor under an airflow. The vibratory motion of the blades was recorded with accelerometers, and the resulting information was analyzed with four techniques: correlation coefficients, Kuramoto parameter, cross-correlation functions, and the recurrence plot. Themeasurements clearly show the existence of frequencies due to the foreground components and the internal interaction between them due to the background components (coupling).

A model composed by three partial differential equations, three ordinary differential equations and several arithmetic ones was proposed. Using a discretization of 60 nodes in radial direction, the percentage of error respect to plant data in terms of exit liquid mean temperature and SO3 conversion was 0.03% and 1%, respectively. Temperature distribution in the liquid film aided to detect hot zones in the falling film near the entrance of the reactor, reaching an increase of ca. 36 K in the hottest point. The behavior of the reaction along the reactor was also studied based on the conversion profile and concentration distribution in the liquid film. The model allows performing a complete analysis of the reactor operation, making the model and its results a useful tool for the industry.	method of lines;reactor (software);simulation	Noel Andrés Gómez Mendoza;Izabela Dobrosz-Gómez;Miguel Ángel Gómez García	2014	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2014.05.023	simulation;engineering;mathematics;forensic engineering;method of lines	Robotics	89.15328478432959	-3.5895032365214288	136453

The transform of spin moment from O(2) to Al(13)(-) is much faster. Small molecularly binding energy and relatively high energy barrier show that these clusters are all reluctant reacts with the ground state O(2).		Q. I.

The Gaussian surface is smooth and its properties are analytically differentiable with respect to the positions of atoms. A significant advantage of a solvent model based on this analytically differentiable surface is the availability of analytical gradients of the surface and solvation forces. An efficient and robust algorithm is designed to construct and triangulate the Gaussian surface for large biomolecules with arbitrary shapes, and to compute the various terms required for energy gradients. The Gaussian surface is shown to better mimic the boundary between the solute and solvent by properly addressing solvent accessibility, as is demonstrated by comparisons with standard Poisson-Boltzmann calculations for proteins of different sizes. These results also demonstrate that surface definition is a dominant contribution to differences between GB and PB calculations, especially if the system is large. Application of the new surface to prediction of long loop regions is presented, and significant improvement in the energetics is seen compared with results obtained using the van der Waals surface, even in the absence of optimized empirical correction terms that were used in the latter calculations.

The advantage of a numerical representation of the band structure over an analytical approximation is the accurate representation of the energy bands in the high energy regime. This allows accurate treatment of hot carrier effects in semiconductors. In this work we outline an efficient full-band Monte Carlo (FBMC) simulator and investigate the accuracy of simulation results for different meshing approaches for the Brillouin zone. © 2008 IMACS.

This paper introduces a new formal system of units, which maintain compatibility with SI units, to express all seven SI base units by dimensionless numbers with acceptable uncertainties and to establish the number one as the fundamental parameter of everything. All seven SI base units are converted successfully into the unified dimensionless numerical values via normalization of s, c, h, k, e/me, NA, and b by unity (1). In the proposed system of units, even the unlike-dimensioned physical quantities can be convertible and hence added, subtracted, or compared to one another. It is very simple and easy to analyze and validate physical equations by substituting every unit with the corresponding number. Furthermore, it is expected to find new relationships among unlike-dimensioned physical quantities, which is extremely difficult or even impossible in SI units.	database normalization;formal system;ibm pc convertible;numerical analysis;system of measurement	Dong Bong Yang;Gun Woong Bahang;Sang Zee Lee	2009	Data Science Journal	10.2481/dsj.007-041	gaussian units;rydberg constant;uncertainty;dimensionless quantity;nondimensionalization;natural units;fine-structure constant;statistics	ML	88.67672758012665	-3.1695868949719985	137866

However, there have been concerns about their potential environmental impacts. The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based simulation model for predicting the diffusion dynamics and concentration of toxic materials released from QDs. Reaction kinetics is used to model the stability of surface capping agent particularly due to oxidation process. The diffusion of toxic Cd2+ ions in aquatic environment was simulated using an adapted Brownian motion algorithm. A calibrated parameter to reflect sensitivity to reaction rate is proposed.

Here, we describe the NuSol program in which three classes of algorithms were implemented to solve the 1D, 2D and 3D time independent nuclear Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation was solved using the finite differences based Numerov’smethodwhichwas extended to higher dimensions, themore accurate pseudo-spectral Chebyshev collocation method and the sinc discrete variable representation by Colbert and Miller. NuSol can be applied to solve the Schrödinger equation for arbitrary analytical or numerical potentials with focus on nuclei bound by the potential of their molecular environment. We validated themethods against literature values for the 2DHenon–Heiles potential, the 3D linearly coupled sextic oscillators and applied them to study hydrogen bonding in the malonaldehyde derivate 4-cyano2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione. With NuSol, the extent of nuclear delocalization in a given molecular potential can directly be calculated without relying on linear reaction coordinates in 3D molecular space.	algorithm;chebyshev polynomials;collocation method;digital video recorder;finite difference;hydrogen;numerical analysis;schrödinger;sextic equation;sinc function;solver;stationary process	Timo Graen;Helmut Grubmüller	2016	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2015.08.023	computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;quantum mechanics	ML	94.86425466397169	2.056415955344012	138477

New version program summary Title of program: RHEED_DIFF_Z Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/52nxmwzkxx.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language used: C++ Journal reference of previous version: Computer Physics Communications 207 (2016) 536–538 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No. It is a supplement to the previous version. Reasons for new version: Responding to users’ feedback we present a practical procedure of construction of simulation program, which facilitates the calculation of changes to the intensity of RHEED rocking curves, employing various models of scattering crystal potential for heteroepitaxial structure of hexagonal (0001) GaN film nucleated on a 3C-SiC(111) surface. Nature of problem: Growth of GaN layers on SiC is of importance for potential electronic device applications. Silicon carbide crystallizes in numerous different modifications, so-called polytypes [1]. Among them, only hexagonal structure 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC have been thoroughly investigated while the cubic 3C-SiC polytype is lagging behind in technological developments. The 3C-SiC has a Zincblende crystal structure and is characterized by an identical orientation of all bilayers in the crystal, where the atomic geometry is repeated every three bilayers along the c-axis this crystal structure ( Fig. 1 ). For this reason, 3C-SiC has the high electron mobility and saturation velocity by reducing phonon scattering resulting from the high symmetry. The lattice mismatch between GaN(0001) and 3C-SiC(111) is about 3.3%, and is smaller than the mismatch between GaN(0001) and Si(111) [2]. Therefore progress in investigations on crystal growth of GaN on 3C-SiC is a key issue for device developments related to this heterostructure. Researchers and technologists manufacturing two-dimensional heterostructures frequently use RHEED rocking curves to control growth of samples at the atomistic level of accuracy. The fundamental scientific problem in such research is to specify both interface type and growth mechanism for subsequent layers. Method of solution: RHEED intensities are calculated within the general framework described in Refs. [2] and [3]. Summary of revisions: The presented version of the program implements an original algorithm of self-consistent calculations for scattering potentials GaN(0001)/3C-SiC(111) and solving a time-independent Schrodinger equation for high-energy electrons. During the numerical calculations of the changes in the intensity of the specular beam in the function of the glancing angle, it was assumed that the azimuth of the incident beam direction corresponds to the one-beam condition, the electron energy equals 10 keV, the glancing angle was increased from 0 . 5 ∘ to 6 . 5 ∘ , and the value of α parameter = 0 . 1 and β = 0 . 5 for the MODEL3 of the scattering potential [3] with the model of ideal SiC/GaN interface [4].

The code simulates the nonlinear dynamics of the amplitudes of individual eigenmodes and of a set of discrete markers in five-dimensional phase space representing the energetic particle distribution. Action– angle coordinates of the equilibrium system are used for efficient tracing of energetic particles, and the particle acceleration by the wave fields of the eigenmodes is Fourier decomposed in the same angles. The eigenmodes are described using temporally constant eigenfunctions with dynamic complex amplitudes. Possible applications of the code are presented, e.g., making a quantitative validity evaluation of the one-dimensional bump-on-tail approximation of the system.

For the case of suddenly-applied electric fields, it is shown that the use of a similar dynamical model, in conjunction with the hypothesis of progressive waves generated inside mixtures of fatty acids by suddenly-applied electric fields, can simulate the dynamics of electrical properties of such mixtures in a correct manner.

Here, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) is presented for carrying out grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) BD simulations of channel proteins: http://www.charmm-gui.org/input/gcmcbd. The webserver is designed to help users avoid most of the technical difficulties and issues encountered in setting up and simulating complex pore systems. GCMC/BD simulation results for three proteins, the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), α-Hemolysin (α-HL), and the protective antigen pore of the anthrax toxin (PA), are presented to illustrate the system setup, input preparation, and typical output (conductance, ion density profile, ion selectivity, and ion asymmetry). Two models for the input diffusion constants for potassium and chloride ions in the pore are compared: scaling of the bulk diffusion constants by 0.5, as deduced from previous all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of VDAC, and a hydrodynamics based model (HD) of diffusion through a tube. The HD model yields excellent agreement with experimental conductances for VDAC and α-HL, while scaling bulk diffusion constants by 0.5 leads to underestimates of 10-20%. For PA, simulated ion conduction values overestimate experimental values by a factor of 1.5-7 (depending on His protonation state and the transmembrane potential), implying that the currently available computational model of this protein requires further structural refinement.

This proposed simulator is composed by the cyclic interaction between an electrical solver for the calculation of the current density as well as heating power density distributions and a thermal solver based on the recently proposed steady state analytical thermal simulator DJOSER [4]. In a metal interconnection, because of the temperature dependence of the resistivity, the self Joule-heating within the metal, the heating due to proximity of power devices, the packaging structure and the various thermal boundary conditions concur to change the temperature distribution and the local conductivity values within the interconnection, so that the usual hypothesis of isothermal substrate is largely unrealistic. The simulations were performed on a virtual single-layer PCB in FR-4 epoxy glass cloth with a 80 μm thick copper-foil interconnection driven with constant current. The results, showed in terms of distribution maps of current density, voltage potential, heating power density and temperature, were compared with those obtained under isothermal conditions for many values of the input current and under different average convective heat-transfer coefficients.	simulation	Paolo Emilio Bagnoli;Yongzhi Zhang	2010	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2010.07.029	electronic engineering;chemistry;electrical engineering;printed circuit board;thermodynamics;physics	Arch	91.10700455010657	-9.75086171755944	139011
b2757e1350cd2cabdccf1b9644fcb140d524e213	mesoscopic moment equations for heat conduction: characteristic features and slow-fast mode decomposition		In this work, we derive different systems of mesoscopic moment equations for the heat-conduction problem and analyze the basic features that they must hold. We discuss twoand three-equation systems, showing that the resulting mesoscopic equation from two-equation systems is of the telegraphist’s type and complies with the Cattaneo equation in the Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics Framework. The solution of the proposed systems is analyzed, and it is shown that it accounts for two modes: a slow diffusive mode, and a fast advective mode. This latter additional mode makes them suitable for heat transfer phenomena on fast time-scales, such as high-frequency pulses and heat transfer in small-scale devices. We finally show that, if proper initial conditions are provided, the advective mode disappears, and the solution of the system tends asymptotically to the transient solution of the classical parabolic heat-conduction equation.

The known mechanisms of the transduction of the light pulse derive mainly from studies on bovine rhodopsin. The objective of this work is to construct molecular models of human rhodopsin and opsins, for which threedimensional structures are not available, to analyze the retinal environment and identify the similarities and differences that characterize the human visual pigments. One of the main results of this work is the identification of Glu102 as the probable second counterion of the Schiff base in M opsin (green pigments) and L opsin (red pigments). Further, the analysis of the molecular models allows uncovering the molecular bases of the different absorption maxima of M and L opsins with respect to rhodopsin and S opsin. These differences appear to be due to both an increase in the polarity of the retinal environment and specific electrostatic interactions, which determine a reorganization of the electronic distribution of retinal by selectively stabilizing one of the two resonance forms.	authentication;download;interaction;maxima;resonance;the new york times;transduction (machine learning)	Francesca Centola;Fabio Polticelli	2016	Bio-Algorithms and Med-Systems	10.1515/bams-2016-0012	optics	Comp.	96.74417876548887	-6.450272501352626	140012

Here, we developed a novel partition function-based weighting scheme, which not only fits the target potential energies exponentially like the general Boltzmann weighting method, but also reduces the effect of fitting errors leading to overfitting. The van der Waals (vdW) parameters of benzene and propane were reparameterized by using the new weighting scheme to fit the high-level ab initio PESs probed by a water molecule in global configurational space. The molecular simulation results indicate that the newly derived parameters are capable of reproducing experimental properties in a broader range of temperatures, which supports the partition function-based weighting scheme. Our simulation results also suggest that structural properties are more sensitive to vdW parameters than partial atomic charge parameters in these systems although the electrostatic interactions are still important in energetic properties. As no prerequisite conditions are required, the partition function-based weighting method may be applied in developing any types of force field parameters.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;ellis-van creveld syndrome;energy, physics;fits;force field (chemistry);high- and low-level;interaction;linear discriminant analysis;molecular dynamics;overfitting;partial charge;partition function (mathematics);population parameter;potential energy surface;propane;simulation	Yao Wu;Xiaodong Dai;Niu Huang;Lifeng Zhao	2013	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23249	classical mechanics;van der waals force;chemistry;force field;computational chemistry;partition function;physics;potential energy surface;quantum mechanics	Visualization	97.16007389972006	-4.607844530002904	140648
4d44a16d73e12b40668558b2c327c5c418eb5888	pattern-forming fronts in a swift-hohenberg equation with directional quenching - parallel and oblique stripes		We study the effect of domain growth on the orientation of striped phases in a Swift-Hohenberg equation. Domain growth is encoded in a step-like parameter dependence that allows stripe formation in a half plane, and suppresses patterns in the complement, while the boundary of the pattern-forming region is propagating with fixed normal velocity. We construct front solutions that leave behind stripes in the pattern-forming region that are parallel to or at a small oblique angle to the boundary. Technically, the construction of stripe formation parallel to the boundary relies on ill-posed, infinite-dimensional spatial dynamics. Stripes forming at a small oblique angle are constructed using a functional-analytic, perturbative approach. Here, the main difficulties are the presence of continuous spectrum and the fact that small oblique angles appear as a singular perturbation in a traveling-wave problem. We resolve the former difficulty using a farfield-core decomposition and Fredholm theory in weighted spaces. The singular perturbation problem is resolved using preconditioners and boot-strapping.	data striping;magnetic stripe card;oblique projection;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);preconditioner;stripes;swift (programming language);velocity (software development);well-posed problem	Ryan N.

While based on a variational method, in which the solution approaches the optimal eigenstate of a huge Hamiltonian matrix, the diagonalization method in practice has difficulty because of the rapidly increasing number of quantum states. In this paper, we suggest an improved implementation method of finding the ground state via exact diagonalization of the Hubbard and t - J model Hamiltonians. Achieved is a great increase in the computational capability through an optimized code based on Boolean operations, a reduction of the state space using symmetry properties, and an effective variation on the trial ground state. Our method is restricted mainly by the memory capacity to keep the components of the trial ground state. Carried out on a single personal computer, the method turns out to find exact solutions in a relatively short time with 10 8 – 10 9 basis states.	approximation;basis set (chemistry);bioinformatics;computation;computational biology;computer memory;ground state;hubbard model;instability;numerical stability;quantum simulator;quantum system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time complexity	Myoung Won Cho;Sul-Ah Ahn	2009	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2008.11.003	hubbard model;quantum monte carlo;combinatorics;state space;variational method;hamiltonian matrix;orthogonal diagonalization;mathematics;ground state;quantum electrodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics	Logic	96.62278253671873	-1.9774351198926716	140852

The interaction energies of 10 orientations of complexes were calculated for each system. The largest interaction energies calculated for the three systems are 1.06, 0.70, and 0.80 kcal/mol, respectively. The inclusion of electron correlation increases the attraction significantly. It gains the attraction 1.47, 1.19, and 1.27 kcal/mol, respectively. The dispersion interaction is found to be the major source of the attraction in these systems. In the CH3OCH3—CH4 system, the electrostatic interaction ( 0.34 kcal/mol) increases the attraction substantially, while the electrostatic energies in the other systems are not large. Fluorine substitution of the ether decreases the electrostatic interaction, and therefore, decreases the attraction. In addition the orientation dependence of the interaction energy is decreased by the substitution. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The configurations of rock strata calculated by DDA were imported into a code that is written by using VC++ called “Fractal” to calculate the fractal dimension of the rock strata. As illustrated, a long wall mining case in China was presented.The relationship of the fractal dimension, excavation length, stress, and movement of strata were discussed. The evolution of fractal dimension can be considered as an index of instability or failure.Themethod proposed in this paper can be employed to predict the period weighting in long wall mining engineering.	computer simulation;fractal dimension;instability;numerical analysis;the wall street journal	Yanan Gao;Feng Gao;Man-Chu Ronald Yeung	2014	J.

Density, velocity and entropy per unit volume are used as independent variables for a single-phase, single-component flow. Time-dependent nodal values and interpolation functions are introduced to represent the flow field. Nodal vectors of mass, velocity and entropy are defined as bond graph state variables. It can be shown that the system total energy can be represented as a three-port  IC -field. The conservation of linear momentum for the nodal velocity is represented at the inertial port, while mass and entropy conservation equations are represented at the capacitive ports. All kind of boundary conditions are handled consistently and can be represented as generalized modulated effort or flow sources. As a result of a combination of bond graph concepts with elements of numerical methods, a new approach was developed, which is a foundation of a bridge between bond graphs and CFD.	computational fluid dynamics	J.

Load history and stability analyses of structures of nonlinear reversible or irreversible materials are based on the concept of tangent modulus. Generally, instantaneously changing tangent modulus is needed and the solution yields iteration process. In the case of inelastic problems, the switch from loading to unloading of the material behaviour results in nonsmooth material functions. Nonsmooth, generally saw-tooth like behaviour happens in composite, laminated or rock type materials, or in the interaction of concrete and the reinforcement, too. Recently, damage and localization are in the focus of structural analyses, extending the tangent modulus to the negative cases, as well. Consequently, an overview of the history and development of the tangent modulus containing the recent modifications seems to be necessary. On the other hand, the more than a century long history of the tangent modulus is a marvellous study of the parallel development of mechanics and mathematics, by following the mutual inspiring effect of them through the activity of such pioneers like P.D. Panagiotopoulos in creating Nonsmooth Mechanics.	euler;modulus of continuity	Marta Kurutz	2001	J.

3f0e5e6ae81e3fb519f3408b661d159285cb3852	a new pressure regularity criterion of the three-dimensional micropolar fluid equations		In the past ten years, the mathematical models of fluid dynamics attract more and more attention. As a classic fluid dynamical model, Naiver-Stokes equations [1] are proved as an accurate model in many practical situations, which presume that the derivatives of the components of the velocity are small. However, for certain anisotropic fluids, for example, liquid crystals, which are made up of dumbbell molecules, and some polymeric fluids or fluids containing certain additives in narrow films [2], the constructive relations do not satisfy Stoke Law. In 1960s, Eringen [3] introduced viscous incompressible micropolar fluid flows, a nonNewtonian fluid model with asymmetric stress tensor. From the viewpoint of mathematics, micropolar fluidmodel is coupledwith the incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations,microrotational effects, and microrotational inertia.

7c0d51d10f4a998accac4931363b62aa754ce398	review on the sensitization of turbulence models to rotation/curvature and the application to rotating machinery		Abstract The complex geometry of rotating machines makes the flows strongly affected by rotation and curvature, which are challenging for turbulence modeling. During the development of CFD, large amount of turbulence models appeared and hence make the user hard to decide which one to choose. The present paper presents a coherent review of the various approaches proposed in the recent literatures on this topic. First, the influence of the rotation and curvature is reviewed and concluded. Then, the basic concepts of RANS and LES are introduced to facilitate the description of the models and each method is classified into several types. A variety of models are then described and assessed either by the results in the literatures or by own results, with special concentration on the application to rotating machines. Finally, a brief introduction to the hybrid RANS/LES is made and assessed, together with the recommendation for the selection of the models. The aim of the review is to provide information on the advantages and limitations of related models and make it easier for the user to choose an appropriate model.	turbulence modeling	Jennifer L Brickley;Wei Yang;Yaojun Li;Baoyun Qiu;Qiang Guo;Zhuqing Liu	2019	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2018.08.027	mathematical optimization;turbulence modeling;complex geometry;curvature;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;mathematics;computational fluid dynamics;turbulence	NLP	93.24921658928338	3.9901181273450512	142245

However, the numerical solution of this system often requires a large computational effort. It is worthwhile, whenever possible, to take into account the geometrical or physical particularities of the problem to derive asymptotic simpler approximate models, leading to cheaper simulations. In this paper, we consider the case of high energy short beams, as for example the transport of a bunch of highly relativistic charged particles in the interior of a perfectly conducting hollow tube. We then derive and analyze a new paraxial asymptotic model, that approximates the Vlasov–Maxwell equations and is fourth order accurate with respect to a small parameter ηwhich reflects the physical characteristics of the problem. This approach promises to be very powerful in its ability to get an accurate and fast algorithm, easy to be developed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

d8ad56354c577a11433705238144026295951c6f	mean displacement near an interface in a nonlinear string		Nonlinear waves on a two-part stretched string are considered as a reduced model of nonlinear waves in sea ice near a sudden change in ice properties. Geometric nonlinearity is retained, and the waves are confined to a wave packet. The weakly nonlinear approach results in three coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, one for incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The waves create a local mean displacement at the interface of the two sides, which provides the primary nonlinear effect. This interfacial mean requires a time-history approach, treated here with Laplace transforms. The results show that the mean is positive when the stiffness decreases across the interface and negative otherwise. The magnitude of the mean displacement near the interface is much larger when the stiffness increases, as it would where ice increases in thickness.	displacement mapping	R. Arredondo;John P.

An MMPB/SA-type analysis was applied to conformational samples from 3 ns explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Binding affinities and the sampled conformations of the inhibitor and enzyme were compared between different HIV-1 protease protonation states to find the most likely protonation state of the enzyme in the complex with each of the inhibitors. The resulting set of protonation states leads to good agreement between calculated and experimental binding affinities. Results from the MMPB/SA analysis are compared with an explicit/implicit hybrid scheme and with MMGB/SA methods. It is found that the inclusion of explicit water molecules may offer a slight advantage in reproducing absolute binding free energies while the use of the Generalized Born approximation significantly affects the accuracy of the calculated binding affinities.

The method simply relates the kinetic energy to the system temperature via the particles' momenta based on the ideal gas law. However, when used in a tightly bound system such as solids, the method may suffer from deriving a lower system temperature and potentially inducing early breaking of atomic bonds at relatively high temperature due to the neglect of the effect of the potential energy of atoms based on solid state physics. In this paper, a modified NH thermostat method is proposed for solid system. The method takes into account the contribution of phonons by virtue of the vibrational energy of lattice and the zero-point energy, derived based on the Debye theory. Proof of the equivalence of the method and the canonical ensemble is first made. The modified NH thermostat is tested on different gold nanocrystals to characterize their melting point and constant volume specific heat, and also their size and temperature dependence. Results show that the modified NH method can give much more comparable results to both the literature experimental and theoretical data than the standard NH. Most importantly, the present model is the only one, among the six thermostat algorithms under comparison, that can accurately reproduce the experimental data and also the T^3-law at temperature below the Debye temperature, where the specific heat of a solid at constant volume is proportional to the cube of temperature.	molecular dynamics;nosé–hoover thermostat;simulation;solid-state drive	Wen-Hwa Chen;Chun-Hung Wu;Hsien-Chie Cheng	2011	J.

The performance of actual devices was compared against the simulated operation and was found to be in good agreement. The 3-dimensional simulation was reduced to two 2-dimensional simulations to reduce complexity. The two equations resulting from steady state energy balance considerations were discretized and an iterative nonlinear Gauss-Seidel procedure applied to solve the system of equations. Temperature profiles and contours were calculated and the effect of geometric and materials modifications was demonstrated. >		Walter Allegretto;Bing Shen;P. Haswell;Zhongsheng Lai;Alexander M.

An analytical formula with which to compute the energy transfer between neighboring solitary waves is derived. The resulting expression shows that the energy change in a variable KdV system is essentially due the two-wave mixing, contrary to the energy change in a nonlinear Schrödinger system, which results from the intrachannel four-wave mixing. By considering the case of Gaussian solitary wave solutions, we have determined the transfer of energy in the system analytically and numerically. © 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

9688303f0fade7b1cc99f3ead5041d8f5276e749	the nitrogen edge-doped effect on the static first hyperpolarizability of the supershort single-walled carbon nanotube	nitrogen doped effect;single wall carbon nanotube;monotonic dependences;static first hyperpolarizability;carbon nanotube;dipole moment;nitrogen	The nitrogen edge-doped effect on the structure, dipole moment, and first hyperpolarizability of the supershort single-walled carbon nanotube (5, 0) has been studied systematically. For the nitrogen edge-doped effect on the structure, the mean diameter on the nitrogen-doped side (D(u)) decreases as the number of doped-nitrogen (n) increases (4.044 (1) > 3.991 (2) > 3.941 (3) > 3.891 (4) > 3.844 A (5)). Significantly, the nitrogen edge-doped effects on the dipole moment and first hyperpolarizability are revealed for the first time and these new effects are dramatic for the supershort single-walled carbon nanotube (5, 0). Among the beta(0) values of these seven nitrogen-doped structures, the largest beta(0) (3155 au) is larger by almost 450 times than the very small beta(0) (7 au) of undoped structure (D(5h)). For nitrogen-doped structures, the order of the beta(0) values is 3155 (1) > 2677 (2A) approximately 2817 (2B) > 1465 (3A) approximately 1458 (3B) > 670 (4) > 254 au (5), which shows two interesting relationships between the beta(0) value and nitrogen-doped number: (1) the smaller the nitrogen-doped number, the larger the beta(0) value. (2) The structures with the same number of doped-nitrogen have almost the same beta(0) values (1465 for 3A and 1458 au for 3B). As for the frequency-dependent beta (-omega; omega, 0) and beta (-2omega; omega, omega), the dependence on the nitrogen-doped number (n) is similar to the case of static beta(0). For beta (-2omega; omega, omega) values at omega = 0.005 au are 3220 (1) > 2720 (2A) approximately = 2862 (2B) > 1480 (3A) approximately = 1477 (3B) > 676 (4) > 256 au (5). In addition, the important monotonic dependences of the beta value on the D(u) and electronic spatial extent  are also observed. The new knowledge of influence the beta value will be beneficial to design high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.	carbon monoxide poisoning;chaitin's constant;diameter (qualifier value);doping (semiconductor);generalized context-free grammar;gold;greater;large;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;nitrogen;nitrogen-vacancy center;nonlinear system;small;spherical basis;dipole moment	Hong-Liang Xu;Fang-Fang Wang;Zhi-Ru Li;Bing-Qiang Wang;Di Wu;Wei Chen;Guang-Tao Yu;Feng Long Gu;Yuriko Aoki	2009	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21140	carbon nanotube;chemistry;carbon nanotube quantum dot;organic chemistry;computational chemistry;nitrogen	ML	96.20504066211048	-6.876622097698628	143526

It uses a deterministic approximation of an adjoint transport solution to reduce variance, computed quickly by ignoring atmospheric interactions. This allows significant variance and computational cost reductions when the atmospheric scattering and absorption coefficient are small. When combined with an atmospheric photon-redirection scheme, significant variance reduction (equivalently acceleration) is achieved in the presence of atmospheric interactions.	approximation;coefficient;computational complexity theory;hybrid monte carlo;interaction;monte carlo method;variance reduction	Guillaume Bal;Anthony B.

If the electrical conductivity is anisotropic, this current is tilted toward the fiber direction, causing charge to accumulate between half-wavelengths: positive charge where the current vectors converge and negative where the current vectors diverge. This charge produces an electric field in the direction of propagation that is associated with an electrical potential, and this electric field causes an additional current that is also tilted by the anisotropy. The final result is the total current pointing perpendicular to the direction of propagation and a charging of the tissue every half wavelength. The potential has a greater magnitude than that obtained from colloidal suspensions or ionic solutions (ultrasonic vibration potentials) and may be used as the basis of a technique to image conductivity.	anisotropy;converge;electrical current;electrical engineering;ionic;ions;magnetic fields;software propagation;solutions;suspensions;tissue fiber;ultrasonic waves;ultrasonics (sound);electric field;wavelength	Nancy Tseng;Bradley J.

In contrast to the well-established B2PLYP type of DH functionals, the energy expressions in the xDH functionals are constructed by using density and orbital information from another standard Kohn-Sham (KS) functional (e.g., B3LYP) for doing the self-consistent field calculations. Thus, the xDH functionals are nonvariational in both the hybrid density functional part and the second-order perturbation part, each of which requires formally to solve a coupled-perturbed KS equation. An implementation is reported here which combines the two parts by defining a total Lagrangian such that only a single set of the Z-vector equations need to be solved. The computational cost with our implementation is of the same order as those for the conventional Møller-Plesset theory to the second order (MP2) and B2PLYP. Systematic test calculations are provided for covalently bonded molecules as well as compounds involving the intramolecular nonbonded interactions for the main group elements. Satisfactory performance of the xDH functionals demonstrates that the extra computer time on top of the conventional KS procedure is well-invested, in particular, when the standard KS functionals and MP2 as well, are problematic.

The lowest optical allowed transition of these tubes is between the first two van Hove singularities on each side of the Fermi level, which is different from that of small-diameter tubes. The exciton binding energy for E11 is calculated, which is consistent with that of the experiments.	approximation;bethe–salpeter equation;electron hole;electronic band structure;exciton;experiment;gw-basic;many-body problem;perturbation theory;quasiparticle;semiconductor	Y.

Working with the Zeldovitch--von Neumann--Doring (ZND) model, he identified two fundamental classes of detonation profiles, referred to as those of decreasing (D) and increasing (I) type, which appeared to exhibit very different behavior with respect to high-frequency perturbations. Using a combination of rigorous and nonrigorous arguments, Erpenbeck concluded that type I detonations were unstable to some oscillatory perturbations for which the (vector) frequency was of arbitrarily large magnitude, while type D detonations were stable provided the frequency magnitude was sufficiently high. For type D detonations Erpenbeck's methods did not allow him to obtain a cutoff magnitude for stability that was uniform with respect to frequency direction. Thus, he left open the question of whether the cutoff magnitude for stability might approach $+\infty$ as certain frequency directions were approached. In this paper...		Olivier D.

When it is difficult to get analytical solutions or necessary to track the trajectory of particles, lattice Monte Carlo (LMC) simulation has been shown to be particularly useful. To develop such an LMC simulation algorithm for the Galilei variant anomalous diffusion, we derive explicit solutions for the conditional and unconditional first passage time (FPT) distributions with double absorbing barriers. According to the theory of random walks on lattices and the FPT distributions, we propose an LMC simulation algorithm and prove that such LMC simulation can reproduce both the mean and the mean square displacement exactly in the long-time limit. However, the error introduced in the second moment of the displacement diverges according to a power law as the simulation time progresses. We give an explicit criterion for choosing a small enough lattice step to limit the error within the specified tolerance. We further validate the LMC simulation algorithm and confirm the theoretical error analysis through numerical simulations. The numerical results agree with our theoretical predictions very well.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;central processing unit;displacement mapping;error analysis (mathematics);first-hitting-time model;gillespie algorithm;graphics processing unit;little man computer;mean squared error;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;parameterized complexity;samuel j leffler;simulation;stochastic process	Gang Guo;Arne T.

In this paper, a coarse-grained (CG) particle model is developed for simulating blood flow by modifying the Morse potential, traditionally used in Molecular Dynamics for modeling vibrating structures. The modified Morse potential is parameterized with effective mass scales for reproducing blood viscous flow properties, including density, pressure, viscosity, compressibility and characteristic flow dynamics of human blood plasma fluid. The parameterization follows a standard inverse-problem approach in which the optimal micro parameters are systematically searched, by gradually decoupling loosely correlated parameter spaces, to match the macro physical quantities of viscous blood flow. The predictions of this particle based multiscale model compare favorably to classic viscous flow solutions such as Counter-Poiseuille and Couette flows. It demonstrates that such coarse grained particle model can be applied to replicate the dynamics of viscous blood flow, with the advantage of bridging the gap between macroscopic flow scales and the cellular scales characterizing blood flow that continuum based models fail to handle adequately.	bridging (networking);coupling (computer programming);flow;liquid substance;molecular dynamics;navier–stokes equations;plasma active;population parameter;quantity;search - action;self-replicating machine;simulation;solutions;triune continuum paradigm;viscosity	Na Zhang;Peng Zhang;Wei Kang;Danny Bluestein;Yuefan Deng	2014	Journal of computational physics	10.1016/j.jcp.2013.09.040	statistical physics;text mining;simulation;density;computer science;bioinformatics;inverse problem;blood flow;mathematics;thermodynamics;physics;algorithm	Networks	93.19380463694222	-0.4391312118736828	145358

Their properties are governed by a Gaussian hypergeometric function, which cannot be reduced to either elementary or easily tractable functions. We discuss the method of efficient computation of this function for half-integer parameters and a moderate value of its argument. We show how to dynamically estimate a cutoff for infinite sums involving this function performed over its parameters. Our algorithm exceeds double precision and is parallelizable. Depending on the experimental parameters it chooses one of the several ways of summation to achieve the best efficiency.

Under a suitable phase-space transformation, the coupled systems can be expressed as a composition of independent subsystems. We find that for the coupled systems, the figures of merit, that is the efficiency for engine and the coefficient of performance for refrigerator, are bounded (both from above and from below) by the corresponding figures of merit of the independent subsystems. We also show that the optimum work extractable from a coupled system is upper bounded by the optimum work obtained from the uncoupled system, thereby showing that the quantum correlations do not help in optimal work extraction. Further, we study two explicit examples; coupled spin-1/2 systems and coupled quantum oscillators with analogous interactions. Interestingly, for particular kind of interactions, the efficiency of the coupled oscillators outperforms that of the coupled spin-1/2 systems when they work as heat engines. However, for the same interaction, the coefficient of performance behaves in a reverse manner, while the systems work as the refrigerator. Thus, the same coupling can cause opposite effects in the figures of merit of heat engine and refrigerator.	coefficient;interaction;quantum statistical mechanics;quantum system;spin-½	George Thomas;Manik Banik;Sibasish Ghosh	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19090442	mathematical optimization;heat engine;control theory;coefficient of performance;coupling;spin-½;quantum;bounded function;figure of merit;quantum mechanics;oscillation;physics	HPC	89.17646717613454	0.5319910922782108	147032

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have been able to study the CD mediated extraction of cholesterol from model membranes, in particular from a pure cholesterol monolayer, at atomic resolution. Our results show that efficient cholesterol extraction depends on the structural distribution of the CDs on the surface of the monolayer. With a suitably oriented dimer, cholesterol is extracted spontaneously on a nanosecond time scale. Additional free energy calculations reveal that the CDs have a strong affinity to bind to the membrane surface, and, by doing so, destabilize the local packing of cholesterol molecules making their extraction favorable. Our results have implications for the interpretation of experimental measurements, and may help in the rational design of efficient CD based nano-carriers.	cholesterol;cyclodextrins;depletion region;document completion status - documented;domino tiling;extraction;gnu nano;molecular dynamics;processor affinity;set packing;simulation;tissue membrane;free energy;nanosecond	Cesar A.

The comparison results show that in TM mode the measuring point above the abnormal body can more effectively reflect the anisotropy effect than the one which is far away from the abnormal body. In addition, the results demonstrate that in TM mode the anisotropy effect cannot be ignored, and then in TE mode it is not sensitive to the anisotropy.

fe3dae5e365063f47b7389fb1d5042ab4afb2696	simulação do ciclo de vida social da ameba dictyostelium discoideum	transporte celular;biofisica molecular;simulacao computacional;biodifusao;tese	In this work we aim to simulate different stages of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum through its social cycle. This organism has a typical life cycle in which it behaves like an Eukaryotic amoeba, feeding on bacteria and reproducing through mitosis. It is when the sources of nutrients in the environment become scarce that the social cycle begins. In this cycle the amoebae start to emit a chemical signal that will guide them to form aggregates with approximately 50 thousand amoebae. Within such aggregate the amoebae differentiate themselves to create a multicellular being in the form of a slug, which aims to transport the amoebae to a region with a higher probability of survival. In order to simulate such organism we have merged two different models to reproduce the chemical signaling among amoebae and their movement. The model chosen to describe the chemical signaling of the compound cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate 3’5’ has ben developed according to the biochemical processes and the parameters obtained experimentally. The amoebae movement is implemented through a boids model with fixed speed where the angle of movement varies according to simple rules that have proven effective in other simulations of animal groups and cellular segregation. In this thesis we show how the method used to solve the model chemical signaling is not only numerically more efficient, but also capable of reproducing several properties of the amoeba seen in experiments until the aggregation stage, including: synchronization, adaptation, spiral formation and reaction-diffusion patterns. Upon implementation of amoeba movement we verified other properties such as streaming, mound formation and collective rotational movement. In this thesis we in addition to uniting several properties in a single model, were also able to demonstrate that the origin of the helicoidal movement within the slug can come from simple physical properties, in contrast to some studies which claim the origin to be from chemotaxis in a system with scroll waves of chemical signaling.

CoMFA was carried out to describe the activities of 78 analogues. The models were applied to a training set including 64 compounds. The best CoMFA model included steric and electrostatic fields, had a good Q(2) value of 0.845, and adequately predicted the compounds contained in the test set. Furthermore, plots of the steric CoMFA field allowed conclusions to be drawn for the choice of suitable inhibitors. In addition, the dynamical behavior of compounds with 4-(aminosulfonyl)phenyl, 4-[(methylamino)sulfonyl]phenyl, 4-[(dimethylamino)sulfonyl]phenyl, and [3-methoxy-4-(aminosulfonyl)]phenyl groups at position 2 of the 9H-purine scaffold inside the CDK2 active site were analyzed by QM/MM calculations. The interactions of these compounds with residues Lys89, Asp86, and Ile10 were characterized.		Jans H.

975d2656e903695116acbba6602ed4ed79e34b80	numerical simulations of the influence of temperature changes on structural integrity of stone temples in angkor, cambodia	contact interface;theoretical model;temperature changes;sandstone monuments in angkor;structural integrity of sandstone structures;nonlinear analysis of static behaviour	Mediaeval stone temples on archaeological site Angkor were built between 9th and 14th century. Ever since they have been exposed to many external detrimental effects of various intensity. Among others, significant are temperature changes causing specific character of failures of the structures. These are caused by partly irreversible and in time increasing cyclical micro-movements of individual stone blocks. The total sum of all movements happening since their creation in these risk areas reached values high enough to cause stone blocks falling out of the structures. Process of cyclical shrinking and expansion of stone structures represents significant contribution to their total disintegration. This text presents preparation and progress of numerical simulations of static behaviour and process of disintegration of stone temples caused by the influence of temperature changes. It introduces a principle of creation and optimization of numerical models for construction and load put on them including preparation of all input data and evaluation of the achieved results. The analysis of static reliability of the stone temples is performed in the framework of activities of Czech National Project at Angkor (CNPA). Theoretical simulation of structural behaviour of the stone temples in Angkor presents a unique approach as nothing similar has been attempted before. 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The results, based on Dupuit and Ghyben-Herzberg approximations, clearly show both the extent of seawater intrusion and how the latter can be reduced by means of artificial recharge. The new methodology describes a simplified mathematical formulation based on the sharp freshwater-saline interface in a fractured aquifer, rather than solving complicated density dependent partial differential equations of flow and solute transport in porous media. Application of the method requires, in a preliminary stage a knowledge of the freshwater flow rates in the fractured media. This can be derived by means of specific computational codes, under steady conditions. In the second stage, the extent of seawater intrusion can be evaluated in vertical planes of a three-dimensional domain. The methodology was applied to the Nardo fractured rock aquifer in order to estimate the extent to which seawater had intruded into it. The procedure was easily implemented in a job file of EXCEL Microsoft Office and performed well. Results indicated a good correlation between the coastal spring zones of the model with Landsat Thematic Mapper sensor photos and field investigation.	simulation	Costantino Masciopinto	2006	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2004.09.028	geomorphology;geology;hydrology;mathematical model;mathematics;geotechnical engineering;ecology;statistics	Robotics	90.30506187448943	-2.0672591218497174	148677

Performance of the SCC-DFTB-D method was examined by comparing the calculated results using it with those obtained from experiment as well as ab initio and other different density functional theoretical studies. An excellent agreement between the SCC-DFTB-D results and those obtained by the other calculations regarding the structural modifications, hydrogen bonding, and dissociation energies of the neutral and radical anion base pairs was found. It is shown that adiabatic electron affinity can be better predicted by considering reaction enthalpies of formation of the respective neutral and anionic base pairs from their respective molecular components instead of taking the difference between their total energies. The calculated AEAs of the base pairs were compared with those obtained by the bracketing method from Schaefer and coworkers, where a satisfactory agreement was found. It shows applicability of the SCC-DFTB-D method to study charged DNA models at a highly economical computational cost.		Anil Kumar;Michaela Knapp-Mohammady;P. C.

It has been well proved that the cascaded nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators (CNOPOs) are the most successful devices to produce bright entangled optical beams with different wavelengths. Here, we discuss the dependence of the possibly obtained largest-size multicolor entangled state and the entanglement degree on optical parameters of CNOPOs. Each NOPO in the cascaded system is operated above its oscillation threshold. One of two output optical beams produced by a NOPO is used for the pump light of the subsequent one, and the remained another beam serves as a submode of the multicolor entangled state. The obtainable maximal number of entangled submodes and the multicolor entanglement degree are numerically calculated under experimentally accessible conditions. The calculated results provide direct references for the design of generation systems of multicolor entangled optical beams.	experiment;experimental system;interconnection;maximal set;multiple encryption;numerical analysis;parametric oscillator;quantum entanglement;quantum information;resultant	Wangyun Liu;Xiaojun Jia	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-015-1019-8	w state;optics;quantum entanglement;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	86.95529131558332	-1.5037194065930852	149502

This analysis confirms that singlet pair energies converge much slower than triplet pair energies. In addition, singlet pair energies with (aug)-cc-pVDZ and (aug)-cc-pVTZ basis sets do not follow a converging trend and energies with three basis sets larger than aug-cc-pVTZ are generally required for reliable extrapolations of third order correlation energies, making so the explicitly correlated R12 calculations preferable.

According to the analysis, it can be seen that the spurting atoms from the nanojet aperture are more evenly distributed as the temperature is increased. However, as the temperature lowers, the atoms easily concentrate on the central region. Furthermore, when a larger nanojet aperture was used, the amount of spurting atoms increased and concentrated easily into the central region. The phenomenon of the pressure wave was found with the aid of molecular dynamics. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A practical implementation of these numerous functionals can present a substantial challenge particularly if the higher order functional derivatives are required. We present a systematic method of functional implementation. The method allows a clean handling of a large number of functionals in a mutually independent way. We developed an extensive set of automatic test routines to facilitate functional and derivative testing with respect to the implementation correctness and numerical stability. An integral part of the presented solution is a program for automatic code generation from analytical formulas that uses only freely available tools. Code for evaluation of functionals and their first, second, third, and fourth derivatives can be generated, which accelerates the development, implementation, and testing of new functionals.	approximation;automatic programming;code generation (compiler);computational chemistry;contain (action);correctness (computer science);density functional theory;floor and ceiling functions;functional derivative;functional theories of grammar;handling (psychology);numerical stability;organic chemistry phenomena	Pawel Salek;Andreas Hesselmann	2007	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20758	mathematical optimization;chemistry;local-density approximation;minnesota functionals;thermochemistry;computational chemistry;mathematics;orbital-free density functional theory;hybrid functional;density functional theory;quantum chemistry;physics;quantum mechanics	PL	95.8911237736435	0.7478286374605205	150094

Chem. Phys. 131, 154103 (2009)], a hybrid explicit/implicit method to treat electrostatic interactions in computer simulations of biomolecules formulated for spherical cavities, to prolate spheroidal and triaxial ellipsoidal cavities, designed to better accommodate non-spherical solutes in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition to the utilization of a general truncated octahedron as the MD simulation box, central to the proposed extension is an image approximation method to compute the reaction field for a point charge placed inside such a non-spherical cavity by using a single image charge located outside the cavity. The resulting generalized image charge solvation model (GICSM) is tested in simulations of liquid water, and the results are analyzed in comparison with those obtained from the ICSM simulations as a reference. We find that, for improved computational efficiency due to smaller simulation cells and consequently a less number of explicit solvent molecules, the generalized model can still faithfully reproduce known static and dynamic properties of liquid water at least for systems considered in the present paper, indicating its great potential to become an accurate but more efficient alternative to the ICSM when bio-macromolecules of irregular shapes are to be simulated.	approximation;autostereogram;body cavities;british informatics olympiad;computation;computer simulation;explicit and implicit methods;interaction;molecular dynamics;small;solutions;water model;solute	Shaozhong Deng;Changfeng Xue;Andrij Baumketner;Donald Jacobs;Wei Cai	2013	Journal of computational physics	10.1016/j.jcp.2013.03.027	simulation;computer science;mathematics;method of images;thermodynamics;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics	Visualization	92.8859945364536	0.2614007776290361	150214
87ecb790b6a246d8cd7e097b8759a2da58348c74	diffusion of particles with short-range interactions		A system of interacting Brownian particles subject to short-range repulsive potentials is considered. A continuum description in the form of a nonlinear diffusion equation is derived systematically in the dilute limit using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Numerical simulations are performed to compare the results of the model with those of the commonly used mean-field and Kirkwood-superposition approximations, as well as with Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic particle system, for various interaction potentials. Our approach works best for very repulsive short-range potentials, while the mean-field approximation is suitable for long-range interactions. The Kirkwood-superposition approximation provides an accurate description for both short- and long-range potentials but is considerably more computationally intensive.	interaction	Maria Bruna;S.

The most important feature of the intraplate earthquakes in the Indian region are that the seismicity occurs within the entire crust. In Latur region of India an earthquake occurred in the upper crust. In such situations, quantifying the uncertainties in seismogenic depths becomes very important. The stochastic heat conduction equation has been solved for different sets of boundary conditions, an exponentially decreasing radiogenic heat generation and randomness in thermal conductivity. Closed form analytical expressions for mean and variance in the temperature depth distribution have been used and an automatic formulation has been developed in Matlab for computing and plotting the thermal structure. The Matlab toolbox presented allows us to display the controlling thermal parameters on the screen directly, and plot the subsurface thermal structure along with its error bounds. The software can be used to quantify the thermal structure for any given region and is applied here to the Latur earthquake region of India.	matlab	Kirti Srivastava;Likhita Narain;Swaroopa Rani;V. P.

First eigen affine mode shape imperfection pattern (FEAMSIP) is taken as distributed geometrical imperfections and dent as local geometrical imperfections. Limit load of the cylindrical shells are determined using non-linear static finite-element analysis module of general purpose FE software ANSYS. A parametric study on the effect of both imperfection patterns is done by varying the size and orientation of the dent.

The program contains an efficient Monte Carlo ion implant algorithm that includes explicit calculation of ion channelling and damage. The key feature of the diffusion calculation is a general partial differential equation solver for rapid prototyping of physical models. The solver has been used to develop several unique diffusion models. A new model for impurity diffusion in polysilicon treats the problem as a two-stream process, with a relatively slow standard diffusion within the grain and a much more rapid component of diffusion along the grain boundaries. The two components are coupled at each point by a segregation term. Two new models for impurity diffusion in silicon include explicit calculation of the coupling of point defects with impurities. One of the point defect models is a general and detailed formulation from a chemical kinetics viewpoint, while the other model makes further assumptions to simplify the model for engineering analysis.	algorithm;chemical vapor deposition;computer program;debian;epitaxy;ion implantation;kinetics internet protocol;monte carlo method;rapid prototyping;software bug;solver;very-large-scale integration	Brian J.

But difficulties in calculating the pKBH+ and m* values are often encountered due to the “medium effects” in the UV-VIS absorption spectra considered. To overcome these difficulties a computer program based on the factor analysis target testing method has been written. The program generates a large number of combinations of the give pKBH+ and m* values. Employing the target testing method a pair of these values is chosen which best fit the set of UV-VIS spectra measured.		Ülo Haldna;A.

The question of the number of possible oscillations and the coherent quality of these oscillations remain unanswered. This paper proves the upper-bounds on the number and quality of such oscillations when the system in question is homogeneously driven and has a discrete network of states. In a closed system, the maximum number of oscillations is bounded by the number of states in the network. In open systems, the size of the network bounds the quality factor of oscillation. This work also explores how the quality factor of macrostate oscillations, such as would be observed in chemical reactions, are bounded by the smallest equivalent loop of the network, not the size of the entire system. The consequences of this limit are explored in the context of chemical clocks and limit cycles.	closed system;coherence (physics);limit cycle;neural oscillation;open system (computing)	Nathan O.

The optimized geometries, frequencies, and minimum energy path are all obtained at the MP2/6-311+G(d,p) level, and energetic information is further refined by the BMC-CCSD (single-point) method. The rate constants for every reaction channels, R1, R2, R3, and R4, are calculated by canonical variational transition state theory with small-curvature tunneling correction over the temperature range 200-1000 K.

The threshold for chaotic behavior can be increased and decreased when the modulation profiles are reshaped by triangular wave and Jacobi elliptic sine functions, respectively. Experimental results show that sinusoidalwave, square-wave, and triangular-wave modulations have different chaotic thresholds, agreeing with numerical results. In addition to the dynamic parameters of modulation frequency and modulation depth, the shape of modulation is an important parameter for controlling the nonlinear dynamics in pump-modulation lasers.	chaos theory;jacobi method;linear programming relaxation;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;relaxation oscillator;self-oscillation	Ming-Dar Wei;Chih-Chang Hsu	2012	I.

However, their computational treatment is unconventional (e.g., lack of convergence in naive self-consistent iterative algorithm). The stringent evaluation requires evaluation of Boltzmann averaged statistical mechanics sums and electrostatic energy estimation for each microstate.   SUMMARY irGPU: Irregular strong interactions in proteins--a GPU solver is novel solution to a versatile problem in protein biophysics--atypical protonation behavior of coupled groups. The computational severity of the problem is alleviated by parallelization (via GPU kernels) which is applied for the electrostatic interaction evaluation (including explicit electrostatics via the fast multipole method) as well as statistical mechanics sums (partition function) estimation. Special attention is given to the ease of the service and encapsulation of theoretical details without sacrificing rigor of computational procedures. irGPU is not just a solution-in-principle but a promising practical application with potential to entice community into deeper understanding of principles governing biomolecule mechanisms.

The asymptotics of the voltage potential depend on the position of the inclusions and on the contrast between the inclusions and matrix conductivities via a polarization tensor. We are especially interested in determining an analytical expression of this tensor in order to study how the terms in the expansion depend on the interinclusion distance, the inclusion size, and the conductivity contrast. We present numerical tests that compare the true voltage potential to our asymptotic formula when the inclusions are treated as a single inhomogeneity and to the asymptotic formula when the inclusions are well separated.	floppy disk	Fahmi Ben Hassen;Eric Bonnetier	2005	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/030602083	conformal map;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;mathematics;geometry	Theory	88.04862316325244	4.089161722482187	152581

This airway surface liquid is a bilayer composed of a viscoelastic mucus layer supported by a fluid film known as the periciliary liquid. The viscoelastic behavior of the mucus layer is principally due to long-chain polymers known as mucins. The airway surface liquid is cleared from the lung by ciliary transport, surface tension gradients, and airflow shear forces. This work presents a multiscale model of the effect of airflow shear forces, as exerted by tidal breathing and cough, upon clearance. The composition of the mucus layer is complex and variable in time. To avoid the restrictions imposed by adopting a viscoelastic flow model of limited validity, a multiscale computational model is introduced in which the continuum-level properties of the airway surface liquid are determined by microscopic simulation of long-chain polymers. A bridge between microscopic and continuum levels is constructed through a kinetic-level probability density function describing polymer chain configurations. The overall multiscale framework is especially suited to biological problems due to the flexibility afforded in specifying microscopic constituents, and examining the effects of various constituents upon overall mucus transport at the continuum scale.	apache continuum;brainwave entrainment;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computational model;coughing;gradient;kinetics;mucins;polymer;polymers;simulation;structure of parenchyma of lung;surface tension;triune continuum paradigm;mucus layer;physical hard work	Sorin Mitran	2013	Journal of computational physics	10.1016/j.jcp.2013.01.037	probability density function;simulation;surface tension;layers;respiration;lattice boltzmann methods;nanotechnology;thermodynamics;physics	Graphics	93.45540436037531	-3.5600494349193887	152786
b359552789269b2d18799a3e2d32fc68e8733b48	two-dimensional oscillatory neural network based on charge-density-wave devices operating at room temperature		We propose an oscillatory neural network implemented with twodimensional tantalum disulfide devices operating in the change density wave regime at room temperature. An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices connected in series. Such a cell has constant output and oscillatory states. All cells have the same bias voltage. There is constant current flowing through the cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias voltage due to the electrical-field driven metal-to-insulator transition owing to the changes in the charge density wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two 1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-ofphase where one of the devices is in the insulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The nearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are resistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the On state while they are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the Off state. The operation of the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30×30 node network. The results of our numerical modeling show the formation of artificial vortexes and cellular-automata type data processing. The two-dimensional 1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of properties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast synchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for both consumer electronic and defense applications.	artificial neural network;automata theory;biasing;cellular automaton;constant current;elementary;graphene;numerical analysis;radiation hardening;scalability;series and parallel circuits;topological insulator;transistor	Alexander G.

These devices contain substantial layers of ternary alloys, whose thermal conductivities are not well documented, although they are known to be much smaller than those of the corresponding binary compounds. Therefore a comparison of measurement and calculation gives a valuable check on the thermal conductivities, and is important for validating temperature estimates in a wide variety of HBTs, HEMTs and laser diodes. The measurements employed the V/sub be/-shift technique, while the calculations employed a high-resolution 3-D nodal network model of the transistor structure, including emitter metal interconnects, and the chip carrier. This was solved iteratively, with the best estimates for thermal conductivities from the literature. Comparisons were made from 25 to 200/spl deg/C baseplate temperature. At 25/spl deg/C the measurement and calculation yield temperature rises (normalized to power per unit area) of 31.0 and 28.9/spl deg/C./spl mu/m/sup 2//mW respectively, i.e. there is agreement to within 7%. At higher temperatures, the calculation is hampered by lack of knowledge of the temperature coefficients (n) for the thermal conductivities of the ternary alloys. So these were all assumed to have the same value, which was used as a fitting parameter. A good fit was obtained with n=1.0. These results suggest that the published thermal conductivity value for Ga/sub 47/In/sub 53/As is accurate to within /spl plusmn/10%, and to first order a GaInAs/AlInAs superlattice can be treated as just two layers of the constituent materials with thermal conductivities equal to the bulk values. Also n=1.0 for these compounds, either separately, or as the net effect for this device structure.	diode	Bruce M. Paine;Ami P.

The complex hydrodynamic interactions are described by an improved color-fluid LB model, in which the interfacial tension forces and the Marangoni stresses are modeled in a consistent manner using the concept of a continuum surface force. An additional convection-diffusion equation is solved in the LB framework to obtain the temperature field, which is coupled to the interfacial tension through an equation of state. A stress-free boundary condition is also introduced to treat outflow boundary, which can conserve the total mass of an incompressible system, thus improving the numerical stability for creeping flows. The model is firstly validated against the analytical solutions for the thermocapillary driven convection in two superimposed fluids at negligibly small Reynolds and Marangoni numbers. It is then used to simulate thermocapillary migration of three-dimensional deformable droplet at various Marangoni numbers, and its accuracy is once again verified against the theoretical prediction in the limit of zero Marangoni number. Finally, we numerically investigate how the localized heating from a laser can block the microfluidic droplet motion through the induced thermocapillary forces. The droplet motion can be completely blocked provided that the intensity of laser exceeds a threshold value, below which the droplet motion successively undergoes four stages: constant velocity, deceleration, acceleration, and constant velocity. When the droplet motion is completely blocked, four steady vortices are clearly visible, and the droplet is fully filled by two internal vortices. The external vortices diminish when the intensity of laser increases.	lattice boltzmann methods;simulation	Haihu Liu;Yonghao Zhang;Albert J. Valocchi	2012	J. Comput.

The analysis proceeds by rigorously deriving a one dimensional cable equation from the full problem with three-dimensional geometry and a known current passed into a constricted extracellular space. Conditions for the validity of the derivation are given. An analysis of the cable equation gives estimates for the electronic length constant of between 2 μm and 20 μm, which are between one and three orders of magnitude smaller than estimates in the literature for neuroprosthetic electrical stimulation. The implication of this is that passive changes in the membrane potential due to electrical stimulation are determined by the local extracellular current density, on the scale of a few to a few tens of micrometers.	functional electrical stimulation;neuroprosthetics	Hamish Meffin;Tatiana Kameneva	2011	Biomed.

cc2bd37550f4c881950c8a620fd4d6643c99ce95	phase transition in a random fragmentation problem with applications to computer science	search algorithm;phase transition;critical value	We study a fragmentation problem where an initial object of size x is broken into m random pieces provided x > x0 where x0 is an atomic cut-off. Subsequently, the fragmentation process continues for each of those daughter pieces whose sizes are bigger than x0. The process stops when all the fragments have sizes smaller than x0. We show that the fluctuation of the total number of splitting events, characterized by the variance, generically undergoes a nontrivial phase transition as one tunes the branching number m through a critical value m = mc. For m < mc, the fluctuations are Gaussian where as for m > mc they are anomalously large and non-Gaussian. We apply this general result to analyse two different search algorithms in computer science. PACS numbers: 02.50.−r, 05.40.−a, 89.20.−a Fragmentation is a widely studied phenomenon [1] with applications ranging from conventional fracture of solids [2] and collision induced fragmentation in atomic nuclei and aggregates [3] to seemingly unrelated fields such as disordered systems [4] and geology [5]. In this paper, we consider a problem where an object of initial size (or length) x is first broken into m random pieces of sizes xi = rix with ∑m i=1 ri = 1 provided the initial size x > x0 where x0 is a fixed ‘atomic’ threshold. At the next stage, each of those m pieces with sizes bigger than x0 is further broken into m random pieces and so on. Clearly, the process stops after a finite number of fragmentation or splitting events when the sizes of all the pieces become less than x0. This problem and its close cousins have already appeared in numerous contexts including the energy cascades in turbulence [6], rupture processes in earthquakes [7], stock market crashes [8], binary search algorithms [9–11], stochastic fragmentation [12] and DNA segmentation algorithms [13]. It therefore comes as somewhat of a surprise that there is a nontrivial phase transition in this problem as one tunes the branching number m through a critical value m = mc. In this letter, we study analytically the statistics of the total number of fragmentation events n(x) up to the end of the process as a function of the initial size x. We show that, while the average number of events μ(x) always grows linearly with x for large x, the asymptotic 0305-4470/02/320501+07$30.00 Printed in the UK L501 L502 Letter to the Editor behaviour of the variance ν(x), characterizing the fluctuations, undergoes a phase transition at a critical value m = mc, ν(x) ∼ { x m < mc x2θ m mc . (1) The exponent θ is nontrivial and increases monotonically with m for m mc starting at θ (m = mc) = 1/2 and the amplitude of the leading x2θ term has log-periodic oscillations for m mc. This signals unusually large fluctuations in n(x) for m > mc. The full distribution of n(x) also changes from being Gaussian for m < mc to non-Gaussian for m > mc. This phase transition is rather generic for any fragmentation problem with an ‘atomic’ threshold. However, the critical value mc and the exponent θ are nonuniversal and depend on the distribution function of the random fractions ri . In this letter, we establish this generic phase transition and then calculate explicitly mc and θ for two special cases with direct applications in computer science. Indeed, it is in the context of the computer science problem of counting the number of nodes of an m-ary search tree that the first special case of this rather generic phase transition was discovered [15]. In this fragmentation problem with a fixed lower cut-off x0, one first breaks the initial piece of length x provided x > x0 into m pieces of sizes xi = rix. The sizes of each of these ‘daughters’ are then examined. Only those pieces whose sizes exceed x0 are considered ‘active’ and those with sizes less than x0 are considered ‘frozen’. Each of the active pieces is then subsequently broken into m pieces and so on. The fractions ri characterizing a splitting event are considered to be independent from one event to another but are drawn each time from the same joint distribution function ηm(r1, r2, . . . , rm). As the splitting process conserves the total size, the fractions ri satisfy the constraint ∑m i=1 ri = 1. In addition, we consider the splitting process to be isotropic, i.e., all the m daughters resulting from a splitting event are statistically equivalent. This indicates that the marginal distribution of any one of the ri is independent of i and is given by η1(r) = ∫ ηm(r, r2, . . . , rm) m ∏	binary search algorithm;computer science;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);gaussian blur;ip fragmentation;marginal model;neural oscillation;picture archiving and communication system;quantum fluctuation;search tree;steam rupture;turbulence	David S.

The performance of a variety of basis sets in evaluating the basis set superposition error and the interaction energy has been systematically examined. It is shown that for a proper description of the stacking interaction the diffuse sp-functions as well as the multiple sets of polarization functions are required. Additional calculations were carried out with popular semi-empirical methods (MNDO, AM1 and PM3). All of the applied semi-empirical methods greatly overestimate the interaction forces and give qualitatively incorrect results.

When signal-to-noise ratio and data sequence available satisfy the predefined conditions, the ionospheric phase contamination may be modeled by the polynomial phase signal. As a new parametric tool for analyzing polynomial phase signal, HAF is applied to estimate polynomial phase model parameters and reconstruct the disturbance signal. Using the estimated reconstructed signal, compensation can be performed before coherent integration and the original radar return spectrum can be restored. A piecewise scheme is proposed to track rapid variation of the phase contamination in HAF method, and it can remove the Doppler spread effect caused by the ionosphere nonstationarity. Simulation is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.	polynomial	Kun Lu;Jiong Wang;Xingzhao Liu	2003		10.1109/ICASSP.2003.1202384	computer vision;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio	Logic	83.14522566336647	-5.328479165014801	154787

For example, recent EURO 6 regulations for vehicles have placed stringent limits on soot emissions. In order to allow design engineers to achieve the goal of reduced soot emissions, they must have the tools to so. Due to the complex nature of soot formation, which includes growth and oxidation, detailed numerical models are required to gain fundamental insights into the mechanisms of soot formation. A detailed description of the CoFlame FORTRAN code which models sooting laminar coflow diffusion flames is given. The code solves axial and radial velocity, temperature, species conservation, and soot aggregate and primary particle number density equations. The sec∗Corresponding author. Fax +1 416 978 7753.

8c8ded2250a71a504e057da35380e482e9fba02e	a lattice boltzmann model for substrates with regularly structured surface roughness	multiphase flow and multi component flow;shan and chen lattice boltzmann model;apparent contact angle;superhydrophobic surfaces	Superhydrophobic surface characteristics are important in many industrial applications, ranging from the textile to the military. It was observed that surfaces fabricated with nano/micro roughness can manipulate the droplet contact angle, thus providing an opportunity to control the droplet wetting characteristics. The Shan and Chen (SC) lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) is a good numerical tool, which holds strong potentials to qualify for simulating droplets wettability. This is due to its realistic nature of droplet contact angle (CA) prediction on flat smooth surfaces. But SC-LBM was not able to replicate the CA on rough surfaces because it lacks a real representation of the physics at work under these conditions. By using a correction factor to influence the interfacial tension within the asperities, the physical forces acting on the droplet at its contact lines were mimicked. This approach allowed the model to replicate some experimentally confirmed Wenzel and Cassie wetting cases. Regular roughness structures with different spacing were used to validate the study using the classical Wenzel and Cassie equations. The present work highlights the strength and weakness of the SC model and attempts to qualitatively conform it to the fundamental physics, which causes a change in the droplet apparent contact angle, when placed on nano/micro structured surfaces.	lattice boltzmann methods;lattice gas automaton	A.

In the prevailing approach, the first principle is assumed to be generally valid and, hence, the field strength is equated to the negative gradient of a scalar potential. The second principle is dropped at certain points, which are called current sources, that current is supposed to be injected from the outside. In the present paper, a different approach is proposed, in which the density of current is equated to the curl of a vector potential so that its divergence vanishes unconditionally while the curl of field strength assumes nonvanishing value at some points that are called curl sources. It is called the vector potential theory approach and shows its advantage over scalar potential theory in spontaneous potential (SP) computation. In the vector potential approach, the dipole layer disappears and SP is supposed to be generated by the curl source rather than the dipole layer. In the numerical computation, the numerical mode-matching method (NMM) is used. Hermite cubic interpolation rather than linear interpolation is employed in the basis function expansion of the simulated function. Eigenvectors to be solved for are composed of, not only the amplitudes, but also the slopes of the simulated function at nodal points.	basis function;computation;constant current;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;current source;gradient;linear interpolation;numerical analysis;spontaneous order;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula;curl	Geng Ji Zhang;Gong Li Wang	1999	IEEE Trans.

4ae515b202f3fdd8986a3018c9cd8cf99b77058c	numerical study of wings with wavy leading and trailing edges	flow control	Abstract The use of wavy leading edges is presented in the literature as a possible way of delaying stall, allowing a wing to have a better aerodynamic performance at high angles of attack. In this paper, we present results of direct numerical simulations of the flow around infinite wavy wings with a NACA0012 profile at a Reynolds number Re = 1000. The simulations were carried out using the Spectral/hp Element Method, with a coordinate system transformation being employed to treat the waviness of the wing. Several combinations of wavelength and amplitude were considered, showing that for this value of Re the waviness leads to a reduction in the lift-to-drag ratio ( L/D ), associated with a suppression of the fluctuating lift coefficient. Also, flow visualization indicate that this behaviour is associated with a regime where the flow remains attached behind the peaks of the leading edge while there are distinct regions of flow separation behind the troughs.	numerical method	Douglas Serson	2016			structural engineering;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	ECom	89.21180579061539	3.8770074214302244	155568

HX and linear blue-shifted N2 ... HKrX complexes were determined by ab initio computations, with and without counterpoise correction, at the SCF and MP2(full) levels of theory using a 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set. The MP2 computations agree with predictions from a perturbation theory model involving the first and second derivatives of the interaction energy with respect to displacement of the H--X and H--Kr bond lengths from their equilibrium values in the isolated monomers. The theoretical results agree qualitatively with the experimentally observed frequency shifts, with near quantitative agreement for N2 ... HKrCl. The characteristic downfield shift of the isotropic proton magnetic resonance in the red-shifted complexes was obtained, but for the blue-shifted complexes, the proton NMR shifts to higher fields.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;basis set (chemistry);computation;displacement mapping;equilibrium;experiment;interaction energy;perturbation theory;protons;psychologic displacement;resonance;monomer	Sean A.

In accordance with previous analytical predictions and two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulations, it is shown that cellular flames occurring in low Lewis number premixtures can propagate at heat-loss rates greater than the maximum that extinguishes the planar flame. At sufficiently high heat losses, the flame interface breaks up into separate self-drifting flame balls while a significant portion of the fuel remains unconsumed.	flaming (internet)	Leonid Kagan;S.

Most models of the iron-based superconductors find a sign-changing (s±) order parameter [1–6], with the physical implication that pairing is driven by spin fluctuations. Recent work, however, has indicated that LiFeAs has a simple isotropic order parameter [7–9] and spin fluctuations are not necessary [7,10], contrary to the models [1–6]. The strength of the spin fluctuations has been controversial [11,12], meaning that the mechanism of superconductivity cannot as yet be determined. We report the momentum dependence of the superconducting energy gap, where we find an anisotropy that rules out coupling through spin fluctuations and the sign change. The results instead suggest that orbital fluctuations assisted by phonons [13,14] are the best explanation for superconductivity.	abductive reasoning;molecular orbital;onset (audio);phonon	Sergey V.

The solution takes account of the space charge distribution in the semiconductor, of a surface dielectric layer, of the possible presence of surface states, and of the exact Fermi-Dirac statistics for the charge carriers. The macroscopic electrostatic problem and microscopic electronic description are kept separate, convenient reduced units are introduced, and the differential capacitance characteristic is expressed in a simple parametric form. For bands of normal form, and for a single-level acceptor or donor surface state, the reduced characteristic depends on eight reduced quantities for general statistics, and on six for the simpler Boltzmann limit; the latter include three quantities describing the surface state level, one for the dielectric layer, one bulk semiconductor parameter, and one contact potential constant which shifts the voltage scale. Explicit calculations are made for silicon at 293K for various doping levels, dielectric layers, and single-level surface states; the variation of the characteristic dip in the capacitance is exhibited as a function of these parameters.	semiconductor	Paul M.

In this article we present SCISSORS, a linear-algebraical technique (related to multidimensional scaling and kernel principal components analysis) to rapidly estimate chemical similarities for several popular measures. We demonstrate that SCISSORS faithfully reflects its source similarity measures for both Tanimoto calculation and rank ordering. After an efficient precalculation step on a database, SCISSORS affords several orders of magnitude of speedup in database screening. SCISSORS furthermore provides an asymptotic speedup for large similarity matrix construction problems, reducing the number of conventional slow similarity evaluations required from quadratic to linear scaling.	algorithm;chemical similarity;cheminformatics;evaluation;image scaling;kernel;multidimensional scaling;principal component analysis;rate limiting;similarity measure;speedup;structural similarity;test scaling;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Imran S.

We speculate that all maze solvers implement Lee algorithm by first developing a gradient of values showing a distance from any site of the maze to the destination site and then tracing a path from a given source site to the destination site. All prototypes approximate a set of many-source-one-destination paths using resistance, chemical and temporal gradients. They trace a path from a given source site to the destination site using electrical current, fluidic, growth of slime mould, Marangoni flow, crawling of epithelial cells, excitation waves in chemical medium, propagating crystallisation patterns. Some of the prototypes visualise the path using a stream of dye, thermal camera or glow discharge; others require a computer to extract the path from time lapse images of the tracing. We discuss the prototypes in terms of speed, costs and durability of the path visualisation.

The analysis is performed by randomly choosing the initial condition for the noise source. However, in order to investigate how the initial value of the dichotomous noise affects the phase dynamics, we extend our analysis using two different fixed initial values for the source of random fluctuations. In our study, the phase dynamics of the Josephson junction is analyzed as a function of the noise signal intensity, for different values of the parameters of the system and external driving currents. We find that the mean lifetime of the superconductive metastable state as a function of the noise intensity is characterized by nonmonotonic behavior, strongly related to the soliton dynamics during the switching towards the resistive state. The role of the correlation time of the noise source is also taken into account. Noise-enhanced stability is observed in the investigated system.	initial condition;noise generator;randomness;soliton	Claudio Guarcello;Davide Valenti;Angelo Carollo;Bernardo Spagnolo	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17052862	shot noise;quantum noise;noise;metastability;thermodynamics;condensed matter physics;physics	Robotics	90.83283020130229	-7.448087494885807	158324

It is assumed that the biological interactions take place in capillaries, ligands bind and dissociate with receptors on the wall of capillary, and ligands are transported by blood stream. The blood stream in capillary is modeled as Newtonian laminar flow, and ligand transport is modeled by a general transport equation. A set of ordinary differential equations is used to describe the complex chemical kinetics due to binding and dissociation. The time-dependent solution of media flow is obtained using second order implicit Euler method to achieve high order time accuracy. The spatial distribution of ligands and receptors are obtained and visualized.

7fda95f78c8946b106e1d8120c2551a4bcf3cc82	the steady-state convection-diffusion equation at high péclet numbers for a cluster of spheres: an extension of levich's theory	76r50;physical sciences and mathematics;diffusion convection mass transfer;76m45	This paper describes an approximate analytical model of competitive effects between members of a dense cluster of absorbing objects, which are modeled as spheres. Neighboring absorbing spheres compete for diffusing species and thereby reduce each other’s rate of absorption. Levich’s well-known asymptotic (high Péclet number) theory of convection-diffusion considers only the inner region of the concentration boundary layer; it does not describe the wake zone accurately. An extension of the Levich model is constructed for the wake zone. This is used to model intersphere competitive effects. The model demonstrates that for two neighboring spheres aligned along the flow direction, the absorption of the downstream sphere is substantially reduced vis-à-vis the upstream sphere. The model is verified by comparison to numerical simulation studies. Both single-sphere simulations (reported in this paper) and multisphere simulations (taken from existing literature) are considered. In the single-sphere case, the discrepancy between the analytical model and the numerical results is maximally 10% at Pe = 10 and much lower at higher Péclet numbers. An appreciable part of the error stems from the original Levich model itself, rather than from our method of extending the Levich model. In the multisphere case, the difference between the analytical model and the numerical studies is generally less than 30%. At small intersphere separations (say, center-to-center distances < 5 sphere radii), the model tends to overestimate the interference effects. This is related to the fact that flow stagnancy in the space between two closely packed spheres is not taken into account in the model.	absorbing markov chain;alexander horned sphere;approximation algorithm;computer simulation;discrepancy function;downstream (software development);interference (communication);midsphere;numerical analysis;visual instruction set	Joseph A.

38cb6735a88b7ff65efa30ec782f502d9f8e6fb9	a mean-field approach for the determination of the polarizabilities for the water molecule in liquid state	polarizabilities;molecular dynamics;electric field;field gradient;chemistry;ab initio;mean field methods;article;water;electric response properties	A mean-field method is presented describing the electrostatic environment experienced by water molecule in liquid state, which is used to extract the corresponding hyper- and high-order polarizabilities. Within this approach, MD computer simulations of liquid water samples for two standard water potentials at several different temperatures are performed to characterize the distributions (specifically average values) of local fields and field gradients. The electric response properties (including non-linear contributions up to fourth-order) are then calculated using ab initio techniques in conjunction with a charge perturbation variant of a finite field method. Sets of fixed charges are used to generate the desired electric fields and electric field gradients. Calculations of dipole polarizability, hyper- and principal components of high-order polarizabilities of the water molecule in gas and liquid phase conditions are carried out at MP2 and MP4 levels of theory; the values obtained for three different liquid phase models are compared with those for gas phase. For a liquid phase water molecule the first hyperpolarizability (β) and first higher polarizability (A) increase markedly, actually changing sign. The second hyperpolarizability γ) also increases but much less dramatically, and components of the second high-order polarizability tensor (B) demonstrate a rearrangement of contributions. We observe that a less symmetrical gradient model gives the most accurate representation of liquid-phase conditions. The excellent agreement of our gas-phase values with experimental results and the most accurate previous theoretical predictions is evident of the quality of our higher order polarizabilities and theoretical models.	polarizability	Anna V.

The simulations emulate the motion of a localized laser-beam spot through the trapped condensate. Our results for the 1D case indicate that, due to the inhomogeneity of the BEC density, the critical speed for nucleation, as a function of the condensate density displays two distinct dependences. In particular, the square root of the critical density for nucleation as a function of speed displays two different linear regimes corresponding to small and large velocities. Effectively, the emission of gray solitons and vortex–antivortex pairs occurs for any velocity of the impurity, as any given velocity will be supercritical in a region with a sufficiently small density. At longer times, the first nucleation is followed by generation of an array of solitons in 1D (“soliton train”) or vortex pairs in 2D (“vortex street”) by the moving object. © 2006 IMACS.

MRMP2, MP2 to MP4, CCSD(T), and DFT studies of NO dimerization on Ag2 and Cu2 clusters disclosed that the CCSD(T) method could be applied to this reaction on Ag2 and Cu2 unlike NO dimerization in gas phase which exhibits significantly large nondynamical electron correlation effect. Charge-transfer (CT) from Ag2 and Cu2 to NO moieties plays important role in NN bond formation between two NO molecules. This CT considerably decreases nondynamical correlation effect. Also, the DFT method could be applied to this NO dimerization, if appropriate DFT functional is used; all pure functionals examined here and most of the hybrid functionals underestimated the activation barrier (Ea ), while only ωB97X provided Ea similar to CCSD(T)-calculated value. NO dimerization on similar Cu2 and Cu5 needs moderately larger Ea than those on Ag2 and Ag5 , because frontier orbital participating in the CT exists at lower energy in Cu2 and Cu5 than in Ag2 and Ag5 . The Ea decreases in the order Ag2 >> Ag38 > Ag7 ∼ Ag5 and the reaction energy (ΔE) is positive (endothermic) in Ag2 but significantly negative in Ag38 , Ag7 , and Ag5 , indicating that various Ag clusters could be effective for NO dimerization except for Ag2 . The decreasing order of Ea and increasing order of exothermicity are attributed to increasing order of the frontier orbital energy of Ag2 < Ag38 < Ag7 ∼ Ag5 . © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2239efd7421b81fceecc46d3ba86da80c52ad837	application of the poor man's navier-stokes equations to real-time control of fluid flow	real time control;fluid dynamics	Control of fluid flow is an important, underutilized process possessing potential benefits ranging from avoidance of separation and stall on aircraft wings to reduction of friction in oil and gas pipelines tomitigation of noise fromwind turbines. But theNavier-Stokes N.-S. equations, whose solutions describe such flows, consist of a system of time-dependent, multidimensional, nonlinear partial differential equations PDEs which cannot be solved in real time using current computing hardware. The poorman’s Navier-Stokes PMNS equations comprise a discrete dynamical system that is algebraic—hence, easily and rapidly solved—and yet which retains many possibly all of the temporal behaviors of the PDE N.-S. system at specific spatial locations. Herein, we outline derivation of these equations and discuss their basic properties. We consider application of these equations to the control problem by adding a control force. We examine the range of behaviors that can be achieved by changing this control force and, in particular, consider controllability of this nonlinear system via numerical experiments. Moreover, we observe that the derivation leading to the PMNS equations is very general andmay be applied to a wide variety of problems governed by PDEs and possibly time-delay ordinary differential equations such as, for example, models of machining processes.

Numerical simulations for performance assessments using such a local and detailed model are unrealistic, and there is a need to replace this local model (mesoscopic model) by a global one (macroscopic model). After introducing a small parameter $\varepsilon$, linking the relative size of the waste packages to the repository module size and to geological parameters, a first-order accurate macroscopic model of a repository module is obtained by studying the asymptotic behavior of the mesoscopic model when $\varepsilon$ tends to 0. The mathematical homogenization method that we use herein leads to an accurate macroscopic model which could be used as a global repository model for far field numerical simulations in performance assessment.	underground	Alain Bourgeat;Eduard Marusic-Paloka	2005	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/040605424	computer simulation;statistical physics;simulation;homogenization;first-order logic;mathematical model;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	90.47236019577993	1.9151851833165583	159941

Recently, Morales and Nocedal developed hybrid methods for large-scale unconstrained optimization that interlace iterations of the limited-memory BFGS method (L-BFGS) and the Hessian-free Newton method (Computat Opt Appl 2002, 21, 143-154). We test the performance of this approach as compared to those of the L-BFGS algorithm of Liu and Nocedal and the truncated Newton (TN) with automatic preconditioner of Nash, as applied to the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and a loop of the protein ribonuclease A. These systems are described by the all-atom AMBER force field with a dielectric constant epsilon = 1 and a distance-dependent dielectric function epsilon = 2r, where r is the distance between two atoms. It is shown that for the optimal parameters the hybrid approach is typically two times more efficient in terms of CPU time and function/gradient calculations than the two other methods. The advantage of the hybrid approach increases as the electrostatic interactions become stronger, that is, in going from epsilon = 2r to epsilon = 1, which leads to a more rugged and probably more nonlinear potential energy surface. However, no general rule that defines the optimal parameters has been found and their determination requires a relatively large number of trial-and-error calculations for each problem.	aprotinin;assisted model building with energy refinement (amber);atom;bovine metabolome database;broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);central processing unit;energy minimization;force field (chemistry);gradient;hessian;interaction;interlaced video;iteration;limited-memory bfgs;mathematical optimization;morale;nash equilibrium;newton's method;nonlinear system;potential energy surface;preconditioner;ribonucleases;rugged computer;truncated newton method;trypsin inhibitors;twice (numerical qualifier);twisted nematic field effect	B.

The knowledge of this phenomenon represents the key factor for performing effective pre-commissioning activities in petrochemical industry; in order to avoid hydrate formation and pipe corrosion, it is in fact necessary to achieve an effective removal of all water prior the introduction of hydrocarbon gas. This is normally achieved by performing a bulk dewatering operation, followed by a drying operation which efficiency is dependent on the air flow rate, air pressure and temperature. In this paper, the model implemented in a finite volume-based simulation software, as well as the considerations that have been made for its development, is presented. Its predictions are compared with available air drying field data of two existing gas pipeline systems. 352 A.

Therefore, together with the movements in the input frequencies, several others are produced in different time scales. In this letter, we propose a theory that explains the chaotic regimes in loudspeakers reported in the literature, as a consequence of ponderomotive force resulted from the nonlinear coupling between two of those different time scales. On the basis of the theory, we discuss design directions on how to avoid the chaotic behaviors.	loudspeaker	Luiz P.

The lipids investigated are 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phospho-L-serine given their common use both in experimental and computational studies. The charges, and to a lesser extent the polarizabilities, are found to depend strongly on the molecular conformation of the lipids. Furthermore, the importance of explicit polarization is underlined for the description of larger assemblies of lipids, that is, membranes. In conclusion, we find that specially developed polarizable parameters are needed for embedding calculations in membranes, while common non-polarizable point-charge force fields usually perform well enough for structural and dynamical studies. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	algorithmic efficiency;clomiphene;computation;dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine;embedding;excitation;force field (chemistry);fragmentation (computing);frequency capping;hybrid functional;john d. wiley;large;lipids;mike lesser;molecular dynamics;multiscale modeling;periodicals;phospholipids;polarizability;polarization (waves);respiratory rate;simulation;tissue membrane;prodan	Sarah Witzke;Nanna Holmgaard List;Jógvan Magnus Haugaard Olsen;Casper Steinmann;Michael Petersen;Maarten T.

We find, on the consideration of both the electron correlation and spin-orbital coupling effect, that the LCMO takes on insulating nature, yet is transformed to half metallicity once the external pressure is introduced. Such tuning is accompanied by a spin-state transition of Co(2+) from the high-spin state (t(5)2ge(2)g) to low-spin state (t(6)2ge(1)g) because of the enhancement of crystal-field splitting under pressure. Using mean-field approximation theory, Curie temperature of LCMO with Co(2+) being in low-spin state is predicted to be higher than that in high-spin state, which is attributed to the enhanced ferromagnetic double exchange interaction arising from the shrinkage of Co-O and Mn-O bonds as well as to the increase in bond angle of Co-OMn under pressure. We also find that antisite disorder in LCMO enables such transition from insulating to half-metallic state as well, which is associated with the spin-state transition of antisite Co from high to low state. It is proposed that the substitution of La(3+) for the rare-earth (RE) ions with smaller ionic radii could open up an avenue to induce a spin-state transition of Co, rendering thereby the RE2CoMnO6 a promising half-metallic material.	approximation theory;auditory processing disorder;curie;electron;ground state;ionic;ions;molecular orbital;mood disorders;small;state transition table;topological insulator;perovskite	Shuhui Lv;Xiaojuan Liu;Hongping Li;Lin Han;Zhongchang Wang;Jian Meng	2012	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.22976	phase transition;magnetism;chemistry;nuclear magnetic resonance;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics;spin states	HCI	94.81810087370397	-8.148414898634696	161144

It derives the ground state properties of multi-atomic ensembles directly from the computation of their one-particle density n(r). In DFT-based simulations the solution is calculated through a chain of successive self-consistent cycles; in each cycle a series of coupled equations (Kohn-Sham) translates to a large number of generalized eigenvalue problems whose eigenpairs are the principal means for expressing n(r). A simulation ends when n(r) has converged to the solution within the required numerical accuracy. This usually happens after several cycles, resulting in a process calling for the solution of many sequences of eigenproblems. In this paper, the authors report evidence showing unexpected correlations between adjacent eigenproblems within each sequence and suggest the investigation of an alternative computational approach: information extracted from the simulation at one step of the sequence is used to compute the solution at the next step. The implications are multiple: from increasing the performance of material simulations, to the development of a mixed direct-iterative solver, to modifying the mathematical foundations of the DFT computational paradigm in use, thus opening the way to the investigation of new materials.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;algorithm;central processing unit;computation;density functional theory;gsc bus;ground state;iterative method;kohn–sham equations;mathematical model;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;simulation;solver;supercomputer	Edoardo Di Napoli;Stefan Blügel;Paolo Bientinesi	2012	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2012.03.006	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;data structure;mathematics;density functional theory;information extraction;physics;quantum mechanics	Graphics	95.352600147296	1.7722328391486417	161273

This work discusses, from 3D TCAD simulations, the effect of the spatial distribution of interface traps on the variability of the threshold voltage and the on-current of MOSFETs. The results suggest that threshold voltage is mainly influenced by the trap distribution along the channel of the device, whereas on-current is also influenced by the alignment of the traps along the device width.

22d6952581a125ca32b38ed063ac90f7994b3410	ab initio study on the electronic structures of styrene in the franck-condon region	photochemistry;excited states;vibrational analysis;styrene;franck condon;electronic structure;ab initio mrmp2 calculations;ab initio casscf calculations	The electronic structures of styrene in the Franck-Condon region have been theoretically examined by means of ab initio complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and the second order multireference Møller-Plesset calculations. The optimized structure of styrene in S(0) is planar but the torsional motion of the phenyl group is very floppy. The S(1) state is assigned to the local pi-pi* excitation within the benzene ring. On the other hand, S(2), above S(1) by 0.561 eV, is assigned to a state that resembles the so-called V-state of ethylene. The transition intensity of S(0)-S(1) is weak, while that of S(0)-S(2) is strong. This is in good agreement with the experimental absorption spectrum where the S(0)-S(1) and S(0)-S(2) transitions are in the energy range of 290-220 nm. The optimized geometry of S(1), characterized by an enlarged benzene ring and its vibrational analyses, further justifies the assignment of the S(1) state.

0b2af2919178021a7d428b833c29e5e050718dfc	on the implementation of membrane models in computational fluid dynamics calculations of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells	pemfc;computation fluid dynamics;polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell;membrane model;cfd modeling;approximation property;polymer electrolyte membrane;water content;model membrane;transport properties	The implementation of phenomenological membrane models within computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes requires coupling of the conervation equation for water content within the membrane to the conservation equations for species mass outside the membrane. It is common ractice to treat water and current transport within the membrane as one-dimensional (1D), i.e., normal to the membrane surface only. The purpose f this study is to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of various strategies of implementing a phenomenological membrane model within the ramework of a two-dimensional (2D) CFD code. Springer’s membrane model was compared against two other models available from the literature, nd the accuracy of each model was assessed by comparing predicted results against experimental data. Results appear to indicate that the Springer odel and the Nguyen and White model over-predict the drying of the membrane, while the Fuller and Newman model provides the best match ith experimental data. Following these studies, three strategies for implementation of the membrane model were investigated: (1) 2D transport in embrane, (2) 1D transport in membrane and (3) 1D transport with approximate transport properties. Fuller and Newman’s membrane model was sed for these studies. The results obtained using the three approaches were found to be within 4% of each other, while there was no significant ifference in the computational time required by the three models, indicating that an analytical 1D transport model for the membrane that uses pproximate properties is adequate for describing transport through it. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we show how Willems's dissipativity theory provides a convenient framework to study a physical system at both microscopic and macroscopic level, and suggests a natural storage function different from the usual free energy to derive the theorem of energy equipartition of energy for linear systems. In this setup, we introduce a simple and general definition for temperature defined also out of equilibrium which allows to test the limits of validity of Fourier's law describing the transfer of heat from hot systems to cold systems. In particular under time-scale separation conditions, we derive the Maxwell-Cattaneo law, allowing for instantaneous flow of energy from cold to hot systems, which should be considered instead of Fourier's law for a proper description of energy exchanges between interconnected linear systems.	dissipative system;eddy willems;entropy (information theory);linear system;maxwell (microarchitecture);nonlinear system;positive systems	Jean-Charles Delvenne;Henrik Sandberg	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402284	probability distribution;microscopy;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;linear system;statistics	Embedded	89.53281517331742	0.7939164265710077	162212

The main distinguishing attribute of this fitting procedure is the production of approximated electronic density functions with positive definite expansion coefficients; in this way, the statistical meaning of the probability distribution is preserved. The methodology, which was fully described previously, was modified in this work to improve and accelerate the fitting procedure. This variation concerns the optimization method employed to obtain the optimal angle of the EJR, implementing an algorithm based on a Taylor series expansion. Additionally, a new 1S-Type Gaussian basis set for atoms H to Rn is presented, that was fitted from a primitive basis set of Huzinaga. Fitted density functions facilitate theoretical calculations over large molecules and may be employed in many areas of Ž . computational chemistry, for example, in quantum similarity measures QSM . To verify the basis set, a sound example related to QSM applications is given. This corresponds to the comparison of experimental structures obtained from Ž .

Our results and the available literature data clearly show that extrapolation of intermolecular distances to the complete basis set (CBS) limit is satisfactory on PESs corrected for BSSE. On the other hand, one should avoid such extrapolations using data obtained from uncorrected PESs. Also, fixing intramolecular parameters at their experimental values could cause difficulties during the extrapolation. As the available literature data and our results clearly show, the MP2/aug-cc-pVXZ {X = 2, 3, 4} data series of intermolecular distances obtained from the CP-corrected surfaces can be safely used for the purpose of CBS extrapolations. c © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The constitutive equations between nominal stresses and Green strains are assumed to be linear elastic and isotropic. The numerical results are obtained by using a finite element approach, following a classical Newton-Raphson procedure. They show the peculiarity of the non-linear dependence of the torsional torque on the corresponding angle of rotation, which can be either of hardening or softening type. Comparisons with previous numerical results available in literature are also provided.	finite element method;hardening (computing);newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;softening	L.

Small deviations from a linear dependence of wave velocity on magnetic field are found and are interpreted as quantum oscillations in the mass density of carriers. Theory and experiment are compared for the magnetic field along a bisectrix axis and along a two-fold axis. Good agreement is found for the first case, but significant discrepancies exist for the magnetic field along a two-fold axis.	quantum;software propagation	George A. Williams;George E.

The comparison of numerical and experimental data has been performed, for the simple nozzle, in terms of mass flow rate, velocity at the exit and pressure and cavitation distributions. The numerical results for the real diesel nozzle geometry have been validated with experimental measurements of mass flow rate, momentum flux and effective injection velocity. The results obtained in both cases and their comparison with available experimental data showed that the model is able to predict with a high level of confidence the behavior of the fluid in such conditions.	diesel	F.

Certain materials with dominantly uniform pore sizes (e.g. coarse-grained materials) can exhibit ranges of constitutive function values within several orders ofmagnitude, possibly beyond the length of real numbers that computers can handle. Thus a numerical approximation of the Richards equation often requires the solution of systems of equations that cannot be solved on computer arithmetics. An appropriate domain decomposition into subdomains that cover only a limited range of constitutive function values, and that will change adaptively, reflecting the time progress of the model, will enable an effective and reliable solution of this problem. Parts of this problem have already been treated in our work Kuraz et al. (2014). This paper focuses on improving the performance of a nonlinear solver by locating the areas with abrupt changes in the solution. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Relaxation generally results in the shrinkage in a and the expansion of c. Relaxed BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI present indirect band gaps, whereas BiOF exhibits a direct or somewhat indirect band-gap feature corresponding to the relaxation and calculation with the Bi 5d states or not. The bottom of the conduction band is quite flat for relaxed BiOI, and apparently flat in BiOBr, and shows observable flatness in BiOCl as well when considering the Bi 5d states. The top of the valence band is rather even as well for some species. The obtained maximum gaps for relaxed BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI are 3.34, 2.92, 2.65, and 1.75 eV, respectively. The density peak of X np states in the valence band shifts toward the valence band maximum with the increasing X atomic number. The bandwidths, atomic charges, bond orders, and orbital density have also been investigated along with some optical properties.	anisotropy;bands;bi-directional text;birefringence;bromides;cell (microprocessor);covalent interaction;density functional theory;exhibits as topic;experiment;functional theories of grammar;large;lattice constant;linear programming relaxation;list of amd athlon x2 microprocessors;mrgprx2 gene;mathematical optimization;maxillary right canine prosthesis;molecular orbital;nlrx1 gene;nucleic acid hybridization;observable;pp (complexity);personality character;polyhedron;population;relaxation (approximation);small;whole earth 'lectronic link;bismuth oxybromide;orders - hl7publishingdomain;width	Wen Lai Huang	2009	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21191	atomic physics;chemistry;computational chemistry;density of states;density functional theory;condensed matter physics;physics;electronic structure;quantum mechanics;electronic band structure	Logic	96.70976720073524	-8.232047764599274	163185

It was found that the fluctuation of unsteady heat release due to the deformation of flame surface was significantly decreased as the equivalence ratio increased because of the change in interaction between inner vortical structures and flames. This phenomenon was another evidence of the amplification mechanism in the combustion instabilities due to the strong flame-vortex interactions under lean premixed conditions.Graphical AbstractGraphical Abstract text [IMAGE]	large eddy simulation;numerical method;vortex	C.-H.

GPE is a nonlinear Schrödinger equation which describes the order parameter of such systems at the mean field level. In the present work, we describe a Fortran 90 computer program developed by us, which solves the GPE using a basis set expansion technique. In this technique, the condensate wave function (order parameter) is expanded in terms of the solutions of the simpleharmonic oscillator (SHO) characterizing the atomic trap. Additionally, the same approach is also used to solve the problems in which the trap is weakly anharmonic, and the anharmonic potential can be expressed as a polynomial in the position operators x, y, and z. The resulting eigenvalue problem is solved iteratively using either the self-consistent-field (SCF) approach, or the imaginary time steepest-descent (SD) approach. Iterations can be initiated using either the simple-harmonic-oscillator ground state solution, or the Thomas–Fermi (TF) solution. It is found that for condensates containing up to a few hundred atoms, both approaches lead to rapid convergence. However, in the strong interaction limit of condensates containing thousands of atoms, it is the SD approach coupled with the TF starting orbitals, which leads to quick convergence. Our results for harmonic traps are also compared with those published by other authors using different numerical approaches, and excellent agreement is obtained. GPE is also solved for a few anharmonic potentials, and the influence of anharmonicity on the condensate is discussed. Additionally, the notion of Shannon entropy for the condensate wave function is defined and studied as a function of the number of particles in the trap. It is demonstrated numerically that the entropy increases with the particle number in a monotonic way.	algebraic riccati equation;basis set (chemistry);bose gas;computer program;crystal oscillator;entropy (information theory);fortran;gradient descent;ground state;imaginary time;iteration;list of code lyoko episodes;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;schrödinger;shannon (unit);thomas–fermi model;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Rakesh Prabhat Tiwari;Alok Shukla	2006	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2005.10.014	classical mechanics;harmonic analysis;bose–einstein condensate;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	95.45668029538173	1.5880684045883933	163587

9d784dd2d598ab89ab64baf4cd5aa34452f74f18	minimum dissipation principle in nonlinear transport	transport processes;nonequilibrium distribution function;nonequilibrium and irreversible thermodynamics	We extend Onsager’s minimum dissipation principle to stationary states that are only subject to local equilibrium constraints, even when the transport coefficients depend on the thermodynamic forces. Crucial to this generalization is a decomposition of the thermodynamic forces into those that are held fixed by the boundary conditions and the subspace that is orthogonal with respect to the metric defined by the transport coefficients. We are then able to apply Onsager and Machlup’s proof to the second set of forces. As an example, we consider two-dimensional nonlinear diffusion coupled to two reservoirs at different temperatures. Our extension differs from that of Bertini et al. in that we assume microscopic irreversibility, and we allow a nonlinear dependence of the fluxes on the forces.	boundary case;coefficient;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;nonlinear system;quantum field theory;shortest path problem;stationary process;steady state	Giorgio Sonnino;Jarah Evslin;Alberto Sonnino	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17117567	classical mechanics;statistical physics;thermodynamics;physics	ML	89.67665633868714	2.2540375472576546	163777

With the presence of a reflecting boundary, the precision depends on the atomic polarization, position and acceleration, which can be effectively enhanced compared to the case without boundary if we choose the appropriate conditions. In particular, with the presence of two parallel reflecting boundaries, we obtain the optimal precision for atomic parallel polarization and the special distance between two boundaries, as if the atom were shielded from the fluctuation.	atom;fall time;polarization (waves);propagation constant;quantum fluctuation;quantum metrology;universal conductance fluctuations	Ying Yang;Xiaobao Liu;Jieci Wang;Jiliang Jing	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-018-1815-z	acceleration;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum metrology;quantum;shielded cable;electromagnetic field;atom;polarization (waves)	HPC	92.09027078131325	-7.500620091002516	164745

The underlying quantum model for graphene is a massless Dirac equation, whose eigenvalues display a conical singularity responsible for non adiabatic transitions between the two modes. We first derive a kinetic model which takes the form of two Boltzmann equations coupled by a collision operator modeling the non-adiabatic transitions. This collision term includes a Landau-Zener transfer term and a jump operator whose presence is essential in order to ensure a good energy conservation during the transitions. We propose an algorithmic realization of the semi-group solving the kinetic model, by a particle method. We give analytic justification of the model and propose a series of numerical experiments studying the influences of the various sources of errors between the quantum and the kinetic models.	computation;experiment;graphene;landau–zener formula;mathematical model;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry	Clotilde Fermanian Kammerer;Florian Méhats	2016	J.

The nature of the low-lying excited states is discussed, and the results are compared with those from experiment and also with those of y-bases. Geometrical characteristics of the lowest excited singlet pipi* and npi* states were explored using the CIS method, and the effects of methanol solution and paring with their complementary natural bases on the relevant absorption and emission spectra of these modified bases were examined. The calculated excitation and emission energies agree well with the measured data, where experimental results are available. In methanol solution, the fluorescence from yy-A and yy-G would be expected to occur around 539 and 562 nm, respectively, suggesting that yy-A is a green-colored fluorophore, whereas yy-G is a yellow-colored fluorophore. The methanol solution was found to red-shift both the absorption and emission maxima of yy-A, yy-T, and yy-C, but blue-shift those for yy-G. Generally, though base pairing has no significant effects on the absorption and fluorescence maxima of yy-A, yy-C, and yy-T, it blue-shifts those for yy-G.

94ebdb6c650c1566a702df03d1d5ead43ed2823e	comparison of methods for deriving atomic charges from the electrostatic potential and moments	electrostatic potential	Four methods for deriving partial atomic charges from the Ž quantum chemical electrostatic potential CHELP, CHELPG, Merz-Kollman, and . RESP have been compared and critically evaluated. It is shown the charges strongly depend on how and where the potential points are selected. Two alternative methods are suggested to avoid the arbitrariness in the point-selection schemes and van der Waals exclusion radii: CHELP-BOW, which also estimates the charges from the electrostatic potential, but with potential points that are Boltzmann-weighted after their occurrence in actual simulations using the energy function of the program in which the charges will be used, and CHELMO, which estimates the charges directly from the electrostatic multipole moments. Different criteria for the quality of the charges are discussed. The CHELMO method gives the best multipole moments for small and medium-sized polar systems, whereas the CHELP-BOW charges reproduce best the total interaction energy in actual simulations. Among the standard methods, the Merz-Kollman charges give the best moments and potentials, but they show an appreciable dependence on the orientation of the molecule. We have also examined the recent warning that charges derived by a least-squares fit to the electrostatic potential normally are not statistically valid. It is shown that no rank-deficiency problems are encountered for molecules with up to 84 atoms if the least-squares fit is performed using pseudoinverses calculated by singular value decomposition and if constraints are treated by elimination.

Modified crystallization and agglomeration, which produce a less tenacious scale, retain this property for hours following treatment. It is considered to be a result of magnetically modified hydration and Lorentz force effects of magnetic devices. In treated water, as a complex solution/dispersion system, they affect the kinetics of processes at solution/solid interfaces. Which effect prevails depends on the treatment regime and water composition.		V. Kozic;L. C.

e622d7be9765390afd039d862195806e6e6c400a	monte carlo methods for radiative transfer with singular kernels		This work is devoted to Monte Carlo methods for radiative transfer equations with singular kernels, and is motivated by the study of wave propagation in random media with long-range dependence. As opposed to the short-range case where the collision cross section is integrable and leads to a nonzero mean free time, the cross section is not integrable in the long-range situation and yields a vanishing mean free time. For computational efficiency, particular care is then required in the construction of the stochastic processes used in the Monte Carlo methods. For this, we adapt a method of Asmussen--Rosinski and Cohen--Rosinski based on a small jumps/large jumps decomposition of the generator. We compare this method with another approach based on alpha-stable processes, and show the superiority of the first one. The jump distribution is simulated with an appropriate stochastic collocation method, and comparisons between the integrable and singular kernel cases are given.	monte carlo method;singular value decomposition	Christophe Gomez;Olivier Pinaud	2018	SIAM J.

The study includes formaldehyde, formyl radical (HCO), and CO adsorption and dissociation energy calculations on the surface, adsorbate vibrational frequency calculations, density of states analysis of clean and adsorbed surfaces, complete potential energy diagram construction from formaldehyde to atomic carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), simulation of formaldehyde adsorption and dissociation reaction on the surface using reactive force field, ReaxFF MD, and reaction rate calculations of adsorbates using transition state theory (TST). Formaldehyde and HCO were adsorbed most strongly at the hollow (fourfold) site. Adsorption energies ranged from -22.9 to -33.9 kcal/mol for formaldehyde, and from -44.3 to -66.3 kcal/mol for HCO, depending on adsorption sites and molecular direction. The dissociation energies were investigated for the dissociation paths: formaldehyde → HCO + H, HCO → H + CO, and CO → C + O, and the calculated energies were 11.0, 4.1, and 26.3 kcal/mol, respectively. ReaxFF MD simulation results were compared with experimental surface analysis using high resolution electron energy loss spectrometry (HREELS) and TST based reaction rates. ReaxFF simulation showed less reactivity than HREELS observation at 310 and 523 K. ReaxFF simulation showed more reactivity than the TST based rate for formaldehyde dissociation and less reactivity than TST based rate for HCO dissociation at 523 K. TST-based rates are consistent with HREELS observation.	auriculo-ventricular dissociation;duoxa1 gene;diagram;electron;energy, physics;fatigue;force field (chemistry);formaldehyde;health care organization;hydrogen;mole, unit of measurement;molecular dynamics;new foundations;oxygen;reaxff;simulation;spectrometry;ternary search tree;tuberculin test;walker-warburg congenital muscular dystrophy;kilocalorie	Takahiro Yamada;Donald K.

They operate in tandem with their surroundings. Pathway selection and traversal require coordinated work and heat exchanges along with parallel tuning of the system variables. Previous research by the author (Reference [1]) focused on the information expressed in thermodynamic pathways. Examined here is how spectral entropy is a by-product of information that depends intricately on the pathway structure. The spectral entropy has proven to be a valuable tool in diverse fields. This paper illustrates the contact between spectral entropy and the properties which distinguish ideal from non-ideal gases. The role of spectral entropy in the first and second laws of thermodynamics and heat → work conversions is also discussed.	gene regulatory network;parallel computing	Daniel J.

82cb901bb5e74dff4570fce5c09b7f3755461501	flexibility of hydrogen bond and lowering of symmetry in proton conductor	ionic conductor;hydrogen bonded compound;ferroelasticity;phase transition	In order to investigate why crystal symmetry lowers with increasing temperature by phase transition of TII–III (=369 K) in Cs3H(SeO4)2, in spite of the fact that crystal symmetry in the high-temperature phase of many ionic conductors becomes higher by the phase transition, we have studied the relation between the change in crystal symmetry and the appearance of proton motion. It was found from the analysis of domains based on crystal structure that the number of possible geometrical arrangement of hydrogen bond in phase II becomes two times larger than that in phase III, derived from the lowering of crystal symmetry with increasing temperature. These results indicate that the lowering of crystal symmetry in phase II appears by the increase of the number of geometrical arrangements and by the enhancement of the flexibility of hydrogen bond. Considering that the enhancement of the flexibility of hydrogen bond yields mobile proton in phase II, it is deduced that mobile proton in phase II appears in exchange for the lowering of crystal symmetry at II–III phase transition.	crystal structure;hydrogen;in-phase and quadrature components;ionic	Yukihiko Yoshida;Junko Hatori;Hinako Kawakami;Yasumitsu Matsuo;Seiichiro Ikehata	2012	Symmetry	10.3390/sym4030507	phase transition;ferroics;ferroelasticity;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics	AI	96.6542635541961	-6.339306432751689	167348

In the 1D steering experiment, localization and force exertion are interleaved. The device is initially localized on the right side (1) and steered to the center (2). Once arrived and localized at the desired position, the steering algorithm centers the imaging volume on the device position (3) in order to average out the forces. After the user defines a new target position, the device is steered to this point (4) and stabilized there (5). This experiment has been done in a viscous medium to reduce the device velocity explaining the long steering times. In another experiment not shown here, a steering sequence levitates the object in a viscous medium demonstrating that the method can create forces greater than gravitational force.	arrival - action;imaging system;velocity (software development);algorithm;physical hard work	Nils Nothnagel;Jürgen Rahmer;Bernhard Gleich;Aleksi Halkola;Thorsten M.

In addition, the reorganization energy, transfer integral, and carrier mobility were explored to measure the charge transport properties of these substituted corannulenes and sumanenes at different configurations for investigating the substituent effects. Our study is closely related to the experiment and previous theoretical investigation and provides a better understanding of the structure-property relationships for these substituted corannulenes and sumanenes.

The reactions in both the electronic ground and excited states are considered. The second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP) theory or the second-order multireference MP theory is used to evaluate the effect of the dynamical electron correlation on the free energy profiles. The free energy surface in the ground state shows a discrepancy with the experimental results for the related hydrogen-bonded complexes. To resolve this discrepancy, the effects of chloro-substitutions in phenol are examined, and its importance in stabilizing the ionic form is discussed. The temperature effect is also studied. In contrast to the ground state, the ππ* excited state of phenol-trimethylamine complex exhibits the proton transfer reaction with a low barrier. The reaction is almost thermoneutral. This is attributed to the reduction of proton affinity of phenol by the ππ* electronic excitation. We further examine the possibility of the electron-proton-coupled transfer in the ππ* state through the surface crossing with the charge transfer type πσ* state.

We use dimensional and asymptotic analysis to derive a reduced two-dimensional model and show that, to leading order, the filaments evolve in a plane, similar to what is experimentally observed.

Two dimensional and three dimensional models are considered demonstrating the very high sensitivity and field growth associated with these crystals. A major part of the paper deals with the development of realistic anisotropic periodic structures using a combination of layers constructed from thin film frequency selective surfaces, alumina, titanate and calcium vanadium garnet (CVG) materials. Measurements for antenna applications demonstrate and validate the theoretical performance of the MPC and DBE crystals. The latter part of the paper will present an exciting and promising development relating to microwave circuit applications. Specifically, a novel dual-line printed circuit is presented to emulate propagation in anisotropic media. As such, the MPC and DBE phenomena can be realized using very simple printed circuits (coupled lines).

Observing these changes in computer simulations is difficult if their timescales are long. These calculations can be accelerated by observing the transition on an auxiliary free energy surface with a simpler Hamiltonian and connecting this free energy surface to the target free energy surface with free energy calculations. Here, we show that the free energy legs of the cycle can be replaced with energy representation (ER) density functional approximations. We compute: (1) The conformational free energy changes for alanine dipeptide transitioning from the right-handed free energy basin to the left-handed basin and (2) the free energy difference between the open and closed conformations of β-cyclodextrin, a """"host"""" molecule that serves as a model for molecular recognition in host-guest binding. β-cyclodextrin contains 147 atoms compared to 22 atoms for alanine dipeptide, making β-cyclodextrin a large molecule for which to compute solvation free energies by free energy perturbation or integration methods and the largest system for which the ER method has been compared to exact free energy methods. The ER method replaced the 28 simulations to compute each coupling free energy with two endpoint simulations, reducing the computational time for the alanine dipeptide calculation by about 70% and for the β-cyclodextrin by > 95%. The method works even when the distribution of conformations on the auxiliary free energy surface differs substantially from that on the target free energy surface, although some degree of overlap between the two surfaces is required. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."""	alanine;approximation;communication endpoint;computation (action);computer simulation;density functional theory;dipeptides;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;energy, physics;erdős–rényi model;free energy perturbation;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);john d. wiley;largest;ligands;thermodynamics;time complexity;water model	Robert C.

The convergence of the vortex method for twoand three-dimensional inviscid incompressible fluid flows was first proved by Hald [13], Beale and Majda [2, 3]. Then Anderson and Greengard [1] gave a simpler proof for the estimate of the consistency error. When the effect of viscosity is involved, the vortex method is replaced by the so-called random vortex method by adding a Brownian motion to every vortex. The convergence analysis of the random vortex method for the Navier-Stokes equation has been given by [11, 19, 20, 23] in 1980s. Generally speaking, there are two ways to set up the initial data. On one hand, some authors like Marchioro and Pulvirenti [20], Osada [23], Goodman [11] and [17] took the initial positions as independent identically distributed random variables Xi(0) with common density ρ0(x). Specifically, Goodman proved a rate of convergence for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in two dimensions of the order N−1/4 lnN , where N is the number of vortices used in the computation. However, this Monte Carlo sampling method is very inefficient in the computation. On the other hand, Chorin’s original method assumed that initial positions of the vortices are on the lattice points hi ∈ R with mass ρ0(hi)h. In particular, Long [19] achieved an almost optimal rate of convergence of the order N−1/2 lnN ∼ h| lnh| except an event of probability h ′C ; much of his technique will be adapted to this article. A similar probabilistic approach has been used on the Vlasov-Poisson system by [5]. Finally, we refer to the book [7] for theoretical and practical use of the vortex methods, and also refer to [8] for recent progress on a blob method for the aggregation equation.	brownian motion;computation;monte carlo method;navier–stokes equations;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);vortex	Hui Huang;Jian-Guo Liu	2017	Math.

Previously a uniform charging method was shown to reduce the grid dependence substantially over the point charge model used in commercially available codes. In this article we demonstrate that smoothing the charge and dielectric values on the grid can improve the grid independence, as measured by the spread of calculated values, by another order of magnitude. Calculations of Born ion solvation energies, small molecule solvation energies, the electrostatic field of superoxide dismutase, and protein-protein binding energies are used to demonstrate that this method yields the same results as the point charge model while reducing the positional errors by several orders of magnitude. © 1997 by John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.	finite difference;poisson–boltzmann equation;smoothing;spatial anti-aliasing	Robert E.

The system is composed of a Release Module and a Near Field Module, linked together with necessary databases through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI allows the user to sketch a platform–pipeline layout, enter characteristic parameters, and run a quasi-3-phase flow model to estimate the volume of potential or actual leaks. Inputs to the model are parameters describing the configuration and characteristics of a pipeline system, the fluid it contains, and the leak or break from which the discharge occurs. Key outputs are the evolution of the release rate over time, the total mass of oil released, and the mean thickness of any eventual surface slick being formed. Test applications of the software are described. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

ccbaeb8b9cd9dc72a9f1ba2a3bb0c36d7518eeb4	a space-averaged model for hollow fibre membranes filters	hollow fibre;waste water treatment;flow in porous media;modeling	We present a space independent model to describe the filtration process taking place in a hollow fibre membrane filter. This method is based on averaging a full three-dimensional model made by a system of PDEs describing the hydrodynamic process coupled with transport, adsorption and attachment equations. Few crucial assumptions are needed to guarantee the physical coherence of the model, but a practical way to check the fulfilment of these constraints is provided, so that one can quickly verify the applicability of the model. This work has been tested in the framework of a collaboration project with a manufacturing company to provide an optimization of both product and process. To this purpose, a program was written in  Python  programming language, implementing both the calibration and the forward simulation part, in order to be used by the membranes manufactures for obtaining information on the filter efficiency.

The model includes the nucleation and crystal growth processes and their dependence on the temperature field by means of linearized Arrhenius expressions for the kinetics of these processes, and temperature thresholds that result in partial differential equations for the temperature field and local degree of crystallinity. It is shown that there are three crystallization regimes depending on the temperatures of the boundaries, and that the focusing regime results in the fastest crystallization. It is also shown that, in rectangular polymer samples, complete crystallization first occurs along the shortest dimension of the domain, and then proceeds in an almost one-dimensional fashion along the longest direction with temperature fields which are smooth and a local degree of crystallinity that it is continuous but not smooth. However, inclusion of the random motion of nuclei through a diffusion process indicates that the local degree of crystallinity is smooth, and complete crystallization is only observed for sufficiently small diffusion coefficients; larger diffusion coefficients result in partial crystallization of the polymer sample. It is also shown that cross-diffusion terms have a very small influence on the total mass of crystals, at least, for the conditions considered here, and that non-crystallized material may be trapped in the middle of the polymer sample. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Due to a rapid down scaling of transistor dimensions, with the 90 nm technology node being already industrially implemented, quantum effects becomes more pronounced, and the question of going beyond the semiclassical approach becomes increasingly relevant. An attractive approach which accounts for the quantum effects explicitely is based on the equation for the Wigner function. Similarly to the classical distribution function, the Wigner function depends on position and momentum simultaneously. Another attractive feature of the Wigner function approach is that the Boltzmann scattering integral may naturally be included to account for dissipative processes. It allows to treat semiclassical collisions on equal footing with the quantum mechanical interference effects, described by the quantum collision operator. The question, however, rises as to whether the use of the classical Boltzmann scattering operator in the Wigner equation is justified. It is well known that the Boltzmann scattering integral neglects several quantum mechanical effects such as collisional broadening due to the finite lifetime of single particle states, collisional retardation due to the finite collision time, and intra-collisional field effects. To incorporate quantum effects due to the finiteness of the scattering duration we adopt the aforementioned quantum kinetic equation approach.

158c8e3359cd6d2ff91f285a16066c86330f0734	mcdp: an advanced tool to simulate comb-like polymers		A strategy to study polymeric systems with ordered structures, and in particular comb-like polymers, is presented. These are dense systems for which atomistic simulations with conventional methods are difficult or even impracticable. The strategy, which has been incorporated into a computer program named MCDP, is based on a Configuration Bias Monte Carlo algorithm and a method to investigate the structure of crystalline polymers using force-field calculations. To obtain a maximum efficiency, the MCDP computer program has been optimized and parallelized. The ability of MCDP to investigate ordered polymers have been tested by simulating two complex systems: (1) the crystal structure of poly(4-methyl-1-pentene), and (2) the biphasic structure of poly(α-octyl-β-L-aspartate), a comb-like polyamide derived from β-amino acids. The results obtained from MCDP simulations demonstrates the efficiency and reliability of this method to study both the NVT and NPT behavior of ordered dense polymers. c © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In most cases, such configurations are obtained by using strong magnetic fields. Several models exist for describing the evolution of a strongly magnetized plasma, e.g., guiding-center approximation and the finite Larmor radius regime. The topic of this paper concerns a different approach leading to plasma confinement. More precisely, we are interested in mathematical models with fast oscillating magnetic fields. We provide rigorous derivations for this kind of model and analyze their properties.	approximation;mathematical model;plasma active	Mihai Bostan	2012	SIAM J. Math.

In this work, the statistical thermodynamic apparatus for predicting the efficiency of DNA hairpin-based computers is validated experimentally. The model system employed is a simple competitive folding system, formed by two competing hairpin structures (sub-optimal vs. optimal), with the intent of testing the ability to predict the efficiency of target structure formation in the presence of a non-target structure. System behavior was characterized via a set of fluorescence measurement experiments, to directly determine the fractional occupancy of target structures versus temperature. Predicted and experimental behaviors are compared for both the melting of each of the two isolated hairpin structures (control), and the efficiency of the competitive composite system. Results indicate that the applied equilibrium model provides predictions which consistently agree with experimental results, supporting design for the control and programming of DNA-based systems.	autonomous robot;computer	Ken Komiya;Satsuki Yaegashi;Masami Hagiya;Akira Suyama;John A.

A pseudo-arclength continuation method (PACM) is employed to compute the ground state and excited state solutions of spin-1 BoseEinstein condensates (BEC). The BEC is governed by the time-independent coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE) under the conservations of the mass and magnetization. The coupling constants that characterize the spin-independent and spin-exchange interactions are chosen as the continuation parameters. The continuation curve starts from a state obtained from a ground state or an excited state that has very small coupling parameters. The proposed numerical schemes allow us to investigate the effect of the coupling constants and study the bifurcation diagrams of the time-independent coupled GPE. Numerical results on the wave functions and their corresponding energies of spin-1 BEC with repulsive/attractive and ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interactions are presented. Furthermore, we reveal that the component separation and population transfer between the different hyperfine states can only occur in excited states due to the spin-exchange interactions.	antiferromagnetism;battery eliminator circuit;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;coupling constant;epr paradox;excited state;ground state;interaction;numerical analysis;numerical continuation	Jen-Hao Chen;I-Liang Chern;Weichung Wang	2011	J.

It is also a necessary means to improve pipeline network, optimize the operation and management of pipe network, and ensure the safety of gas supply. In this paper, based on the model of hydraulic calculation and the finite element nodal method, the research on the hydraulic simulation of branch pipeline network and loop pipe network with multi gas sources is carried out. It applies to pipelines of different materials and different pressures. At the same time, the influence of frictional resistance coefficient on the convergence of hydraulic calculation in gas pipeline network is deeply studied, the reasons of poor convergence in the small flow or some pipeline with large diameter are analyzed, the solution is proposed and the hydraulic simulation in gas pipeline network is studied. The simulation experiment shows that the simulation results are consistent with the actual measured data under certain precision. It can effectively solve the poor convergence in the course of hydraulic calculation.	coefficient;finite element method;pipeline (computing);program optimization;simulation	Lei Xiao;Kejiang Liu;Xincai Zhuang	2017	22017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)	10.1109/CSE-EUC.2017.117	finite element method;control engineering;simulation;distributed computing;computer science;hydraulic machinery;convergence (routing);pipeline transport	Robotics	89.9244139107683	-2.445035462293342	172761

However, in some cases, it cannot determine accurately the position of the hydrogen. To investigate the origins of this difficulty, the SE structures of several molecules containing either the OH or the CH3 group are determined and compared to their best ab initio counterparts. It appears that an important factor is the accuracy of the geometry used to calculate the force field, in particular when the least-squares system is not well conditioned. In this case, the mixed regression method is often an easy way to circumvent this difficulty.	cubic function;force field (chemistry);ground state;hydrogen;least squares;national origin	Natalja Vogt;Jean Demaison;Jürgen Vogt;Heinz Dieter Rudolph	2014	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23758	stereochemistry;chemistry;computational chemistry;ethanol fuel	ML	97.46098782677572	-4.093300654424613	173169

Furthermore, these recommended methods with the relatively small 6-31+G(d,p) basis set may also be used to perform direct classical trajectory simulations to uncover the dynamic behaviors of the S(N)2 reactions at N center.	basis set (chemistry);behavior;benchmark (computing);blood urea nitrogen measurement;density functional theory;energy, physics;hybrid functional;møller–plesset perturbation theory;simulation;chorioallantoic membrane;mecarzole	Feng Yu	2012	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.22963	chemistry;computational chemistry;density functional theory;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	97.1769141191484	-4.83376209252193	173219
bf7f62e0e532255b79b287fcb2758ade3b65e497	numerical simulation of destruction processes by the grid-characteristic method		Abstract Destruction is occurred in wide variety of applied problems: collisions, dynamic load of materials, seismic influence on ground facilities, railway defects, etc. Nowadays, there are a lot of different mechanical models that describe the destruction process. In addition to the failure criteria, it is important to take into account correctly the changes in rheology of destroyed material. Due to these reasons, it is important to have the ability to simulate the process of destruction of arbitrary material. In this paper, the method for simulation is proposed. It is based on the numerical solution of govern system of elastic equations by the grid-characteristic method. After each step of elastic scheme, special corrector was applied to each damaged nodes of numerical grid to describe correctly dynamic behavior of fractured material. To illustrate the application of proposed technique, a set of problems was solved. The problem of collision between the metal hammer and glass plate was successfully solved in 2D and 3D cases. The developed software allows to analyze not only static image of fractured material but to calculate full stress tensor in a sequence moments of time. The extension of this approach may significantly extend the area of application of numerical simulation.

During the extraction process, the aqueous phase pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide. In additional to the formation of the transition metal-extractant reversed micelles, sodium-bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (NaDEHP) reversed micelles can also form. According to the classical model of reversed micelles, water molecules act as promoters for the formation of reversed micelles. Water molecules act as ‘‘gluing’’ agents for micellization in apolar media. Here we report a unique finding about the role of water molecules in reversed micellar aggregates using molecular modeling. The molecular modeling of the reversed micellar system of NaDEHP in n-heptane clearly shows that water molecules can act as an ‘‘antimicellization’’ agent. Water molecules have no gluing effect on the formation of NaDEHP reversed micelles. In fact, large NaDEHP reversed micelles are formed in ‘‘dry’’ conditions. & 2010 The Franklin Institute.

The flow configuration considered is a corner flow with sidewall surface mass injection into a horizontal boundary-layer flow. The equations for the velocity fluctuations are cast into a spectral Lorenz-type format and incorporated into the overall computational procedure for the three-dimensional flow. The non-linear time-dependent solutions of the spectral equations predict deterministic spectral ordered structures within spiral structures. Spectral analysis of these fluctuating solutions yields the resulting entropy generation rates resulting from the dissipation of the ordered structures. The results for the entropy generation rates indicate the prediction of a strong burst of ordered structures within the range of injection velocities studied. This new computational method is applicable to only selected thermal design processes.	apache axis;computation;embedded system;first-order predicate;mass effect trilogy;multiphase particle-in-cell method;nonlinear system;spectral density;spectral method;spectrum analyzer;steady state;time complexity;time series;velocity (software development)	LaVar King Isaacson	2016	Entropy	10.3390/e18020047	classical mechanics;combinatorics;mathematics;thermodynamics	Vision	89.52531993121116	2.9020684657993843	173832

Ions in the fluid are allowed to precipitate onto the grains, while minerals in the grains are allowed to dissolve into the fluid, taking into account the possible change in the aperture of the strip that these two processes cause. Temperature variations and possible effects of the temperature in both fluid density and viscosity and in the mineral precipitation and dissolution reactions are included. For the pore scale model equations, we investigate the limit as the width of the strip approaches zero, deriving one-dimensional effective equations. We assume that the convection is dominating over diffusion in the system, resulting in Taylor dispersion in the upscaled equations and a Forchheimer-type term in Darcy’s law. Some numerical results where we compare the upscaled model with three simpler versions are presented: two still honoring the changing aperture of the strip but not including Taylor dispersion, and one where the aperture of the strip is fixed but contains dispersive terms.	dispersive partial differential equation;interaction;numerical analysis;probability of precipitation;the void (virtual reality)	Carina Bringedal;Inga Berre;Iuliu Sorin Pop;Florin A.

This process requires large Rabi frequencies, which is an undesirable in many experimental applications. To overcome this problem transitionless (superadiabatic) STIRAP was proposed. In this paper we study the role of superadiabatic STIRAP in two examples, population transfer and quantum rotation gates. The effect of dephasing was also investigated by computing the fidelity. We have shown that the damping of the excited state has a little effect but the dephasing of the ground state leads to imperfect population transfer and imperfect rotation gates.

Geometric optimizations using the Hartree–Fock and the B3LYP density functional theory methods with the large 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set were performed to determine the structures and charge distributions of two halogenated anesthetics, 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (halothane) and fluoromethyl-2,2,2,-trifluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl) ethyl ether (sevoflurane). The calculated bond lengths and angles are within 3% of the corresponding experimental values reported for the similar molecular groups. Charges are assigned using the Mulliken population analysis and the electrostatic potential (ESP) based on the Merz–Kollman–Singh scheme. The atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory is also used to assign the charges in halothane. The dipole moments calculated with the Mulliken population analysis and ESP for the structures optimized by B3LYP/6-311+(2d,p) were respectively 1.355 and 1.430 D for halothane and 2.255 and 2.315 D for sevoflurane. These are in excellent agreement with the experimental values of 1.41 and 2.33 D for halothane and sevoflurane, respectively. The calculated structures and partial charge distributions can be readily parameterized for molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations involving these halogenated agents. © 2001 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.

While in the ‘thick film regime’, i.e. when the film consists of many layers of atoms, we recover the well known plate theory derived from 3d-elasticity in [11], for ‘thin films’ new terms in the limit functional are obtained. These terms are due to the discrete nature of atomic models and surface effects, and cannot be detected from continuum elasticity.

5acabcdf5b175d81809067d557862dda8ab21c6f	laminar mixed convection in two concentric vertical cylinders		The flow patterns and heat transfer have been studied numerically for contained air in the space formed by two vertical concentric cylinders. The inner cylinder rotates about its vertical axis and the outer cylinder is kept stationary. This geometry simulates, for example, the gaps at the ends of the rotor of vertical electric motors. The results facilitate the thermal design of such devices. The governing equations for velocity and temperature are solved by finite volume techniques in which the SIMPLE algorithm is incorporated. Results are presented for a range of Reynolds numbers (Re) and for various values of aspect ratio. It has been found that for high values of Re, the flow is dominated by centrifugal forces whereas for low values of Re the flow is dominated by gravitational buoyancy. To facilitate the use of results for design, some correlations were developed which represent the heat transfer coefficient as a continuous function of the investigated independents parameters.

Ultrasound incorporating microbubbles has been applied to enhance drug delivery into these tissues, but the effects of a streaming flow by microbubble oscillation on drug perfusion have not been elucidated. In order to clarify the physical effects of steady streaming on drug delivery, an experimental study on dye perfusion into a tissue model was performed using microbubbles excited by acoustic waves. The surface concentration and penetration length of the drug were increased by 12% and 13%, respectively, with streaming flow. The mass of dye perfused into a tissue phantom for 30s was increased by about 20% in the phantom with oscillating bubbles. A computational model that considers fluid structure interaction for streaming flow fields induced by oscillating bubbles was developed, and mass transfer of the drug into the porous tissue model was analyzed. The computed flow fields agreed with the theoretical solutions, and the dye concentration distribution in the tissue agreed well with the experimental data. The computational results showed that steady streaming with a streaming velocity of a few millimeters per second promotes mass transfer into a tissue.	acoustic cryptanalysis;body tissue;computation;computational model;drug delivery systems;dyes;experiment;gastric balloon;imaging phantom;mandibular right first molar;microbubbles;millimeter per second;phantoms, imaging;solutions;sound waves;streaming algorithm;streaming media;velocity (software development)	Jin Sun Oh;Yong Seok Kwon;Kyung Ho Lee;Woowon Jeong;Sang Kug Chung;Kyehan Rhee	2014	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.10.020	acoustic wave;surgery	Comp.	96.93922561403348	1.6510676303774974	175114

The method is based on the assumption that the molecule may be represented as a tree of rigid bodies without cyclic elements in it. Fixed proline rings seem to be an important limitation for the procedure. Since flexible pyrrolidine rings not only add cycles to the tree, but also result in variable valence angles, the following is done: (i) the structure of the tree and the summation procedure for recurrent equations are modified to adopt variable angles; (ii) a computational scheme is described which takes cyclic structures into account in evaluating the first and second derivatives of the energy; and (iii) the problem of ring closure is considered for a five-membered ring, and equations are derived for rapidly calculating the first and second derivatives of the dependent ring angles with respect to the independent variables. The approach proposed can also be applied to molecules with pentagonal and hexagonal sugar rings.		R. A. Abagyan;A. K.

For the simulated tempering (ST) in particular–useful due to its generality and conceptual simplicity–the latter aspect (closely related to the actual   R     R       ) may be a key issue in problems displaying metastability and trapping in certain regions of the phase space. To determine   T R        T    R         ’s leading to accurate thermodynamics estimates and still trying to minimize the simulation computational time, here a fixed exchange frequency scheme is considered for the ST. From the temperature of interest   T 1        T    1         , successive   T     T       ’s are chosen so that the exchange frequency between any adjacent pair   T r        T    r          and   T r+1        T    r  +  1          has a same value   f     f       . By varying the   f     f       ’s and analyzing the   T R        T    R         ’s through relatively inexpensive tests (e.g., time decay towards the steady regime), an optimal situation in which the simulations visit much faster and more uniformly the relevant portions of the phase space is determined. As illustrations, the proposal is applied to three lattice models, BEG, Bell–Lavis, and Potts, in the hard case of extreme first-order phase transitions, always giving very good results, even for   R=3     R  =  3       . Also, comparisons with other protocols (constant entropy and arithmetic progression) to choose the set   T R        T    R          are undertaken. The fixed exchange frequency method is found to be consistently superior, specially for small   R     R       ’s. Finally, distinct instances where the prescription could be helpful (in second-order transitions and for the parallel tempering approach) are briefly discussed.		A. Valentim;Marcos G.

Electrical lysis is the complete disintegration of cell membranes, due to a critical level of electric fields applied for a critical duration on a biological cell. Generating an electric field inside a microchannel of a microfluidic device has many advantages, including the efficient utilization of energy and low-current requirement. An ideal microchannel model was compared with a practical microchannel model using a finite element analysis tool that suggests that the overestimation error can be over 10%, from 2.5 mm or smaller, in the length of a microchannel. Two analytical forms are proposed to reduce this overestimation error. Experimental results showed that the high electric field is confined only inside the microchannel that is in agreement with the simulation results. Single cell electrical lysis was conducted with a fabricated microfluidic device. An average of 800 V for seven seconds across an 8 mm-long microchannel with the dimension of 100 μm × 20 μm was required for lysis, with electric fields exceeding 100 kV/m and consuming 300 mW.	altered level of consciousness;approximation;downstream (software development);electrical engineering;finite element method;internationalization and localization;joule;nonlinear system;refinement (computing);simulation;the magical number seven, plus or minus two;vortex	Bashir I.

The behavior of these polymer constituents determines the performance, such as functionality and reliability, of the final products. Therefore, the successful development of microelectronics depends on, to some extent, the optimal design and processing of polymer materials. Due to the development trends of microelectronics, characterized mainly by ongoing miniaturization down to the nano scale, technology and functionality integration, eco-designing, shorter-time-to-market, development and application of polymers become one of the bottlenecks for microelectronic industry. Aiming at optimizing the product/process development, we have been spending a lot of effort to understand and design polymer behavior in microelectronics, such as material pre-selection, processing, characterization and modeling.

The aim of the work is to derive numerical time-stepping methods that generate samples exactly from the desired target temperature distribution. The numerical methods proposed in this paper rely on the well-known splitting of stochastic thermostat equations into a conservative and a fluctuation-dissipation. We propose a methodology to derive numerical approximation to the fluctuation-dissipation part that exactly samples from the underlying Boltzmann distribution. Our methodology applies to Langevin dynamics as well as Dissipative Particle Dynamics and, more generally, to arbitrary position dependent fluctuation-dissipation terms. A Metropolis criterion is introduced to correct for numerical inconsistency in the conservative dynamics part of the model. Shadow energies are used to increase the acceptance rate under the Metropolis criterion. We call the newly proposed method meso-GSHMC.	approximation;dissipative particle dynamics;mesoscopic physics;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;numerical method;quantum fluctuation;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stepping level;whole earth 'lectronic link	Elena V.

ed11f0316b205743eaf13b2b54cf0a838a8771f0	molecular characterization of the adsorptive properties of extended graphene towards polyaromatic compounds of environmental interest: chrysene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[b]fluoranthene		The geometry, electronic properties and energy of the complexes formed between an extended graphene and poly16 cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,PAHs, were investigated at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level. We have studied the 17 interaction of benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, benzo[a]anthracene and benzo[b]fluoranthene with graphene models of dimensions of 18 15 Å × 15 Å and 20 Å × 20 Å. These calculations were performed within the generalized gradient approximation GGA using 19 the HCTH functional and the numerical DNP basis set. According to the results, the HCTH/DNP methodology can qualitatively 20 describe attractive interactions occurring between the weakly-polar systems, verifying the formation of molecular complexes 21 stabilized by Keesom or Debye forces. The interaction dipole moments and polarizabilities indicate that the interaction of per22 manent dipoles and induced dipoles are responsible for the complex formation in weakly polar PAHs. These results are useful 23 to understand the processes of adsorption of PAHs by graphene. 24	approximation;basis set (chemistry);dnp3;density functional theory;gradient;graphene;interaction;numerical analysis	Vianeis de J.

The S(0)/S(1) and S(1)/T(1) intersection points were determined by the state-average CASSCF method. Two main reaction pathways, which are possible to the photodissociation, have been studied. It has been found that the mechanism is stepwise, and belongs to Norrish type-I reaction. The n --> pi* excitation leads to the first excited singlet state, followed by the intersystem crossing from S(1) to T(1). On the T(1) potential energy surface, the system can dissociate adiabatically to CH(3)(x) +COCH(2)OH( x) and CH(3)CO(x)+CH(2)OH(x). The COCH(2)OH(x) and CH(3)CO(x) radicals can further dissociate into CO, OH, and other fragments. Our calculated results are in good agreement with recent experimental results.	emoticon;excitation;gradient;hydroxyl radical;intersection of set of elements;intersystem crossing;multi-configurational self-consistent field;potential energy surface;singlet state;stepwise regression;telling untruths;acetol	Yong Wu;Daiqian Xie;Ying Xue	2003	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.10264	photochemistry;chemistry;computational chemistry;intersystem crossing;photodissociation	NLP	97.29969449693915	-5.892903202015329	176337

In this framework, we characterize the stochastic process that governs the positions of the particle. The key tool is the reduction of the process to a Skew Brownian motion (SBM). In a zone where the coefficients are locally constant on each side of the discontinuity, the new position of the particle after a constant time step is sampled from the exact distribution of the SBM process at the considered time. To do so, we propose two different but equivalent algorithms: a two-steps simulation with a stop at the discontinuity and a one-step direct simulation of the SBM dynamic.

It can be simulated by an equivalent Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model of the board-level package, in which detailed layer structure of the Print Circuit Board (PCB), signal wires and through-holes were ignored. For this purpose, it is necessary to obtain the equivalent material properties of the board-level package. In this work, a laser-based interferometric technique was used to measure the modal parameters of the board-level package. By fitting the FEA results with the experimental results, we can obtain equivalent material properties of the board-level package by means of the Taguchi method. Four control factors (Young’s modulus in the x and y direction, mass density and shear modulus in the xy plane) at three levels are explored and assigned to the columns of a L9(3) saturated orthogonal array. The so obtained equivalent parameters provided the best fit between the FEA results and the experimental observations. Crown Copyright 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

c55db1e71253bc595b52bf56a5d88c5f92448e35	blue shifts of the c-h stretching vibrations in hydrogen-bonded and protonated trimethylamine. effect of hyperconjugation on bond properties	hydrogen bond;blue shifts;trimethylamine;hyperconjugation;trimethylamine phenols complexes;protonated trimethylamine;dft calculations	The optimized geometry of isolated trimethylamine (TMA), its hydrogen bond complexes with phenol derivatives and protonated TMA is calculated at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis on these systems is carried out at the same level of theory. In isolated TMA, one of the C-H bond in each of the three CH(3) groups is more elongated than the two other ones. As revealed by the NBO data, this results from a hyperconjugative interaction from the N lone pair to the sigma*(C-H) orbitals of the C-H bonds being in a transoid position with respect to the N lone pair. The formation of an intermolecular OH...N hydrogen bond with phenols results in a decrease of the lone pair effect. A linear correlation is found between the decrease in occupation of the sigma*(C-H) orbitals and the decrease in the hyperconjugative interaction energy in the complexes and isolated TMA. Complex formation with phenols results in a blue shift of 55-74 cm(-1) of the C-H stretching vibrations involved in the lone pair effect. Smaller blue shifts between 14 and 23 cm(-1) are predicted for the other C-H bonds. In these complexes, a linear correlation is found between the frequency shifts and the elongation of the C-H bonds. Protonation of TMA results in a nearly equalization of all the C-H distances and a blue shift of 180 cm(-1) of the C-H bonds involved in hyperconjugation with the N lone pair.	5-trimethoxyamphetamine;chronic multifocal osteomyelitis;distance;endianness;hydrogen bonding;hydroxyl radical;interaction energy;molecular orbital;phenols;thrombotic microangiopathies;tower mounted amplifier;vibration - physical agent;newton;trimethylamine	Asit K.

The GB models involve two main types of approximations relative to the Poisson equation (PE) theory on which they are based. First, the self-energy contributions of individual atoms are estimated and expressed as """"effective Born radii."""" Next, the atom-pair contributions are estimated by an analytical function f(GB) that depends upon the effective Born radii and interatomic distance of the atom pairs. Here, the relative impacts of these approximations are investigated by calculating """"perfect"""" effective Born radii from PE theory, and enquiring as to how well the atom-pairwise energy terms from a GB model using these perfect radii in the standard f(GB) function duplicate the equivalent terms from PE theory. In tests on several biological macromolecules, the use of these perfect radii greatly increases the accuracy of the atom-pair terms; that is, the standard form of f(GB) performs quite well. The remaining small error has a systematic and a random component. The latter cannot be removed without significantly increasing the complexity of the GB model, but an alternative choice of f(GB) can reduce the systematic part. A molecular dynamics simulation using a perfect-radii GB model compares favorably with simulations using conventional GB, even though the radii remain fixed in the former. These results quantify, for the GB field, the importance of getting the effective Born radii right; indeed, with perfect radii, the GB model gives a very good approximation to the underlying PE theory for a variety of biomacromolecular types and conformations."""	approximation;epilepsy, generalized;equation:equ:pt:gestational age estimation formula:nar;implicit solvation;molecular dynamics;simulation	Alexey Onufriev;David A.

aec93db7568cdffa8a960b4b93cffeaacfc39e30	a reduced-order electrochemical model of li-ion batteries for control and estimation applications		In this paper, a reduced-order electrochemical model of lithium-ion batteries is developed for control and estimation applications through analytical model order reduction based on a Galerkin projection method. The governing diffusion partial differential equations in the liquid and solid phases are approximated into low-order systems of ordinary differential equations while the physical meaning of all model parameters is preserved, allowing one to perform state and parameter estimation. The selection of basis functions for the Galerkin projection method and model order truncation is carefully determined based on analysis both in the frequency and time domains. With the reduced-order diffusion models in the liquid and solid phases, an extended single particle model incorporating the electrolyte dynamics is developed. The model is then validated against the experimental data gathered from two batteries with different chemistries (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide/graphite and lithium iron phosphate oxide/graphite) at different input conditions. Results show that the reduced-order model agrees very well with experimental data at various conditions. Meanwhile, it can be simulated thousands of times faster than the real time, making it suitable for long-term-life simulation, control, and estimation applications.	approximation algorithm;basis function;cobalt;estimation theory;galerkin method;graphite;model order reduction;projection method (fluid dynamics);simulation;truncation	Guodong Fan;Xiaoyu Li;Marcello Canova	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2738780	electronic engineering;computational chemistry;model order reduction;projection method;experimental data;simulation;computer science;ordinary differential equation;lithium iron phosphate;partial differential equation;lithium;galerkin method	Visualization	91.96678972320029	-2.8528755775607233	176787

Oxime K203 seems to be one of the promising reactivators for tabun-inhibited AChE than (K027, K127, and K628). These reactivators differ only in the linker units between the two pyridinium rings. The conformational analyses performed with quantum chemical RHF/6-31G* level for K027, K127, K203 and K628 showed that the minimum energy conformers have different orientations of the active and peripheral pyridinium rings for these reactivator molecules. K203 with (-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-) linker unit possesses more open conformation compared to the other reactivators. Such orientation of K203 experiences favorable interaction with the surrounding residues of catalytic anionic site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of tabun-inhibited AChE. From the steered molecular dynamics simulations, it has been observed that the oxygen atom of the oxime group of K203 reactivator approaches nearest to the P-atom of the SUN203 (3.75 Å) at lower time scales (less than ~1000 ps) as compared to the other reactivators. K203 experiences less number of hydrophobic interaction with the PAS residues which is suggested to be an important factor for the efficient reactivation process. In addition, K203 crates large number of H-bonding with CAS residues SUN203, Phe295, Tyr337, Phe338 and His447. K203 barely changes its conformation during the SMD simulation process and hence the energy penalty to adopt any other conformation is minimal in this case as compared to the other reactivators. The molecular mechanics and Poisson-Boltzmann surface area binding energies obtained for the interaction of K203 inside the gorge of tabun inhibited AChE is substantially higher (-290.2 kcal/mol) than the corresponding K628 reactivator (-260.4 kcal/mol), which also possess unsaturated aromatic linker unit.	aromatics;aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylases;boat dock;ch c/c++ interpreter;computational linguistics;duoxa1 gene;docking (molecular);energy, physics;experience;gauche;interaction;job control (unix);kank2 gene;linker (computing);mandibular right second molar tooth;markov switching multifractal;molecular dynamics;molecular mechanics;muscle rigidity;novobiocin;organophosphates;organophosphorus compounds;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;oximes;oxygen;peripheral neuropathy;phosphorus;poisson–boltzmann equation;pyschological bonding;reactivation;ring device;science;service mapping description;simulation;storage module device;surface-mount technology;technetium tc 99m exametazime;user-generated content;erythromycin oxime;kilocalorie;kilojoule (kj);phenyl;tabun	Shibaji Ghosh;Nellore Bhanu Chandar;Kalyanashis Jana;Bishwajit Ganguly	2017	Journal of computer-aided molecular design	10.1007/s10822-017-0036-3	tabun;pyridinium;hydrophobic effect;chemistry;molecule;conformational isomerism;oxime;acetylcholinesterase;organic chemistry	Visualization	96.45744004873515	-6.806285713015602	177803
5caf4030a80bdf9f8701f2e8411afe1b780c2106	dynamically active compartments coupled by a stochastically gated gap junction	gap junctions;piecewise deterministic pdes;diffusion;channel permeability	We analyze a one-dimensional PDE-ODE system representing the diffusion of signaling molecules between two cells coupled by a stochastically gated gap junction. We assume that signaling molecules diffuse within the cytoplasm of each cell and then either bind to some active region of the cell’s membrane (treated as a well-mixed compartment) or pass through the gap junction to the interior of the other cell. We treat the gap junction as a randomly fluctuating gate that switches between an open and a closed state according to a two-state Markov process. This means that the resulting PDE-ODE is stochastic due to the presence of a randomly switching boundary in the interior of the domain. It is assumed that each membrane compartment acts as a conditional oscillator, that is, it sits below a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. In the ungated case (gap junction always open), the system supports diffusion-induced oscillations, in which the concentration of signaling molecules within the two compartments is either in-phase or anti-phase. The presence of a reflection symmetry (for identical cells) means that the stochastic gate only affects the existence of anti-phase oscillations. In particular, there exist parameter choices where the gated system supports oscillations, but the ungated system does not, and vice versa. The existence of oscillations is investigated by solving a spectral problem obtained by averaging over realizations of the stochastic gate. Communicated by Philip K. Maini. B Paul C.

This transport process may significantly affect the flux of reactive solutes to the ocean. A two dimensional model coupling the Richards equation that describes the flow in permeable sediments and the conservation equation of the silicic acid was developed to simulate the evolution of the silicic acid concentration into a variably saturated porous media submitted to tidal forcing. A detailed algorithm of drainage zone under tidal forcing and numerical methods needed to solve it are properly presented. Flux to the ocean has been estimated. The silicic acid concentration displays a permanent lens with low silicic acid concentration at the top of the tidal zone. This lens that results from the tidal forcing, presents weak variations of area during the tidal cycle. Silicic outflux to the ocean increases with increasing beach slope, hydraulic conductivity and tidal range. Simulations reveal that the total silicic acid flux to the ocean from the coastal marine sands can be considered as significant compared to the flux supplied by the rivers. These results may alter the previously published global budget of the silicic acid to the ocean. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the analysis of the overall gas flow through DPF, the developed scheme is applied to simulating the gas–particle flow through a porous structure, which is fabricated by packing powder particles of several tens of micrometer size with the discrete element method so as to mimic the porous wall in SiC-DPF. At the initial stage of the simulation, the filtration efficiency of the porous structure in its clean state is evaluated as a function of diameter of the soot particle, and it is found out that the dominant collection mechanism transfers from the Brownian diffusion to the direct interception around the particle diameter of 300 nm, and the filtration efficiency has the minimum at around this diameter. A coupled simulation of the gas flow and the particle dynamics is executed repeatedly, updating the flow velocity and the gas permeability, until a considerable amount of soot particles accumulates in the porous structure. From this simulation, it is confirmed that the developed scheme can reproduce improvement of the filtration efficiency and deterioration of the back pressure caused by the accumulation of soot particles. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

6f69a50d23b603bc72fb4554e5aeeab88b6ce400	a 2d closed form model for the electrostatics in hetero-junction double-gate tunnel-fets for calculation of band-to-band tunneling current	analytical modeling;double gate dg tunnel fet;hetero junction;conformal mapping;band to band tunneling;2d poisson	In the last few years the Tunnel-FET has become one of the promising devices to be the successor of the MOSFET due to its CMOS compatibility and steep subthreshold slopes ( S ) below 60 mV/dec. Hetero-junctions at the channel interface are used to improve the on-state current of the device. In this paper a 2D physics-based analytical model for hetero-junction Tunnel-FETs is introduced. It predicts a 2D band-to-band tunneling probability calculation through Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation (WKB) based on a 2D solution of electrostatics with respect to the device structure and carrier distributions in the device. These results are embedded in a model for the device current. The solutions of the potential, electrical field and the current transfer characteristics of the model are in good agreement with simulation data from the finite-element-method (FEM) simulator TCAD Sentaurus.	tunneling protocol	Michael Graef;Thomas Holtij;Franziska Hain;Alexander Kloes;Benjamín Iñíguez	2014	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2014.04.033	conformal map;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology	HPC	89.6702825246949	-9.64834709151108	179474
f66cac9109bf932cd731629979f5aea1fb9f2e5e	large-eddy simulation of the particle-laden turbulent flow in a cyclone separator		A gas cyclone separator represents a classic field of application where turbulent particle-laden flows play a major role. In order to evaluate the performance of a recently developed Euler–Lagrange simulation tool based on the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique and the point-particle approach, this practically relevant flow problem is considered in the present study. As a first step towards a full simulation taking all interactions between the two phases (fluid–particle, particle–fluid and particle–particle) into account, a one-way coupled prediction is carried out. Nevertheless, the entire simulation methodology is described in detail including a sandgrain roughness model and a deterministic collision model. For the latter a performance analysis was carried out demonstrating that even for a high mass loading the computational effort for the collision detection remains below 10 % of the entire CPU-time. The predicted LES results for the cyclone flow are compared with corresponding measurements and a reasonable agreement is found.	cyclone;large eddy simulation;turbulence	Michael Alletto;Michael Breuer	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02165-2_26	collision;computational physics;parallel computing;computer science;large eddy simulation;particle;collision detection;cyclone;cyclonic separation;turbulence	Arch	93.07416869642884	0.7722508932276203	180061

Solution method: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method exploits the decoupling, over a short time period, of the inter-particle interaction from the trapping potential. The particle dynamics is thus exclusively driven by the external optical field. The rare interparticle collisions are considered with an acceptance/rejection mechanism, that is by comparing a random number to the collisional probability defined in terms of the inter-particle cross section and centre-of-mass energy. All particles in the trap are individually simulated so that at each time step a number of useful quantities, such as the spatial densities or the energy distributions, can be readily evaluated. Restrictions: The in-trap motion of the particles is treated classically. Running time: The running time is relatively short, 1–2 hours. However it is convenient to replicate each simulation several times with different initialisations of the random sequence.	cool;molecular dynamics;monte carlo method;simulation	Paolo Barletta	2012	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2011.09.007	statistical physics;molecular dynamics;simulation;mathematics;physics;statistics;monte carlo method	HPC	95.91810242675005	-0.8607151857662139	180627

Recent attention has focused on such problems of Hamiltonian tomography for networks constructed with two-level systems. For open quantum systems, the fact that injected signals are likely to decay before they accumulate sufficient information for parameter estimation poses additional challenges. In this paper, we consider use of the gateway approach to Hamiltonian tomography [1, 2] to complex quantum systems with a limited set of state preparation and measurement probes. We classify graph properties of networks for which the Hamiltonian may be estimated under equivalent conditions on state preparation and measurement. We then examine the extent to which the gateway approach may be applied to estimation of Hamiltonian parameters for network graphs with non-trivial topologies mimicking biomolecular systems.	complex systems;estimation theory;graph property;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);many-body problem;open quantum system;tomography	Koji Maruyama;Daniel Burgarth;Akihito Ishizaki;Takeji Takui;K.

The test atom was mercury. The number of primitive GTFs used is between 7 and 62 (abbreviated as 7-62), 6-62, 6-62, 4-36, 4-36, 3-36, and 3-36 for s(+), p(-), p(+), d(-), d(+), f(-), and f(+) symmetries. The respective exponent parameters were determined with even-tempered manner, which requires the minimum and maximum exponents for the respective symmetries. We prepared several sets of these. The total energy (TE) given by the numerical DF (NDF) is -19648.849250 hartree; one of the present sets with largest number of expansion terms gave -19648.849251 hartree. The error (deltaTE) relative to the NDR TE is quite small. We then applied this set to the inert gas atoms Ne (10), Ar (18), Kr (36), Xe (54), Rn (86), and No (102), and also to Es (99) as the representative of the open shell atoms. The absolute values of deltaTE were at most 2.8 x 10(-6) hartree, showing the potential of this set as a universal set.

85fcaae98f08dae1651d2500c5fab07ea98b36cc	a variational approach to behavioral and neuroelectrical laws	psychophysical law;sensation;analytical mechanics;neurons	Variational methods play a fundamental and unifying role in several fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, economics, and biology, as they allow one to derive the behavior of a system as a consequence of an optimality principle. A possible application of these methods to a model of perception is given by considering a psychophysical law as the solution of an Euler–Lagrange equation. A general class of Lagrangians is identified by requiring the measurability of prothetic continua on interval scales. The associated Hamiltonian (the energy of the process) is tentatively connected with neurophysiological aspects. As an example of the suggested approach a particular choice of the Lagrangian, that is a sufficient condition to obtain classical psychophysical laws, while accounting for psychophysical adaptation and the stationarity of neuronal activity, is used to explore a possible relation between a behavioral law and a neuroelectrical ,response based on the Naka–Rushton model.	acclimatization;calculus of variations;euler;euler–lagrange equation;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);level of measurement;stationary process;variational principle	Stefano Noventa;Giulio Vidotto	2012	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-012-0501-y	psychology;sensation;mathematical optimization;analytical mechanics;mathematics;mathematical economics;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	ML	84.11232774070656	2.1098327119436493	181044

We present a fully three-dimensional model for the feature scale simulation of continuum transport and reaction determined high-pressure chemical vapor deposition processes suitable for the investigation of such nonuniformities. The newly developed three-dimensional approach combines topography simulation, meshing, and finite element method tools, and allows simulations over arbitrary geometries such as structures resulting from nonuniform underlying physical vapor deposition films. This enables the examination of film profile variations across the wafer for multistep processes consisting of lowand high-pressure parts such as Ti/TiN/W plugfills. Additionally, the model allows a very flexible formulation of the involved gas chemistry and surface reactions and can easily be extended to process chemistries including gas phase reactions of precursors as observed in deposition of silicon dioxide from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). We show simulation examples for a tungsten deposition process, which is applied as last step in a Ti/TiN/W plug-fill. For filling of an L-shaped trench, we show the transition from transport to reaction limited process conditions.	3d modeling;apache continuum;chemical vapor deposition;circuit complexity;finite element method;hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition;kinetics internet protocol;physical vapor deposition;plug-in (computing);semiconductor device fabrication;simulation;topography;vacuum deposition;wafer (electronics)	Wolfgang Pyka;Peter Fleischmann;Bernhard Haindl;Siegfried Selberherr	1999	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/43.811323	three-dimensional space;mesh generation;physical vapor deposition;index term;chemical kinetics;computer science;finite element method;chemical vapor deposition;high pressure;semiconductor device fabrication;engineering drawing	EDA	92.34479648422902	-1.7754527272119236	181335

Surprisingly, the simplest molecular models, taking account only of molecular size and shape, are sufficient to generate a wide variety of liquid crystalline phases, closely analogous to those observed in real life. Thermodynamic stability of different phases is very sensitive to shape, and presumably will also be sensitive to further details of intermolecular interactions as they are incorporated into the model. Realistic atom-atom potential models of liquid crystals are available, but the associated simulations are quite expensive. Thus, while idealized models may be used to study quite general, fundamental properties of mesophases, the modelling of specific liquid crystal systems in a realistic way remains a great challenge. Progress continues to be made on both these fronts.	atom;computer simulation;interaction;liquid crystals;molecular mechanics;real life;thermodynamics	Michael P. Allen;Mark R.

8303f73407514fec67695feb7c98f5a01946714a	a fem-based study on the influence of skewness and kurtosis surface texture parameters in human dental occlusal contact	contact problem;dental occlusion;height distribution;surface roughness;finite element analysis	Tooth wear, which manifests with a great variety of degree or level, is one of the dental abnormalities commonly found in diverse populations. The computational modeling of occlusal contact problem can help comprehension of any interaction between teeth generating stress concentration. The approach used to simulate contact between rough surfaces, given the probability density functions, consists in discretizing them into several intervals, so that each one represents a main asperity. The deformations of the main asperities are analyzed and, using homogenization techniques, it is possible to establish the relationship among the responses occurred in micro-scale and the predicted responses in macro-scale. In this work we create parameterized scripts in Python language for the Abaqus CAE software in order to analyze the influence of the surface topography on contact of human dental occlusal surfaces. The texture parameters influence their tribological behavior. As the mean roughness or mean curvature increases, the nature of the contact changes from elastic to plastic and the friction coefficient increases and becomes saturated. For negative skewness, the higher the skewness, the lower the contact area. For positive skewness, the opposite is observed. The higher the kurtosis, greater the area, except for kurtosis less than 3. The surface hardness is not affected by any of the surface texture parameters tested. Further verification using experimental data can encourage dentists to become more familiar with computer simulation.	finite element method	Flávia S. Bastos;Evelyn A. Oliveira;Leonardo G.

Closure is achieved by Taylor expansion of the fractional flow function and a perturbation argument. Previous results in 1-D are extended to 2-D, in which a bimodal profile is less evident. Mean and variance of (water) saturation exhibit a bimodal character; two shocks replace the single shock front evident in the classical Buckley–Leverett saturation profile. Comparison to Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) shows that the MDE approach gives a good approximation to total oil production. For such integrated or averaged quantities, or where a rough approximation of the location and magnitude of uncertainty is sufficient, MDEs may be substantially more efficient than MCS.	approximation;flow network;model-driven engineering;monte carlo method;simulation	Kenneth D.

Some test calculations were also performed using high-level composite CBS-QB3 approach. The direct scheme generally does not yield a satisfactory agreement between calculated and measured acidities due to a severe overestimation of the Gibbs free energy changes of the gas-phase deprotonation reaction by the used exchange-correlation functionals. The relative pK(a) values calculated using proton exchange method compare to experimental data very well in both qualitative and quantitative terms, with a mean absolute error of about 0.4 pK(a) units. To achieve this accuracy, we find it mandatory to perform geometry optimization of the neutral and anionic species in the gas and solution phases separately, because different conformations are stabilized in these two cases. We have attempted to evaluate the effect of the conformer-averaged free energies in the pK(a) predictions, and the general conclusion is that this procedure is highly too costly as compared with the very small improvement we have gained.

The results show considerable differences in performance among the different levels of theory. The values of H calculated by the semiempirical methods agree much better with the experimental values than those obtained at the DFT level. The differences are discussed in terms of the different contributions, electrostatic and no-electrostatic, to Gibbs free energy of solvation. In addition, the Henry's law constants of some triazine derived herbicides whose values have not been reported earlier are predicted as well.		Eduardo J. Delgado;Joel B.

20cde68bfbd3b531ce6ee022d6a6b33a3a1097d0	continuum scale modeling of exhaust gas transport in gasoline particulate filters: an applicability regime approach		Emission control devices such as gasoline particulate filters (GPFs) are being adopted by vehicle manufacturers to mitigate particulate emissions in gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines. In this paper, we present a multi-scale modeling framework to resolve mass, energy, and momentum transport equations of the exhaust gases in a GPF. Applicability conditions under which the macroscale transport equations accurately capture pore-scale dynamics are derived. Moreover, a novel methodology is proposed to quantify the relative importance of different transport mechanisms in the soot layer by means of mass and heat transfer Péclet (Pe) and Damköhler (Da) numbers. Finally, we discuss how the newly developed modeling tools assess the veracity of macroscopic models against their pore-scale counterparts in a case study of GPF operation prior to, during, and after the completion of a regeneration event using experimental data.	amos fiat;apache continuum;facility condition assessment;general protection fault;gradient;graphics device interface;ibm gpfs;phase diagram;triune continuum paradigm;veracity	Gabriele Pozzato;Harikesh Arunachalam;Simona Onori	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963794	control engineering;vehicle dynamics;experimental data;heat transfer;computer science;gasoline direct injection;gasoline;momentum;soot;exhaust gas	Robotics	91.29841738849598	-3.0215991745123554	182644

This static magnetic field can be used for controlling as well as vanishing the Berry phases and entanglement of the system state. Besides, we show that the Berry phase and entanglement are not always exact but useful to detect energy levels approach. Additionally, we find that a nontrivial two-spin unitary transformation, purely based on Berry phases, can be obtained by using two consecutive cycles with the opposite direction of the static magnetic field, opposite signs of the exchange constant as well as DM interaction, and a phase shift of the rotating magnetic field. This unitary transformation presents a two-qubit geometric phase gate.	quantum entanglement;qubit	M. Amniat-Talab;H.

e9a833d8b583a5afe3c22c2b6bacfc38b3316e02	quantum phase transition, quantum fidelity and fidelity susceptibility in the yang-baxter system		In this paper, we investigate the ground-state fidelity and fidelity susceptibility in the many-body Yang–Baxter system and analyze their connections with quantum phase transition. The Yang–Baxter system was perturbed by a twist of \( e^{i\varphi } \) at each bond, where the parameter \( \varphi \) originates from the q-deformation of the braiding operator U with \(q = e^{-i\varphi }\) (Jimbo in Yang–Baxter equations in integrable systems, World Scientific, Singapore, 1990), and \( \varphi \) has a physical significance of magnetic flux (Badurek et al. in Phys. Rev. D 14:1177, 1976). We test the ground-state fidelity related by a small parameter variation \(\varphi \) which is a different term from the one used for driving the system toward a quantum phase transition. It shows that ground-state fidelity develops a sharp drop at the transition. The drop gets sharper as system size N increases. It has been verified that a sufficiently small value of \(\varphi \) used has no effect on the location of the critical point, but affects the value of \( F(g_{c},\varphi ) \). The smaller the twist \(\varphi \), the more the value of \( F(g_{c},\varphi ) \) is close to 0.

CHARMM provides an extensive set of simulation algorithms, like molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy perturbation, and support for mature nonpolarizable and Drude polarizable force fields. TURBOMOLE provides fast QM calculations using density functional theory or wave function methods and excited state properties. CHARMM-TURBOMOLE is well-suited for extended QM/MM MD simulations using first principles methods with large (triple-ζ) basis sets. We demonstrate these capabilities with a QM/MM simulation of Mg(2+) (aq), where the MM outer sphere water molecules are represented using the SWM4-NDP Drude polarizable force field and the ion and inner coordination sphere are represented using QM PBE, PBE0, and MP2 methods. The relative solvation free energies of Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) were calculated using thermodynamic integration. We also demonstrate the features for excited state properties. We calculate the time-averaged solution absorption spectrum of indole, the emission spectrum of the indole 1La excited state, and the electronic circular dichroism spectrum of an oxacepham.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;anatomy, regional;basis set (chemistry);charmm;circular dichroism;computer simulation;density functional theory;distance;dual;energy citations database;energy, physics;excitation;excited state;force field (chemistry);free energy perturbation;functional theories of grammar;interface device component;ions;mechanical ventilation;molecular dynamics;molecular mechanics;møller–plesset perturbation theory;oscillator device component;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;radial (radio);semantics (computer science);simulation;thanatophoric dysplasia, type i (disorder);turbomole;thermodynamic integration;thermodynamics;vibration - physical agent;acetonitrile;kilocalorie;micacocidin a;zinc cation	Saleh Riahi;Christopher N.

These definitions are introduced considering two different series expansions for the function ln2(x). The expansions are “matched”: the upper limit for convergence of the first series and the lower limit for convergence of the second series define the border and transition from weak to moderate inversion/saturation. The moderate inversion/saturation corresponds to approximation of the function ln2(x) by a modified sum of two first terms of the second series. Then, the condition of inversion/saturation is defined by dominance of one term with respect to another. The condition of moderate inversion/saturation is a necessary step in transition from weak to strong inversion/saturation. The introduced definitions correspond to MOS transistor operation physics and eliminate discontinuity in this transition.	approximation;reflections of signals on conducting lines;transistor	Igor M.

In constrast with standard nonlinear effects, this """" threshold nonlinearity """" is non-perturbative and occurs for infinitesimal perturbations around the lithostatic pressure taken as the reference. For a given earthquake source, such nonlinear elasticity is shown to (i) rotate, widen or narrow the different lobes of stress transfer, (ii) to modify the 1/r 2 2D-decay of elastic stress Green functions into the generalized power law 1/r γ where γ depends on the azimuth and on the amplitude of the modulii asymmetry. Using reasonable estimates, this implies an enhancement of the range of interaction between earthquakes by a factor up to 5 − 10 at distances of several tens of rupture length. This may explain certain long-range earthquake triggering and hydrological anomalies in wells and suggest to revisit the standard stress transfer calculations which use linear elasticity. We also show that the standard double-couple of forces representing an earthquake source leads to an opening of the corresponding fault plane, which suggests a mechanism for the non-zero isotropic component of the seismic moment tensor observed for some events."""	elasticity (data store);nonlinear system;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);steam rupture	Guy Ouillon;Didier Sornette	2006	Future Generation Comp.

A Glauber model is used with the scattering wavefunctions calculated in the eikonal approximation. The program is appropriate for knockout reactions at intermediate energy collisions ( 30 MeV ≤ Elab/nucleon ≤ 2000 MeV). It is particularly useful for reactions involving unstable nuclear beams, or exotic nuclei (e.g. neutron-rich nuclei), and studies of singleparticle occupancy probabilities (spectroscopic factors) and other related physical observables. Such studies are an essential part of the scientific program of radioactive beam facilities, as in for instance the proposed RIA (Rare Isotope Accelerator) facility in the US. 1	approximation;computer program;control theory;glauber;knockout;observable;rich internet application	C.

For the modeling of the transient flow in an energy tower and the related power production a one-dimensional approach is taken. Although many simplifying assumptions are imposed, this approach is thought to incorporate most of the main physical effects. The model is derived from the general one-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics for a compressible humid air gas mixture. Low Mach number asymptotics allow us to handle the related problems. Numerical simulations are performed. Optimal values for the spray rate and the height of the spraying region are identified. The model gives results which are in accordance with our physical understanding. For lack of an energy tower prototype, a quantitative comparison is not possible at the moment.	simulation	Maria Bauer;Ingenuin Gasser	2012	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/100797977	gas dynamics;calculus;mathematics;geometry;thermodynamics	Theory	90.7314190006991	1.7997124102565387	186217

The main method used for these calculations was the Configuration Interaction approach, modeling excited states as combinations of single substitutions out of the Hartree-Fock ground state. These calculations correlate well with both experimentally measured singlet and triplet state energies and also previous HOMO-LUMO gap energies that approximate the singlet state energies. The excited state calculations then correlate well with general models of photo-induced toxicity based for the PAHs.	aromatics;ab initio quantum chemistry methods;adverse reaction to drug;approximation algorithm;aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylases;configuration interaction;dermatitis, phototoxic;energy, physics;excited state;experiment;fock state;ground state;hartree–fock method;hydrocarbons;polycyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic;singlet state;triplet state	Leon D.

To provide useful information about location, grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This, together with the near-absence of rotation in novel environments, suggests that the rotation emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.	angularjs;distortion;emergence;grid cells;reference frame (video);reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;walls of a building	Tor Stensola;Hanne Stensola;May-Britt Moser;Edvard I.

In the clean limit, the system is in the $s_pm$ state with the sign-changing gaps. Scattering by nonmagnetic impurities leads the change of sign of the smaller gap thus resulting in a transition from the $s_{pm}$ the $s_{++}$ state with the sign-preserving gaps. We show here that the transition is temperature-dependent, thus, there is a line of $s_pm to s_{++}$ transition in the temperature-disorder phase diagram. There exists a narrow range of impurity scattering rates, where the disorder-induced $s_pm to s_{++}$ transition occurs at low temperatures, but then the low-temperature $s_{++}$ state transforms back the $s_pm$ state at higher temperatures. With increasing impurity scattering rate, temperature of such $s_{++} to s_{pm}$ transition shifts the critical temperature $T_c$ and only the $s_{++}$ state is left for higher amount of disorder.	field electron emission	V.

The periodic boundary condition was applied through decoupled contributions of both solvent and solute fluxes. The upstream boundary conditions were scaled from the downstream boundary conditions after accounting for solute and solvent losses via permeation. The simulation incorporates fluid flow, solute convection–diffusion and separation, variable viscosity and density, as well as the effect of osmotic pressure on the permeation rate. The methodology developed here represents a novel theoretical advance. The commercial CFD software FLUENT® was used for this project. The utility of the PBC approach is that it enables significant reductions in computational requirements. Only a small portion of a larger domain need be treated to quantitatively infer information about a substaneriodic boundary condition tially larger system. For example, it could be applied to the repeating volume between crossing filaments in spacer filled channels of spiral wound or plate and frame modules, or to a section of a long closed channel such as in plate and frame modules or in tubular membranes. The plausibility of the model was demonstrated in two dimensions for the case of solute separation in the ultrafiltration regime under laminar flow in a channel. First, the velocity and solute concentration profiles were simulated for a 1 m long module. These results were then replicated, using 20 cm sections, and the periodic boundary condition methodology, applied at various positions along the channel length. ( a u w s 2 2 a i t . Introduction Transport modeling in membrane systems has been a vital lement of the broader research efforts aimed at refining and prooting the use of membrane separation processes (Kleinstreuer Belfort, 1984). Early work focussed on the modeling of porous alls and their effects on bi-directional flow characteristics in wo-dimensional models (Berman, 1953; Gupta & Levy, 1976). nstead of simply inferring membrane behaviour from overall modle flow fields, such as shear rates based on average cross-flow elocity or bulk solution properties, a level of empiricism was emoved as models became more elaborate with the inclusion of he convection–diffusion equation, and the treatment of a solute ermeating with or without some separation at a porous boundary Abbreviations: BSA, bovine serum albumin; CFD, computational fluid dynamics; E, initial evaluation; SBC, standard boundary conditions; PBC, periodic boundary	aris express;artificial intelligence;coefficient;computation;computational fluid dynamics;downstream (software development);fluent calculus;flux qubit;hang (computing);local interconnect network;mass effect trilogy;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;p (complexity);periodic boundary conditions;plausibility structure;predictive modelling;requirement;reverse mathematics;simulation;springer (tank);stochastic process;turbulence;velocity (software development)	K.

The polarity of aqueous solvent is essential and qualitatively captured by continuum electrostatics methods like Generalized Born (GB). However, GB does not account for the solvent-induced interactions between exposed hydrophobic sidechains or solute-solvent dispersion interactions. These """"nonpolar"""" effects are often modeled through surface area (SA) energy terms, which lack realism, create mathematical singularities, and have a many-body character. We have explored an alternate, Lazaridis-Karplus (LK) gaussian energy density for nonpolar effects and a dispersion (DI) energy term proposed earlier, associated with GB electrostatics. We parameterized several combinations of GB, SA, LK, and DI energy terms, to reproduce 62 small molecule solvation free energies, 387 protein stability changes due to point mutations, and the structures of 8 protein loops. With optimized parameters, the models all gave similar results, with GBLK and GBDILK giving no performance loss compared to GBSA, and mean errors of 1.7 kcal/mol for the stability changes and 2 Å deviations for the loop conformations. The optimized GBLK model gave poor results in MD of the Trpcage mini-protein, but parameters optimized specifically for MD performed well for Trpcage and three other small proteins. Overall, the LK and DI nonpolar terms are valid alternatives to SA treatments for a range of applications. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."""

For such simulations, pairwise force calculation is a serious bottleneck which can impose a prohibitive amount of computational load on the simulation if not performed wisely. Herein, we approximate the resultant force due to long-range particle-body and body-body interactions applicable to multiresolution simulations. Since the resultant force does not necessarily act through the center of mass of the body, it creates a moment about the mass center. Although this potentially important torque is neglected in many coarse-grained models which only use particle dynamics to formulate the dynamics of the system, it should be calculated and used when coarse-grained simulations are performed in a multibody scheme. Herein, the approximation for this moment due to far-field particle-body and body-body interactions is also provided.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;interaction;multiresolution analysis;numerical linear algebra;resultant;simulation	Mohammad Poursina;Kurt S.

The strategy was designed to carry out repetitive model predictive control (RMPC) of average product purities in the lower tier and off-line cyclic steady state optimization of feed and desorbent flow rates and the length of switching period in the upper tier. Experimental studies have been conducted in a four zone SMB system to separate L-ribose and L-arabinose from their mixture dissolved in water for the linear isotherm case and numerical studies have been carried out for the nonlinear isotherm case. As a consequence, the optimizing control strategy is observed to satisfactorily attain the intended optimum while robustly regulating the product purities against various uncertainties.	mathematical optimization;steady state	Kiwoong Kim;Kwang Soon Lee	2010		10.3182/20100826-3-TR-4016.00034	control engineering;engineering;operations management;control theory	Robotics	94.59467130138596	-1.9319439449026197	189040

While analytically equivalent to existing boundary integration methods, this new domain integration technique is less sensitive to numerical error introduced by calculations of finite precision. Most significantly, we derive entirely new optimized formulas for the ensemble Monte Carlo estimation of steady-state terminal currents from the time-independent form of our GRST, which are in general not equivalent to the time-average of the true time-dependent terminal currents. We then demonstrate, both analytically and by means of example, how our new varianceminimizing terminal current estimators may be exploited to improve estimator accuracy in comparison to existing methods.	monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical error;simulation;steady state	P.

For leg lightness it is suggested in some cases to miniaturize its cross section. At that buckling of the leg rectilinear form is possible under dead weight. To keep the rectilinear form it is proposed to place a vibroexciter for vertical oscillations in the bottom of the leg. It results in parametrical oscillations which make onset for effect of vibrational stabilization of the rectilinear form. This effect can be treated as an increase of flexural stiffness of the flexible rod. Scheme of the leg's model in the form of flexible rod with distributed mass and concentrated mass at its free end is developed. Taking into account finite rotations of its sections we derive the equation of oscillations for the rod. It is shown that the effect of rectilinear form stabilization occurs under certain magnitudes of vibration frequency and amplitude. Stability conditions for obtained solutions are analyzed.	mobile robot	Grigory Panovko;Evgeniya Myalo;Teodor Akinfiev	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10817-4_71	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;cross section;oscillation	Robotics	83.67624414590195	-2.794126473880746	189969
2152b4e00613bfee023b9c73c99d0cc79d2818e1	smoluchowski reaction kinetics for reactions of any order	smoluchowski kinetics;diffusion controlled reactions;68u20;high order reactions;92b05;37m05;reaction diffusion processes	In 1917, Marian von Smoluchowski presented a simple mathematical description of diffusioncontrolled reactions on the scale of individual molecules. His model postulated that a reaction would occur when two reactants were sufficiently close and, more specifically, presented a succinct relationship between the relative proximity of two reactants at the moment of reaction and the macroscopic reaction rate. Over the last century, Smoluchowski reaction theory has been applied widely in the physical, chemical, environmental and, more recently, the biological sciences. Despite the widespread utility of the Smoluchowski theory, it only describes the rates of second order reactions and is inadequate for the description of higher order reactions for which there is no equivalent method for theoretical investigation. In this paper, we derive a generalised Smoluchowski framework in which we define what should be meant by proximity in this context when more than two reactants are involved. We derive the relationship between the macroscopic reaction rate and the critical proximity at which a reaction occurs for higher order reactions. Using this theoretical framework and using numerical experiments we explore various peculiar properties of multimolecular diffusion-controlled reactions which, due to there being no other numerical method of this nature, have not been previous reported.	experiment;kinesiology;numerical method	Mark B.

The EDL is described with the Stern model, and a generalized Frumkin–Butler–Volmer (gFBV) equation is used to describe the EDL dependent kinetics. The liquid electrolyte is modeled with the Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) equations and the incompressible Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. For planar microchannel applications, the three-dimensional model is reduced to an in-plane depth averaged set of equations through an asymptotic analysis. The diffuse layers are resolved in the thin double layer limit through asymptotic matching by considering the Debye length to channel width ratio as a smallness parameter. This yields an outer problem for the bulk electrolyte and an inner problem for the anode and cathode diffuse regions. Fuel cell performance is then evaluated by introducing several specified local current density profiles. The resulting approximate analytic expressions, based on the proposed specified current density profiles, are validated against results from a numerical solution of the full in-plane PNP–NS–gFBV model, in which a priori current profile approximations are not required. We demonstrate that simple current density profiles yield physically unrealistic electrode potential distributions despite producing reasonably accurate overall device performance results. We also present an appropriate current density profile which yields accurate spatial distributions for the continuum fields and electrode potential distributions.	3d modeling;approximation algorithm;kinetics internet protocol;legacy plug and play;multidimensional analysis;navier–stokes equations;numerical partial differential equations;triune continuum paradigm	Isaac B.

Instead of the Wigner quasi-probability distributions used in the standard protocol, we use positive definite true probability densities which account for unsharp measurements through a proper wave function representing a non-ideal quantum measuring device. This is based on a result of Schroeck and may be taken on any relativistic or nonrelativistic phase space. The obtained formula is similar to a known formula in quantum optics, but contains the effect of the measuring device. It has been applied in three cases. In the first case, the two measuring devices, corresponding to the two entangled parts shared by Alice and Bob, are not entangled and described by two identical Gaussian wave functions with respect to the Heisenberg group. They lead to a probability density identical to the $$Q$$Q function which is analyzed and compared with the Wigner formalism. A new expression of the teleportation fidelity $$F$$F for a coherent state in terms of the quadrature variances is obtained. In the second case, these two measuring devices are entangled in a two-mode squeezed vacuum state. In the third case, two Gaussian states are combined in an entangled squeezed state. The overall observation is that the state of the measuring devices shared by Alice and Bob influences the fidelity of teleportation through their unsharpness and entanglement.	quantum mechanics	Juba Messamah;Franklin E.

2903081d39437e1bbc181ab125d20b1e1603aff6	comparison between linear genetic programming and m5 tree models to predict flow discharge in compound channels		There are many studies on the hydraulic analysis of steady uniform flows in compound open channels. Based on these studies, various methods have been developed with different assumptions. In general, these methods either have long computations or need numerical solution of differential equations. Furthermore, their accuracy for all compound channels with different geometric and hydraulic conditions may not be guaranteed. In this paper, to overcome theses limitations, two new and efficient algorithms known as linear genetic programming (LGP) and M5 tree decision model have been used. In these algorithms, only three parameters (e.g., depth ratio, coherence, and ratio of computed total flow discharge to bankfull discharge) have been used to simplify its applications by hydraulic engineers. By compiling 394 stage-discharge data from laboratories and fields of 30 compound channels, the derived equations have been applied to estimate the flow conveyance capacity. Comparison of measured and computed flow discharges from LGP and M5 revealed that although both proposed algorithms have considerable accuracy, LGP model with R 2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.32 has very good performance.	algorithm;compiler;computation;discharger;flood;linear genetic programming;numerical partial differential equations	A.

This paper characterizes the feasible equilibrium postures of mechanisms supported by three frictional point contacts in a three-dimensional gravitational environment, for a subclass of contact arrangements, called tame, for which the friction cones lie above the plane spanned by the contacts. The kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body I having the same contacts with the environment and a variable center of mass. The equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts become the center-of-mass locations of I that maintain a feasible equilibrium with respect to gravity. The paper establishes the relations between the feasible equilibrium region and the classical support polygon principle. For tame 3-contact arrangements, the paper identifies and characterizes geometrically three types of boundary curves of the feasible equilibrium region, where two of them are obtained is closed-from, and the third is given implicitly as a solution of a set of nonlinear equations, which can be traced numerically. The three types of boundary curves are then associated with the onset of three different modes of non-static contact motions. Finally, the paper reports on experimental results that verify the theoretical predictions by using a 3-legged prototype.		Yizhar Or;Elon D. Rimon	2010	I. J.

Single point energy calculations were performed at the MP2/AUG-cc-pVDZ level. Genuineness of the calculated transition states (TS) was tested by visually examining the vibrational modes corresponding to the imaginary vibrational frequencies and applying the criterion that the TS properly connected the reactant and product complexes (PC). Genuineness of all the calculated TS was further ensured by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. Effects of aqueous media were investigated by solvating all the species involved in the reactions using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The calculations reveal that the most stable nitro-product complex involving the anion of 8-nitroguanine and a water molecule i.e. 8NO(2)G(-) + H(2)O can be formed according to one reaction mechanism while there are two possible reaction mechanisms for the formation of the oxo-product complex involving 8-oxoguanine and anion of the NO(2) group i.e. 8OG + NO(2)(-). The calculated relative stabilities of the PC, barrier energies of the reactions and the corresponding enthalpy changes suggest that formation of the complex 8OG + NO(2)(-) would be somewhat preferred over that of the complex 8NO(2)G(-) + H(2)O. The possible biological implications of this result are discussed.		N. R. Jena;P. C.

However, there are indications that this approach leads to ill conditioned systems that must be inverted and to numerically unstable differential equations of motion. We derive a sufficient condition for ill conditioning of augmented dynamical systems that the mechanism's trajectory passes through, or very near, a kinematic singularity. In singular regions the equations of motion are also numerically stiff, and frequently require special numerical methods for computer solution. We propose a new method of calculating closedchain dynamics, based on the systematic elimination of variables that are both redundant and that may adversely affect the computations. This approach produces numerically stable solutions of the differential equations of motion, and the equations are apparently much less stiff than the equations produced by the traditional force-closure approach.	computation;condition number;control theory;dynamical system;gaussian elimination;numerical method;numerical stability;simulation;singularity project;stiff equation	R.

acd2d4e11589914158d105d255623ee3c5ac2bae	computational science and re-discovery: open-source implementations of ellipsoidal harmonics for problems in potential theory	potential theory;separation of variables;higher order;spherical harmonic;solar system;eigenvalues;barriers to entry	We present two open-source (BSD) implementations of ellipsoidal harmonic expansions for solving problems of potential theory using separation of variables. Ellipsoidal harmonics are used surprisingly infrequently, considering their substantial value for problems ranging in scale from molecules to the entire solar system. In this paper, we suggest two possible reasons for the paucity relative to spherical harmonics. The first is essentially historical—ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19th century and early 20th, when it was found that only the lowest-order harmonics are expressible in closed form. Each higher-order term requires the solution of an eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have discouraged applications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is practical: even with modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms, expansions in ellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to compute than those in Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present implementations reduce the ‘barrier to entry’ by providing an easy and free way for the community to begin using ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research. We demonstrate our implementation using the specific and physiologically crucial problem of how charged proteins interact with their environment, and ask: what other analytical tools await re-discovery in an era of inexpensive computation?

2a02cacc442209e98240ba68ce9bd1cbf8480d7e	molecular dynamics simulations in hybrid particle-continuum schemes: pitfalls and caveats		Heterogeneous multiscale methods (HMM) combine molecular accuracy of particle-based simulations with the computational efficiency of continuum descriptions to model flow in soft matter liquids. In these schemes, molecular simulations typically pose a computational bottleneck, which we investigate in detail in this study. We find that it is preferable to simulate many small systems as opposed to a few large systems, and that a choice of a simple isokinetic thermostat is typically sufficient while thermostats such as Lowe-Andersen allow for simulations at elevated viscosity. We discuss suitable choices for time steps and finite-size effects which arise in the limit of very small simulation boxes. We also argue that if colloidal systems are considered as opposed to atomistic systems, the gap between microscopic and macroscopic simulations regarding time and length scales is significantly smaller. We propose a novel reduced-order technique for the coupling to the macroscopic solver, which allows us to approximate a non-linear stress–strain relation efficiently and thus further reduce computational effort of microscopic simulations.	apache continuum;molecular dynamics;simulation	S.

Oscillations were observed between pH 4 and 8. Thus the reaction appears a good candidate for the observation of oscillations in experiments, providing the necessary condition that (k_h u003e k_s) is met. In order to match these conditions, we devised an experimental system where we can ensure the fast transport of acid to the encapsulated urease, compared to that of urea. In particular, by means of the droplet transfer method, we encapsulate the enzyme, together with a suitable pH indicator, in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid membrane, where differential diffusion of H(^+) and urea is ensured by the different permeability ((P_m)) of membranes to the two species. Here we present preliminary tests for the stability of the enzymatic reaction in the presence of lipids and also the successful encapsulation of the enzyme into lipid vesicles.

Among the activity coefficient models available for mixed solvent/salt systems, the NRTL-E model (with refitted parameters), is shown to be the most accurate to correlate the experimental vapor /liquid equilibrium (VLE) data available for the ethanol/water/CaCl2 system. A model is proposed and implemented to calculate the salt contribution to the liquid phase enthalpy by combining calorimetric quantities of the solute such as its relative apparent enthalpy and the infinite dilution values of its integral heat of solution and partial isobaric heat capacity. The column model is solved by use of the Newton /Raphson method with a damping factor found by minimizing the Euclidean norm of the vector of discrepancy functions associated with the MESH equations. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, the reliability of MEMS devices under buckling deformation environments remains elusive and needs to be further explored. Based on the Talreja's tensor valued internal state damage variables as well as the Helmhotlz free energy of piezoelectric material, a constitutive model of piezoelectric materials with damage is presented. The Kachanvo damage evolution law under in-plane compressive loads is employed. The model is applied to the specific case of the postbuckling analysis of the piezoelectric plate with damage. Then, adopting von Karman's plate theory, the nonlinear governing equations of the piezoelectric plates with initial geometric deflection including damage effects under in-plane compressive loads are established. By using the finite difference method and the Newmark scheme, the damage evolution for damage accumulation is developed and the finite difference procedure for postbuckling equilibrium path is simultaneously employed. Numerical results show the postbuckling behaviors of initial flat and deflected piezoelectric plates with damage or no damage under different sets of electrical loading conditions. The effects of applied voltage, aspect ratio of plate, thick-span ratio of plate, damage as well as initial geometric deflections on the postbuckling behaviors of the piezoelectric plate are discussed.	aspect ratio;behavior;buckling;electrical load;equilibrium;finite difference method;micro-electrical-mechanical systems;microelectromechanical systems;newmark-beta method;nonlinear system;numerical method;piezoelectricity;span distance;tree accumulation;free energy;voltage	Zhigang Sun;Xianqiao Wang	2014		10.3390/s140304876	structural engineering;medical research;bioinformatics;engineering;forensic engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	88.30241833351552	-2.0288473839280443	191942
548a47ac1f2668edc95d45a971a0267bc9089302	verification of photon transport capability of unist monte carlo code mcs		Abstract A photon transport capability has been implemented and verified in the Monte Carlo code MCS of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology for the purpose of radiation shielding studies. The MCS photon fixed-source mode simulates the transport of photons between 1 keV and 20 MeV for all elements from hydrogen to fermium. The specific physics for the main four photo-atomic reactions (Rayleigh scattering, Compton scattering, photoelectric effect and pair production) and three secondary processes of photon production (positron–electron annihilation, atomic relaxation and electron/positron bremsstrahlung) are reviewed. Verification results against Monte Carlo codes MCNP6.1 and SERPENT2.1.29 are presented. The verification cases include the comparison of energy distributions of photon flux in an infinite medium, of spatial distributions of photon flux in a cylinder, of the spatial distribution of photon body-equivalent dose in a spent nuclear fuel transport cask, and of photon KERMA (Kinetic Energy Released per MAss) in photon detector calibration geometries. Good calculation/calculation agreement is observed overall, with some marked differences in the detailed photon flux comparison at given energy ranges traced back to differences in photon physics implementation. MCS can from now on be applied for the purpose of advanced photon studies and corresponding validation against experimental shielding benchmarks will follow in the future.	angularjs;approximation;benchmark (computing);code;doppler effect;experiment;flux qubit;hydrogen;importance sampling;monte carlo method;multi categories security;music construction set;reactor (software);sampling (signal processing);sensor;uranium dioxide;variance reduction	Matthieu Lemaire;Hyunsuk Lee;Bamidele Ebiwonjumi;Chidong Kong;Wonkyeong Kim;Yunki Jo;Jinsu Park;Deokjung Lee	2018	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2018.05.008	compton scattering;annihilation;pair production;mathematical analysis;monte carlo method;bremsstrahlung;photon;mathematics;radiation;positron;particle physics	AI	95.15140076117152	-0.7643027102325911	192136
c424c66f6bf2b025796699b61c01c217b8829c78	a hybrid ab initio/free electron computational model for conjugated dye molecules: simple cyanines and oxonols	ab initio calculations;computer model	Justifications developed for the application the free electron model to the π-orbitals of conjugated molecules suggest that the optical properties of these molecules would be well described by a one-dimensional free electron model with a potential chosen to reproduce the energy level spacing of the ground state occupied π-orbitals. Such a hybrid ab initio/free electron modeling approach, where the free electron potential parameters are optimized on a molecule-by-molecule basis, is developed, and applied to a series of simple cyanine and oxonol dyes. The ensuing predictions for λmax, oscillator strengths, and redox properties compare well to available experimental information. Two important strengths of this approach are that no explicit calculations of the excited electronic state are required, and that the ab initio determination of the occupied π-orbital level spacing considers all the electrons (π and σ) of the entire molecule in a specified geometry, environment, etc. This second characteristic gives the ability to efficiently model modifications of the optical properties of conjugated molecules resulting from chemical and/or physical modifications occuring within and remote to the conjugated region of the molecule. © 2000 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.

135999c06a1847cb046b9267b187d21116e42911	large-eddy simulation of hypersonic flows. selective procedure to activate the sub-grid model wherever small scale turbulence is present	astrophysical jets;localization;small scale;large eddy simulation;turbulence	A new method for the localization of the regions where small scale turbulent fluctuations are present in hypersonic flows is applied to the large-eddy simulation (LES) of a compressible turbulent jet with an initial Mach number equal to 5. The localization method used is called selective LES and is based on the exploitation of a scalar probe function f which represents the magnitude of the stretching–tilting term of the vorticity equation normalized with the enstrophy (Tordella et al., 2007) [3]. For a fully developed turbulent field of fluctuations, statistical analysis shows that the probability that f is larger than 2 is almost zero, and, for any given threshold, it is larger if the flow is under-resolved. By computing the spatial field of f in each instantaneous realization of the simulation it is possible to locate the regions where the magnitude of the normalized vortical stretching–tilting is anomalously high. The sub-grid model is then introduced into the governing equations in such regions only. The results of the selective LES simulation are compared with those of a standard LES, where the sub-grid terms are used in the whole domain, and with those of a standard Euler simulation with the same resolution. The comparison is carried out by assuming as reference field a higher resolution Euler simulation of the same jet. It is shown that the selective LESmodifies the dynamic properties of the flow to a lesser extentwith respect to the classical LES. In particular, the prediction of the enstrophy, mean velocity and density distributions and of the energy and density spectra are substantially improved. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

c50192b720c7af6e6cf6e23109d06660ba833852	(non-)thermal production of wimps during kination		Understanding the nature of the Dark Matter (DM) is one of the current challenges in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Knowing the properties of the DM particle would shed light on physics beyond the Standard Model and even provide us with details of the early Universe. In fact, the detection of such a relic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) period, an epoch from which we have no direct data, and could even hint at inflation physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the Universe after inflation is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field φ, in the so-called “kination” model. Adding to previous work on the subject, we assume that the φ field decays into both radiation and DM particles, which we take to be Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The present abundance of WIMPs is then fixed during the kination period through either a thermal “freeze-out” or “freeze-in” mechanism, or through a non-thermal process governed by the decay of φ. We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement that the present WIMP abundance provides the correct relic budget. Requiring that BBN occurs during the standard cosmological scenario sets a limit on the temperature at which the kination period ends. Using this limit and assuming the WIMP has a mass mχ = 100 GeV, we obtain that the thermally-averaged WIMP annihilation cross section has to satisfy the constraints 4 × 10−16 GeV−2 . 〈σv〉 . 2 × 10−5 GeV−2 in order for having at least one of the production mechanism to yield the observed amount of DM. This result shows how the properties of the WIMP particle, if ever measured, can yield information on the pre-BBN content of the Universe.

The scheme couples conventional hydrodynamic conservation equations for mass and momentum-flux with molecular dynamics (MD) in a unified framework. The method is very much di↵erent from common ‘domain-decomposition’ hybrid methods, and is more related to micro-resolution methods, such as the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method. We optimise the use of the computationally-costly MD solvers by applying them only at a limited number of streamwise-distributed cross-sections of the macroscale geometry. The greater the streamwise scale of the geometry, the more significant is the computational speed-up when compared to a full MD simulation. We test our new multiscale method on the case of a converging/diverging nanochannel conveying a simple Lennard-Jones liquid. We validate the results from our simulations by comparing them to a full MD simulation of the same test case.		Matthew K. Borg;Duncan A. Lockerby;Jason M. Reese	2013	J. Comput.

The method is based on solving relaxation-type kinetic equations using high-order shock capturing weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in the coordinate space and the discrete ordinate techniques in the velocity space. In contrast to the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, this approach is not subject to statistical scattering and is equally efficient when simulating both steady and unsteady flows. The presented numerical method is used to simulate some classical problems of rarefied gas dynamics as well as some microflows of practical interest, namely shock wave propagation in a microchannel and steady and unsteady flows in a supersonic micronozzle. Computational results are compared with Navier---Stokes and DSMC solutions.	numerical linear algebra;numerical method;simulation	A. N. Kudryavtsev;A. A. Shershnev	2013	J. Sci.

The local noise-level distribution over the fan blade is measured by microphone arrays, and the flow field is visualized by smoke and phase-averaged PIV measurement. The noise source distribution is examined by cross-correlation analysis between noise signal and velocity fluctuation. It is found that the noise source is located near the rotating fan blade, especially around leading and trailing edges. The separation and reattachment of flow are observed near the leading edge, and the tip vortices and vortex shedding are found near the trailing edge. The cross-correlation distribution of the noise signal and the radial velocity fluctuation shows large magnitude in the correlated regions, which indicates the noise generation by the formation of vortex structure around the blade.	cross-correlation;microphone;noise generator;quantum fluctuation;radial (radio);velocity (software development);vortex	Atsushi Nashimoto;Nobuyuki Fujisawa;Tomonori Nakano;Takeshi Yoda	2008	J.

In the phase-field formalism, one introduces an order parameter called phase-field function to characterize thermodynamically the phases. All the system parameters are assumed to vary continuously from one fluid bulk to another (as linear functions of the phase-field). The Navier-Stokes equation (with some extra terms) and the heat equation are written only once for the whole system. The evolution of the phase-field is described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In the sharp-interface limit the results found by the phase-field formalism recover the results given by the classical formulation.	evaporation;formal system;instability;linear function;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;semantics (computer science);simulation	Rodica Borcia;Domnic Merkt;Michael Bestehorn	2004	I.

21e77b249bf283cefa62e6cd130b258cd3f19d15	simulated tempering based on global balance or detailed balance conditions: suwa-todo, heat bath, and metropolis algorithms	molecular simulation;molecular dynamics;generalized ensemble algorithm;random walk;correlation	Simulated tempering (ST) is a useful method to enhance sampling of molecular simulations. When ST is used, the Metropolis algorithm, which satisfies the detailed balance condition, is usually applied to calculate the transition probability. Recently, an alternative method that satisfies the global balance condition instead of the detailed balance condition has been proposed by Suwa and Todo. In this study, ST method with the Suwa-Todo algorithm is proposed. Molecular dynamics simulations with ST are performed with three algorithms (the Metropolis, heat bath, and Suwa-Todo algorithms) to calculate the transition probability. Among the three algorithms, the Suwa-Todo algorithm yields the highest acceptance ratio and the shortest autocorrelation time. These suggest that sampling by a ST simulation with the Suwa-Todo algorithm is most efficient. In addition, because the acceptance ratio of the Suwa-Todo algorithm is higher than that of the Metropolis algorithm, the number of temperature states can be reduced by 25% for the Suwa-Todo algorithm when compared with the Metropolis algorithm.	autocorrelation;detailed balance;markov chain;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;molecular dynamics;molecular modelling;sampling (signal processing);short;simulate composite resin;simulation	Yoshiharu Mori;Hisashi Okumura	2015	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.24213	statistical physics;molecular dynamics;computational chemistry;thermodynamics;correlation;random walk;physics	ML	96.18474197794889	-3.307173859539426	195161

For each pair and each solvent a series of umbrella-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with the AMBER force field, explicit solvent, and counterions added to maintain a zero net charge of a system were carried out and the PMF was calculated by using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). Subsequently, homoconjugation-equilibrium constants were calculated by numerical integration of the respective PMF profiles. In all cases but imidazole stable homocomplexes were found to form in solution, which was manifested as the presence of contact minima corresponding to hydrogen-bonded species in the PMF curves. The calculated homoconjugation constants were found to be greater for complexes with the OHO bridge (acetic acid and phenol) than with the NHN bridge and they were found to decrease with increasing polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity of the solvent (i.e., in the series AN > DMSO > H(2)O), both facts being in agreement with the available experimental data. It was also found that interactions with counterions are manifested as the broadening of the contact minimum or appearance of additional minima in the PMF profiles of the acetic acid-acetate, phenol/phenolate system in acetonitrile, and the 4(5)-methylimidazole/4(5)-methylimidzole cation conjugated base system in dimethyl sulfoxide.	2-propylamine;4(5)-methylimidazole;acetate;acetic acid;arabic numeral 0;assisted model building with energy refinement (amber);base;cations;coupling constant;dimethyl sulfoxide;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;equilibrium;force field (chemistry);histogram;hydrogen;imidazoles;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);interaction;maxima and minima;molecular dynamics;numerical analysis;numerical integration;phenols;pyschological bonding;sampling (signal processing);simulation;solvents;sulfoxides;systems modeling;thioctic acid;umbrella sampling;water model;acetonitrile;phenol;phenolate;polarity	Joanna Makowska;Mariusz Makowski;Adam Liwo;Lech Chmurzynski	2005	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20166	stereochemistry;systems modeling;chemistry;organic chemistry;computational chemistry;equilibrium constant;potential of mean force;umbrella sampling;physics;quantum mechanics	Comp.	96.13107886975789	-6.040965493502629	195296

Equilibrium data for adsorption and desorption of water from yoghurt powder spray were investigated at ambient temperatures in the range of 20–40 ◦C and water activity ranging from 0.40 to 0.99. Sorption capacity decreased as temperature increased. Four models available in the literature (Chung-Pfost, Halsey, Henderson and Oswin) were evaluated by determining the best fit to the experimental data. The modified Chung-Pfost equation was found to be a good model for moisture adsorption and desorption of yoghurt powder spray. The critical value of equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of samples tested, corresponding to the water activity equal 0.6, was 8.1–8.9% (wet basis, w.b.) at the temperature of 20 ◦C. © 2003 IMACS.

6df351c73b7c0cd0456086974fcb4808c5f8e973	flexible framework for modeling water conveyance networks		A flexible framework for modeling different water conveyance networks is presented. The network is modeled using a linear canal pool model based on the Saint-Venant equations to describe transportation phenomenon occurring in open channels. This model is used as a link to connect different nodes defined by gates or reservoirs. The linear pool model has interesting features namely the pool axis monitoring, the inflow along the pool axis and the ability to consider different boundary conditions. Based on these characteristics canal pool observers for leak detection and localization can be developed. It is shown that based on a finite difference scheme a good performance is obtained for low space resolution. The modeling framework is validated with experimental data from a real canal property of the Évora University. This is a challenging configuration due to its strong canal pool coupling.	algorithm;apache axis;finite difference method;internationalization and localization;pool (computer science);water model	João Miguel Lemos Chasqueira Nabais;José Duarte;Miguel Ayala Botto;Manuel Rijo	2011			simulation;computer science	Robotics	93.5728311095102	0.3908172702974984	195784

The particle Sherwood number representing the dimensionless particle deposition flux is obtained as a function of the radial distance from the stagnation point. The charge heterogeneity is modeled as concentric bands bearing positive and negative charges on the substrate. When a negatively-charged particle approaches such a charge heterogeneous substrate, it experiences an alternating attractive and repulsive force due to the presence of different charges on the substrate. Consequently, as the particle moves radially outward from the stagnation point, it experiences a periodic array of favorable (attractive) and unfavorable (repulsive) regions on the substrate, giving rise to an oscillatory trajectory. The numerical results obtained from the finite element model are in excellent agreement with existing theoretical and experimental values of deposition rates on homogeneous collector surfaces. However, the results for particle deposition over a heterogeneous substrate depict a significant deviation from those predicted by the patchwise heterogeneity model due to the coupled influence of hydrodynamic interactions and the surface chemical heterogeneity of the collector. The particles that do not deposit over an unfavorable repulsive band are convected to the next favorable band by the tangential velocity. This increases the particle concentration at the leading edge of each favorable band resulting in an increase in particle deposition over the favorable bands and the overall deposition rate on to the collector. Application of this phenomenon will be discussed in context of developing micropatterned surfaces with engineered particle capture properties.	chemical vapor deposition;finite element method;flux qubit;interaction;numerical analysis;physical vapor deposition;radial (radio);velocity (software development)	Neda Nazemifard;Jacob Masliyah;Subir Bhattacharjee	2005	2005 International Conference on MEMS,NANO and Smart Systems	10.1109/ICMENS.2005.106	classical mechanics;statistical physics;chemistry;finite element method;particle deposition;physics;quantum mechanics;fluid dynamics	HPC	91.98441904182658	-1.5144578268750037	195834

Cosmologists use the rate of the expansion of space (the Hubble constant) to determine the age of the universe. Knowing the rate at which galaxies are separating, and the distances among them, one can work backwards to determine how much time has passed when, in theory, there was no separation at all. Most cosmologists expect the expansion rate to change with time. They had thought that the rate was faster in the past and that it slowed down to its current rate as gravity from all the mass in the universe gradually overcame the momentum from the Big Bang. Recently, however, astronomers observed very bright exploding stars called supernova to measure the universal expansion, and the results of these observations indicate that the universal expansion is speeding up, or accelerating. This implies that the expansion rate was less in the past, so it took more time for galaxies to reach their present separations than if they had always been receding at the more rapid current rate. This indicates that the universe is actually older than it appears from a simple calculation using the current Hubble constant.	galaxy;microwave;observable	Charles L.

The model is based on the known possibility to provide a statistically convergent estimate of the exact solution for a linear transport equation using the test particle Monte Carlo method. Accordingly, the flow field of the main gas is preliminary calculated and as a second step the linear transport equations obtained by fixing the target distribution in the collision term of the Boltzmann equation for both main and minority components are solved. Both solutions are based on appropriately devised test particle Monte Carlo methods. The second step, the critical one in evaluating the separation effects, is exact and thereby completely free of numerical diffusion. The model is described in details and illustrated by 2D test cases of atomic separation in shock fronts.	monte carlo method	Savino Longo;Paola Diomede	2009	J. Comput.

The nonlinear dynamic responses are analyzed by applying the reference of backlash bifurcation parameters. The motions of the system on the change of backlash are identified through global bifurcation diagram, largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), FFT spectra, Poincare maps, the phase diagrams and time series. The numerical results demonstrate that the system exhibits rich features of nonlinear dynamics such as the periodic motion, nonperiodic states and chaotic states. It is found that the sun-planet backlash has more complex effect on the system than the ring-planet backlash. The motions of the system with backlash of parallel gear are diverse including some different multi-periodic motions. Furthermore, the state of the system can change from chaos into quasi-periodic behavior, ...	multistage amplifier;nonlinear dynamics	Ling Xiang;Yue Zhang;Nan Gao;Aijun Hu;Jingtang Xing	2018	I. J.

In their work Brown and Paulus developed two dynamic models of brainstorming, a non-cognitive model and a cognitive model. These models describe for each participant, the evolution of ideas number over time, and are formalized by differential equations. Through solution functions of these models, we propose to calculate the number of ideas of each participant on any time intervals and thus in the future (called prediction). To enable computing solution functions, we used an optimization model to determine the model parameter values. In this paper, we propose an optimization model based on the fourth order Runge-Kutta's numerical method and we apply it to the cognitive model. Through some feasibility tests, we show the adequacy of the proposed approach to our prediction context.	cognitive model;mathematical optimization;numerical method;runge–kutta methods	Hassan Ait Haddou;Guy Camilleri;Pascale Zaraté	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.230	computer simulation;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;differential equation;statistics	SE	84.27506508046284	-3.0420027898973006	196366

A recent theory predicts that dissipationless spin currents can be induced purely by an electric field in conventional semiconductors. The dissipationless spin current is derived from a novel topological structure in momentum space, is independent of the sample disorder and leads to the intrinsic spin Hall effect. In hole doped semiconductors, with or without inversion symmetry breaking, there are no vertex corrections due to impurities scattering, and there are no extrinsic contributions to the spin Hall effect in the clean limit. The author analyzes a recent experiment on the spin Hall effect, and shows that it is consistent with the intrinsic nature of the effect. The author also shows that the spin Hall effect can be quantized in semiconductors with appropriate strain gradients, but in the absence of any external magnetic fields or the associated time reversal symmetry breaking.	doping (semiconductor);gradient;position and momentum space;semiconductor;spin hall effect;spin tensor;symmetry breaking;t-symmetry	Shoucheng Zhang	2005	2005 International Conference on MEMS,NANO and Smart Systems	10.1109/ICMENS.2005.120	quantum hall effect;quantum spin hall effect;hall effect;symmetry breaking;magnetic field;electric field;spin polarization;spin hall effect;nuclear magnetic resonance;scattering;condensed matter physics;physics;t-symmetry;quantum mechanics;thermal hall effect;position and momentum space	Robotics	94.64890849346112	-8.21740348101653	196800

As a mathematical model, the distributed Selkov system is used, since it describes the key step of glycolytic reaction cascade — the phosphofructokinase-catalyzed reaction. We argue that the emergence of spatial phase clusters does not correspond to the Turing mechanism because diffusion coefficients used for two considered reagents are taken as equal. We show that the actual background of this phenomenon is connected with various local rotation velocities in phase space. In this case, large diffusion coefficients stabilize spatial patterns and small diffusion provides an asynchronous regime only.	turing	Andrey Yu. Verisokin;Darya V. Verveyko	2013	I. J.

The system state tends to the so-called necessary path, or creode, when the exogenous signals are in a certain system-relevant range. The present work develops the homeorhesis-aware dynamical model for the motion of a single individual (e.g., human). The model allows for the purposeful behaviour of the individual, the creode, the exogenous forces, and the individual-specific sensitivity to their influences. The model also describes the homeorhetic-dysfunction movements. The transparency of the model is such that it allows a physical analogue in the form of electronic circuits. The model is a first step towards the construction of sociologically relevant models for the prediction of human behaviour. It is indispensable for the analyses of dangerous scenarios where the experiments are impossible, for example when predicting the behaviour of panic-stricken crowds in life-threatening situations. The work illustrates the corresponding numerical-simulation results with a series of figures and suggests topics for future research.	homeorhesis;simulation	M. J. Piotrowska;E. Mamontov;A.

It is composed of two rectangular waveguides with many stubs. One waveguide is put on another waveguide symmetrically. When one mode with odd electric field distribution is excited, the stubs work as open stubs and the mode propagates with very small loss. Guided regions of the left-handed mode and a right-handed mode are discussed using an approximate equivalent circuit. Tuning the structure parameters, the band gap between the two regions can be removed, and the wave propagates continuously from the left-handed frequency regions to the right-handed frequency region. The transmission line is applied to a leaky waveguide. It is confirmed experimentally that the beam angle of the radiation wave changes from the backward to the forward directions.	transmission line	Hiroshi Kubo;Hidetaka Kuwahara;Atsushi Sanada	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e91-c.11.1765	electronic engineering;band gap;telecommunications;leaky mode;optics;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	91.9329432042677	-8.509201683780304	197747

These simulations have been carried out for a special case of geometries called Tikhonov fitted geometries for alleviating the instability phenomenon commonly known as onset phenomenon in self-field MPD thrusters. The work was also extended to applied field MPD thrusters. A new equation for magnetic field was introduced to incorporate a virtual cathode. All the computations were carried out using a higher order integration scheme. The results obtained were found to be in good agreement with the previous work done on similar models.	mpd (programming language);mathematical model;plasma active	Sujay V. Kumar;S.

4dfed1bf7b874c7a3b5d47c7c5beb68754709b7d	accelerating optical absorption spectra and exciton energy computation via interpolative separable density fitting		We present an efficient way to solve the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE), a method for the computation of optical absorption spectra in molecules and solids that includes electron–hole interactions. Standard approaches to construct and diagonalize the Bethe–Salpeter Hamiltonian require at least O(N e ) operations, where Ne is the number of electrons in the system, limiting its application to smaller systems. Our approach is based on the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) technique to construct low rank approximations to the bare exchange and screened direct operators associated with the BSE Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the complexity of the Hamiltonian construction to O(N e ) with a much smaller pre-constant, and allows for a faster solution of the BSE. Here, we implement the ISDF method for BSE calculations within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA) in the BerkeleyGW software package. We show that this novel approach accurately reproduces exciton energies and optical absorption spectra in molecules and solids with a significantly reduced computational cost.

For the class of pr oblems considered here, t he lat t ice gas flow description can be reduced to a """"one-dimens ional"""" formula t ion; therefore such problems can be solved wit h low power computational techniques. @ 1989 Complex Systems Publications, Inc. 318 Lattice Boltzmann Equation for Laminar Boundary Flow The formation and growth of boundary layers is of cru cial importance in fluid dynamical flows, in particular as t heir occurrence triggers the development of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers . For viscous flow (at low Rey nolds number) , boundary layer pr oblems can be solved within the limi ts of reasonable approximations . Such problems so appear as an interesting test for the validity of the lat tice gas method and their solutions are a prerequisite to the understanding of mor e complex flows and of the three-dimensionalization in the transitio n to tur bulence. The pur pose of the present work is to show that laminar boundary flow can be treated efficient ly, that is, simply and economically, by the lattice gas method . The basic idea is the following: consider that a lattice gas, initially in homogeneous un idirectional motion, is suddenly put in contact with a wall. All lattice gas nodes in any layer parallel to the flow direct ion have the same particle distribution and, the system being translationally invariant, it suffices to perform one-dimensional computat ion to evaluate the velocity profil e. T he wall effects on the flow velocity are propagat ed by the particl es at the microscopic """"t hermal velocity,"""" whereas t he flow profil e modifi cations pr opagate via particle interactions, i.e. , at much lower speed. Interactions with the wall will first be felt on the first layer of the gas (i.e., the layer adjacent to the wall); at the next time st ep, they will be felt on the first and second layers , and progressively the successive lattice layers will be interactively involved. More pr ecisely, we consider a gas (density d) flowing parallel to a wall wit h free flow velocity Uo. Momentum is first exchanged between the wall and the first layer: the flow is slowed down in that layer due to velocity reversal of the particles colliding with the wall. T he first layer will come to a state of local equilibrium acquiring velocity U parallel to the wall with U < Uo. All layers beyond the first one remain at the free flow velocity Uo. During the second t ime st ep , the transport of the particles from the first layer will affect the second layer of the gas: particles in the second layer are now slowed down due to t he lower veloci ty in the first layer. The new equilibrium populations in the first and second layers ar e computed. The third ste p in the process will affect the third layer of the gas; however, the fresh values of the second layer computed from the second time step will exert an influ ence on the first layer so that equilibrium values for the first two layers must be up dated before that of the third be evaluated. At each time step of the process , the new equilibrium values of each underlying layer are updated from the fresh values obtained for the upper and lower adjacent layers a t the previous step and the next upper layer is included in the computation. At any given time, all the layers that have reached equilibrium and have a velocity value U ~ O.99Uo are considered to belong to the bo undary layer. Because of the discreteness of the lat ti ce, the exact value of the boundary layer thickness 8 must be evaluated (in general) by interpolation. The boundary layer thickness growth is much slower than the increase in the number of layers: the boundary layer thickness grows as the square root of the number of time st eps [8], whereas the number of layers is equal to the number of ti me steps.

72b7ed102933177b1bfad680f87818ca9d145166	simulation of wellbore stability during underbalanced drilling operation		The wellbore stability analysis during underbalance drilling operation leads to avoiding risky problems. These problems include (1) rock failure due to stresses changes (concentration) as a result of losing the original support of removed rocks and (2) wellbore collapse due to lack of support of hydrostatic fluid column. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to simulate the wellbore stability by incorporating finite element modelling and thermoporoelastic environment to predict the instability conditions. Analytical solutions for stress distribution for isotropic and anisotropic rocks are presented to validate the presented model. Moreover, distribution of time dependent shear stresses around the wellbore is presented to be compared with rock shear strength to select appropriate weight of mud for safe underbalance drilling.	anisotropic diffusion;data drilling;finite element method;instability;simulation	Reda Abdel Azim	2017	J.

Though traditionally modeled as a surface, the reaction zone is usually a thin layer (often a gel) abutting a flowing fluid or gas. Therefore, one would expect a more realistic model for the reacting zone to include the effects of transport in the gel. In this paper we examine the BIAcore, a device for measuring rate constants which has this geometry. To explain anomalous measurements from the device, it has been proposed that some flow penetrates into the dextran (gel) layer, thus enhancing transport. To analyze the reversible kinetics, asymptotic and singular perturbation techniques are used, yielding linear and nonlinear integrodifferential equations. Explicit and asymptotic solutions are constructed for cases motivated by experimental design. The results indicate that such flow penetration effects are bound to be negligible in surface-volume reactions, regardless of the flow model used.	depletion region;design of experiments;evanescent field;experiment;kinetics internet protocol;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;polymer;side effect (computer science);sol-gel;thickness (graph theory);velocity (software development)	David A.

One distribution models the transport of the Schvab–Zeldovich coupling function, or the mixture fraction to combine the energy and species equations. The other distribution models the quasi-incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with the low Mach number approximation. In the quasi-incompressible flows, the thermodynamics quantities depend on the coupling function but not on the hydrodynamic pressure, and the fluid components are assumed to be compressible only in the mixing/reaction region. A systematic and consistent approach to deriving LBEs for the general advection–diffusion equation and the quasi-incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are also presented. The streaming step of the LBEs are discretized by the total variation diminishing (TVD) Lax–Wendroff scheme. Numerical simulations are carried out to reproduce the low frequency flame oscillation (or flame flicker) of buoyant jet diffusion flame. Comparison between the quasi-incompressible model and the incompressible model is presented and the role of non-solenoidal velocity is examined. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The models utilise a varying viscosity that is constant away from a solid surface and that becomes infinite as the solid surface is approached. The varying viscosity introduces an inner boundary layer. Consequently, we are able to explain, qualitatively, the discrepancy between theoretical predictions of the conventional theory of fluid flow with experimental data of flow over a flat plate with distributed roughness. Our model also explains the discrepancy between an increased amount of drag observed in some experiments and a theoretical predicted drag from Newtonian fluids with a constant viscosity. Couette flow over a rough surface is utilised to demonstrate the underlining nature of the modelling. Arguments for the consistency of our models are provided.

Coupling conditions at the nodes of the network for these models are derived from the coupling conditions of kinetic equations. The results of the different models are compared and relations to a Keller-Segel model on networks are discussed. For a numerical approximation of the governing equations an asymptotic well-balanced schemes is extended to directed graphs. Kinetic and macroscopic equations are investigated numerically and their solutions are compared for tripod and more general networks.		Raul Borsche;Axel Klar;T. N.

742a39129dce529e3057ef0a34cf6743e3e7c380	double-ended travelling-wave fault location based on residual analysis using an adaptive ekf		This paper presents the estimated residuals for detecting the traveling wave front using an adaptive extended Kalman filter based on the maximum likelihood (EKF-ML), which uses the maximum likelihood method to adaptively optimize the error covariance matrices and the initial conditions. In some situations, such as faults close to the bus or close to zero inception angle, or faults with high fault resistances, the transient waves can become weak and even become lost in the noise, which makes the discrimination of the traveling wave front become more difficult. Aiming at this, residuals between the observed values and the estimated values using the adaptive EKF exhibit remarkable singularities, and can be used for exactly determining the wave front. Thus, the exact arrival time of the initial wave head can be determined and then the fault distance can be calculated precisely. The effectiveness of exacting mutation feature using the proposed method has been demonstrated by a simulated instantaneous pulse. And it has been tested with different types of faults using ATP simulation. Simulation results verify that the estimated residuals are highly sensitive to traveling wave front and less sensitive to modeling uncertainty (such as noise disturbance).	extended kalman filter	Yanhui Xi;Xiaodong Zhang;Zewen Li;Xiangjun Zeng;Xin Tang;Rachel Yeh;Hui Xiao	2018	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2017.0486	gravitational singularity;control theory;residual;mathematics;matrix (mathematics);wavefront;noise pollution;extended kalman filter;pulse (signal processing);covariance	Robotics	88.48388076827024	-6.957484819955988	199577

The determination of the lattice constant was made by minimizing the energy as a function of volume. The internal coordinate of the O-atom was optimized. From these optimizations we have found that the lattice constant is 8:482 Å and the bond length between Tb and O-atoms is 2:193 Å and the one for Bi and O-atoms is 2:051 Å. From a study of the DOS of f Tb, eg and t2g–Mn atomic-like orbitals for each spin polarization we conclude that there exists a permanent magnetic moment of about 16Bohr magneton per unit cell. Also, a metallic behavior is displayed, and thus it is expected that ferroelectricity will disappear. Inside the conduction band, next to Fermi level, two peaks in the DOS-spin-down are observed, which are due to f Tb. Therefore, conduction electrons will be spin-down polarized and this shows that Tb0:5Bi0:5MnO3 has possible applications in spintronics. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
