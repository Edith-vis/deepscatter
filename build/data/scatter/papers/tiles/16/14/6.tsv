Molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensors have proved useful for the determination of different compounds in different matrices with the required sensitivity and selectivity. In this work, a highly sensitive and selective molecularly imprinted polymer with electrochemical capabilities for the determination of TATP has been developed. The molecular imprinting has been performed via electropolymerisation onto a glassy carbon electrode surface by cyclic voltammetry from a solution of pyrrole functional monomer, TATP template and LiClO4. Differential Pulse Voltammetry of TATP, with LiClO4 as supporting electrolyte, was performed in a potential range of -2.0 V to +1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Three-factor two-level factorial design was used to optimise the monomer concentration at 0.1 mol∙L(-1), template concentration at 100 mmol∙L(-1) and the number of cyclic voltammetry scan cycles to 10. The molecularly imprinted polymer-modified glassy carbon electrode demonstrated good performance at low concentrations for a linear range of 82-44,300 µg∙L(-1) and a correlation coefficient of r(2) = 0.996. The limits of detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) achieved were 26.9 μg∙L(-1) and 81.6 μg∙L(-1), respectively. The sensor demonstrated very good repeatability with precision values (n = 6, expressed as %RSD) of 1.098% and 0.55% for 1108 and 2216 µg∙L(-1), respectively. It also proved selective for TATP in the presence of other explosive substances such as PETN, RDX, HMX, and TNT.	clinical use template;coefficient;explosive agents;imprinting (psychology);intrauterine devices;limit of detection;molecular imprinting;parts per billion;polymer;polyvinyl chloride;pyrroles;quantitation;reagents;really simple discovery;repeatability;selectivity (electronic);silver;synthetic intelligence;triacetone triperoxide;acetonitrile;cyclonite;lithium perchlorate;monomer;octogen;sensor (device)	Samuel Kassahun Mamo;J.

42f20ee2db84d0b71c6200cb703a803ecc18ebeb	a cost-effective, non-invasive system for pressure monitoring during epidural needle insertion: design, development and bench tests	sensors;force;pressure measurement;force measurement;area measurement;calibration;needles	Epidural blockade procedures have gained large acceptance during last decades. However, the insertion of the needle during epidural blockade procedures is challenging, and there is an increasing alarming risk in accidental dural puncture. One of the most popular approaches to minimize the mentioned risk is to detect the epidural space on the base of the loss of resistance (LOR) during the epidural needle insertion. The aim of this paper is to illustrate an innovative and non-invasive system able to monitor the pressure exerted during the epidural blockade procedure in order to detect the LOR. The system is based on a Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensor arranged on the top of the syringe's plunger. Such a sensor is able to register the resistance opposed to the needle by the different tissues transducing the pressure exerted on the plunger into a change of an electrical resistance. Hence, on the base of a peculiar algorithm, the system automatically detects LOR providing visual and acoustic feedbacks to the operator improving the safety of the procedure. Experiments have been performed to characterize the measurement device and to validate the whole system. Notice that the proposed solution is able to perform an effective detection of the LOR.	acoustic cryptanalysis;axel world;body tissue;calcium-sensing receptor;clinical act of insertion;cranial sinuses;error-tolerant design;experiment;gain;insertion mutation;lor gene;plunger device component;puncture wound;resistor device component;algorithm;physical hard work	Marco Tesei;Paola Saccomandi;Carlo Massaroni;Rossella Quarta;Massimiliano Carassiti;Emiliano Schena;Roberto Setola	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590673	calibration;pressure measurement;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;biological engineering;force;physics;quantum mechanics;surgery	Robotics	93.50807533093993	-23.491650082229672	87339

They have the potential to be used as sensors for various applications such as damage detection, stress analysis and monitoring of manufacturing processes and quality. In this paper, carbon fiber sensors are prepared to perform reliable strain measurements. Both experimental and computational studies were carried out on commercially available carbon fibers in order to understand the response of the carbon fiber sensors due to changes in the axial strain. Effects of parameters such as diameter, length, and epoxy-hardener ratio are discussed. The developed numerical model was calibrated using laboratory-based experimental data. The results of the current study show that sensors with shorter lengths have relatively better sensitivity. This is due to the fact short fibers have low initial resistance, which will increase the change of resistance over initial resistance. Carbon fibers with low number of filaments exhibit linear behavior while nonlinear behavior due to transverse resistance is significant in fibers with large number of filaments. This study will allow researchers to predict the behavior of the carbon fiber sensor in real life and it will serve as a basis for designing carbon fiber sensors to be used in different applications.	carbon;computation;computer simulation;diameter (protocol);diameter (qualifier value);epoxy resins;greater than;high- and low-level;large;mathematical model;nonlinear system;olfactory nerve;optical fiber;real life;stress–strain analysis;tissue fiber;transverse wave;adenotonsillectomy;sensor (device)	Salem Bashmal;Mohammed Siddiqui;Abul Fazal M.

However, the thermal properties of 3D FETs become worse than those of conventional planar MOSFETs. As a result, an increase in channel temperature during operation, which is called self-heating effects (SHEs) is prominent in nanoscale devices. In this work, 1) SHEs in scaled devices are experimentally evaluated. In particular, SHEs of SOI devices with ultra-thin (UT) buried oxide (BOX) are measured using a four-terminal gate electrode. Then, the modeling of thermal resistance/conductance of interconnect wires are discussed.

Motivated by the need to improve the yield rate of our first generation, rotating arm based peel demolding system, numerical models based on the explicit dynamic finite element method are developed in order to identify a minimum stress design of the process which can minimize the maximum stress of microstructures during demolding. A scale-up approach is proposed to reduce computational time for the micro-scale problems. The experimental tests are also carried out to verify the findings from numerical simulations. From this study, the roller based demolding system is identified as the optimal scheme in our analysis cases and is developed as our next generation automatic demolding system (the maximum pillar stress can reduce 20% comparing to the rotating arm scheme).	computation;computer simulation;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;numerical analysis;pdms;solver;time complexity	Chih-Hsing Liu;Wenjie Chen	2013	2013 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2013.6584096	materials science;structural engineering;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	Robotics	85.31695549815531	-12.916752765983228	88095
3616793271e0297dc3029759361ba75755bad5d7	a cooperative raman spectrum reconstruction platform for real-time in-vivo nano-biosensing		In the last few decades, the development of miniature biological sensors able to detect and measure different phenomena at the nanoscale has led to transformative disease diagnosis and treatment techniques. Among others, biofunctional Raman nanoparticles have been utilized in-vitro and in-vivo for multiplexed diagnosis and detection of different biological agents. However, existing solutions require the use of bulky lasers to excite the nanoparticles and similarly bulky and expensive spectrometers to measure the scattered Raman signals, which limit the practicality and applications of this nano-biosensing technique. In addition, due to the high path loss of the intra-body environment, the received signals are usually very weak, which hampers the accuracy of the measurements. In this paper, the concept of cooperative Raman spectrum reconstruction for real-time in vivo nano-biosensing is presented for the first time. The fundamental idea is to replace the single excitation and measurements points (i.e., the laser and the spectrometer, respectively) by a network of interconnected nano-devices able to simultaneously excite and measure nano-biosensing particles. More specifically, in the proposed system a large number of nanosensors jointly irradiate and distributively collect the Raman response of bio-functional nanoparticles traveling through the blood vessels. This paper presents a detailed description of the sensing system and, more importantly, proves its feasibility, by utilizing accurate models for intra-body light propagation and nanoparticle scattering processes. The numerical results show that with a certain density of nano-biofunctional particles, the reconstructed Raman spectrum can be recovered and utilized to accurately extract the targeted intra-body information.	british informatics olympiad;ccir system a;excite;gnu nano;multiplexing;numerical analysis;raman scattering;real-time clock;sensor;software propagation;video-in video-out	Hongzhi Guo;Zhi Sun;Josep Miquel Jornet	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116376	nanosensor;analytical chemistry;raman spectroscopy;raman scattering;nanoparticle;spectrometer;biosensor;laser;scattering;materials science	Vision	96.97958548291759	-21.510134662165086	88114

62225679e5439f34930eed99fc12ca0cb4fdee13	influence factors analysis on the modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges based on a free-interface mode synthesis algorithm	free interface modal synthesis method;design parameters;irregularly shaped bridges;dynamic substructure;modal characteristics	In order to relieve traffic congestion, irregularly-shaped bridges have been widely used in urban overpasses. However, the analysis on modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges is not exhaustive, and the effect of design parameters on modal characteristics will be deeply investigated in future studies. In this paper, a novel strategy based on a free-interface mode synthesis algorithm is proposed to evaluate the parameters’ effect on the modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges. First, a complicated, irregularly-shaped bridge is divided into several substructures based on its properties. Then, the modal characteristics of the overall structure can be obtained, only by a few low-order modal parameters of each substructure, using a free-interface mode synthesis method. A numerical model of a typical irregularly-shaped bridge is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Simulation results reveal that the free-interface mode synthesis method possesses favorable calculation accuracy for analyzing the modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges. The effect of design parameters such as ramp curve radius, diaphragm beam stiffness, cross-section feature, and bearing conditions on the modal characteristics of an irregularly-shaped bridge is evaluated in detail. Analysis results can provide references for further research into and the design of irregularly-shaped bridges.	algorithm;bending stiffness;bifurcation theory;diaphragm (acoustics);finite element method;futures studies;lateral thinking;mathematical model;modal logic;network congestion;numerical analysis;qualitative comparative analysis;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;stiffness matrix	Hanbing Liu;Mengsu Zhang;Xianqiang Wang;Shuai Tian;Yubo Jiao	2017	Algorithms	10.3390/a10020062	modal analysis using fem	EDA	84.58509989543631	-11.473916503309244	88413

In this work, metal-oxide-high-k dielectric-oxide-silicon (MOHOS) structures are fabricated using HfO2 and Dy2O3 high-k dielectrics as the charge storage layer. The Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si capacitors have a C–V memory window of 1.88 V and a leakage current density of 10 8 A/cm. This leakage current is lower than those of Al/SiO2/HfO2/SiO2/Si capacitors and other similar capacitors reported in the literature. A minimum detection window of 0.5 V for MOHOS capacitors can be maintained up to 2 · 10 s using asdeposited Dy2O3. The better performance of the Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si structure over Al/SiO2/HfO2/SiO2/Si is attributed to the larger conduction band offset at the Dy2O3/SiO2 interface (2.3 eV) versus 1.6 eV at the HfO2/SiO2 interface. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

195fa6a810556cbf8b8c80c497c3c1186447269e	image processing-aided fea for monitoring dynamic response of potato tubers to impact loading		Abstract Potato tubers suffer from dynamic loads during series of harvest and/or post-harvest operations, leading to the occurrences of mechanical damages. Supervision of dynamic responses upon impact from varied drop heights (200, 400 and 600 mm) onto rigid plate for potatoes was undertaken using finite element analysis (FEA) in this study. Two image processing-aided algorithms were developed and validated with reference methods for creating a potato digital model for FEA and determining the radius of curvature on contact point of the potato. A potato was taken as elastic and viscoelastic models in FEA respectively. The material parameters were derived from compression test and stress-relaxation test. Five response parameters of contact time T c , peak force time T p , maximum impact force F max , maximum deformation D max and coefficient of restitution r were selected to characterize dynamic response of potato collision. Results showed that T c and T p decreased slightly with the rise of drop height, while F max and D max showed positive correlations with drop heights. The value of r stayed high despite of material model and drop height. Dynamic responses presented similar but different values for viscoelastic model compared with elastic model, due to its viscous effect. It was also found that simulation results were highly dependent on modulus of elasticity for both models. Conclusions from this study can be used for monitoring occurrences of damages and solving other agricultural engineering problems with respect to material impact/collision.	federal enterprise architecture;image processing	Yingwang Gao;Chenbo Song;Xiuqin Rao;Yibin Ying	2018	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2018.05.027	deformation (mechanics);control engineering;viscoelasticity;coefficient of restitution;elasticity (economics);structural engineering;finite element method;engineering;young's modulus;compression (physics);impact	AI	85.982301518587	-12.227100091741413	88798

This phenomenon is directly linked to both the object and the gripper surface chemical composition. We propose to control adhesion by using chemical self-assembly monolayer (SAM) on both surfaces. Previous distance-force measurements done with AFM have shown that the liquid pH can be used to modify the adhesion and created repulsive force between the gripper fingers and the micro-objet. This paper shows the correlation between the force distance distance measurements and the micromanipulation tasks using chemically functionalized grippers.	atomic-force microscopy;self-assembly	Jérôme Dejeu;Patrick Rougeot;Michaël Gauthier;Wilfrid Boireau	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11598-1_25	stereochemistry;chemistry;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology	Robotics	92.00997047792222	-15.92104558214527	88949

fc4d307f9de809ccea656ad178059beb3a4423e7	pmma-coated capacitive type soil moisture sensor: design, fabrication, and testing		This paper describes the fringing electric field modeling and performance of four different shaped poly methyl methacrylate-coated capacitive sensors for soil moisture measurement. Experiments are carried out in the laboratory by placing the sensor inside the soil. The analytical solution for such fringing field system is difficult to obtain, so COMSOL Multiphysics software is used for modeling the capacitive sensor surrounded by the soil. Experimental data are compared with the software simulated value. Statistical root-mean-square error (RMSE) and percentage of normalized RMSE for polynomial fit are studied for the sensitivity and performance analysis. Effect of external temperature on the performance of the sensor is also discussed. The proposed signal conditioning circuit is implemented in printed circuit board to measure the output voltage with respect to capacitance change. Obtained results are transmitted through a global system for mobile communication module for remote observation of soil moisture. The thermogravimetric method is used for voltage to soil moisture calibration, and based on the experimental data, results are analyzed further. A review of some relevant fringing field capacitive sensors and their instrumentation system reported in past 7–8 years are studied for comparison with the proposed sensor system.

3ae29a235fddb7bd0afec0ca78d8cec4696c01cb	wide and fast wavelength-swept fiber laser based on dispersion tuning for dynamic sensing	fiber laser	We have developed a unique wide and fast wavelength-swept fiber laser for dynamic and accurate fiber sensing. The wavelength tuning is based on the dispersion tuning technique, which simply modulates the loss/gain in the dispersive laser cavity. By using wideband semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), the sweep range could be as wide as 180 nm. Since the cavity contains no mechanical components, such as tunable filters, we could achieve very high sweep rate, as high as 200 kHz. We have realized the swept lasers at three wavelength bands, 1550 nm, 1300 nm, and 800 nm, using SOAs along with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), and in two laser configurations, ring and linear ones. We also succeeded in applying the swept laser for a dynamic fiber-Bragg grating (FBG) sensor system. In this paper, we review our researches on the wide and fast wavelength-swept fiber lasers.	fiber laser	Shinji Yamashita;Yuichi Nakazaki;Ryosei Konishi;Osamu Kusakari	2009	J.

More technically, a biosensor is a probe that integrates a biological component, such as a whole bacterium or a biological product (e.g., an enzyme or antibody) with an electronic component to yield a measurable signal. Biosensors, which come in a large variety of sizes and shapes, are used to monitor changes in environmental conditions. They can detect and measure concentrations of specific bacteria or hazardous chemicals; they can measure acidity levels (pH).

This technique uses a microfeature enhanced heat exchanger that is inserted between the stator winding bundles. The DWHX is innovative, with the capability of generating large heat transfer coefficients, i.e., ~30 000 W/m2 · K, due to the small channel size and microfeatures. This cooling technique significantly reduces the thermal resistance from the stator windings to the ambient. The cooling technique is explained in detail, and an initial DWHX technology demonstrator electric machine is presented.

These may be attached to the trumpet in a similar manner to that of a tuning bell trumpet. The novel bells are designed to eliminate or enhance particular harmonics to change their brightness by altering the thickness of material, thus altering the impact of the vibrations to the sound column within it. This initial paper focuses on a comparison between the natural resonances of a current trumpet brass bell and various modified plastic bells using simulation software. Various designs are presented that show the resulting changes of the resonance harmonic mode frequencies and deformation amplitudes for Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) can be shifted toward that of brass depending on the thickness of the material thus paving the way for designed plastic trumpet bells with similar tones.	3d printing;bell's theorem;normal mode;rapid prototyping;resonance;simulation software;thickness (graph theory)	David Gibson	2016		10.14236/ewic/EVA2016.3	acoustics;engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering	HCI	89.49922614183926	-15.175365385598775	89504

ba42ce8e447c9b8b8115ae4a040e4de4bbf51e16	flexible non-contact electrodes for bioelectrical signal monitoring		Physiological signals such as ECG and EMG are closely related with human health and a long term monitoring of the physiological signals would be beneficial to detect possible disorders at the early stage. The wet electrodes currently used in the clinics require adhesives gels to record high-quality signals, which might cause discomfort of the patients and introduce some risk of skin allergy. Non-contact capacitive electrodes that can be operated without skin contact have been developed in previous studies, but these electrodes were rigid with electronic components on the back, which might not be an optimal solution for long term healthcare monitoring. In this study, a flexible non-contact electrode without any electronic components on both sides was designed for the long term acquisition of bioelectrical signals to maximize subject comfort. The flexible electrode was made up of multi-layer flexible printed circuits (FPC) materials and could be bent according to the local shape to achieve better non-contact capacitive coupling with the skin. The performance of the proposed flexible electrode was compared with that of the conventional wet electrodes in different signal recording conditions. The results showed that the proposed non-contact flexible electrode can capture high quality ECG and EMG signals, and its performance was comparable to the commonly used wet electrodes. This study might provide a reliable solution with great patient comfort for the long-term monitoring of biological signals.	adhesives;display resolution;drug allergy;electromyographs;electromyography;electronic component;gel;hypersensitivity;layer (electronics);limited stage (cancer stage);muscle rigidity;numerous;patients;printed circuit board;state printed on filter paper card:id:pt:nbs card:nom;electrode;skin allergy	Shuting Liu;Xueyu Liu;Yanbing Jiang;Xin Wang;Pingao Huang;Mingxing Zhu;Jingqian Tan;Peng Li;Chuang Lin;Guanghe Zhang;Shixiong Chen;Guanglin Li	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513306	capacitive sensing;capacitive coupling;electronic engineering;coupling;electrode;skin allergy;printed circuit board;computer science;electronic component	EDA	92.07180734556907	-21.209395323714407	89771

The apparatus comprises a two-part tapered plug assembly which is adapted to be installed in the tube in alignment with the tube sheet and expanded radially outward into tight engagement with the interior of a tube by pulling an inner wedge portion of the plug assembly axially relative to an outer ring portion. The pulling is effected by an hydraulic ram which is connected by a breakaway unit to a pull rod which slides axially relative to a compression tube both of which are received axially within the defective tube. The hydraulic ram pulls the rod relative to the compression tube and thereby draws the wedge inside the ring until the breakaway connection releases the pull rod and enables the pull rod, compression tube and auxiliary parts to be withdrawn from the defective tube. A shorter length of compression tube and pull rod is utilized for plugging the other end of the defective tube and for plugging U-bend types of heat exchangers.		Debra L. Smarkusky;Harold H. Smith;A.

In this paper, we fabricated magnetic sugar particles (MSPs) as porogen to control pore size, pore structure and pore density in the scaffold fabrication by particulate leaching method. Also a kind of new compound material — magnetic PVA is proposed and fabricated for aligning MSPs on desired positions and improving the layout of pores. In-plane magnetizer was utilized to create a permanent magnetic field with a specific pattern over a magnetic PVA layer. After biomaterial casting and removal of the sugar template, spherical pores were generated inside scaffold. Further preliminary cytocompatibility evaluation experiments of ferrite and NdFeB MSPs in developed scaffold were conducted with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Pass-band filtering of the complex spectrum is then used to achieve a complete time-domain separation of the constituent modes. The use of a compact surface-mounted sensor array to unscramble a multi-modal Lamb wave packet represents a novel development with potentially important implications for ultrasonic methods of structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing, in particular acousto-ultrasonics and acoustic emission. It provides in principle an opportunity to better exploit the significant diagnostic potential of modes above the first cut-off frequency, which traditionally has been difficult because of the time-domain complexity of mixed signals in this regime. More generally, it enables selective time-domain reconstruction of specific modes of interest, eliminating interference from other modes, boundary reflections and noise. An experimental case study involving a high frequency multi-modal Lamb wave inspection is used to validate and demonstrate the approach.	amap;acoustic cryptanalysis;amiga reflections;interference (communication);modal logic;multimodal interaction;network packet;scrambler;super high material cd;wave packet	Nik Rajic;Cedric Rosalie;Claire Davis;Patrick Norman	2013	2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing	10.1109/ISSNIP.2013.6529772	materials science;electronic engineering;acoustics;optics	Robotics	92.27032088933586	-21.797591736712018	90022

We blow jet flow into a cylindrical cavity via tangential nozzles to form a rotating air flow that generates a cupped negative pressure distribution and creates suction force. Subsequently, air is exhausted through an annular gap passage at the bottom of the sucker. The cupped pressure distribution and exhausting air flow, which can inhibit the effect of air leakage caused by the rough surfaces of workpieces, are the key technical features that distinguish the new sucker from currently available pneumatic suckers. In this paper, we present the design and study the characteristics of the new sucker via experiments that measure the suction force and pressure distribution. The results reveal that the height of the annular gap passage is a key design parameter that affects the negative pressure and suction force and that an optimal value for the height exists. In addition, we investigate the influence of the roughness of the workpiece surface. The observed pressure distributions suggest that rough surfaces slow down the rotating air flow such that the suction force decreases as the roughness of the workpiece surface increases, which, however, only causes a small extent of decline in the suction force. Furthermore, we compare the new sucker with two existing suckers: a traditional rubber sucker and a Bernoulli sucker. The comparison reveals that the new sucker is superior in handling rough workpieces and saving energy. Finally, we use the new sucker to pick up several types of workpieces to confirm its applicability. This research of developing a new pneumatic sucker was motivated by the problem of gripping of workpieces with rough surface. Traditional rubber suckers are invalid due to the air leakage caused by the rough surfaces of workpieces, and the existing Bernoulli sucker has the shortcoming of consuming a large amount of air. In this paper, we propose a pneumatic sucker forming rotating air flow in an upside-down cup-like cavity to generate suction force. We present the design and investigate a key design parameter (i.e., the height of the gap passage) via experiments. It is found that an optimal value for the height exists, and it is independent of the air consumption and roughness of workpieces. We then verify the merit in gripping rough-surface workpieces and saving air consumption via comparison with a rubber sucker and a Bernoulli sucker. At the end of the paper, we use the new sucker to pick up several types of workpieces to confirm its applicability. These examples show that the new sucker could replace manual work to complete sorting and packing operations and play an important role in fully automatic production lines.	adobe air;bernoulli polynomials;experiment;gap buffer;optimization problem;p. p. hammer and his pneumatic weapon;pneumatic artificial muscles;set packing;sorting;spectral leakage	Li Xin;Wei Zhong;Toshiharu Kagawa;Hao Liu;Guoliang Tao	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2014.2361251	structural engineering;natural rubber;surface roughness;engineering;gasket;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;force	Robotics	86.73011375725831	-13.987621768316798	90304

In a condition where the spherically convex surface is received in the concave surface, the slight step serves to cause a small gap between the spherically convex surface and a part of the first spherical surface.

It is the result of industrial waste and environmental accidents. One of the main sources of water pollution is suspended solids. When these suspended particles settle to the bottom of a water body, they become sediments. Optical methods offer two possibilities: scattering and transmission. The design of optical sensor systems is based on the interaction between the photons of the electromagnetic radiation and suspended particles in water. Pollution usually results in higher total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations or turbidity. Water pollution is caused by any chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water. Suspended solids are small particles of solid pollutants that float on the surface of, or are suspended in waters. Water pollution has become increasingly critical in this present-day, whether in the developed or the developing countries. Total suspended solids (TSS) in water can be detected by a number of optical sensing techniques, which involve light interaction with suspended particles in water. The measurements of the transmittance give a method for determining the concentration of the particles. The objectives of this study are to derive multispectral absorption algorithm and to develop an optical system, which is based on absorption measurements for measuring the concentration of total suspended solids,TSS in water. The multispectral absorption algorithm has been developed and a new multispectral optical sensor system designed for measuring total suspended solids TSS concentrations in polluted water. The development of the optical algorithm was based on the Beer-Lambert law. Firstly, the water samples used for calibration were filtered and dried to obtain the TSS values. In this study, three light emitting diodes were used as sensing emitters (sources) and a silicon phototransistor as radiations detector. The radiation values were determined from the output voltage readings of the sensor system. An electronic circuit was designed and the readings were measured by using a digital multimeter. The major advantages in using an LED as the light sources are its relatively low power consumption and ability to be modulated electronically at rapid rates. Standard polluted samples were prepared for sensors calibration. As the concentration of total suspended solids P was increased, the intensity of the transmitted light decreased. The level of the photocurrent was linearly proportional to the pollutants concentration. The proposed multispectral algorithm was calibrated using the measured parameters. Its accuracy was determined based on correlation coefficient,R and the value of the root-mean square errors,RMSE. The results showed a good correlation between the radiation values and the total suspended solids concentrations. This optical system provides various advantages over the current portable turbidity meter, which uses a single infrared source. The main advantage is its capability provide water pollution levels accurately (i.e. total suspended solids concentration). It only requires inexpensive components and can be assembled easily. The proposed algorithm produced a high correlation coefficient and low root mean square error value. This new methodology is very important for measuring and monitoring TSS in polluted water areas.	algorithm;atmospheric dispersion modeling;coefficient;diode;electronic circuit;image sensor;mean squared error;modulation;multispectral image;water cooling	Sami Gumaan Daraigan;Syahril Amin Hashim;Mohd.

eaf4588530b30860460441a7fe75e12515e77e0b	experimental study of the oriented immobilization of antibodies on photonic sensing structures by using protein a as an intermediate layer	integrated photonics;biosensing;ring resonator;sensor	A proper antibody immobilization on a biosensor is a crucial step in order to obtain a high sensitivity to be able to detect low target analyte concentrations. In this paper, we present an experimental study of the immobilization process of antibodies as bioreceptors on a photonic ring resonator sensor. A protein A intermediate layer was created on the sensor surface in order to obtain an oriented immobilization of the antibodies, which enhances the interaction with the target antigens to be detected. The anti-bovine serum albumin (antiBSA)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) pair was used as a model for our study. An opto-fluidic setup was developed in order to flow the different reagents and, simultaneously, to monitor in real-time the spectral response of the photonic sensing structure. The antiBSA immobilization and the BSA detection, their repeatability, and specificity were studied in different conditions of the sensor surface. Finally, an experimental limit of detection for BSA recognition of only 1 ng/mL was obtained.	antibody microarray;biosensors;blocking (computing);british informatics olympiad;cattle;durability (database systems);experiment;flow;gelatin;immobiliser;pack unit;physical restraint (procedure);preparation;reagents;real-time clock;repeatability;resonator device component;sensitivity and specificity;serum albumin;serum albumin, bovine;serum metabolome database;staphylococcal protein a;analyte;sensor (device)	Raffaele Caroselli;Javier García Castelló;Jorge Escorihuela;María José Bañuls;Ángel Maquieira;Jaime García-Rupérez	2018		10.3390/s18041012	analytical chemistry;protein a;antibody;engineering;photonics;detection limit;analyte;serum albumin;biosensor	Robotics	94.49381490989897	-17.97626793748987	90681

The oxide was synthesized by a microwave-assisted colloidal method in presence of ethylenediamine after calcination at 600 °C. This CoSb2O6 oxide crystallized in a tetragonal structure with cell parameters a = 4.6495 and c = 9.2763 Å, and space group P4(2)/mnm. To prove its physical, chemical and sensing properties, the oxide was subjected to a series of tests: Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and impedance (Z) measurements. Microstructures, like columns, bars and hollow hemispheres, were observed. For the CO2 sensing test, a thick film of CoSb2O6 was used, measuring the impedance variations on the presence of air/CO2 flows (0.100 sccm/0.100 sccm) using AC (alternating current) signals in the frequency-range 0.1-100 kHz and low relative temperatures (250 and 300 °C). The CO2 sensing results were quite good.	carbon dioxide;characteristic impedance;column (database);crystal structure;ethylenediamine;flow;kilohertz;microscopes, electron, scanning;microwave;oxides;quantitative impedance;radionuclide imaging;raman scattering;scanning electron microscopy;spectroscopy, near-infrared;wafer (electronics);electric impedance	Alex Guillén-Bonilla;Verónica-María Rodríguez-Betancourtt;Martín Flores-Martínez;Oscar Blanco-Alonso;Juan Reyes-Gómez;Lorenzo Gildo-Ortiz;Héctor Guillén-Bonilla	2014		10.3390/s140915802	chemical synthesis;cobalt;chemistry;temperature;analytical chemistry;carbon dioxide;organic chemistry;nanotechnology;antimony;conductometry	Networks	93.32255786015445	-17.098036228458916	91163

We discuss a modification of the so-called short-only calibration, in order to increase the accuracy of the measurements. We relate the material properties of a sample under study to the measured surface impedance, which is affected by the geometry of the measurement, and we discuss the effects on the proposed approximate calibration procedure. We experimentally check the applicability of the approximations at the ground of the method, and we thoroughly discuss the uncertainties related to the approximations employed. Finally, we report the sample measurements of the surface impedance of two MgB2 superconducting films.	3d film;approximation algorithm;characteristic impedance;experiment;hall effect;nominal impedance	Enrico Silva;Nicola Pompeo;Kostiantyn Torokhtii;Stefano Sarti	2016	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2016.2534380	electronic engineering;calibration;engineering;electrical engineering;conductivity;electrical impedance;focused impedance measurement;instrumentation;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Visualization	89.78085414466452	-20.11356869609083	91357
02215eecd48ef3c4ed4d2137f1fddd5a9047bb91	utilization of a composite hole transporting layer and novel homogeneous double emitting layers for performance improvement and low efficiency roll-off in organic light-emitting diodes	homogeneous;double emitting layers;composite hole transporting layer	Abstract Blue organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) combing a composite hole transporting layer (c-HTL) and novel homogeneous double emitting layers (DELs) have been fabricated. The c-HTL plays a significant role of rectification in balancing the carriers’ injection concentration which matches well with the DELs structure. The DELs is consisted of two homogeneous hosts, such as 2-methyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl) anthracene (MADN) and 9,10-di(2-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN). The optimal device presents the maximal current efficiency of 15.9 cd/A at 4.9 mA/cm 2 and the minor efficiency roll-off of 13.4% under the driving voltage varying from 5 V to 10 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the device’s maximal current efficiency and the corresponding efficiency roll-off have been obviously improved by 55.9% and 63.9% compared with those of the conventional device. These results indicate that the homogeneous DELs not only greatly facilitate carriers’ injection into the emitting layer (EML), but also evenly modulate carriers’ distribution due to natural energy barrier of the interface. The transient photoluminescence decay of double hosts further illustrates that the DELs structure can increase the recombination ratio of electron–hole pairs and improve the exciton’s utilization. Additionally, the optimal device’ current density is reduced by 44.1% under the same luminance of 25,780 cd/m 2 compared with that of the conventional device.	diode;electron hole;exciton;high threshold logic;maximal set;oled;performance;rectifier;roll-off	Xiaoming Wu;Xin Zhang;Juanjuan Bai;Yulin Hua;Liwen Xin;Qianqian Yu;Shougen Yin	2015	Displays	10.1016/j.displa.2015.03.004	homogeneous;electronic engineering;optoelectronics;optics;physics	ML	92.16493599522597	-13.734097475723397	91366

Defects observed after As implants of 6E15cm^-^2 through screen oxide after low-temperature anneal were annihilated at the subsequent high-temperature steps, but the direct implant of As into the silicon is preferred since fewer defects are generated and there is no knock-on of oxygen into the material. Fabricated devices showed excellent electrical performance. However, the upper limit (dose and/or energy) at which perfect recrystallization does no longer occur has not been defined and the process limit is consequently not established.	ion implantation;radio frequency	H.

This article describes the optimization and miniaturization of an enzymatic assay using a chemiluminescence reaction. The analytical performance and detection limit for determination of Hg(II) was optimized in 96 well plates and further extended to 384 well plates with a 10-fold reduction in assay volume. Inhibition of the enzyme activity by dissolved Hg(II) was found to be linear in the range 5-500 pg·mL(-1) with 3% CV in inter-batch assay. Due to miniaturization of assay in 384 well plates, Hg(II) was measurable as low as 1 pg·mL(-1) within 15 min. About 10-fold more specificity of the developed assay for Hg(II) analysis was confirmed by challenging with interfering divalent metal ions such as cadmium Cd(II) and lead Pb(II). Using the proposed assay we could successfully demonstrate that in a composite mixture of Hg(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II), inhibition by each metal ion is significantly enhanced in the presence of the others. Applicability of the proposed assay for the determination of the Hg(II) in spiked drinking and sea water resulted in recoveries ranging from 100-110.52%.	adverse reaction to drug;apple electric car project;biological assay;cadmium;chemiluminescence;dynamic range;entity name part qualifier - adopted;enzyme assays;ethanol;high-throughput computing;horseradish peroxidase;ions;limit of detection;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mercury 2+;mercury poisoning, nervous system;metals;miniaturization;pb2+;quantitation;recovery - action;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;throughput;utility functions on indivisible goods;alcohol oxidase;enzyme activity;filtration;mixture;sequestering of mercury	Kanchanmala Deshpande;Rupesh K.

In the previous work, a computational model for chemical sensor arrays has been proposed based on physiological properties of mouse taste bud cells (TBCs). The model consists of three functional parts: the chemical sensor, the random pulse generator, and the stochastic synchronizer. The chemical sensor array based on the computational model detects the concentration of chemical substances as the degree of stochastic synchronization. For practical implementation, we compare the probabilistic firing properties of an array of resonate-and-fire neuron (RFN) models and those of an array of leaky integrate-and-fire neuron models in order to consider their feasibility as the second part of a chemical sensor array. We further investigate stochastic synchronization in uncoupled integrated circuits implementing the RFN model in order to confirm if they act as the third part of a chemical sensor array on a practical hardware platform.	neuron;sensor	Kazuki Nakada;Katsumi Tateno;Hatsuo Hayashi;Kiyonori Yoshii	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-04025-2_22	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	97.08258445959255	-20.450307501601166	91702

However, the roughness of the free surface of flow and its temporal variation in a pipe is a dynamic and non-stationary process that is difficult to measure directly. This work examines a new acoustic method that is used to study the characteristics of the free surface roughness under controlled laboratory conditions. The acoustic method makes use of a continuous sine wave that is transmitted through the air above the turbulent flow of water over a section of the pipe instrumented with an array of wave probes and microphones. The results obtained for a representative range of flow regimes and variety of pipe bed conditions illustrate that it is possible to unambiguously relate variations in the recorded acoustic field to the standard deviation in the free surface roughness and mean flow depth. These variations are clearly linked to the hydraulic friction factor of the pipe, which is shown to be related to airborne acoustic data obtained non-invasively.	acoustic cryptanalysis;airborne ranger;fill;friction;microphone;short interspersed nucleotide elements;standard deviation;stationary process;turbulence;disease transmission	Anna V.

The pressure sensor is composed of 16 sensing cells in parallel, and each sensing cell includes a suspended membrane and an NMOS. The suspended membrane is the movable gate of the NMOS. The pressure sensor needs a post-process to obtain the suspended membrane after the CMOS process. The post-process employs etchants to etch the sacrificial layers to release the suspended membrane, and then a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) parylene is used to seal the etching holes in the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor produces a change in current when applying a pressure to the sensing cells. Experimental results show that the pressure sensor has a sensitivity of 0.022@mA/kPa in the pressure range of 0-500kPa.	cmos;microelectromechanical systems	Ching-Liang Dai;Pin-Hsu Kao;Yao-Wei Tai;Chyan-Chyi Wu	2008	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2007.12.015	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;cmos;physics	EDA	92.43608151311459	-11.044894814303293	91976

The residue deposition from KOH etching of Si is typically regarded as a disadvantage of this technology. In this report, we make use of this residue as a second masking layer to fabricate two-layer complex structures. Square patterns with size in the range of 15⁻150 μm and gap distance of 5 μm have been designed and tested. The residue masking layer appears when the substrate is over-etched in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution over a threshold. The two-layer structures of micropyramids surrounded by wall-like structures are obtained according to the two different masking layers of SiO₂ and residue. The residue masking layer is stable and can survive over KOH etching for long time to achieve deep Si etching. The process parameters of etchant concentration, temperature, etching time and pattern size have been investigated. With well-controlled two-layer structures, useful structures could be designed for applications in plasmonic and microfluidic devices in the future.	etching (microfabrication);greater than;helicon focus;hydrofluoric acid;hydroxide ion;international system of units;layers (digital image editing);maxima and minima;microchip analytical devices;microfluidics;microtechnology;ork;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;plasmon;potassium hydroxide;selectivity (electronic);silicon;star height;substrate (electronics);anatomical layer;width	Han Lu;Huaguang Zhang;Mingliang Jin;Tao He;Guofu Zhou;Lingling Shui	2016		10.3390/mi7020019	materials science;ceramic materials;reactive-ion etching;dry etching;isotropic etching;etching;nanotechnology;pattern;physics	HCI	93.6604103021587	-15.038243550998477	92062

In this study, we utilize the maximum entropy fracture model (MEFM) to predict and validate cyclic hysteresis in Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu and Sn3.0Ag0.5 solder alloys through a damage enhanced Anand viscoplasticity model. MEFM is a single-parameter, information theory inspired model that aims to provide the best estimate for accumulated damage at a material point in ductile solids in the absence of detailed microstructural information. Using the developed model, we predict the load drop during cyclic fatigue testing of the two chosen alloys. A custom-built microscale mechanical tester was utilized to carryout isothermal cyclic fatigue tests on specially designed assemblies. The resultant relationship between load drop and accumulated inelastic dissipation was used to extract the geometry and temperature-independent damage accumulation parameter of the maximum entropy fracture model for each alloy. The damage accumulation relationship is input into the Anand viscoplastic constitutive model, allowing prediction of the stress–strain hysteresis and cyclic load drop. The damage accumulation model is validated by comparing predicted and measured load drops after 55 and 85 cycles respectively for Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu and Sn3.0Ag0.5 solder alloys. The predictions agreed to within 10% and 20% of the experimental observations respectively for the two alloys. The damage enhanced Anand model developed in this study will enable the tracking of crack fronts during finite element simulations of fatigue crack initiation and propagation in complex solder joint geometries.	hysteresis	Jonathon P.

The results showed that Al(III) and Al(13) can activate the enzymatic activity of MDH, and the activation reaches maximum levels as the Al(III) and Al(13) concentration increase. Our study also found that the effects of Al(III) and Al(13) on the activity of MDH depended on the pH value and aluminum speciation. Electrochemical and circular dichroism spectra methods were applied to study the effects of nano-sized aluminum compounds on biomolecules.	aluminum compounds;aluminum measurement;circular dichroism;gnu nano;glass;google compute engine;interaction;malate dehydrogenase;multi-walled nanotube;nadh;nanotubes;nonketotic hyperglycinemia;numerous;enzyme activity;negative regulation of secondary cell wall biogenesis;oxidation	Xiaodi Yang;Ling Cai;Yu Peng;Huihui Li;Rong Fu Chen;Ren Fang Shen	2011		10.3390/s110605740	circular dichroism;carbon;biochemistry;catalysis;nad+ kinase;redox;chemistry;spectroscopy;electrochemistry;electrode;organic chemistry;inorganic chemistry;physical chemistry;glass;malate dehydrogenase;kinetics	HCI	95.82153665672183	-16.666764941538002	92179

Thus, they are, for instance, very suitable for being applied as electrodes integrated in clothing to measure biomedical parameters of a person. For this purpose they need to be modified to provide reliable electro-conductive properties. This can be achieved by depositing metals on the textile surface. Copper and gold are good materials to be used for this purpose because of their outstanding electro-conductive properties and possibility to deposit them in form of a thin layer on the surface of a fiber. In this work preference was given to copper. Hence, a thin layer of copper was deposited on synthetic yarns by means of an electroless deposition. This paper states the coating method for the copper deposition on para-aramide yarns. Further, it reports the first results on the characterization of the copper layer and the performance of the resulting yarns.	chemical vapor deposition;physical vapor deposition;synthetic intelligence	Anne Schwarz;Jean Hakuzimana;Philippe Westbroek;Lieva Van Langenhove	2009	2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks	10.1109/BSN.2009.24	gold;metallizing;electrode;clothing;copper	Vision	92.11108856001538	-16.984014007518365	92340
4681e018f79391a7c6eb5d9a0cfce1ba0d19c2cb	study of micro-bga solder joint reliability	solder joint reliability;dwell time;ball grid array;nitrogen	A new re¯ow parameter, heating factor (Q g), which is de®ned as the integral of the measured temperature over the dwell time above liquidus, has been proposed in this report. It can suitably represent the combined eect of both temperature and time in usual re¯ow process. Relationship between reliability of the micro-ball grid array (micro-BGA) package and heating factor has been discussed. The fatigue failure of micro-BGA solder joints re¯owed with dierent heating factor in nitrogen ambient has been investigated using the bending cycle test. The fatigue lifetime of the micro-BGA assemblies ®rstly increases and then decreases with increasing heating factor. The greatest lifetime happens at Q g near 500 s °C. The optimal Q g range is between 300 and 750 s °C. In this range, the lifetime of the micro-BGA assemblies is greater than 4500 cycles. SEM micrographs reveal that cracks always initiate at the point of the acute angle where the solder joint joins the PCB pad.	ball grid array;soldering	P. L. Tu;Y. C. Chan;K. C. Hung;J. K. L.

The electrode modification was achieved in order to separate the voltammetric peaks of ascorbic acid and uric acid when present in the same solution. On the modified electrodes the potential of the oxidation peak of the ascorbic acid was shifted to more negative values by over 0.3 V, while in the case of uric acid, the negative potential shift was about 0.15 V compared to the bare glassy carbon electrode. When the two compounds were found together in the solution, on the bare electrode only a single broad signal was observed, while on the modified electrode the peak potentials of these two compounds were separated by 0.4 V. When the uric acid concentration remained constant, the peak intensity of the ascorbic acid is increased linearly with the concentration (r2 = 0.996) and when the ascorbic acid concentration remains constant, the peak intensity of the uric acid increased linearly with the concentration (r2 = 0.992). FTIR measurements supported the formation of inclusion complexes. In order to characterize the modification of the electrodes microscopic studies were performed. The modified electrodes were successfully employed for the determination of ascorbic acid in pharmaceutical formulations with a detection limit of 0.22 µM.	amino acids;ammonia measurement;ascorbic acid;carbon-carbon lyases;dental caries;dosage forms;injectable solution;pei-yuan wei;personal experience inventory;pharmaceutical preparations;polyethyleneimine;probability;recovery - action;spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;uric acid;whole earth 'lectronic link;electrode;oxidation	Luminta Fritea;Mihaela Tertis;Cecilia Cristea;Robert Sandulescu	2013		10.3390/s131216312	chromatography;biochemistry;chemistry;detection limit;electrochemistry;electrode;inorganic chemistry;physical chemistry	Web+IR	96.1967057641752	-17.00436194443789	92418
1f2d0a9182bbab10992904a962c51bc8f05e42d4	low frequency noise characteristics in p-type mosfet with multilayer wse2 channel and al2o3 back gate dielectric		Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) has recently attracted great attention for microelectronics and other applications. In this paper, we present the low frequency noise spectra in one of the typical TMDC, i.e., the WSe2 channel p-type MOSFET with back-gated Al2O3 dielectric. We observed that the noise power spectra all show 1/fα characteristic with α near 1. The analysis on the spectra in linear and saturation regions as a function of drain current demonstrates that the carrier number fluctuation is the dominant mechanism responsible to the noise. The correlated mobility fluctuation has a minor contribution in order to quantitatively account for the experimental observations. We also observed a correlated asymmetric effect of source and drain in both IV and noise spectra, showing that the Schottky contact may have contribution to the noise. This presentation provides new evidence that the noise spectra are a very powerful tool in the characterization of emerging semiconductor MOSFETs.	cmos;gate dielectric;noise power;quantum fluctuation;schottky barrier;semiconductor;text mode demo contest;universal conductance fluctuations;web services enhancements	Hui Shen;Huiwen Yuan;Sitong Bu;Mingyue He;Daming Huang	2017	2017 IEEE 12th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)	10.1109/ASICON.2017.8252490	microelectronics;schottky barrier;electronic engineering;noise power;infrasound;optoelectronics;gate dielectric;semiconductor;mosfet;computer science;dielectric	EDA	92.29674639093079	-12.818731244455421	92775

8fe3e4a32976d97739fb2ae11ba10d19d6fd8b98	thermotechnical modelling of hard turning: a computational fluid dynamics approach		During hard turning the original hardness of the surface layer changes, as does its texture structure and stress state. Even cracks and other defects may appear if the heat effect is too intense. As experimental investigations into heat effects are difficult and expensive, simulation investigation methods based on modelling are of great significance. In this paper an example of heat modelling of hard turning is presented. The layer thickness on the workpiece surface that reaches high temperature is determined. In that layer different modifications can occur due to heat. It was found that the thickness of the layer affected by heat depends primarily on the feed and only secondarily on other cutting parameters. The cooling gradient of the layer was determined, allowing conclusions to be drawn on the re-tempering of the heated layer. The computational fluid dynamics method and a commercial software was used for the modelling and proved to be suitable for the simulation analysis of the hard turning process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

5f552391738f3cb3135229b5abb42e6e77592607	electrochemical capacitance dna sensing at hairpin-modified au electrodes		An interfacial capacitance measurement electrochemical technique has been used for the sensing of self-assembled DNA hairpin probes (M. tuberculosis and B. anthracis) attached to Au electrodes. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was determined with electrochemical perturbations from 0.2 V to 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl at a Au/M. tuberculosis DNA hairpin probe at surface coverage Au electrodes. The capacitance study was done at pH 7, which was necessary to maintain the M. tuberculosis and B. anthracis DNA probes closed during the electrochemical perturbation. Detailed experimental analysis carried out by repetitively switching the electrochemical potential between 0.2 and 0.5 V (versus Ag/AgCl) strongly supports the use of capacitance measurements as a tool to detect the hybridization of DNA targets. A large change in the capacitance deference between 0.2 and 0.5 V was observed in the DNA hybridization process. Therefore, no fluorophores or secondary transducers were necessary to sense a DNA target for both DNA hairpins.		Joel Rivera-Gandía;Maria del Mar Maldonado;Yarimar De La Torre-Meléndez;Edwin O.

The proposed doping is characterized by the absence of halos at the source and drain ends. We propose a Gaussian doping distribution inside the source and drain regions, and a low-high-low distribution across the depth of the transistor from the channel surface towards the body region. It also has a low-high-low doping distribution along the length of the transistor below the channel region. The analysis is performed by changing the doping densities, body bias and gate-source voltage (Vgs) to observe the variations of off-current (Ioff), threshold voltage and Ion/Ioff ratio. Results show that the optimized device with the proposed doping profile would provide higher drain current (Ion) and Ion/Ioff at a certain body bias.	and gate;doping (semiconductor);gaussian blur;ion implantation;qualitative comparative analysis;transistor	MunEm Hossain;Masud H.

The tester has a corona charger and surface potential detectors in a cylindrical grounded body. The corona charger provides a surface charge on the test material, and the surface potential detectors measure the traveling motion of the surface charge. The traveling speed of the surface charge is dependent on the surface resistivity of the test material; therefore, the surface resistivity can be determined without contact to the material. An equivalent circuit with a 1-D ladder circuit was predicted, which includes the surface resistance of the material, the volume resistance of air, and the capacitance between the cylinder and the test material. From analysis of the equivalent circuit, the surface resistivity for an insulative surface was found to be a function of ρs/(ρvδ), where ρs is the surface resistivity of the test material, ρv is the volume resistivity of air, and δ is the gap between the test surface and the cylinder. For conductive and dissipative surfaces, the surface resistivity is dependent on ε0ρs/δ, where ε0 is the permittivity of air. The measurement concepts were experimentally verified using a needle-type corona charger, two induction probes, and a surface potential meter. The predicted surface resistivity measured using this method was consistent with the surface resistivity measured with a contact-type surface resistivity tester.	battery charger;cylinder seal;discharger;equivalent circuit;experiment;integrated circuit;sensor;sheet resistance	T.

Electrode performance was characterized in vitro using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and compared with sputtered thinfilm platinum (TFPt) electrodes. We characterized electrode impedance, charge storage capacity, voltage transient properties, and relative surface area enhancement in vitro. Preliminary lifetime testing of the electrode reveals that the NCPt electrodes degrade more slowly than TFPt electrodes. The combination of material biocompatibility, electrochemical performance, and preliminary lifetime results point to a promising new electrode material for neural interface devices.	brain–computer interface;characteristic impedance;cisplatin;dielectric spectroscopy;exhibits as topic;gnu nano;in vitro [publication type];interface device component;microelectrodes;physical vapor deposition;platinum;quantitative impedance;semiconductor;tcf3 fusion partner;vacuum deposition;biocompatibility;electrode;voltage	Kedar G.

In addition, a post N(2) annealing was used to improve the sensing properties. At first, the pH sensitivity, hysteresis, drift, and light induced drift of the ISFETs were evaluated. After the covalent bonding process and urease immobilization, the urea sensitivity of the EnFETs were also investigated and compared with the conventional Si(3)N(4) sensing layer. The ISFETs and EnFETs with annealed Ta(2)O(5) sensing membranes showed the best responses, including the highest pH sensitivity (56.9 mV/pH, from pH 2 to pH 12) and also corresponded to the highest urea sensitivity (61 mV/pC(urea), from 1 mM to 7.5 mM). Besides, the non-ideal factors of pH hysteresis, time drift, and light induced drift of the annealed samples were also lower than the controlled Ta(2)O(5) and Si(3)N(4) sensing membranes.	coefficient;covalent interaction;field effect (semiconductor);hysteresis;immobiliser;ions;mv-algebra;maxima and minima;pyschological bonding;simulated annealing;tantalum;tissue membrane;transistor;urea;urease;silicon nitride	Cheng-En Lue;Ting-Chun Yu;Chia-Ming Yang;Dorota Genowefa Pijanowska;Chao-Sung Lai	2011		10.3390/s110504562	electronic engineering;tantalum;chemistry;analytical chemistry;inorganic chemistry	HCI	93.3024409704625	-15.851253841638325	93819

The front wall of the housing, which is spaced from the lower end of the diverter, incorporates a slightly upwardly inclined deflector, which directs substantially all of the air incoming to the hood upwardly and rearwardly directly towards for movement through the filter, and out of the exhaust outlet, and since the air is generally unencumbered by any structure in the path of its flow, it moves in a rather parallel course with the arranged diverter, and rapidly exits carrying the entrained fumes therewith significantly reducing the BTU requirements for operation of this hood. A thinly slotted diffuser extending approximately the width of the hood maintains a thin film air flow through the same and thereby enhancing the efficiency of operation of the hood through a minimum of absorption of tempered air. A second deflector functions in cooperation with a first named deflector, and directs a minor segment of the air flow substantially downwardly for creating an air shield above the frontal portion of the heating apparatus, to thereby prevent the escape of any generated fumes from avoiding entrainment with the major flow of air passing through the filter and out of the hood by way of its exhaust conduit.

Nevertheless, fiber-optic sensing of liquids has been largely restricted to measurements of refractive index and absorption spectroscopy. The temporal dynamics of fluid evaporation have potential applications in monitoring the quality of water, identification of fuel dilutions, mobile point-of-care diagnostics, climatography and more. In this work, the fiber-optic monitoring of fluids evaporation is proposed and demonstrated. Sub-nano-liter volumes of a liquid are applied to inline fiber-optic micro-cavities. As the liquid evaporates, light is refracted out of the cavity at the receding index boundary between the fluid and the ambient surroundings. A sharp transient attenuation in the transmission of light through the cavity, by as much as 50 dB and on a sub-second time scale, is observed. Numerical models for the transmission dynamics in terms of ray-tracing and wavefront propagation are provided. Experiments show that the temporal transmission profile can distinguish between different liquids.	body cavities;decibel;embedded system;embedding;evaporation;experiment;eye;fiber optic sensor;gnu nano;liquid substance;optical fiber;ray tracing (graphics);software propagation;tissue fiber;unit propagation;liter	Eyal Preter;Borut Preloznik;Vlada Artel;Chaim N.

This prediction requires an a priori chosen surface normal velocity of the active transducer surface, which often does not coincide with the actual surface normal velocity. By contrast, in our work we solve an inverse problem, which yields a spatially discretized weighting function (distribution) for the surface normal velocity of the active transducer surface. Furthermore, this estimated distribution of the surface normal velocity is used to compare simulated data to measured output signals for a transiently excited ultrasound transducer for known targets.	nonlinear system;normal (geometry);transducer;velocity (software development)	Stefan J.

During further analysis power loss density values act as input for the Penne's bioheat equation. To achieve results, which are as realistic as possible, a method to obtain power loss density values, depending on the observed tissue or medium in the operating field, is presented. Applying this method, the power loss density distribution in isotonic saline solution at 25 °C is compared to the distribution calculated for the average conductivity of biological tissue in the region of interest.	isotonic regression;region of interest;salineos	Christoph Knopf;Jorg Himmel;F.

Three different materials are employed to build such devices, analyzing also the effect of the spray order in their final performance. The highest Seebeck coefficient (50.4 μV/K) is found for a junction made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on top of silver nanowires (AgNWs) whereas its efficiency in terms of power is the lowest because of the higher sheet resistance of the CNTs. In this case, the best combination for energy-harvesting purposes would be poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and AgNWs, with a power factor of 219 fW/K. These results prove the feasibility of developing large-scale and cost-effective thermocouples that could be used for sensing or energy-harvesting applications.		Andreas Albrecht;A.

The characterization of the curved grating with different shape has been performed to observe out-of-plane deformation. A finite-element model has been established to analyze such a deformation. Furthermore, the influence of postprocessing temperature on the residual stress of the metal films is examined. Experimental indicates that the postprocessing temperature and residual stress reveal a close relationship. As postprocessing temperature increases, the residual stress of the metal increases, resulting in a larger out-of-plane deformation of the curved grating. The proposed curved grating can be applied to optical measurement applications.	residual stress	Chen-Chieh Liao;Ju-Nan Kuo	2009	2009 4th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068632	materials science;surface micromachining;ceramic materials;finite element method;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;physics	Robotics	88.13622111636565	-14.117716964806537	95873

We hypothesize that this is because commercially available red and green laser pointers are exceeding their labeled power outputs. We tested the power outputs of 4 red and 4 green lasers which were purchased for less than AUD$30 each. The average of 10 measurements was recorded for each laser. We found that 3 out of 4 red lasers conformed to the 1mW safety standard; in contrast, all of the green lasers exceeded this limit, with one of the lasers recording an output of 127.9 mW. This contrast in compliance is explained by the construction of these lasers - green lasers are typically Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) lasers that can emit excessive infrared (IR) radiation with poor workmanship or inconsistent adherence to practices of safe design and quality control; red lasers are diode lasers which have limited power outputs due to `Catastrophic Optical Damage' (COD).

All experiments are carried out on (1 1 0) silicon at 70 1C. Undercuts take place on convex corners in both solutions. Moreover, the front etch planes governing undercut vary with solutions. Rhombus compensations are used to correct the undercut. Perfect acute corner without residue is obtained, and there are only some residue structures on both sides of obtuse convex corners in KOH with IPA solution, which are better results than those in pure aqueous KOH solution. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The IR thermal emitter is designed as a bridge-style hotplate (BSH) structure suspended on a silicon frame for realizing a good thermal isolation between hotplate and frame. For investigating the reliability of BSH structure, three kinds of fillet structures were designed in the contact corner between hotplate and frame. A 3-dimensional finite element method (3D-FEM) is used to investigate the electro-thermal, thermal-mechanical, and thermal-optical properties of BSH IR emitter using software COMSOLTM (COMSOL 4.3b, COMSOL Inc., Stockholm, Sweden). The simulation results show that the BSH with oval fillet has the lowest stress distribution and smoothest flows of stress streamlines, while the BSH with square fillet has the highest temperature and stress distribution. The thermal-optical and thermal-response simulations further indicate that the BSH with oval fillet is the optimal design for a reliable IR thermal emitter in spite of having slight inadequacies in emission intensity and modulation bandwidth in comparison with other two structures.	beanshell;denture, partial, fixed, resin-bonded;emission intensity;emitter device component;finite element method;flow;lambert's cosine law;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;microsoft kin;modulation;optimal design;silicon;simulation;smoothing;sodium borocaptate;filleting	Peng Zhou;Ranbin Chen;Na Wang;Haisheng San;Xuyuan Chen	2016		10.3390/mi7090166	electronic engineering;engineering;analytical chemistry;finite element method;optics	HCI	89.40024525016115	-13.519164515832186	96199

Gated silicon drift detectors (GSDDs) are much cheaper to fabricate than commercial silicon drift detectors (SDDs). However, previous GSDDs were fabricated from 10-kΩ·cm Si wafers, which are more expensive than 2-kΩ·cm Si wafers used in commercial SDDs. To fabricate cheaper portable X-ray fluorescence instruments, we investigate GSDDs formed from 2-kΩ·cm Si wafers. The thicknesses of commercial SDDs are up to 0.5 mm, which can detect photons with energies up to 27 keV, whereas we describe GSDDs that can detect photons with energies of up to 35 keV. We simulate the electric potential distributions in GSDDs with Si thicknesses of 0.5 and 1 mm at a single high reverse bias. GSDDs with one gate pattern using any resistivity Si wafer can work well for changing the reverse bias that is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the Si wafer.	detectors;diagnostic radiologic examination;energy, physics;fluorescence;gated blood-pool imaging;image resolution;instrument - device;kiloelectronvolt;oral wafer;photons;p–n junction;silicon;simulation;tracing (software);wafer (electronics);x-ray detector	Hideharu Matsuura;Shungo Sakurai;Yuya Oda;Shinya Fukushima;Shohei Ishikawa;Akinobu Takeshita;Atsuki Hidaka	2015		10.3390/s150512022	electronic engineering;text mining;medical research;computer science;bioinformatics;electrical engineering;nanotechnology	ML	93.71999880498201	-19.813693155038383	96703

4c57cf1947e2d544a58454f2caa8143103371d0a	application of distributed optical fiber sensing technology in the anomaly detection of shaft lining in grouting		The rupture of the shaft lining caused by grouting has seriously undermined the safety in coal mining. Based on BOTDRdistributed optical fiber sensing technology, this paper studied the layout method of optical fiber sensors and the anomaly detection method of the deformation and obtained the evolution law of shaft deformation triggered by grouting. The research results showed that the bonding problem of optical fiber sensors in damp environment could be effectively solved, by applying the binder consisting of sodium silicate and cement. Through BOTDR-based deformation detection, the real-time deformation of the shaft lining caused by grouting was immediately spotted. By comparing the respective strain of shaft lining deformation and concrete deformation, the risk range of shaft lining grouting was identified. With the additional strain increment of the shaft lining triggered by each process of grouting, the saturated condition of grouting volume in strata was analyzed, providing an important technical insight into the field construction and the safety of the shaft lining.

However, this method is destructive so causes damage to the asphalt concretes. In addition, this method causes localized points of weakness in the asphalt concretes and is time consuming. In recent years, non-destructive testing methods have been used for pavement thickness estimation, determination of elasticity modulus, and density and moisture measurements. In this study, the above-mentioned non-destructive and destructive tests with data obtained by applying the Marshall stability to the same asphalt concretes were estimated using the artificial neural networks approach.	artificial neural network;elasticity (data store);finite thickness;modulus of continuity;thickness (graph theory)	Serdal Terzi;Mustafa Karasahin;Süleyman Gökova;Mustafa Tahta;Nihat Morova;Ismail Uzun	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1023-1	mathematical optimization;asphalt concrete;nuclear density gauge;structural engineering;nondestructive testing;artificial neural network;elastic modulus;mathematics;asphalt	ML	88.7752136026739	-20.19458009631683	97265

The sensor is manufactured using a planar lithography process that generates microchannels that are subsequently filled with a conductive liquid. The planar geometry is then molded onto a hemispherical plastic scaffolding in a geometric configuration enabling estimation of the contact angle (angle between robot tip tangent and tissue surface normal) by the rotation of the sensor around its roll axis. Contact force can also be estimated by monitoring the changes in resistance in each microchannel. Bench top experimental results indicate that, on average, the sensor can estimate the angle of contact to within ±2° and the contact force to within ±5.3 g.	embedded system;embedding;encode (action);fill;less than;medical robot;noise reduction;normal (geometry);optic axis of a crystal;pdms;polymer;polymers;robot (device);sensor;spatial variability;structure of lumen of body system;millimeter;soft tissue	Veaceslav Arabagi;Andrew H.

The slope of the lift-off curve (LOC) in the RL impedance plane is a good feature for characterizing target thickness independent of lift-off distance variation. A simple equivalent model was built to deal with the ECS problem, and the essential relationship between the slope of LOC (SLOC) and target properties was obtained. Full finite element analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between SLOC feature and target thickness, and the results matched the modeling results very well. A sensor coil probe was then manufactured and used to measure the thickness of copper films with high performance, and the capability of this technique for online noncontact thickness measurement was verified. The basic characteristics and performances of this thickness measurement technique were tested and discussed. The SLOC feature for thickness measurement had significant advantages, such as simplicity, reliability, immunity to the lift-off effect (most important), high speed, simple signal processing, and negligible design limitation of the sensor probe. The results of this paper revealed that online thickness measurement systems could be developed for various advanced industrial applications.	altered level of consciousness;amiga enhanced chip set;characteristic impedance;finite element method;performance;sensor;signal processing;source lines of code;system of measurement;thickness (graph theory)	Hongbo Wang;Wei Li;Zhihua Feng	2015	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2015.2406053	electronic engineering;eddy current;electrical engineering;conductivity;engineering drawing;physics;quantum mechanics	Mobile	89.58629318472589	-19.465278032474718	97447

As the market of smartwear is growing, researches toward E-textiles become more important. Among various ways of providing conductivity on textiles, we selected sputtering technology. Through the sputtering, we developed E-textiles deposited with thin Cu layer on the surface of the fabrics with thickness of about 2 micrometer. Then we measured the electrical resistances, examined their performances as ECG(electrocardiogram) electrodes and compared ECG signal measured with general AgCl electrodes. In result, ECG signals from Cu sputtered electrodes showed big potentials as textile-based electrodes by showing little difference in its signals compared with commonly used AgCl electrodes.

42b9c602594307b69f7a5528548f10b5f5d8342a	nano ag-doped in2o3 thick film: a low-temperature h2s gas sensor		Thick films of AR grade In2O3 were prepared by standard screen-printing technique. The gas sensing performances of thick films were tested for various gases. It showed maximum sensitivity to ethanol vapour at 350°C for 80 ppm concentration. To improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the film towards a particular gas, In2O3 sensors were surface-modified by dipping them in a solution of 2% nanosilver for different intervals of time. Obtained results indicated that spherical nano-Ag grains are highly dispersed on the surface of In2O3sensor. The surface area of the nano-Ag/ In2O3 sensor is several times larger than that of pure In2O3 sensor. In comparison with pure In2O3 sensor, all of the nano-Ag-doped sensors showed better sensing performance in respect of response, selectivity, and optimum operating temperature. The surface-modified (30 min) In2O3 sensor showed larger sensitivity to H2S gas (10 ppm) at 100°C. Nano silver on the surface of the film shifts the reactivity of film from ethanol vapour to H2S gas. A systematic study of gas sensing performance of the sensor indicates the key role played by the nano silver species on the surface. The sensitivity, selectivity, response, and recovery time of the sensor were measured and presented.	doping (semiconductor);gnu nano;indium(iii) oxide	D. N. Chavan;G. E. Patil;D. D. Kajale;V. B.

Initially, a first-order model was proposed to estimate the variance of the error and consider a quantitative model that takes into account the effects of combination. The method of steepest descent is used to sequentially move the descent path, i.e., in the direction of the minimum response decrement, until a new interval near optimal experimentation. Subsequently, a model of higher order was developed using a central composite design with center points and stars, taking into account control other variables additional response flatness, such as the roughness and hardness of the sheets in a range of flexible and acceptable tolerances for the company through a canonical model, and that will be the focus of future research.	beneath a steel sky	Alexander Parody;Amelec Viloria;Mercedes Gaitán;Luz Elena Malagón;Maury-Ardila Henry;Hugo Hernández Palma;Ligia M.

81dd762a5063280593fff12d3e3a27c6551e4eb1	micro sensors for real-time monitoring of mold spores and pollen		Organic airborne particles such as mold spores and pollen cause a variety of diseases. Two types of micro sensors for real-time monitoring of such organic airborne particles have been developed using semiconductor thin-film. A basic type thin-film sensor has a simple configuration with a double-layered sensing film deposited on an alumina substrate. A MEMS type sensor is composed of two parts: a sensing element and a micro heater. Both parts are fabricated by using thin film technology, IC fabrication process and micromachining technique. The double-layered sensing film is deposited on a diaphragm formed on a Si substrate. A thin film heater is placed in parallel at a distance of about 50 μm. The resistance of both sensors steeply decreases and then recovers to the initial value when a mold spore or a grain of pollen adheres to the surface of the sensing film and burns on it. The resistance change and the recovery time depend on the size of the organic airborne particles. Thus it is possible to identify the species of the particle by the developed sensors.

Any DNA sequence can be synthesized by ejecting droplets of DNA bases by a self-focusing acoustic transducer (SFAT) that does not require any nozzles. An SFAT can eject liquid droplets around 3-5 /spl mu/m in diameter, which is significantly smaller than those ejected by commercial ink jet printers and reduces the amount of reagents needed for the synthesis. An array of SFATs is integrated with microchannels and reservoirs for delivery of DNA bases to the SFATs. Poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide is patterned, and is used as a target substrate for in situ synthesis of multiple T bases. The significant advantage of this scheme over some of the existing commercial solutions is that it can allow geneticists to synthesize any DNA sequence within hours using a computer program at an affordable cost in their own labs. This paper describes the concept and scheme of the on-demand DNA synthesis (with an acoustic ejector integrated with microfluidic components) along with the results of an actual DNA synthesis by an SFAT. Note to Practitioners-Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarrays allow geneticists to monitor the interactions among thousands of genes simultaneously in a chip. There are commercial systems for producing DNA microarrays, but none of them give flexibility to synthesize DNA microarrays on-demand in the geneticist's own lab. Affymetrix's GeneChip technology produces DNA probe sequences premade at Affymetrix with a set of 4n photomasks for n-mers. Other techniques transfer premade DNA sequences to a substrate (glass, plastic, or silicon) through ink-jet printing or contact dispensing. Agilent and Rosetta use their ink-jet printing technology to produce DNA probe sequences at their factories. The ink-jet print heads used for printing microarrays use either piezoelectric or thermal actuation, and eject liquid droplets through nozzles. Thus, the smallest droplet size ejected from these devices depends on the size of the nozzle. The small nozzles are difficult to construct with good uniformity and tend to get clogged. The idea presented in this paper is to develop a microelectromechanical-system (MEMS)-based portable system for synthesizing DNA on different substrates, using nozzleless, heatless, lensless, acoustic droplet ejectors. The future research is to synthesize longer DNA sequences with a combination of different bases, using directional droplet ejectors.	acid;acoustic cryptanalysis;circuit complexity;computer program;dna microarray;interaction;microelectromechanical systems;piezoelectricity;printing;transducer	Jae Wan Kwon;Sanat Kamal-Bahl;Eun Sok Kim	2006	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2006.871483	dna microarray;dna;molecular biophysics	Comp.	94.49536791299322	-19.41074135889638	97776

To overcome this limitation, we have developed a Raman scattering simulation using a photon-cell interactive Monte Carlo (pciMC) model that tracks photon migration in both the extra- and intracellular spaces without relying on the macroscopic scattering phase function and anisotropy factor. The interaction of photons at the plasma-cell boundary of randomly oriented three-dimensionally biconcave red blood cells (RBCs) is modeled using geometric optics. The validity of the developed pciMCRaman was investigated by comparing simulation and experimental results of Raman spectroscopy of glucose level in a bovine blood sample. The scattering of the excitation laser at a wavelength of 785 nm was simulated considering the changes in the refractive index of the extracellular solution. Based on the excitation laser photon distribution within the blood, the Raman photon derived from the hemoglobin and glucose molecule at the Raman shift of 1140 cm-1 = 862 nm was generated, and the photons reaching the detection area were counted. The simulation and experimental results showed good correlation. It is speculated that pciMCRaman can provide information about the ability and limitations of the measurement of blood glucose level.	anisotropy;blood cells;blood component transfusion;blood glucose;blood specimen;bos taurus;erythrocytes;excitation;glucose measurement;interaction;intracellular space;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy;optics;photons;plasma active;raman scattering;randomness;reaching;simulation;spectroscopy, near-infrared;track (course);wavelength	Daisuke Sakota;Ryo Kosaka;Masahiro Nishida;Osamu Maruyama	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319859	optics	Robotics	96.08224466178888	-21.45946353870446	97868

This problem may be a limiting factor when calculating the earthing system. Generally, a danger from too high touch voltage occurs. Also, very large potential differences are possible. Calculation of the transferred potential in substation should be given special attention. Superposition procedures are often used in literature for calculation of transferred potentials with which it is needed to solve two or more large full systems of matrixes. Direct approach to forming and solving of modified matrix of potential coefficients by applying Galerkin's procedures of weight residue in indirect method of boundary elements is considered in this paper.

51f53f9e876348568fdb7accf2988c9a895c12b5	application of temperature modulation-sdp on mos gas sensors: capturing soil gaseous profile for discrimination of soil under different nutrient addition		A technique of temperature modulation-SDP (specified detection point) on MOS gas sensors was designed and tested on their sensing performance to such complex mixture, soil gaseous compound. And a self-made e-nose was built to capture and analyze the gaseous profile from sampling headspace of two soils (sandy loam and sand) with the addition of nutrient at different dose (without, normal, and high addition). It comprises (a) 6 MOS gas sensors which were driven wirelessly on a certain modulation through (b) a PSoC CY8C28445-24PVXI-based interface and (c) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural network (NN) as pattern recognition tools. The gaseous compounds are accumulated in a static headspace with thermostatting and stirring under controlled condition to optimize equilibration and gases concentration as well. The patterns are trained by backpropagation algorithm which employs a log-sigmoid function and updates the weights using search-then-converge schedule. PCA results indicate that the sensor array used is able to differentiate the soil type clearly and may provide a discrimination as a response to presence/level of the nutrients addition in soil. Additionally, the PCA enhances the classification performance ofNN to discriminate among the predescribed nutrient additions.		Arief Sudarmaji;Akio Kitagawa	2016	J.

11630682649c33c9249ac6d1cd5a5de00cd90662	explanation of impact load curve in ball impact test in relation to thermal aging		Solder joints are required to have high impact strength for use in portable electronic products. To make solder joints with high impact strength, qualitative evaluation methods of impact strength are required. Ball impact tests have been widely adopted in evaluating the impact strength of solder joints because of their easy implementation. Impact load curves obtained from ball impact tests are used as an evaluation indicator of impact strength of solder joint. However, a relation between fracture behavior and impact load curve has not yet been clarified, and an explanation of the impact load curve has not yet been provided in detail. In addition to this, detailed study about the relation between IMC layer thickness and impact strength has not been performed, although the IMC layer thickness formed at the interface would significantly affect the impact strength of the solder joint. This study aimed to explain the impact load curve in the ball impact test and to reveal the effect of the IMC layer thickness on the impact strength of the solder joint. Sn–3.0Ag–0.5Cu solder was reflowed on an electroless Ni–P plated Cu substrate (Ni–P), and a ball impact test was then carried out to evaluate the impact strength. This study found that the ball impact test is effective to evaluate the interfacial strength of solder joints. In the impact load curve, it is estimated that the solder bump keeps deforming until the interfacial crack initiates (maximum load), and the interfacial crack initiates after the maximum load and propagates along the interface between the solder and Ni–P. The suitable evaluation of impact strength became possible by measuring the correspondence relation between the deformation distance of the solder bump after fracture and the energy until maximum load and the relation between the area fraction of the residual solder on the fractured pad and the energy after maximum load. And, it is proved that the impact strength decreased with increasing aging time because the growth of the IMC layer remarkably degraded the interfacial strength of the solder joint. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The investigation is focused on the effect of its position and shape on aerodynamics performances of a given V – flight formation. Vortices generated the wing tip of the leader moves downstream forming a pair of opposite rotating line vortices. These vortices are generally undesirable because they create a downwash that increases the induced drag on leader’s wing. However, this downwash is also accompanied by an upwash that can beneficial to the follower’s wing flying behind the leader’s one, namely a favorable lift for the follower’s wing. How much contributions of the leader’s wing to the follower’s wing in the V – formation flight is determined by the strength of tip vortices generated by the leader’s wing which is influenced by its position and shape including incidence angle, dihedral angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio. The prediction of aerodynamic performances of the V – flight formation including lift, drag and moment coefficients is numerically performed by solving Navier – Stokes equations with k ε turbulence model. The computational domain is defined with multiblock topology to capture the complex geometry arrangement of the V – flight formation.	coefficient;downstream (software development);incidence matrix;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;performance;quantum vortex;turbulence modeling	H.

51020d97302b31bd85cbe210be0de704878cbeac	the effect of moisture on the degradation mechanism of multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic module		Moisture can diffuse into a photovoltaic (PV) module through its breathable back-sheet and its ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheet. Therefore moisture-induced degradation mechanism is investigated with multi-crystalline (m-Si) silicon PV module. Three types of accelerated tests (ATs) were conducted to evaluate the effect of temperature and humidity on the degradation of m-Si PV module. The thermal activation energy for degradation, 0.492 eV, was calculated. Electroluminescence image shows that moisture has an effect on the module degradation. Electrical measurements, Dark IV and Suns Voc indicate that series resistance (Rs) contributes to drop in power output. The results of SEM&EDX and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) reveal that corrosion occurred at the region of solder joint and also show that the oxide concentration on the metal electrode increased after the AT.	elegant degradation	T.

Thus, a low-cost non-destructive system consisting of a stainless double needle electrode associated to an electronic equipment that allows the implementation of EIS was developed. In order to validate the system, different concentrations of glucose, fructose and sucrose were added to the pineapple waste and analyzed both individually and in combination. Next, statistical data treatment enabled the design of specific Artificial Neural Networks-based mathematical models for each one of the studied sugars and their respective combinations. The obtained prediction models are robust and reliable and they are considered statistically valid (CCR% > 93.443%). These results allow us to introduce this EIS-based technique as an easy, fast, non-destructive, and in-situ alternative to the traditional laboratory methods for enzymatic hydrolysis monitoring.	artificial neural network;british informatics olympiad;dielectric spectroscopy;fossil fuels;fossils;fructose;glucose;mathematical model;mathematics;microsoft outlook for mac;neural tube defects;neural network software;nominal impedance;output impedance;spectroscopy, near-infrared;stainless steel;sucrose;sugars;x-ray emission spectroscopy;pineapple extract	Claudia Conesa;Eduardo García-Breijo;Edwin Loeff;Lucía Seguí;Pedro Fito;Nicolás Laguarda-Miró	2015		10.3390/s150922941	hydrolysis;biochemistry;chemistry;spectroscopy;ethanol fuel;waste management;physics	Graphics	96.42032032120112	-19.142773593862955	99022

1f26deafa2cbd8fa763728d199a514af4f00b95e	application of x-ray fluorescence to determine qualitative parameters of coal		EMAG Institute has specialized in working out the devices for qualitative control of coal. In most cases, they are radiometer appliances taking advantage of absorption or dispersion of gamma radiation of artificial radioactive source or natural radioactivity (ALFA and RODOS Ash Meters). Such methods not always ensure a required accuracy of measurement in case of mineralogical changes of a tested material. In 1980s a PYLOX Meter was worked out in EMAG that makes use of X-ray fluorescence for determining contents of non-combustible solids in mine dust from zones which protect against dust explosions. It was recognised that it is the only method which could allow to measure the quality of hard coal of a very diversified mineralogical contents. Therefore, it was decided to research aimed to determine the usability of PYLOX Meter for measurements of quality of coals from different coal mines and the possibility of improvement of metrological parameters by using semiconductor detectors. Research was conducted on samples originated from Uzbekistan and ,,Piast” Coal Mine. On the basis of received outcomes, it was stated that accurate determination of qualitative parameters of hard coal in the size grade of 0–3 mm is possible. The accuracy of order of 0,02 % Aa (ash) and 0,002 % St (sulphur) was obtained.

A technology is reviewed that measures the temperature versus time relationship of such rapid thermal events. It utilizes the dependence of luminescence on the trap populations of dispersed micro- and nano-particles. The thermoluminescence (TL) of various oxide microparticles gives direct information on temperature and time because the trapped charges that ultimately give rise to TL have a probability of detrapping that follows an Arrhenius-type relationship. To test this concept, Mg2SiO4:Tb,Co particles with two thermoluminescent peaks have been heated using micromachined heaters over a 232°C to 313°C range on time scales of less than 200ms. The effect of maximum temperature during excitation on the intensity ratio of the two luminescent peaks has been compared with first-order kinetics theory and shown to match within an average error of 4.4%. Other TL particles have recently been tested and shown to survive Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) explosions.	first-order reduction;gnu nano;kinetics internet protocol;list of code lyoko episodes;population;transform, clipping, and lighting	J.

Therefore, the requirements of process window are stricter than before. In the small line width, the formation of serious white wall will affect line width and cause rejects in following process. The study conducted research on the control of best focus in which particularly explored the relationship between exposure dose and line width and the phenomenon of white wall generated by focus. The research obtained related coefficients of exposure dose-line width and exposure dose-white wall by coating photo resist of different components with the same thickness on the surface of fused silica wafer.

3a4ae9ccd383387f9d21cdbe6e6eaa4eed9057f5	a non-destructive system based on electrical tomography and machine learning to analyze the moisture of buildings	dampness analysis;electrical tomography;inverse problem;machine learning;moisture inspection;nondestructive evaluation	This article presents the results of research on a new method of spatial analysis of walls and buildings moisture. Due to the fact that destructive methods are not suitable for historical buildings of great architectural significance, a non-destructive method based on electrical tomography has been adopted. A hybrid tomograph with special sensors was developed for the measurements. This device enables the acquisition of data, which are then reconstructed by appropriately developed methods enabling spatial analysis of wet buildings. Special electrodes that ensure good contact with the surface of porous building materials such as bricks and cement were introduced. During the research, a group of algorithms enabling supervised machine learning was analyzed. They have been used in the process of converting input electrical values into conductance depicted by the output image pixels. The conductance values of individual pixels of the output vector made it possible to obtain images of the interior of building walls as both flat intersections (2D) and spatial (3D) images. The presented group of algorithms has a high application value. The main advantages of the new methods are: high accuracy of imaging, low costs, high processing speed, ease of application to walls of various thickness and irregular surface. By comparing the results of tomographic reconstructions, the most efficient algorithms were identified.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;brick (electronics);computational intelligence;conductance (graph);construction materials;description;editorial;electromagnetically induced transparency;entity name part qualifier - adopted;exposure to humidity;hybrid system;least-angle regression;machine learning;mathematics;neural network simulation;neural networks;neural tube defects;norm (social);numerous;pixel;quantity;spatial analysis;supervised learning;thickness (graph theory);tomographic reconstruction;tomography;walls of a building;electrode;moisture;sensor (device)	Tomasz Rymarczyk;Grzegorz Klosowski;Edward Kozlowski	2018		10.3390/s18072285	electronic engineering;inverse problem;structural engineering;moisture;tomography;nondestructive testing;engineering	HCI	88.63070697290551	-20.37180453180709	99710

A negative shift of the flat band voltage with increasing annealing temperatures, for any film thickness, is observed. A dramatic reduction of the leakage current by about four orders of magnitude to 5×10−6 A cm−2 (at 1 MV cm−1) after 700°C and 60 min annealing is found for films thinner than 15 nm. The basic carrier transport mechanisms at different ranges of applied voltage such as hopping, space charge limited current and Fowler–Nordheim is established. An equivalent SiO2 thickness in order of 3.5 nm is demonstrated.	electron;evaporation	V. Mikhelashvili;G.

608994eac9031e45b1815adffa9ed2f85238f916	a novel cacd/cad/cae integrated design framework for fiber-reinforced plastic parts	heterogeneous feature model;response surface method;level set;cacd cad cae integration;structure and material optimization;fiber reinforcement	This work presents a novel CACD/CAD/CAE integrated framework for design, modeling, and optimization of fiber-reinforced plastic parts, which can greatly enhance the current design practice by realizing partial automation and multi-stage optimization. To support this framework, a new heterogeneous feature model (HFM) has been developed to model the fiber-reinforced objects and to be transferred between engineering modules. To be specific, the CACD (computer-aided conceptual design) module employs the level-set structure and material optimization to produce the initial design with thickness control, and also the initial HFM; the CAD (computer-aided design) module allows manual editing on the HFM to reflect various design intents; then, the injection molding CAE (computer-aided engineering) simulates the manufacturing process, and the response surface method (RSM) is applied to optimize the process parameters of gate location, injection flow rate, mold temperature and melt temperature, to approach the manufactured fiber orientation distribution close to the optimized result produced by the CACD module; besides, the structural analysis CAE module generates the mechanical performance result to support the CACD module, as well as to validate the final design. By applying this framework, the final structural design including the fiber orientation distribution, will perform better in mechanical properties, and consume less matrix and fiber materials; besides, the design maturity can be approached in shorter time. To prove the effectiveness, a plastic gripper design will be comprehensively studied. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The inherent inefficiencies associate with electrical storage can be partially overcome when thermal storage that collects and storage the waste thermal energy for alternative uses is integrated. Consequently, thermal energy storage systems are an enabling technology that will allow increased energy efficiency of a community, permit load levelling to reduce peak electricity demand. In order to facilitate a technology evaluation, a sizing strategy is developed for a phase change material (PCM) thermal storage system that determines system requirements under given thermal energy capture and recovery cycles. The sizing process utilizes a simplified onedimensional heat transfer model that estimates melt times for a phase change material thickness without detailed geometry information. This melt time estimate allows the proportion of phase change material to fluid routing materials to be calculated, giving an estimate of material cost for the thermal storage cell to determine economic feasibility. The model is compared to both experimental data and computational fluid dynamics models in order to determine its limitations. Through a specific example of hydrogen based distributed electrical energy mediator system, the utility of the sizing model in determining the estimated cost of thermal energy storage is demonstrated. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

60cfa69f09391e7f3215f0d6fd14c63fa7227fb5	a new device used in selective withdrawal from reservoirs and its effectiveness verified in computational fluid dynamics		Water intake with fixed height limits the application of selective withdrawal technology in a certain degree. This study proposes a technological idea to install baffles on water intake. Through the rotation of upper and lower baffle, poor water layer can be blocked. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the upper baffle on water intake is constructed. The results show that the baffle installed on the upper part of orifice can reduce the withdrawal layer thickness and flow on the upper part of orifice centre. Thereby, the withdrawal flow on lower part can be indirectly increased. While, baffle length and inclining angle are the important factors to influence the withdrawal layer thickness and flow distribution. Therefore, the adjusting range of selective withdrawal can be economically enhanced by installing baffles on water intake.

f11877790caade4367594632b62462ebd1154611	development of a thermal resistance model for chip-on-board packaging of high power led arrays		The performance of high power LEDs strongly depends on the junction temperature. Operating at high junction temperature causes degradation of light intensity and lifetime. Therefore, proper thermal management is critical for LED packaging. While the design of the heat sink is a major contributor to lowering the overall thermal resistance of the packaged luminaire, another area of concern arises from the need to address the large heat fluxes that exist beneath the die. In this study we conduct a thermal analysis of high power LED packages implementing chip-on-board (COB) architecture combined with power electronic substrate focusing on heat spreading effect. An analytical thermal resistance model is presented for the LED array and validated by comparing it with finite element analysis (FEA) results. By using the analytical expression of thermal resistance, it is possible to understand the impact of design parameters (e.g., material properties, LED spacing, substrate thickness, etc.) on the package thermal resistance, bypassing the need for detailed computational simulations using FEA.	on-board data handling;thermal resistance	Minseok Ha;Samuel Graham	2012	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2012.02.005	electronic engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;thermal management of high-power leds	EDA	89.53825514992052	-13.169114348258796	100461

The elastic layer is made of an elastic material and has a cylindrical permanent magnet. The substrate layer is a glass epoxy board and has four GMR(giant magneto resistance) elements and four chip inductors. Each element outputs voltages as to a magnetic flux density when the elastic layer deforms by a contact. A force vector and a slip detection are calculated from these outputs.

Under the framework of the double T-junction hybrid channel, geometry factors such as i the distance between the two junctions, ii the size of the second junction, and iii the size of the broadened channel were analyzed. How these factors impacted the separation process and device performance were examined and discussed to optimize the double T-junction channel design. Results indicated that the best separation performance occurred when the separation layer thickness was 8~15% of the upstream main channel width. This simulation analysis helped the optimum channel geometry design in the microfluidic chip for droplet sorting to prepare uniform microparticles.	simulation;sorting	Ming-Ying Hsu;Chih-Hui Yang;Chih-Yu Wang;Yung-Sheng Lin	2012	IJTHI	10.4018/jthi.2012070102	microfluidics;drop;computer science;sorting	Theory	93.36478856860096	-14.43843506183695	100675

In traditional coal cutting one of the most difficult operations is to mechanise the cutting process. To overcome this problem a most suitable system is a hydro jet cutting system where not only the system can be used for cutting but also the used water can be utilised for transportation of the coal from the site to the required destination in the form of slurry.

dcf52de126a9f01a23f8f22a2c4f4d34bc4ab3c6	numerical analysis of the potential of deep drawing processes with hydrostatic pressure lubrication		Deep drawing is one of the most important forming procedures for the economic production of sheet metal components. Especially for high-volume parts, deep drawing is a very efficient method of fabrication with high utilization of semi-finished parts. Certainly, conventional deep drawing processes are restricted by forming limits due to part failure during the drawing process. The process force is one of the most important factors for this restriction. The narrow process window, especially for deep drawing of light-weight materials, can be extended by reducing the friction forces at the die radius, using hydrostatic pressure lubrication. After the numerical analysis of the appearing loads of deep drawing processes, the optimal position for the insertion of pressurized lubricant was identified and the potential of the hydrostatic pressure lubrication was predicted. With experimental tests, the results of the simulations were approved. Both, the simulations and the experimental tests showed a significant reduction of the process forces.	numerical analysis	Peter Groche;Christian Klöpsch;Norman Möller	2012	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-012-0374-x	forensic engineering;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	SE	85.96859552911883	-13.838440788584276	100905
35d612cdee7bab98a6c0a0c84f7a9ec5beff7dcd	protective coatings of electronics under harsh thermal shock	accelerated testing;electronics reliability;combined testing methods	Industrial electronics devices commonly encounter harsh environmental conditions during their operational lifetime. To protect the electronics from conditions like humidity and contaminants, protective moulding and coating materials can be used. However, the behaviour of materials in harsh environments and their effect on the reliability of electronics in industrial products has been studied only very little. Moreover, the changes in the parameters of several commonly used materials under various conditions remain largely unknown. In this paper the effect of the protective coating and moulding materials on product level reliability of an electronics device was studied under thermal shock test. In addition, the change in the mechanical properties of the materials under test conditions was studied. The conditions of the test used were relatively harsh with extreme temperatures of −40 °C and +125 °C. The samples used in the study were commercial electronics devices designed for use in harsh conditions. The protective materials studied included silicone based conformal coating, polyurethane based moulding material, and silicone based moulding material. Moreover, a comparison test with no protective materials was conducted. The results showed that conformal coating and polyurethane based moulding material markedly decreased the times to failures of the devices. On the other hand, silicone based moulding seemed to slightly improve the reliability of the devices.

48b8094208607adb68d5f578bb8b7e864f548659	research and implementation of a 1800°c sapphire ultrasonic thermometer		A sapphire ultrasonic temperature sensor was produced in this study which possessed working stability, antioxidation properties, and small acoustic-signal attenuation. A method was developed to solve the problems of long periods (u003e0.5 h) and ultrahigh temperature (1800°C) in tests. The sensor adopted here had good sound transmission performance as well as the high thermal conductivity of sapphire single crystals (Al2O3), as ultrasonic waveguides. The ultrasonic waveguide was produced by the method of the laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG method). Calibration experiments in a high temperature furnace found that, at high temperatures and long exposure, sapphire ultrasonic temperature sensors had good stability and repeatability, and it survived in 1600°C for 360 min. This sapphire ultrasonic temperature sensor has potential for applications in aircraft engines where monitoring of high temperatures is very important.

This consists of a conductive deposit (13) in parallel with the fuse element, but of higher resistance. This is preferably covered by a nonconductive deposit (14) of light color which prevents arcing and highlights burn-out of the conductive deposit when the element blows.	genetic programming;optimizing compiler;register allocation	Mostafa Sami;Mohamed Haggag;Heba Thabit	2007	Egyptian Computer Science Journal		electronic engineering;register allocation;engineering;parallel computing;fuse (electrical);cartridge;electric arc;burning out;electrical conductor;composite material	Theory	86.68927522928536	-16.200812174629032	102053

dbc103eca84a65af68eea716343e6326031b1e8b	biomimetic sensors for the senses: towards better understanding of taste and odor sensation	biomimetic sensors for senses;biosensors;chemical sensing;odor sensation;olfaction;signal transduction;taste sensation	Taste and smell are very important chemical senses that provide indispensable information on food quality, potential mates and potential danger. In recent decades, much progress has been achieved regarding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of taste and odor senses. Recently, biosensors have been developed for detecting odorants and tastants as well as for studying ligand-receptor interactions. This review summarizes the currently available biosensing approaches, which can be classified into two main categories: in vitro and in vivo approaches. The former is based on utilizing biological components such as taste and olfactory tissues, cells and receptors, as sensitive elements. The latter is dependent on signals recorded from animals' signaling pathways using implanted microelectrodes into living animals. Advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches, as well as differences in terms of sensing principles and applications are highlighted. The main current challenges, future trends and prospects of research in biomimetic taste and odor sensors are discussed.	biomimetics;biosensors;body tissue;categories;characteristic impedance;chemical space;chemical vapor deposition;chemicals;classification;detection theory;drug discovery;esthesia;fits;fingerprint;halitosis;immobiliser;implants;integrated circuit;interaction;iontophoresis;ligands;odorants;odors;quantitative impedance;quorum sensing;requirement;rodent;seizures;self-assembly;sensation disorders;signal transduction;smell perception;taste perception;transducer;transducers;transduction (machine learning);video-in video-out;drug development;sensor (device)	Chunsheng Wu;Ya-Wen Du;Liquan Huang;Yaron Ben-Shoshan Galeczki;Ayana Dagan-Wiener;Michael Naim;Masha Y.

Scaffolds supports cell adhesion as a temporary extracellular matrix, which plays a key role in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Hydrogel 3D structure bio-fabrication was an important step towards cell 3D printing. A precision extrusion nozzle based on ball screw transmission was developed for porous hydrogel fabrication. The whole bio-fabrication temperature was controlled between 4-14 degrees C which eliminates ice exactly. Three-dimensional structure was formed based on the temperature-sensitive gelling properties of gelatin. Hereby, the influence of hydrogel concentration, extrusion speed and scanning speed, printing temperature, scanning spacing and the heights of layer were analyzed in depth. Hydrogel scaffolds were fabricated pore network in the gelatin 10% and the sodium alginate 2%. The processing parameters of this paper can be directly applied to hybrid printing of cell and hydrogel material.	3d printing	Shengjun Ma;Xiongfei Zheng;Cheng Zhang;Heran Wang;Hongyi Li	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22876-1_45	biological engineering;tissue engineering	HCI	93.81435824304656	-15.829492764947673	102456

The difficulty for an exhaustive color characterization of the printing technology comes not only from the goniochromaticity of the samples, but also from their very high specularity, to which classical measurement instruments are not adapted. Moreover, as the light-matter interaction relies on a number of optical phenomena (surface plasmon resonance, interferences, diffraction, effects of polarization of light) for which no predictive model is available today, their characterization requires measurement of many printed samples. In this paper, we present a characterization method based on multispectral imaging and on spectral prediction for halftone colors that permitted a first gamut estimation in three specific illumination/viewing configurations.	ambiguous name resolution;color;free viewpoint television;multispectral image;plasmon;polarization (waves);printing;resonance;specularity;telecentric lens	Mathieu Hébert;Juan Martínez-García;Thomas Houllier;Hayk Yepremian;Nicolas Crespo-Monteiro;Francis Vocanson;Alain Trémeau;Nathalie Destouches	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56010-6_18	optoelectronics;hyperspectral imaging;optics;structural coloration	Robotics	94.86240193734558	-15.157328738902326	102686
8369d409ff0e34c02aff9fee821c2b050e8000cf	a newly developed rapid uniform thermal cycle test system for electronic components		Article history: Received 12 January 2017 Received in revised form 24 July 2017 Accepted 25 July 2017 Available online 6 August 2017 Electronic components are difficult to heat or cool uniformly and rapidly because of the low heat conduction properties of the materials used in these components. The present study reports a new rapid thermal fatigue test system that circulates a temperature-controlled air shower around test samples to realize both uniform and rapid temperature control. Since the proposed test system allows multi-unit integration of multiple test chambers, the simultaneous evaluation of several samples under various test conditions can be performed efficiently. Based on the results of the temperature profile measured for a practical electronic circuit board, the proposed system is confirmed to enable the target temperature to be approached rapidly while maintaining a uniform temperature distribution. The proposed system shortens the thermal cycle period from 60 min to 12 min while generating the same degree of crack damage and the same fracture mode of solder joints. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It happens when the transport rate of Li ions to the negative electrode exceeds the rate that Li ions can be inserted (intercalated) into the graphite. This paper presents a two-step Plating Mechanism Detection (PMD) algorithm which is based on the model-based fault diagnosis theory. In the first step, an estimation of the Li ions' transport rate in both positive and negative electrodes is obtained from an electrochemical model of the battery through a particle filtering approach. Estimated data are then compared with their boundary values in order to generate an appropriate fault alarm. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed PMD algorithm.	algorithm;elegant degradation;failure cause;graphite;pmd;particle filter;plating;short circuit;simulation	Seyed Mohammad Mahdi Alavi;M.

The frequency response of the presented SIW sensor is switched by filling a very small quantity of chemical inside of the fluidic channel, which also causes a difference in the effective permittivity. The fluidic channel on this structure is either empty or filled with a chemical; when it is empty the structure resonates at 17.08 GHz. There is always a different resonant frequency when any chemical is injected into the fluidic channel. The maximum amount of chemical after injection is held in the center of the SIW structure, which has the maximum magnitude of the electric field distribution. Thus, the objective of sensing chemicals in this research is achieved by perturbing the electric fields of the SIW structure.	bands;body cavities;categorization;clock rate;fill;frequency band;frequency response;futile cycles;numerical analysis;pdms;post-wall waveguide;resonance;sensor;small;waveguide device component;electric field;millimeter	Muhammad Usman Memon;Sungjoon Lim	2016		10.3390/s16111829	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry;ethanol fuel;fluidics	Mobile	91.78225353283635	-17.569223651222966	103408

The problem of the fatigue strength estimation of materials or components containing natural defects, inclusions or in homogeneities is of great importance from both a scientific and industrial point of view. This article gives some insight into the dimensioning process, with special focusing on fatigue analysis of W/H in a vehicle’s door structures. An endurance life prediction of door W/H was calculated using finite element analyses. Endurance test data for slim test specimens were compared with the predicted fatigue life for verification. The final life expectancy of the component combines the effects of these microstructural features with the complex stress state arising from the combined service loading and residual stresses.	electronic component;finite element method;test data;test harness;wiring	Byeong-Sam Kim;Kyoungwoo Park;Young-Woo Kim	2009	JSEA	10.4236/jsea.2009.25050	structural engineering;engineering;finite element method;forensic engineering;mechanical engineering	HPC	88.57950293058997	-12.8021402328853	103663

1fa102001a792f97e1d91bdfc675a484fcc264c7	streak line pattern of supersonic transverse jet into mach 6 freestream over a sharp cone		An oil flow technique for obtaining good quality streakline patterns around the transverse injection into a Mach 6 freestream over a sharp cone of nose angle 20 degree(1) has been demonstrated. The freestream Reynolds number based on cone diameter is 0.53 million and total pressure of Mach 2.5 transverse jet is 12 bar. The oil viscosity should be low enough for its streaks to align with flow without being swept away completely during start of the blowdown. After many trials, it is found that, 1:5 mixture (by volume) of titanium dioxide powder (as white pigment) and paraffin oil gives good result. Three drops of oleic acid in 0.5 cc of this mixture give good coagulation properties. This mixture is sprayed as sparsely distributed fine droplets on the model painted black. A still camera is used from outside the tunnel to capture the pictures through the tunnel window (quartz glass) during the blowdown. Six pictures from starting to shutdown of the tunnel are shown in Fig. 1. Frame-A is before tunnel starting, Frame-B is immediately after start of the tunnel, Frames-C and D are during the test, Frame-E is after 4 seconds of run time and Frame-F is after shutdown of the tunnel. The time difference between Frames-C and D is 1 ±0.3 s. It is observed that, the oil streaks take sufficient time to align with surface streamlines, also a good amount of oil is washed away during the 4 seconds run time of tunnel and oil is partially disturbed during the shutdown. Frame-D shows full details of the streaklines around the transverse jet on surface of the cone. The present results reveal that, the oil flow pattern has to be captured during the run.		G.

In microsystems technology, micro-machined hotplates represent a platform consisting of a thin suspended membrane where the sensing material can be deposited, usually integrating electrical stimuli and temperature readout. The micro-hotplate ensures a series of advantages such as miniaturized size, fast response, high sensitivity, low power consumption and selectivity for chemical sensing. This work compares the coplanar and the buried approach for the micro-hotplate heaters design with the aim to optimize the fabrication process and to propose a guideline for the choice of the suitable design with respect to the applications. In particular, robust Finite Element Method (FEM) models are set up in order to predict the electrical and thermal behavior of the micro-hotplates. The multiphysics approach used for the simulation allows to match as close as possible the actual device to the predictive model: geometries, materials, physics have been carefully linked to the fabricated devices to obtain the best possible accuracy. The materials involved in the fabrication process are accurately selected in order to improve the yield of the process and the performance of the devices. The fabricated micro-hotplates are able to warm the active region up to 400 °C (with a corresponding power consumption equal to 250 mW @ 400 °C) with a uniform temperature distribution in the buried micro-hotplate and a controlled temperature gradient in the coplanar one. A response time of about 70 ms was obtained on the virtual model, which perfectly agrees with the one measured on the fabricated device. Besides morphological, electrical and thermal characterizations, this work includes reliability tests in static and dynamic modes.	3d modeling;entity name part qualifier - adopted;finite element method;gradient;java platform, standard edition;microelectromechanical systems;multiphysics;predictive modelling;preparation;response time (technology);selectivity (electronic);semiconductor device fabrication;simulation;tellurium;tissue membrane;sensor (device)	Alessio Tommasi;Matteo Cocuzza;Denis Perrone;Candido F.

Careful investigation of currents in different fingers of a multi-finger transistor in the presence of parasitic effects shows differences between the per-finger drain current of the multi-finger transistor and the drain current of a corresponding single-finger transistor. We show that each of the following factors alone causes the drain current in one or more fingers of a multi-finger transistor to be different from that in other fingers of the transistor and the per-finger drain current of the multi-finger transistor to be different from the drain current of a corresponding single-finger transistor: (a) the resistance of wires that connect multiple fingers together, (b) the contact resistance, (c) the diffusion resistance, and (d) self heating. Excluding all of the above factors, the uncorrelated variations among the sub-threshold drain currents of different finger cause the per-finger median sub-threshold drain current of the multi-finger transistor to be different from the median sub-threshold drain current of the single-finger transistor.	emoticon;symmetry breaking;transistor	Ning Lu;Sungjae Lee;Richard A.

40c44859815a75514361ef16a73669f3e08f4da2	experimental demonstration of temperature sensing with packaged glass bottle microresonators	3d printing;bottle microresonators;optical sensors;packaging;temperature sensing;whispering gallery modes	Whispering gallery mode (WGM) glass bottle microresonators are potential highly sensitive structures for a variety of physical and bio-chemical sensing applications. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the practical use of glass bottle resonators as temperature sensors. The basic parameters, such as WGM resonance wavelengths, free spectral ranges, and Q factors, have been investigated by coupling light from a tapered fiber to the bottle structure. We show the spectral characteristics of the WGMs by choosing different bottle dimensions and taper diameters. For practical measurements, a robust 3D-printed package that includes the bottle resonator and the tapered fiber has been proposed. The packaged bottle has a central diameter Dc = 207 µm and a length L = 300 µm. Temperature sensing experiments were also performed. A linear response of the WGM shifts as a function of the temperature is confirmed. The fitted experimental data indicate a temperature sensitivity of 10.5 pm/K at λ ~ 1550 nm, resulting in a limit of detection of 0.06 K. These values can be compared with values reported for other WGM resonators. Additionally, bottle resonators are made with simple splicing methods and their assembly method can be easily defined due to large coupling tolerances.

A collimated microwave beam with an angular width of ±3° at a frequency of 24 GHz was emitted from a sensor (A) on a dish antenna 30 cm in diameter. Another sensor (B), which works as a detector, was installed on the rover. The rover was programmed to make a right turn when the microwave signal was above a specified level and to make a left turn when the signal was below that level. In this study, we fabricated a signal processing electrical circuit for the fourth prototype rover. To confirm the performance of the fabricated electrical circuit, we carried out some experiments on the frequency response of the electrical circuit. Finally, we had a questionnaire for the student who collaborated with this study to investigate how this study had an educational effect on the student.	angularjs;experiment;frequency response;low-pass filter;microwave;parabolic antenna;prototype;rover (the prisoner);sensor;signal processing	Masahiro Isogai;Yuya Takada	2016	2016 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2016.7824223	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;remote sensing	Embedded	91.01897302657835	-23.290620862083834	104439

The fine Bi-2212 powders were dispersed on the Ag substrate before the melting process, so as to avoid the change in the composition of the molten phase with distance, which would result in the formation of the impurity phases. Nearly reversible peritectic reaction on cooling causes the formation of well-defined Bi-2212 phase. Based on the results of in situ high temperature microscope observation, the wetting of the molten phase to the growing ribbons was identified as the essential condition for the growth of the ribbon-like thin films.	3d film	Y.

5a0cf123c3ba5608badf754cdc7aa733cc2172dc	refined nbti characterization of arbitrarily stressed pmos devices at ultra-low and unique temperatures		We reexamine degradation and recovery dynamics in the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) of p-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (PMOSFETs) by making use of the recently developed in situ polyheater technique. The capability of switching the device temperature extremely fast and almost arbitrarily allows for measuring differently stressed devices directly after the termination of stress at a unique and much lower characterization temperature (e.g. 60 C). This procedure (‘degradation quenching’) is a powerful extension of the conventional measure–stress–measure (MSM) technique and provides a cleaner way for comparing threshold voltage shifts and charge pumping (CP) currents of arbitrarily stressed devices. We find that increasing the stress bias predominantly activates a larger number of defects with similar (short) recovery time constants causing steeper threshold voltage recovery transients after the termination of stress. Increasing the stress temperature has a very similar effect on the threshold voltage shift as increasing the stress time. In both cases, defects with larger recovery time constants are activated while the number of defects with short recovery time constants remains essentially the same. A comparison of VTH shift and CP data suggests that the total threshold voltage shift is due to at least two fundamentally different types of defects, one being readily recoverable and uncorrelated to the CP current while the other is ‘quasi-permanent’ and proportional to the CP current. By converting CP currents into corresponding threshold voltage shifts, we find that only about 50% of the ‘quasi-permanent’ VTH damage is due to slowly-recoverable interface states. The remaining fraction is due to another, yet undefined, positively charged defect generated at virtually the same rate. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

8f42887e66bea167dffe981ca95787434f2c302f	analytical solutions for corrosion-induced cohesive concrete cracking	t technology general;th building construction;ta engineering general civil engineering general	The paper presents a new analytical model to study the evolution of radial cracking around a corroding steel reinforcement bar embedded in concrete. The concrete cover for the corroding rebar is modelled as a thick-walled cylinder subject to axisymmetrical displacement constraint at the internal boundary generated by expansive corrosion products. A bilinear softening curve reflecting realistic concrete property, together with the crack band theory for concrete fracture, is applied to model the residual tensile stress in the cracked concrete. A governing equation for directly solving the crack width in cover concrete is established for the proposed analytical model. Closed-form solutions for crack width are then obtained at various stages during the evolution of cracking in cover concrete. The propagation of crack front with corrosion progress is studied, and the time to cracking on concrete cover surface is predicted. Mechanical parameters of the model including residual tensile strength, reduced tensile stiffness, and radial pressure at the bond interface are investigated during the evolution of cover concrete cracking. Finally, the analytical predictions are examined by comparing with the published experimental data, and mechanical parameters are analysed with the progress of reinforcement corrosion and through the concrete cover.	bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;cutter expansive classification;cylinder seal;displacement mapping;electronic band structure;embedded system;hoops 3d graphics system;password cracking;radial (radio);reinforcement learning;softening;software propagation	Hua-Peng Chen;Nan Xiao	2012	J.

4a4b0fd658146a9aeba96234bbb9c0974d5ecd85	validating hoda with classical clustering techniques using microarray gene expression data		A film development machine, having plural film treatment tanks capable of containing fluids therein for the development of a film transported therethrough by plural transport roller racks, which are small in size, capable of use in areas of limited access by permitting the film to be introduced into, and to be delivered from the machine, from the same side, and especially well adapted to develop films which are relatively small in length and width. The roller racks have a plurality of rollers forming an essentially non-linear film travel path between machine inlet and outlet. The rollers are closely spaced so that films of relatively small size can safely and reliably pass therethrough. Close roller spacing is maintained by providing rollers of different diameters, which compensate for the curvature of the path of film travel, and a gear drive system which drives nip forming pairs of rollers from alternating sides of the roller rack. The gear drive system is capable of efficiently driving the increased number of rollers. This system comprises roller drive gears which coaxially rotate each of the rollers, intermediate gears which coaxially rotate roller drive gears, and power gears which serially rotate the intermediate gears, either through direct, meshing engagement or through transfer gears which are in meshing engagement therewith. The power gears of each roller rack are operated from a common drive train, providing a completely geared roller drive system.	microarray	Mohammed Essam Khalifa;Taysir Hassan A.

The conventional method, X-ray-energy subtraction, needs detailed research to determine parameters by numerous experiments and rich human experience. The parameters, however, are not published and are thus not considered general-purpose. Two automated methods were implemented with blind-source separation. The experimentation showed our proposed method using an algorithm called QL1-NMF automatically extracts solder bumps from radiographs well.	algorithm;ball grid array;blind signal separation;experiment;flip chip;general-purpose modeling;independent computing architecture;non-negative matrix factorization;radiography;source separation	Motoaki Mouri;Hiroshi Yasukawa;Ichi Takumi	2016	2016 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2016.7745014	materials science;electronic engineering;analytical chemistry;engineering drawing	Arch	93.26024513270063	-18.114725143721678	104941
6aa035676539c32fede3a5e538cd6364066bf2e2	design of a cost-efficient, double curvature display for robots		A novel, low cost display which uses existing 3D printed optics technology and improves upon it by adding isolation and diffusion layers is presented. The display can transmit light source from a planar 2D surface through individual light pipes onto complex surfaces. This is achieved by a combination of total internal reflection of light in the light pipes which are embedded for minimum Fresnel losses, light isolation using structural limiters and by providing a light diffusion mask to augment contrasts. The resulting display is shown to exhibit higher contrasts, enhanced performance and minimal light loss due to scattering. An exhaustive evaluation was carried out and a user survey was done on the final result. The display is then mounted on the head of the new R1 humanoid robot.	3d printing;cost efficiency;embedded system;humanoid robot;planar (computer graphics)	Anand Vazhapilli Sureshbabu;Marco Maggiali;Giorgio Metta;Alberto Parmiggiani	2017	2017 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts (ARSO)	10.1109/ARSO.2017.8025189	artificial intelligence;humanoid robot;computer vision;photon diffusion;computer science;total internal reflection;curvature;light-emitting diode;cost efficiency;scattering;planar	Robotics	86.7662886116379	-22.14998085780184	104976

The material removal in abrasive flow machining takes place by flowing the media, mixed with abrasives, across the surface to be machined. The media is the key element in the process because of its ability to precisely abrade the selected areas along its flow path. From the review of literature, it was found that there is a need to know the viscosity of the media, since it has a significant effect on the process performance parameters. In the present work, a viscometer set-up has been fabricated based on the principle of visco-elasticity. The creep compliance and the bulk modulus have been determined and the viscosity of the abrasive media has been subsequently calculated. Measurements have been conducted for obtaining viscosity along with an assessment of specimen length and initial load, the influence of reduced data points and the repeatability of the experiments. Besides this, experiments have been conducted at varying concentration and temperature of the abrasive media. Experiments show that the viscosity of the media increases with the percentage concentration of abrasives and decreases with temperature. Viscosities at different concentration of the abrasives were compared with the values obtained from a capillary viscometer and the comparison was found to be good.	atomic-force microscopy;biological specimen;data point;elasticity (data store);experiment;instruction creep;loop heat pipe;modulus robot;need to know;radius;repeatability	A.

Existing methods to prevent or limit cytosol diffusion include reducing the diameter of the pipette's orifice, adding cytosolic extract or physiological entities to the pipette solution, and using the perforated patch clamp configuration. The first method introduces measurement error in recorded signals from increased series resistance and the latter two are cumbersome to perform. In addition, most perforated patch configurations, prevent investigators from using test compounds in the pipette solution. We present a method to overcome these limitations by minimizing cytosol dilution using a novel pipette holder. Cell-attached configuration is obtained with the pipette filled with pipette solution. Most of the pipette solution is then replaced with mineral oil so that cytosol dilution can be minimized in whole-cell configuration. To accomplish this requires a suction line and two Ag/AgCl electrodes inside the pipette. Testing our novel pipette holder with Chinese Hamster Ovarian cells, we demonstrate cytosol dilution factors between 76 and 234. For large cells with somas greater than 40 μm, cytosol dilution factors of 10 or less are achievable.	anatomical orifice;cell (microprocessor);cell body of neuron;cell physiology;chinese hamster ovary cell;clamper (electronics);clamping (graphics);cytoplasmic matrix;diameter (qualifier value);dilution of precision (navigation);entity;experiment;fill;holder device component;iontophoresis;large;million;pipette (physical object);pipette device component;preparation;series and parallel circuits;silver;suction drainage;cell type;electrode;ovarian neoplasm;physiological aspects	Samsoon Inayat;Lawrence H.

This paper proposes a direct connection between an FPGA and a resistive array distributed in M rows and N columns, without the need of analog-to-digital converters to obtain resistance values in the sensor and where the conditioning circuit is reduced to the use of a capacitor in each of the columns of the matrix. The circuit allows parallel measurements of the N resistors which form each of the rows of the array, eliminating the resistive crosstalk which is typical of these circuits. This is achieved by an addressing technique which does not require external elements to the FPGA. Although the typical resistive crosstalk between resistors which are measured simultaneously is eliminated, other elements that have an impact on the measurement of discharge times appear in the proposed architecture and, therefore, affect the uncertainty in resistance value measurements; these elements need to be studied. Finally, the performance of different calibration techniques is assessed experimentally on a discrete resistor array, obtaining for a new model of calibration, a maximum relative error of 0.066% in a range of resistor values which correspond to a tactile sensor.	analog;analog-to-digital converter;approximation error;bortezomib/dexamethasone/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin regimen;calibration;capacitor device component;column (database);conditioning (psychology);crosstalk;discharger;effective number of bits;experiment;field-programmable gate array;input/output;linear function;normal mode;quantitation;resistor device component;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;tactile sensor;the matrix;traffic collision avoidance system;value-driven design;electrode;newton;sensor (device)	Óscar Oballe-Peinado;Fernando Vidal-Verdú;José A.

The ESR spectrum are the same as that as-grown samples with Xe light, which are illumination time changes the relative density of intrinsic defects in 4H-SiC; the relative density of intrinsic defects reaches a maximum when the illumination time is 2.5 min, and the ratio of Vc to complex compounds is minimized simultaneously.

The main factors which influence greatly the distribution of the electric field in the gap, and hence the above values are the geometry and the selection of grounding and charging of the electrodes, (ground effect), the gap length, the existence of barrier in the gap (barrier effect), and the Corona effects appearing prior to breakdown. Combining theoretical, simulation and experimental work, it is resulted that: a) The electrode chosen to be ground, strongly influences the distribution of the field and the Corona effects and hence the values of the Corona onset and breakdown voltage. When the rod is grounded and the plate is negatively charged the value of Corona onset voltage is higher, the corona effects are less intense and dc breakdown voltage, without Corona, is higher. When the plate is grounded and the rod is negatively charged the value of the Corona onset voltage is lower, the corona effects are more intense and hence the dc breakdown voltage is higher. b) A dielectric barrier, when placed in specific positions in the gap, decreases the Corona effects and raises the breakdown dc voltage. c) In air gaps stressed by impulse voltages the results are very different. The corona onset and the breakdown voltage are maximum when the rod is grounded and positive leading to more intense Corona effects.	air gap (networking);diameter (protocol);emoticon;finite element method;onset (audio);parallax barrier;simulation;voltage regulator module	Athanasios Maglaras;Trifon Kousiouris;Frangiskos Topalis;Leandros A.

The need for heterogeneous integration, superior electrical and thermal performance, reduction of form factor and overall system-footprint, and integration of high-density interconnects are the main driving forces behind the development of these advanced packaging techniques. As the packaging and system integration is becoming more complex, the emphasis is mainly on improving the reliability of system-level packaging rather than the individually packaged devices.	copper;diarrhea 5, with tufting enteropathy, congenital;dental intrusion;electrical connection;electromigration;emergence;entity name part qualifier - adopted;exposure to humidity;fan-out;fever;heat shock protein 27;immersion (virtual reality);power cycling;salineos;silicon;stacking;switched fabric;system integration;tail value at risk;thermal grease;uc browser;anatomical layer;fangchinoline;oxidation	Subramanian S.

This paper presents constitutive and reliability information on one of the widely used high lead solder materials as a baseline, and discusses potential alternative technologies for high temperature solders with the goal of identifying a cost-effective lead-free solder that can be used at temperatures greater than 200°C.

We propose three types of driving force (i.e., fuel for DNA nano-robots): thermal fuel, pH fuel, and light fuel. The thermal fuel controls the hybridization of DNA molecules around the melting temperature. The pH fuel controls the hybridization of the so-called i-motif by changing the pH condition. The light fuel controls the hybridization of DNA oligomers that are intercalated with azobenzene by irradiation with UV or visible light. These three fuels are not mutually exclusive. However, experimental conditions for the fueling of DNA nano-robots show efficacy. Concrete ideas for using these three fuel types are proposed and discussed.	dna computing;gnu nano;robotics	Akio Nishikawa;Satsuki Yaegashi;Kazumasa Ohtake;Masami Hagiya	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77962-9_8	materials science;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;forensic engineering	ML	95.0668805323708	-16.094626761301562	105662

In this method, local harmonic motion is generated in the tissue using a focused ultrasound probe. A narrow-band microwave signal is transmitted to the tissue. The Doppler component of the scattered signal, which depends on the dielectric and elastic properties of the vibrating region, is sensed. A plane-wave spectrum technique is used together with reciprocity theorem for calculating the response of a vibrating electrically small spherical tumor in breast tissue. The effects of operating frequency, antenna alignment and distance, and tumor depth on the received signal are presented. The effect of harmonic motion frequency on the vibration amplitude and displacement distribution is investigated with mechanical simulations using the finite element method. The safety of the method is analyzed in terms of microwave and ultrasound exposure of the breast tissue. The results show that the method has a potential in detecting tumors inside fibro-glandular breast tissue.	antenna device component;clock rate;displacement mapping;doppler effect;electricity;finite element method;focused ultrasound therapy;mammary gland parenchyma;microwave;neoplasms;psychologic displacement;sensor;simulation;spectral density;stage 0 breast carcinoma;anatomical layer;transmission process	Can Baris Top;Nevzat G.

The visor assembly includes a control arm that is mounted to a vehicle support structure, such as a roof, for example. The control arm rotatably supports the visor substrate with respect to the vehicle support structure. In the lowered position the visor substrate is rotated downwardly about the control arm to partially block a top portion of the windshield so that sunlight is prevented from shining directly into an occupantu0027s eyes. In the raised position, the visor is rotated upwardly so that it is near the headliner and does not block the windshield. The visor assembly also includes a control member that connects the control arm to the visor substrate body. The control member selectively positions the visor substrate at various positions between the raised and lowered positions. The control member has a tab that extends in a first direction and a plurality of barbs that extend in a second direction different than the first direction. The tab and barbs retain the control member to the visor substrate.

In the blood pump, a spiral groove bearing was adopted for a thrust bearing. In the spiral groove bearing, separation of erythrocytes and plasma by plasma skimming has been postulated to occur. However, it is not clarified that plasma skimming occurs in a spiral groove bearing. The purpose of this study is to verify whether plasma skimming occurs in the spiral groove bearing of a hydrodynamically levitated centrifugal blood pump. For evaluation of plasma skimming in the spiral groove bearing, an impeller levitation performance test using a laser focus displacement meter and a microscopic visualization test of erythrocyte flow using a high-speed microscope were conducted. Bovine blood diluted with autologous plasma to adjust hematocrit to 1.0% was used as a working fluid. Hematocrit on the ridge region in the spiral groove bearing was estimated using image analysis. As a result, hematocrits on the ridge region with gaps of 45 μm, 31 μm, and 25 μm were calculated as 1.0%, 0.6%, and 0.3%, respectively. Maximum skimming efficiency in this study was calculated as 70% with a gap of 25 μm. We confirmed that separation of erythrocyte and plasma occurred in the spiral groove bearing with decrease in bearing gap in a hydrodynamically levitated centrifugal blood pump.	cardiovascular system;centrifugal governor;clarify;displacement mapping;entity name part qualifier - adopted;erythrocytes;gpc3 gene;groove;hematocrit procedure;hemopoietic stem cell transplant;image analysis;imagery;mandibular right second molar tooth;microscope device component;plasma active;psychologic displacement;super game boy;thrust;windows hardware certification kit;cell surface furrow	Tomotaka Murashige;Ryo Kosaka;Daisuke Sakota;Masahiro Nishida;Yasuo Kawaguchi;Takashi Yamane;Osamu Maruyama	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318352	engineering;forensic engineering;mechanical engineering	Visualization	88.54404245134111	-21.30184447430488	106036

This cut detection sensor is produced by printing a single stroke pattern of ultra-thin conductive lines almost invisible to naked eye on the surface of IR emitting sheet. As the conductive lines are almost invisible, the sheet does not obstruct viewing of the display screen and is unlikely to be unnoticed by a person who considers photo/video shooting. Detection of a cut is made by real time measurement of electrical resistance of the conductive lines or real time monitoring of transmission/reception of information, and the information can be protected by turning off power to the display. The authors produced prototype cut detection sensors using manufacturing technique of the transparent conductive film and knowhow of offset lithography to reduce two adverse effects caused by conductive lines (decrease in visible transmittance and generation of the moiré pattern on the display screen that makes viewing of the screen difficult). Visible transmittance of the prototype sensor was as high as 84.9% and no moiré pattern was observed when it was applied to the display screen. The prototype sensor showed excellent bending resistance (conductive lines will not break when the sensor is bent) and can detect a cut in vertical, horizontal, and oblique directions and can raise alert when the sensor is cut in a length exceeding about 8 mm. Discussions were made for practical application of such cut sensor, and it was found that the sensor can be produced at low cost, is resistant for harsh environment, and is compatible for use with the microrouver.	authorization;information leakage;oblique projection;printing;prototype;sensor;shot transition detection;spectral leakage	Masaki Fujikawa;Ryosuke Kamai;Sou Tsunetsugu;Michiko Ogawa	2014	2014 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)	10.1109/CCST.2014.6986986	electronic engineering;engineering;optoelectronics;optics	Mobile	87.0755465668414	-21.55322433177974	106176
4564a3914460dceeab49104142381ff130616372	a fiber bragg grating sensor for radial artery pulse waveform measurement		In this paper, we report the design and experimental validation of a novel optical sensor for radial artery pulse measurement based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and lever amplification mechanism. Pulse waveform analysis is a diagnostic tool for clinical examination and disease diagnosis. High fidelity radial artery pulse waveform has been investigated in clinical studies for estimating central aortic pressure, which is proved to be predictors of cardiovascular diseases. As a three-dimensional cylinder, the radial artery needs to be examined from different locations to achieve optimal pulse waveform for estimation and diagnosis. The proposed optical sensing system is featured as high sensitivity and immunity to electromagnetic interference for multilocation radial artery pulse waveform measurement. The FBG sensor can achieve the sensitivity of 8.236 nm/N, which is comparable to a commonly used electrical sensor. This FBG-based system can provide high accurate measurement, and the key characteristic parameters can be then extracted from the raw signals for clinical applications. The detecting performance is validated through experiments guided by physicians. In the experimental validation, we applied this sensor to measure the pulse waveforms at various positions and depths of the radial artery in the wrist according to the diagnostic requirements. The results demonstrate the high feasibility of using optical systems for physiological measurement and using this FBG sensor for radial artery pulse waveform in clinical applications.	audio signal processing;cardiovascular diseases;cylinder seal;estimated;experiment;extraction;image sensor;interference (communication);optical system;optical fiber;psyllium 14.2 mg/ml oral suspension;radial (radio);radial basis function;requirement;structure of radial artery;tissue fiber;waveform	Dagong Jia;Jing Chao;Shuai Li;Hongxia Zhang;Yingzhan Yan;Tiegen Liu;Ye Sun	2018	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2722008	fiber bragg grating;electronic engineering;electromagnetic interference;radial artery;computer science;waveform;pulse (signal processing)	Mobile	93.84137222601052	-22.034653746052772	106177

Even though the cutting mechanism of the ablation process is different from that of the mechanical cutting process, an identical toolpath of the mechanical cutting process has been applied to the ablation process. An inappropriate toolpath for the ablation process may result in a lower dimensional accuracy of the ablated part. Therefore, a new toolpath planning algorithm considering the characteristics of the energy source is required. In this paper, a toolpath planning algorithm for the ablation process is proposed. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: (1) The generation of a valid toolpath element, (2) the storage of toolpath elements and the creation of sub-groups, (3) the linking of sub-groups. New guidelines on the toolpath demanded by the ablation process are studied. A new idea involving the use of a storage matrix is applied to the storage of toolpath elements and the creation of sub-groups. In order to verify the applicability of the proposed algorithm, the proposed toolpath planning algorithm has been implemented and tested with practical examples.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling	Hyung Chul Kim;Seung Jun Lee;Deyou Yang	2009	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2008.12.005	electric power;engineering;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	EDA	85.61665204223209	-14.768208990232182	106283

The array is fabricated by micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology. The radii of the disk working electrodes are 400 μm and 500 μm while the distance between the working electrodes and counting electrode is 100 μm. The counter electrode is composed of difference arc rings. The radian of the arc rings ranges from n to μm while the radius ranges from 100 (μm to μm for different chips. The arrays are characterized by cyclic voltammetry in the presence of the redox probe ferrocenemethanol (FcM). It is found that the peak current has a biggest value between 3π/2 and 5π/3 at the same radius of arc rings. The peak current increases along with the increasing of the radius of the arc rings. For working electrode in same size, the best design has the peak current 35% higher than the smallest peak current. An optimal design of the high sensitivity electrochemical sensor is found.	microelectromechanical systems;optimal design;probe effect;ring counter;sensor	Xiaosen Chai;Chun Xu;Jia Zhou	2010	2010 IEEE 5th International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2010.5592272	materials science;chemistry;electrochemistry;electrode;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems	EDA	93.45397114245675	-16.820970541265815	106529
a866d584f2b58cade4d6bd11e6654e91b946dbe9	analytical modeling of rdf effects on the threshold voltage in short-channel double-gate mosfets		The massive scaling of semiconducting devices is still the most favorable way to enhance device performance to this day. This leads to emerging ultra low power devices with channel lengths down to 14 nm [1]. In this small dimensions the discretization of doping profiles gains influence on the device current, namely random dopant fluctuations (RDF). Therefore, the topic of variability in terms of fabricating these devices is getting more and more important. The simulate on analysis in this paper should give a deeper insight on the variability problems emerging in this new dimension regimes regarding doping discretization and fabrication tolerances. An improved model is introduced which allows an estimation of the RDF-based threshold voltage deviation σvth for MOSFET devices. The simulations are done using randomized profiles with the FEM-Simulator TCAD Sentaurus.	discretization;dopant;doping (semiconductor);finite element method;heart rate variability;image scaling;power semiconductor device;randomized algorithm;rectangular potential barrier;simulation;spatial variability;traffic collision avoidance system;voltage reference	Michael Graef;Franziska Hain;Fabian Hosenfeld;Fabian Horst;Atieh Farokhnejad;Benjamín Iñíguez;Alexander Kloes	2017	"""2017 MIXDES - 24th International Conference """"Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems"""	10.23919/MIXDES.2017.8005168	electronic engineering;computer science;mosfet;dopant;discretization;threshold voltage;logic gate;doping;power semiconductor device;communication channel	EDA	89.66724448362105	-10.248313612765283	106639
75d16ce427e44fc784ad7e63b788e06a99cc6971	passive mixing capabilities of micro- and nanofibres when used in microfluidic systems	fluid mixing;540 chemie;nanofibres;microfluidics;ddc 540;biosensors	Nanofibres are increasingly being used in the field of bioanalytics due to their large surface-area-to-volume ratios and easy-to-functionalize surfaces. To date, nanofibres have been studied as effective filters, concentrators, and immobilization matrices within microfluidic devices. In addition, they are frequently used as optical and electrochemical transduction materials. In this work, we demonstrate that electrospun nanofibre mats cause appreciable passive mixing and therefore provide dual functionality when incorporated within microfluidic systems. Specifically, electrospun nanofibre mats were integrated into Y-shaped poly(methyl methacrylate) microchannels and the degree of mixing was quantified using fluorescence microscopy and ImageJ analysis. The degree of mixing afforded in relationship to fibre diameter, mat height, and mat length was studied. We observed that the most mixing was caused by small diameter PVA nanofibres (450-550 nm in diameter), producing up to 71% mixing at the microchannel outlet, compared to up to 51% with polystyrene microfibres (0.8-2.7 μm in diameter) and 29% mixing in control channels containing no fibres. The mixing afforded by the PVA nanofibres is caused by significant inhomogeneity in pore size and distribution leading to percolation. As expected, within all the studies, fluid mixing increased with fibre mat height, which corresponds to the vertical space of the microchannel occupied by the fibre mats. Doubling the height of the fibre mat led to an average increase in mixing of 14% for the PVA nanofibres and 8% for the PS microfibres. Overall, mixing was independent of the length of the fibre mat used (3-10 mm), suggesting that most mixing occurs as fluid enters and exits the fibre mat. The mixing effects observed within the fibre mats were comparable to or better than many passive mixers reported in literature. Since the nanofibre mats can be further functionalized to couple analyte concentration, immobilization, and detection with enhanced fluid mixing, they are a promising nanomaterial providing dual-functionality within lab-on-a-chip devices.	dance pad;diameter (qualifier value);dual;ethanol 0.62 ml/ml topical gel;experiment;galaxy morphological classification;hybrid fibre-coaxial;image embossing;imagej;immobiliser;linear iga bullous dermatosis;material pore size;mathematical morphology;methacrylates;microchip analytical devices;microfluidics;microscopy, fluorescence;mixing (mathematics);nanostructured materials;optical fiber;passive optical network;percent mass per mass;percolation;period-doubling bifurcation;polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate;polymer;polymers;polymethyl methacrylate;polystyrenes;polyvinyl alcohol;ps (unix);pyschological bonding;schematic;sodium polystyrene sulfonate;transduction (machine learning);unit of measure prefix - micro;analyte;anatomical layer;sensor (device)	Lauren Matlock-Colangelo;Nicholas W.

In the present work, an experimental investigation has been carried out to study and predict the effect of process parameters viz., voltage supplied to the electromagnet, machining gap, rotational speed of electromagnet and size of SiC abrasive particles on percentage improvement in surface finish (%∆Ra) and material removal (MR). The austenitic stainless steel grade 316L, non-magnetic, surgical implant material is selected for the experimental study. The experiments are planned based on Taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array. Using the experimental data, regression models were developed for predicting the %∆Ra and MR. From the experimental results, it is found that the prediction error for %∆Ra and MR using the proposed regression model is 4.16% and 6.96% respectively. The developed regression models were used to study the effect of process parameters on %∆Ra and MR. The surface topography of the magnetic abrasive finished surfaces was analysed using scanning electron microscopy and presented in this work.	design of experiments;electron;experiment;high-level programming language;taguchi methods;topography;viz: the computer game	T.

Thus the two working members and the carrier beam constitute a working unit which is readily releasable from the frame. The two working members of the pair are interlinked by a connecting rod to ensure a uniform operating depth over irregular ground and the members can be located on opposite sides of the carrier beam as viewed in plan. In one embodiment, the working members are mounted on pivot pins journalled to different frame beams and the members are arranged in rows that are inclined to the direction of travel. The beams with working members can be arranged in groups that are hinged to one another for elevation to a reduced transport position. A wheeled central frame portion has an intermediate frame portion and an outer frame portion to each side which are linked to a respective swingable arm. The arm can be turned by a hydraulic ram so that, first, the outer portion is raised and then the intermediate portion is elevated above the central portion.		Raúl Cabido;Antonio S.

For suitability in such applications, the structures often need to have complex three-dimensional shapes, be smaller than or at least as small as the applied wavelengths, consist of metals or dielectric materials, and have certain electromagnetic characteristics such as high permittivity. Although there are several methods for fabricating micro-structures, few of them satisfy all of these conditions. We propose a new fabrication method for dielectric-metal three-dimensional structures with sizes of a few tens of micrometers. The main feature of our method is the extraction of metal using photocatalyst nanoparticles. Silver ions in solution are reduced to neutral silver by electrons from the photocatalyst nanoparticles. Experimental results show that our system can be used to fabricate threedimensional structures, and we propose a new method for controlling the composition of the structures.

These mirror stages are right triangular blocks symmetrically arranged and attached to the mounting plate such that the hypotenuse surfaces of the triangular blocks all make 45(∘) to the plate surface. The cylindrical/polygonal mouse holder has semitransparent rainbow bands on its side surface for the acquisition of spectrally resolved data. Numerical studies and experiments are performed to demonstrate the feasibility of this system. It is shown that bioluminescent signals collected using our system can produce a similar BLT reconstruction quality while reducing the data acquisition time, as compared to the sequential data acquisition mode.	balanced ligamentous tension technique (procedure);bands;bioluminescence test;data acquisition;electron tomography;experiment;holder device component;multispectral image;photographic plate;systems design	Ge Wang;Haiou Shen;Kumar Durairaj;Xin Qian;Wenxiang Cong	2006	International Journal of Biomedical Imaging	10.1155/IJBI/2006/58601	biology;medical research;medicine;computer science;bioinformatics	Robotics	95.71429514317656	-20.416892193797516	107543

In the degraded devices, trap level with activation energy of 0.45–0.47 eV was observed and attributed to surface related traps. This indicates that oxygen may play a crucial role for AlGaN/GaN HEMT reliability.		Milan Tapajna;Nicole Killat;Uttiya Chowdhury;Jose L.

fd114010d56421bc7327498d6c6cd730136ae27f	maximum stress estimation model for multi-span waler beams with deflections at the supports using average strains	average strain;maximum stress;vibrating wire strain gauge;models theoretical;stress mechanical;structural health monitoring	The safety of a multi-span waler beam subjected simultaneously to a distributed load and deflections at its supports can be secured by limiting the maximum stress of the beam to a specific value to prevent the beam from reaching a limit state for failure or collapse. Despite the fact that the vast majority of accidents on construction sites occur at waler beams in retaining wall systems, no safety monitoring model that can consider deflections at the supports of the beam is available. In this paper, a maximum stress estimation model for a waler beam based on average strains measured from vibrating wire strain gauges (VWSGs), the most frequently used sensors in construction field, is presented. The model is derived by defining the relationship between the maximum stress and the average strains measured from VWSGs. In addition to the maximum stress, support reactions, deflections at supports, and the magnitudes of distributed loads for the beam structure can be identified by the estimation model using the average strains. Using simulation tests on two multi-span beams, the performance of the model is evaluated by estimating maximum stress, deflections at supports, support reactions, and the magnitudes of distributed loads.	estimated;numerous;simulation;span distance;sensor (device)	Sung Woo Park;Byung Kwan Oh;Hyo Seon Park	2015		10.3390/s150407728	structural engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	Metrics	86.56395194728573	-12.511202312230637	107806

Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), with high resolution and high acquisition speed, has been widely used in biological tissue imaging in recent years. By evaluation of phase difference between consecutive A-scan lines, SDOCT provides the ability for flow velocity measurement. In order to find the optimize SDOCT system for early stage chicken embryo heart outflow tract (OFT) flow measurement, two spectral domain optical coherence tomography setups were built in our lab with different central wavelength, i.e. 845nm and 1321nm. The performances of the two systems are compared and we found that the system with 1321nm wavelength is more suitable for this application since it has sufficient penetration depth.	chicken;microsoft outlook for mac;performance;scan line;tomography;tract (literature);velocity (software development)	Zhenhe Ma;Xu Tao	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Virtual Environments Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurement Systems (VECIMS) Proceedings	10.1109/VECIMS.2012.6273187	image resolution;blood flow;hemodynamics	HPC	95.74534554268693	-23.87526560416252	108028
6829ede19d5f2216e7ab15a27119d4e685b2eec9	effect of voids on thermo-mechanical reliability of chip resistor solder joints: experiment, modelling and simulation		With the introduction of lead-free solder alloys, the effect of voids on solder joint reliability has rapidly gained importance. In this study, a first analysis of X-rayed CR0805 solder joints shows a significant reduction in void content, from 20% down to 2.5%, after vacuum soldering. The statistical analysis of the void distribution demonstrates that the vacuum option reduces number of voids and median diameter of voids in comparison to the convection soldering process. A subsequent accelerated thermal cycling test of these analysed test vehicles, according to JESD22-A104D, indicates the tendency of a higher characteristic life time for higher void content. In contrast to these findings, the 1% to failure criterion reveals a higher reliability for lower voiding. During the finite element method (FEM) modelling part of this study, two modelling approaches of void implementation into solder joint geometry are investigated: modelling with a constant volume of the standoff for different void contents, and a modelling approach with a random combination of void content and volume of standoff. The modelling approach with the random combination reveals that voids can reduce the lifetime in the “worst case” parameter combination. In particular, the 1% time to failure rate indicates a quantitative correlation with the experimental results. Furthermore, the FEM results suggest a higher impact on reliability for a single void in comparison to a distribution of multiple voids with similar void content. Finally, the FEM study shows a high sensitivity of predicted life time with respect to the standoff height. Based on this finding, the CR0805 solder joint geometry is examined using optical inspection and cross-section polishes with the outcome that the better wetting behaviour during vacuum soldering causes a reduction of the solder alloy volume and consequently further decreases the standoff height.	simulation	Paul Wild;Dominik Lorenz;T.

Wet clean is one of the critical steps to remove post plasma etch residues. In this paper, the impacts of wet clean process after etching of (a) via, (b) metal 2 trench and (c) Cu cap of dual damascene structure on electrical performance of 130 nm Cu/CVD low k SiOCH metallization were explored and discussed. Electrical yields and dielectric breakdown strength of interconnects from the use of batch spray and single wafer processing systems of wet clean were also compared. We observed that electrical yields of interconnects were considerably dependant on optimized processing conditions (temperature, time, and mega-sonic power) and appropriate wet clean chemistry. The use of fluoride-based mixture of wet clean chemical for all three post-etch clean is very effective in cleaning the via and trench line before Ta barrier/Cu seed deposition. As a result, we successfully integrated double level Cu/CVD low k BEOL interconnection with excellent electrical and reliability performance.	debian	C. F. Tsang;C. K. Chang;A. Krishnamoorthy;K. Y.

For this purpose, FBGs were inscribed into the multimode CYTOP fiber with a core diameter of 50 µm by using a krypton fluoride (KrF) excimer laser and the phase mask method. The evolution of the reflection spectrum of the FBG detected with a multimode interrogation technique revealed a single reflection peak with a full width at half maximum (FHWM) bandwidth of about 9 nm. Furthermore, the spectral envelope of the single FBG reflection peak can be optimized depending on the KrF excimer laser irradiation time. A linear shift of the Bragg wavelength due to applied strain, temperature and humidity was measured. Furthermore, depending on irradiation time of the KrF excimer laser, both the failure strain and strain sensitivity of the multimode fiber with FBG can be controlled. The inherent low light attenuation in the near infrared wavelength range (telecommunication window) of the multimode CYTOP fiber and the single FBG reflection peak when applying the multimode interrogation set-up will allow for new applications in the area of telecommunication and optical sensing.	core (optical fiber);diameter (qualifier value);exposure to humidity;fb term type;fluorides;full width at half maximum;hysteresis;image sensor;lasers, excimer;mac os x 10.3 panther;optical fiber;passive optical network;polymer;quantity;tissue fiber;whole earth 'lectronic link;krypton fluoride;negative regulation of protein depolymerization;wavelength	Yulong Zheng;Kort Bremer;Bernhard Roth	2018		10.3390/s18051436	full width at half maximum;optical fiber;fiber bragg grating;attenuation;analytical chemistry;engineering;excimer laser;optoelectronics;multi-mode optical fiber;fiber;wavelength	Graphics	93.30167617787752	-17.25353432817583	108112

Superconducting wires made of alloys such as NbTi have already been commercialized and applied to MRI and NMR, and superconducting wires made of metal compounds such as Nb3Sn have been manufactured for use in high-field applications such as accelerators and nuclear fusion. Since a high-TC superconductor (over 77 K) was discovered approximately 25 years ago, it has been expected that they will be used in electric power apparatus such as cables and electricity storage devices. Among the various high-TC superconductors, Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 (Bi2223) and REBa2Cu3Oy (RE123) (RE: rare earth elements) have mainly been investigated with aim of producing superconducting wires. Among the other superconductors, MgB2 superconductors, which are expected to lead to a lower manufacturing cost, and the recently discovered ironbased superconductors are being studied at present.

This paper describes noncontact assessment of tremor characteristics obtained by an experimental new ultrawideband (UWB) system. The system is based on transmission of a wideband electromagnetic signal with extremely low power, and analysis of the received signal, which is composed of many propagation paths reflected from the patient and its surroundings. A description of the physical principles behind the technology, a criterion, and efficient algorithms to assess tremor characteristics from the bulk UWB measurements are given. A feasibility test for the technology was conducted using a UWB system prototype, an arm model that mimics tremor, and a reference video system. The set of UWB system frequencies and amplitudes estimations were highly correlated with the video system estimations with an average error in the scale of 0.1 Hz and 1 mm for the frequency and amplitude estimations, respectively. The new UWB-based system does not require attaching active markers or inertial sensors to the body, can give displacement information and kinematic features from multiple body parts, is not limited by the range captured by the optical lens, has high indoor volume coverage as it can penetrate through walls, and does not require calibration to obtain amplitude estimations.	approximation algorithm;body part;displacement mapping;e-patient;hertz (hz);internet access;less than;low-power broadcasting;node - plant part;parkinson disease;patients;prototype;psychologic displacement;radar;sensor node;software propagation;spectral density estimation;tremor;usb hub;ultra-wideband;verifying specimen;walls of a building;nervous system disorder;sensor (device);standards characteristics;tributyl phosphate	Gaddi Blumrosen;Moshe Uziel;Boris Rubinsky;Dana Porrat	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2011.2177977	electronic engineering;reflection;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;ultra-wideband;remote patient monitoring;optics;arm architecture;neurophysiology;physics;radar	Mobile	93.807480054697	-22.650971142361573	108457

However, traditional monitoring measures, such as using mechanical extensometers or electronic gauges, either require arduous underground labor or cannot function properly in the harsh underground environment. Therefore, in this paper, in order to break through this technological barrier, a novel monitoring system for roof safety control in underground coal mining, using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) material as a perceived element and transmission medium, has been developed. Compared with traditional monitoring equipment, the developed, novel monitoring system has the advantages of providing accurate, reliable, and continuous online monitoring of roof activities in underground coal mining. This is expected to further enable the prevention of catastrophic roof collapse accidents. The system has been successfully implemented at a deep hazardous roadway in Zhuji Coal Mine, China. Monitoring results from the study site have demonstrated the advantages of FBG-based sensors over traditional monitoring approaches. The dynamic impacts of progressive face advance on roof displacement and stress have been accurately captured by the novel roadway roof activity and safety monitoring system, which provided essential references for roadway support and design of the mine.	catastrophic illness;coal;displacement mapping;entity name part qualifier - adopted;optical fiber;psychologic displacement;roof physical object;tissue fiber;underground;calcium polycarbophil 625 mg oral tablet;monitoring systems;sensor (device)	Yiming Zhao;Nong Zhang;Guangyao Si	2016		10.3390/s16101759	structural engineering;engineering;civil engineering;forensic engineering	Mobile	90.66489520017606	-21.65528570407765	108519

The material flow stress data are obtained from Split Hopkinson Bar experiment. The material behaviour is modelled with a classical JohnsonCook law to accomplish the thermo-mechanical analysis. Good agreements between the numerical results and experimental data at various cutting velocities prove that the proposed model is capable of predicting the cutting forces and temperatures during milling of 300M steel accurately.

Sinusoidally modulated ARF excitations between 200 - 4000 Hz generate a surface wave at the tissue surface that can be related to bulk viscoelastic (VE) properties in a manner that is both precise and quantitative. This method is very well suited to studying media at high spatial resolution and over a very broad range of force frequencies. Mechanical characterization was calibrated using hydropolymers before studying liver samples. Fresh porcine liver samples were measured over time with and without formalin fixation. These data were used to evaluate the utility of the Kelvin-Voigt rheological model commonly used to fit dispersion data when estimating modulus values.

They have recently been shown to be very favorable probes for ultrasensitive detection. When specifically attached to a biomolecule of interest, they allow for single molecule tracking in live cells over unprecedented durations and open new prospects for the study of cellular dynamics. We present an algorithm for automatically detecting and tracking QDs in sequences of fluorescence images. It accounts for the blinking in the fluorescence signal of individual QDs assuming Brownian dynamics of the biomolecules. Our algorithm analyzes images sequentially and can be extended to a real-time use.	algorithm;quantum dot;real-time clock;real-time computing;semiconductor;sensor	Stephane Bonneau;Laurent D.

In fabrication that uses top down method, etch process hold a chief role. Varieties of etch times and oxygen flow rates in ranges 75-88s and 20-50sccm, respectively, were devised to fabricate optimum dimension of nanostructure. As a result, as etch time increased, lateral etch rate of silicon quantum dot, source and drain and also the nanostructure etch depth increased. However, high roughness of etched silicon surface profile led to concave surfaces of source and drain. In this research, no significant relation between quantum dot diameters and oxygen flow rates was found.

This inkjet printhead is manufactured in a batch process with rapid prototyping techniques in order to be able to be adapted to new boundary conditions in a time saving manner. The manufacturing time only amounts less than 30 minutes. The inkjet printhead is inserted into a support plate. Here, it is electrically as well as fluidically connected without any soldering or gluing processes. Heating elements, temperature as well as pressure sensors, and a fluid reservoir are integrated. The reproducibility of experiments is thereby given. Furthermore, printing fluids with solid-liquid phase transition is possible.

4cd74d2898af9d7f99d970aad577c16b681bd54e	inverse methods of determining the acoustical parameters of porous sound absorbing metallic materials		Porous metallic material has become a kind of typical multifunctional material with the quick development of advanced manufacturing and forming process technologies in past years. At present, it has also been a structural function material with the characteristics of ultra-light weight, high specific strength and rigidity. As a sound absorbing material in noise control engineering, the acoustical parameters of porous metallic materials, especially such as the sinuosity factor, viscous and thermal characteristic lengths, are relatively difficult to obtain directly from the measurements under the common experimental conditions. On the contrary, the sound reflection and absorption coefficients,and the normal surface acoustic impedance of porous metallic materials are easy to exactly measure in a standard acoustic impedance tube. As a result, this paper introduced the inverse methods in order to determine the acoustical parameters of porous metallic materials based on available sound absorbing models such as Johnson-Champoux-Allard model, Biot-Allard model, etc. Moreover, inverse methods based on Taboo search algorithm (TSA), simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA) and linear regression (LR), were developed; by which the main acoustical parameters of some porous metallic materials were found out for use elsewhere as well. Finally, the results from the different inverse methods were in comparison with each other to validate the effectiveness of the aforementioned inverse algorithms.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;characteristic impedance;coefficient;control engineering;genetic algorithm;ising model;lr parser;multi-function printer;search algorithm;simulated annealing;software release life cycle;williams tube	Bo Zhang;Jiang Zhu	2016	Proc.

In the ISBT active region, the precise control of crystal growth is strongly required. In this work, the hydrogen-annealing surface flattening of Si substrates was employed to obtain a high quality active region to suppress non-radiative leakage current. A markedly flat surface was obtained in the 30-µm-wide trench bottom after hydrogen annealing. In the EL measurement of the device fabricated in the trench, the EL intensity was approximately 40 times stronger than that of the device without patterning and hydrogen annealing.	hydrogen;simulated annealing;substrate (electronics)	Keisuke Jinen;Kaoru Uchida;Shinji Kodaira;Masahiro Watanabe;Masahiro Asada	2006	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.3.493	electroluminescence;near-infrared spectroscopy;electronic engineering;optoelectronics;optics;silicon;physics	Logic	92.57271006876596	-13.079206333590987	110475

The conventional Wagner-Earth technique is not suitable for continuous measurement. In this paper, a modified operational-amplifier-based Maxwell-Wien bridge measurement technique has been proposed in which the effect of stray capacitance and inductance is minimized. In the first phase of the experiment, the bridge performance has been studied with a known variable inductor, and in the second phase, the same experimentation was done by replacing the variable inductor with an inductive coil having an adjustable core position for the measurement of displacement. The linear characteristics over a wide range of displacement with good repeatability, linearity, and variable sensitivity have been described.	bridge circuit;displacement mapping;inductive reasoning;maxwell (microarchitecture);maxwell bridge;operational amplifier;repeatability;sandy bridge;transducer;wien bridge	S.

After the acidification of the carbon nanotube (CNT), the in-situ polymerization of the aminobenzene monomers was conducted on the surface of the acidified CNT to form a sensitive material composed of a polyaniline/carbon nanotube (PANI/CNT) composite. The Advanced Design System (ADS) software was used for simulating and analyzing the designed structure, which obtained the various parameters of the structure. A lead-free aluminum paste was printed on an alumina ceramic substrate via the screen printing technique to form an inductor coil, before the gas sensitive material was applied to prepare a wireless passive gas sensor, consisting of a single-turn inductor and interdigitated electrodes on the base structure. Finally, an experimental platform was built to test the performance of the sensor. The sensitivity of the gas sensor is about 0.04 MHz/ppm in an atmosphere with a NH₃ concentration of 300 ppm. The sensor was shown to have good repeatability and high stability over a long time period.	advanced design system;aluminum oxide;aluminum paste;aniline;carbon cycle;coil device component;inductor device component;megahertz;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;printing;repeatability;simulation;tesla coil;electrode;monomer;part per million (ppm);polyaniline	Sanmin Shen;Zhihong Fan;Jiahao Deng;Xiaowei Guo;Guanyu Liu;Qiulin Tan;Jijun Xiong	2018		10.3390/s18093022	electronic engineering;engineering;wireless;composite number	Mobile	92.6165169121359	-17.03632076078069	110787

Then the simulation model is taken as a virtual milling test system to replace extensive real milling experiments. Secondly, the specific cutting coefficients in the mechanistic milling forces model are identified by the support vector regression method using the training sample generated from the established virtual milling test system. Lastly, this methodology was validated by the slot milling operation of 2024-T3 aluminum sheets.

05c747a05d1fa54068aa0ca2ce1ec8742ad9983a	low-velocity impact localization on composites under sensor damage by interpolation reference database and fuzzy evidence theory		Composites are widely used in aeronautical manufacturing. Despite their excellent properties, composites suffer from barely visible impact damage caused by low-velocity objects. Random impacts need to be detected and located to alert pilots and engineers of the need for maintenance. Generally, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are installed in aerospace composites, and a reference database is established by recording the reference signals from different impact positions. The random impact is located by comparing its signal to the reference signals in the database. The performance of current localization algorithms mainly relies on the repeatability of FBG signals. However, the FBG sensors or their installation structures may be damaged by repeated impacts during the monitoring process, and the localization accuracy will decrease. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed based on the interpolation reference database and fuzzy evidence theory to realize accurate impact localization under sensor damage. More correlation coefficients are obtained from the basic reference database by interpolation, and the influence of damaged sensors on localization results is reduced by fuzzy evidence theory. The proposed algorithm was tested on a carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate with four surface-attached FBG sensors. A parametric study was conducted to determine the coefficients of the algorithm. The localization performance was analyzed with both properly functioning sensors and damaged sensors. The results showed that the localization accuracy was better than the existing algorithms, especially in the case of sensor damage.	algorithm;bibliographic database;interpolation;optical fiber;polymer;sensor;velocity (software development)	Hongyang Li;Zhongyu Wang;Jeffrey Forrest;Wen-Song Jiang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844802	repeatability;fiber bragg grating;interpolation;fuzzy logic;database;carbon fiber reinforced polymer;parametric statistics;computer science;correlation coefficient;composite material	Embedded	90.7922157194844	-21.512081808443916	111072

It is proved that, since the die degradation under specific conditions increases the temperature swing, bond wires undergo harsher thermo-mechanical stress than expected. The experimental results confirm the die-related thermal failure mechanism. An improved degradation model is proposed for the bond-wire resistance increase in case of die degradation.	elegant degradation;power mosfet	Haoze Luo;Nick Baker;Francesco Iannuzzo;Frede Blaabjerg	2017	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2017.07.004	electronic engineering;mosfet;engineering;cycling;power mosfet	EDA	89.92786480216138	-11.999952809584926	111509

The pulp flows in a flow path confined to a given web thickness, and has first and second opposite sides. Treatment liquid is added to the first side of the flow path at spaced predetermined points along its length. Liquid displaced by the treatment liquid is withdrawn from the second side of the flow path at substantially the predetermined points. The displaced liquid at the first predetermined point along the flow path consists essentially of original suspension liquid, while the liquid fraction of the pulp past the last predetermined point of the flow path is composed mainly of treatment liquid added at the last predetermined point. Treatment can be accomplished at super-atmospheric pressure and at a temperature above 100 DEG C. The web thickness is between about 50-500 mm., and the pulp concentration is between about 7-15 percent and is maintained substantially constant throughout treatment.	page view;web page	Yuxin Wang;Keizo Oyama	2008			backlink;acoustics;filter (signal processing);static web page;site map;database;flow (psychology);web page;suspension (vehicle);computer science	Theory	85.28382151383502	-19.18567808065386	111544

E/B leakage currents are compared with cross-section TEM images to identify sources of leakage currents associated with the epitaxy. In addition, the influence of the position of the extrinsic base implant with respect to the polysilicon emitter on the leakage currents is studied. The emitter/base leakage currents are modelled using Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, trap-assisted tunnelling and Poole–Frenkel (PF) generation. The position of the extrinsic base implant is shown to have a strong influence on the leakage currents. The PF effect dominates the emitter/base leakage current in transistors in which the collector area is smaller than the polysilicon emitter. This result is explained by penetration of the emitter/base depletion region into the p +  polysilicon extrinsic base at the perimeter of the emitter. These leakage currents are eliminated when the collector area is increased so that the extrinsic base implant penetrates into the single-crystal silicon at the perimeter of the emitter.	epitaxy;lambert's cosine law;silicon-germanium;spectral leakage	A.

The fabric engaging end of the clip is normally held in a recess in the side of the temple where it will not inadvertently snag items, and where it will be inconspicuous. The fabric engaging end of the clip moves outward beyond the surface of the temple when the opposite end of the clip is depressed by a finger.

Under compression, a delaminated composite plate may buckle and tend to enlarge the delaminated area, which can lead to loss of global structural stability. This paper presents the elastic buckling and postbuckling analysis of an axially loaded beam-plate with an across-the-width delamination, located at a given depth below the upper surface of the plate. The analysis is done by considering a layered orthotropic plate containing through-width delamination, subjected to in-plane compression. The problem is analyzed by two approaches: (i) A simple analytical model for determining strain energy release rate is obtained using integral transform approach; (ii) A finite element representation of the problem is modeled and analyzed using MSC/NASTRAN and the buckling load is calculated.	buckling;finite element method;simulation	Lalitha Chattopadhyay;S.

This paper presents a low cost, easy to use fiber optic corrosion sensor for practical application. Thin iron film is deposited on the end surface of a cleaved optical fiber by sputtering. When light is sent into the fiber, most of it is reflected by the coating. If the surrounding environment is corrosive, the film is corroded and the intensity of the reflected signal drops significantly. In previous work, the sensing principle was verified by various experiments in laboratory and a packaging method was introduced. In this paper, the method of multiplexing several sensors by optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) and optical splitter is introduced, together with the interpretation of OTDR results. The practical applicability of the proposed sensors is demonstrated in a three-year field trial with the sensors installed in an aggressive marine environment. The durability of the sensor against chemical degradation and physical degradation is also verified by accelerated life test and freeze-thaw cycling test, respectively.	a fibers;beneath a steel sky;chloride ion;cleaved cell;coating excipient;corrosion of medical device material;demultiplexer (media file);depletion region;durability (database systems);elegant degradation;experiment;eye;greater than;highly accelerated life test;multiplexing;optical fiber;optical time-domain reflectometer;reading (activity);signal reflection;tissue fiber;sensor (device)	Kai Tai Wan;Christopher K.

78335b5f965f1cc9dd98f3686bfdad510dd6c135	novel silver die-attach technology on silver pre-sintered dba substrates for high temperature applications		Abstract Currently, Ag die-attach techniques, using nano-silver particles, are of high interest for manufacturing of wide-band-gap (WBG) power module due to their high-temperature operation capability. However, the high cost of silver and complicated processing requirements are the main driving force in the search for simpler and more cost-effective attached technologies. In this study, a new die-attach technique based on silver die-attach, without conventional Ag-paste, for high-temperature applications is developed. Glass containing Ag paste was pre-sintered on the DBA substrates, and later on, semiconductor dies were simply placed on this pre-sintered Ag layer and attached under heat and pressure. The samples were tested under shear and thermal cycling loadings (−45 °C/250 °C) to evaluate the quality and reliability. Destructive and non-destructive analysis methods, such as Scanning Acoustic Tomography and cross-section observation, were used to identify fracture modes. The samples demonstrated sufficient shear strength and high thermal reliability. Furthermore, the effects of Ag recrystallization, grain growth and rearrangement of the voids are considered to be the main fracture factor of conventional Ag die-attach joints based on sampleu0027s cross-sections.

The repetitious signals continuously activate an activation signal which is independently terminated if the repetitious signals do not appear. When the activation signal is present, first and second switching components are activated so that a discharge tube can emit ultraviolet radiation. A detection element detects whether the first and second switching components are deactivated outside the on-time. If one of the two switching components remains active outside the on-time, the detection element supplies a signal to inhibit the next start signal.	computation;computational cybernetics;database	Arthur W.

The transmission spectrum in mid-infrared range is extremely sensitive to the variety of the thickness of silicon layer. An important characteristic is that the number of the coupled modes corresponding to the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) model is different with each thickness, especially at 4.08 micrometer, only one coupled mode emerged. This experiment result shows that Localized surface plasmon (LSP) coupled mode and quasi-cylindrical wave (Quasi-CW) resonant mode all have been involved in the enhanced optical transmission phenomenon (EOT), and different coupled mechanisms have strong interaction with each other. The experiment result further reveals the deeper underlying physics of the EOT phenomenon, and is significant to new design of some optical sensor devices based on enhanced optical transmission phenomenon.	crystal structure;equivalent oxide thickness;plasmon;polariton;silicon on insulator;thickness (graph theory);topological insulator	Fangqiang Li;Changzheng Li;Haisheng San;Xuyuan Chen	2011	2011 6th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2011.6017476	materials science;photonic crystal;ceramic materials;optoelectronics;optics;physics	Robotics	91.88777898488826	-14.150218216277413	111967

The deformations of solder joints are calculated under vibration and thermal cycling loading based on the finite element method. The calculated results are used as the boundary condition of the multi-axial loading to investigate the strain and stress of the solder joints. Then the life of solder joints can be evaluated by using a linear damage superposition approach. The result reveals that the life of solder joints can be divided into three regions according to the vibration amplitude at the same temperature: the life of solder joints in the first region is affected by creep damage; the life of solder joints in the second region is greatly influenced by the combined loading damage; the life of solder joints in the third region is impacted by the fatigue damage. The trend of the simulation results approximately agrees with the experimental results of other researchers.	electronic packaging;finite element method;instruction creep;quantum superposition;simulation;solder mask;soldering;superposition principle	Ping Yang;Dongjing Liu;Yanfang Zhao;Yunqing Tang;Huan Wang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2013.2285038	structural engineering;vibration;finite element method;electronic packaging;soldering;metallurgy	Robotics	87.01411321405476	-12.07649648117265	112026
c695a5ab3f0f2c2bd5fb903322f03ffea9a82771	damage characteristics and response of al alloy 3003 to different components of simulated lightning currents		The understanding on the response of aluminum alloy to direct lightning currents is needed for lightning protection. Four typical lightning current components, which are the first return stroke current, subsequent return stroke current, continuing current in the stroke intervals, and long continuing current, are simulated to investigate their damage effects on Al alloy 3003 material by laboratory experiments. The damage morphology on alloy’s surface and the microstructure in cross section are observed with high-resolution scanning electron microscope. Elemental composition changes of alloy material are measured by an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer. Indentation hardness tests are conducted to measure the changes in alloy’s micro-hardness. Then, the damage characteristics and mechanisms of the alloy are analyzed by comparing the experimental results under different current parameters of lightning components. The results show that, in response to the first return stroke current component, a thin oxide layer and cracks are formed on the alloy’s surface. The cracks are initiated by the broken of the oxide layer. Under the continuing current component in the stroke intervals, the dendritic crystals appear and grow in the direction of temperature decrease inside the material. In response to the long continuing current component, uneven solidification induced cracks are formed. The over-burn phenomenon also occurs and lots of hydrogen evolution porosities appear. As a response to the subsequent return stroke current, the damage pattern on alloy’s surface is dominated by pits, and the thickness of the damaged layer is typically  $15~\mu \text{m}$ .	cross section (geometry);dispersive partial differential equation;electron;elemental;experiment;hydrogen;image resolution;lightning;mathematical morphology;thickness (graph theory)	Yakun Liu;Zhengcai Fu;Xin Gao;Tianwei Li;Mingqiu Dai	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2778197	scanning electron microscope;oxide;distributed computing;alloy;computer science;aluminium;composite material;microstructure;indentation hardness;electrode;lightning	Mobile	87.10381733336546	-12.776308254219577	112060

033a89f6123ee5097dc25156487b9fe61bbfdcb5	a 330μm×90μm opto-electronically integrated wireless system-on-chip for recording of neural activities		Recording neural activity in live animals in vivo poses several challenges. Electrical techniques typically require electrodes to be tethered to the outside world directly via a wire, or indirectly via an RF Coil [1], which is much larger than the electrodes themselves. Tethered implants result in residual motion between neurons and electrodes as the brain moves, and limits our ability to measure from peripheral nerves in moving animals, especially in smaller organisms such as zebra fish or fruit flies. On the other hand, optical techniques, which are becoming increasingly powerful, are nonetheless often limited to subsets of neurons in any given organism, impeded by scattering of the excitation light and emitted fluorescence, and limited to low temporal resolution [2]. Here we present the electronics for an untethered electrode unit, powered by, and communicating through a microscale optical interface, combining many benefits of optical techniques with high temporal-resolution recording of electrical signals.	opto-isolator;peripheral;radio frequency;system on a chip;video-in video-out	Sunwoo Lee;Alejandro J.

dee368221db4365c2defc3912c7fb507f429aa75	effect of hydrocolloid type on transfer phenomena during deep-fat frying of coated potato strips: numerical modeling and experimental analysis		Abstract Numerical simulation is a valuable tool to predict the behavior of systems as well as to optimize and control various food processes. The main aim of this work was to develop a 3-D model to numerically simulate momentum, heat, and mass transfer during deep-fat frying of coated potato strips with a particular focus on the influence of hydrocolloid type. The samples were pre-treated with different hydrocolloids (sodium alginate, Arabic gum, and carrageenan) separately and then fried at different positions of fryer. In order to validate the model, experimental measurements of moisture content ( MC ), oil uptake ( OU ), core ( T co ) and surface ( T surf ) temperatures of potatoes, and oil temperature ( T o ) were carried out. Oil velocity ( u → o ) was also simulated. The results indicated that profiles of dependent variables were not significantly (p u003e 0.05) affected by four positions of the samples in the fryer. The MC and OU were significantly lower in coated potatoes (p  OU . In addition, the rates of T co and T surf increased in the samples and T o and u → o distributions were influenced by pre-treatment. The maximum values of computed u → o were 5.41 × 10 −3 –5.57 × 10 −3  m/s during frying of different potato strips. A comparison of model predictions and experimental data showed their overall good agreement (except for OC with mean relative error u003e20%). Generally, the findings of this work may be used to provide further insights into the influence of hydrocolloid type on transfer phenomena during frying. It may also be valuable to better understand the process and improve quality of fried coated food.	numerical method;strips	Caitlin Atkins;Jalal Dehghannya;Babak Ghanbarzadeh	2018	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2018.09.024	experimental data;arabic;control engineering;mass transfer;water content;engineering;approximation error;chromatography	Robotics	86.97982936806082	-10.905628611967613	112594

The proposed microsensor adopts torsional shutter, which is composed of shielding electrodes and torsional beams. The movable shielding electrodes and the fixed sensing electrodes are fabricated on the same plane and interdigitally arranged. Push-pull electrostatic actuation method is employed to excite the torsional shutter. Simulation results proved that the torsional shutter has higher efficiency of charge induction. The optimization of structure parameters was conducted to improve its efficiency of charge induction further. A micromachining fabrication process was developed to fabricate the EFM. Experiments were conducted to characterize the EFM. A good linearity of 0.15% was achieved within an electrostatic field range of 0-50 kV/m, and the uncertainty was below 0.38% in the three roundtrip measurements. A high sensitivity of 4.82 mV/(kV/m) was achieved with the trans-resistance of 100 MΩ, which is improved by at least one order of magnitude compared with previously reported EFMs. The efficiency of charge induction for this microsensor reached 48.19 pA/(kV/m).	actuation dosing unit;electrical resonance;electroconvulsive therapy;excite;fetal doppler monitoring;mathematical optimization;microtechnology;movie projector;semiconductor device fabrication;sensor;shutter device component;simulation;source-to-source compiler;electrode	Zhaozhi Chu;Chunrong Peng;Ren Ren;Biyun Ling;Zhouwei Zhang;Hucheng Lei;Shanhong Xia	2018		10.3390/s18010286	beam (structure);electronic engineering;analytical chemistry;shutter;electrode;resonance;microelectromechanical systems;electromagnetic shielding;engineering;surface micromachining;electric field	Robotics	90.4302863884292	-18.220615207139936	112854

This fabrication technique benefits of all the advantages that photolithographic processes report, as device isolation, patterning of small dimensions and possibility of device integration on both rigid and flexible substrates. We also show that, since PMMA is placed as the outermost polymeric layer, it serves both as dielectric and as protective layer, allowing devices to work in ambient conditions with significantly less degradation than other PTFTs structures previously reported.

09bd9a5e9b3fa9ecd11edc5b5874dfb1760b84bb	quartz-crystal microbalance gas sensors based on tio2 nanoparticles		Quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors obtained by a facile deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles have been manufactured and tested. Their gas sensing performance is discussed from a theoretical point of view and then verified by means of “ad hoc” measurement systems, through experiments with two toxic gases, CO and NO2, and water vapor. The influence of UV irradiation on the sensor response has also been studied. Results show stable and repeatable responses, characterized by a very high sensitivity to water vapor, a good sensitivity to NO2, and only a fairly low response to CO. Both CO and NO2 responses depend strongly on the relative humidity (RH). So, NO2 sensing should be performed in a controlled humidity environment. Devices proved to be reliable detectors of low RH values. Advantages as low cost, facile preparation, RT operation, good stability, and high/moderate sensitivity, make these devices attractive as an alternative to mostly used gas sensors.	chemical vapor deposition;crystal oscillator;electronic oscillator;experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);maxima and minima;multilayer perceptron;physical vapor deposition;response time (technology);selectivity (electronic);sensor;system of measurement;thickness (graph theory)	Tommaso Addabbo;Ada Fort;Marco Mugnaini;Valerio Vignoli;Andrea Baldi;Mara Bruzzi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2785118		Mobile	94.51698481388675	-17.732197895055887	113020

We present the rationale for the design and the details of the microfabrication of this multifactorial hybrid microfluidic chip. The structure of the platform consists of a three-dimensionally patterned polydimethylsiloxane top part attached to a bottom SU-8 epoxy-based negative photoresist part, where microelectrodes and optical fibers are incorporated to enable impedance and optical analysis. As a proof of concept, the chip functions have been tested and explored, enabling a diversity of applications: (i) impedance-based identification of the size of micro beads, as well as counting and distinguishing of erythrocytes by their volume or membrane properties; (ii) simultaneous determination of the refractive index and optical absorption properties of solutions; and (iii) fluorescence-based bead counting.	bead dosage form;characteristic impedance;design rationale;dielectric spectroscopy;dimethylpolysiloxanes;epoxy resins;fluorescence;microfabrication;microfluidics;nominal impedance;optical fiber;quantitative impedance;refractometry;solutions;tissue membrane;electric impedance	Fábio M.

The CFOTMS consists of a fiber-optic semiconductor absorption temperature sensor (FOSATS) and an ANN inverse compensator. On one hand, optical-fiber-based light transmission is insusceptible to EMI; on the other hand, due to the utilization of the ANN inverse compensator, the dynamic performance and measuring precision of the CFOTMS are significantly enhanced compared with the sole use of the sensor. Therefore, it is very suitable to be used in high-voltage electrical power equipment. Furthermore, as the intensity-dependent FOSATS is a cheap device, and the ANN inverse compensator is realized in software, the cost of the CFOTMS will be low, which makes it suitable to be used in economical equipment.	artificial neural network;catastrophic interference;emi;hybrid fibre-coaxial;interference (communication);optical fiber;semiconductor;system of measurement	Yuhan Ding;Xianzhong Dai;Tao Zhang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2030930	control engineering;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;optical fiber;machine learning;artificial neural network;physics	Embedded	90.84522591057149	-20.413061495292272	113079

19e505901bdd5a161d884e8ba04d5550802760c3	field measurement of wind effects of roof accessory structures on gable-roofed low-rise building		The components and claddings of low-rise buildings are usually destroyed first during typhoon disasters in coastal areas. Roof accessory structures can change the flow pattern on the roof, thus effectively reducing the wind load on the roof surface and the damage to the low-rise buildings. Three types of aerodynamic mitigation plates, that is, (1) 0.3m high full-length roof-edge plate, (2) 0.3m high and 0.5m+0.5m long roof-corner plate, and (3) discrete roof-edge plates with different spaces (which can be used as advertisement boards), are studied on the basis of the field measurement results under roof pitches of 10 and 18.4. By comparing the results of the roof with and without constructed plates, it is implied that the three types of plates can affect the formation of conical vortexes and can significantly reduce the mean and fluctuating pressure coefficients in the windward corner. Compared with the constructed plate, the roof ridge has a larger influence on the wind loads on leeward roof.	coefficient;full scale;gable cad;lifting scheme;typhoon;vortex;wake-on-lan	Peng Huang;Ming Gu;Chun-guang Jia;Da-long Quan	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/280186	roof;gable;geotechnical engineering;wind engineering;computer science;distributed computing;aerodynamics;low-rise;typhoon	HCI	86.46143729326998	-11.156129555825489	113233

In this paper, we describe an architecture of externally controllable molecular communication systems and introduce two types of interfaces: one type for bio-nanomachines to interact with each other in a molecular communication environment, and the other type for bio-nanomachines to interact with conventional device in the external environment. The architecture of externally controllable molecular communication systems is then applied to control the spatio-temporal dynamics of molecular concentrations in a molecular communication environment, demonstrating the applicability of the architecture to pattern formation for medical applications such as tissue regeneration.	british informatics olympiad;nanorobotics;open research;pattern formation	Tadashi Nakano;Shouhei Kobayashi;Tatsuya Suda;Yutaka Okaie;Yasushi Hiraoka;Tokuko Haraguchi	2014		10.1145/2619955.2619971	control engineering;engineering;nanotechnology;communication	HPC	97.0837592278708	-20.641689345216495	113282

This paper is second in a row devoted to the characterization of IPMC transducers with respect to the aforementioned influencing quantities. The characterization is performed by statistically investigating sensing signals in typical working conditions, and the experiments performed show that, for the investigated ranges, the effects of relative humidity are much more evident than the corresponding effects produced by temperature changes. The results reported give information that integrated IPMC transducer models, which are introduced so far, contribute to better exploit this novel technology.	biological system;experiment;ionic;polymer;sensor;transducer	Paola Brunetto;Luigi Fortuna;Pietro Giannone;Salvatore Graziani;Salvatore Strazzeri	2011	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2011.2118870	estimation;systems modeling;transducer;temperature measurement;relative humidity;humidity;physics;measurement;statistics	Visualization	91.72030027466533	-18.301644309641826	113341

Considering control and supervision it is favorable to have a mean value model to be used e.g. in observer design. Such models of turbo engines are similar to those of naturally aspirated engines, but there are some special characteristics, e.g. the interconnected gas flows, the intercooler, the difference in relative sizes between the gas volumes (compared to naturally aspirated engines), the turbo, and the waste gate. Here, a model is developed with a strategy to find a model for each engine component (air filter, compressor, after cooler (or intercooler), throttle, engine, turbine, waste gate, and a lumped model for the catalyst and exhaust) as they behave in an engine setting. When investigating agreement with measured data and sensitivity of possible model structures, a number of interesting issues are raised. The experiments and the model validation have been performed on a Saab 2.3 1 production engine.

The proposed solid propellant microthruster is composed of two layers bonded together. One layer is a silicon layer, which contains a microchamber, a micronozzle and a 30-micron slot. The specific solid propellant is loaded in the microchamber for combustion. The convergent-divergent micronozzle is used to accelerate the combustion gas to produce thrust. The slot is employed to insert the special ignition wire to ignite the solid propellant. The other layer is a glass layer, which is bonded onto the silicon layer to form 3-D microthruster. Numerical investigations have been carried out before the fabrication. The thrust ranging from lmN tolO mN is produced depending on different geometries. Single microthrusters and microthruster layers have been fabricated successfully using MEMS technologies.	microelectromechanical systems;thrust	K. L. Zhang;S. K. Chou;Simon S. Ang;X. S. Tang;J. S.

In this study, the optical properties of two different two-photon fluorescent probes for pH are studied. The ratiometric sensing of the probes are theoretically illustrated. Meanwhile, the recognitional mechanisms of the probes are investigated, which shows the energy transfer process when react with H⁺. Specially, the calculated results demonstrate that Probe1 possesses a higher energy transfer efficiency and a larger two-photon absorption cross-section than Probe2, indicating it to be a preferable pH fluorescent probe. Therefore, the influence of connection between the donor and the acceptor on the sensing performances of the probe is demonstrated. Our results help to understand the experimental observations and provide a theoretical basis to synthesize efficient two-photon fluorescent probes for monitoring pH changes.

For semiconductor devices designed to operate in these harsh conditions, SiC offers an unmatched combination of electronic and physical properties. The availability of SiC wafers on a commercial basis has led to the demonstration of many types of metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS)-gated devices that exploit its unique properties. To which extent the potential of SiC power MOSFET can be utilized is a question of appropriate SiC polytype, device structure, MOS interface quality and maturity of the technology.

More and more home users have motivation to design their own models and then fabricate them using 3D printers. However, the printed objects may have some structural or stress defects as the users may be lack of knowledge on stress analysis on 3D models. In this paper, we present an approach to help users analyze a model’s structural strength while designing its shape. We adopt sectional structural analysis instead of conventional FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis which is computationally expensive. Based on sectional structural analysis, our approach imports skeletons to assist in integrating mesh designing, strength computing and mesh correction well. Skeletons can also guide sections building and load calculation for analysis. For weak regions with high stress over a threshold value in the model from analysis result, our system corrects them by scaling the corresponding bones of skeleton so as to make these regions stiff enough. A number of experiments have demonstrated the applicability and practicability of our approach.	3d modeling;3d printing;analysis of algorithms;approximation;computation;experiment;finite element method;image scaling;stress testing;stress–strain analysis;structural analysis	Wen-Peng Xu;Wei Li;Ligang Liu	2016	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-016-1638-2	computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm	Visualization	85.45699043406644	-23.927892657625666	114190

It has great potential for high-speed signal processing, low power dissipation, and high radiation resistance. W hen silicon replaced germanium in the early 1960's as the semiconductor of choice for solid state devices, it converted the entire industry in just a few years because of two important characteristics. First, silicon has a higher energy bandgap, which permits silicon-based devices to operate over a wider temperature range (a feature especially important to the military). Second, and more important, silicon has a native oxide that provided for improved stability and planar, rather than mesa, type devices. Planar technology soon spawned integrated circuits. The integrated circuit in turn brought on the electronics revolution, allowing the complexity of circuits to increase by a factor of two every year (Moore's Law) and bringing us from single transistors to megabit memory chips.	integrated circuit;megabit;mesa;moore's law;planar (computer graphics);semiconductor;signal processing;solid-state electronics;transistor	Sherman Karp;Sven Roosild	1986	Computer	10.1109/MC.1986.1663064	electronic circuit;data processing;computer science;integrated circuit;signal processing	Arch	93.96812986372915	-12.485718850565952	114510

The research focused on the most relevant parameter for industry, which is the current density, because it determines the process time and the consumed energy.

Therefore, niosomes are one of the most important vehicles to release drug at the nanoscale. In this paper, we present a new automated microsystem for niosome generation on-demand. Used niosome were based on a mixture of cholesterol and dicetyl phosphate with chloroform. Three compact micropumps are connected to a microfluidic substrate in order to generate 100 nm noisome vesicles. Through this paper we also investigated the impact of using 150 μm pseudo-Y and cross shape microchannel on the diameter of vesicles. We have observed reliable results with Y-shaped microchannel, which was able to generate vesicles down to 91 nm. All the system is based on a low-cost fabrication process using dry photo resist.	chloroform;cholesterol;diameter (qualifier value);drug vehicle;gnu nano;microfluidics;niosomes;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;regenerative medicine;semiconductor device fabrication;vesicle (morphologic abnormality);dicetylphosphate	Frédéric Tessier;Myriam Laprise-Pelletier;Eric Boilard;Marc-André Fortin;Amine Miled	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591360	electronic engineering;shape;computer science;nanotechnology;resist;mathematics;nanoparticle;biological engineering;bluetooth	Robotics	94.38526048176706	-17.67685193284284	114893

02cf2f7fd6f16cbedcb9f3b51a174fb9ecdff4cd	development of a soft pzt based tactile sensor array for force localization		The need of designing tactile sensors for machines and robotic systems has become crucial with the increase of the tasks related to human. This work proposes a silicone embedded, low profile piezoelectric sensor array that is suitable for applications where tactile sensing and force localization is needed. The developed sensor has 3 piezoelectric ceramics (PZT) placed in 1×3 array and consists of 5 layers including flexible electrodes and silicone layers. The fabricated tactile sensor has 5 mm spatial resolution and has 0.578–0.821 V/N sensitivity range with a linear characteristic under 0–1 N impulse forces. Also the repeatability of the sensor is approximately 95.65 percent. In this work, the design of the sensor is presented. Each PZT element subjected to impulse force input has been calibrate and a force localization experiment has been performed on the sensor. The results show that our proposed sensor can be used as a force localization sensor.	embedded system;piezoelectricity;repeatability;robot;tactile sensor	Merve Acer;Adnan Furkan Yildiz;Farshad Hamedi Bazzaz	2017	2017 XXVI International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)	10.1109/ICAT.2017.8171644	piezoelectric sensor;piezoelectricity;impulse (physics);electronic engineering;image resolution;tactile sensor;materials science	Robotics	90.53914418986334	-18.952144755510776	115120

A frequency-modified semiempirical short-coil correction factor, based upon the formula published by Vaughan and Williamson in 1945, is presented and experimentally verified. This new equation is shown to predict the total system reactive power and the average magnetic flux at the surface of the workpiece with typical differences of less than 2% at 50 Hz ac and to accurately predict workpiece heating rates typically within 5% for aluminum billets at 50 Hz to 500 kHz ac. The workpiece real and reactive powers, as well as total system reactive power, are compared with both analytic and 2-D axial symmetric finite-element modeling (FEM) model solutions as a function of operating frequencies from 50 Hz to 500 kHz. The measured flux density is compared to FEM and analytical predictions at 50 Hz.	air gap (networking);experiment;finite element method;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method	Mark W.

Among the various geometries, microspheres are the simplest 3D WGM resonators; the total optical loss in such resonators can be extremely low, and the resulting extraordinarily high Q values of 10⁸-10⁸ lead to high energy density, narrow resonant-wavelength lines and a lengthy cavity ringdown. They can also be coated in order to better control their properties or to increase their functionality. Their very high sensitivity to changes in the surrounding medium has been exploited for several sensing applications: protein adsorption, trace gas detection, impurity detection in liquids, structural health monitoring of composite materials, detection of electric fields, pressure sensing, and so on. In the present paper, after a general introduction to WGM resonators, attention is focused on spherical microresonators, either in bulk or in bubble format, to their fabrication, characterization and functionalization. The state of the art in the area of biosensing is presented, and the perspectives of further developments are discussed.	biological science disciplines;biosensors;body cavities;experiment;goto;high-throughput computing;laboratory;large;liquid substance;microsoft forefront;microsoft outlook for mac;microspheres;ringdown;sensor;throughput;tissue membrane;virion;weight-loss agents;aptamer;wavelength	Giancarlo Cesare Righini;Silvia Soria	2016		10.3390/s16060905	photonics;microsphere;nanotechnology;whispering-gallery wave;optics;physics;biosensor	HCI	93.87893505345527	-16.674777645133517	115410

This paper presents generic, objective and application-independent evaluation methods that can be used for quantitative on-body sensor optimization. The methods are applied on the evaluation of a thin, bendable and ultra low-power piezoelectric sensor to capture body sounds. The results of this study show that both chest expansion and the pitch of speech can be determined reliably with this sensor, even under conditions of walking, whereas heart sounds can be captured only under quiet, motionless conditions. A low-pass filtering effect of the sensor assembly with a very low cut-off frequency made further investigation of lung sounds impossible. The presented methods can be used in future studies to optimize sensor, sensor packaging and mounting conditions.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bandwidth (signal processing);futures studies;low-pass filter;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;piezoelectricity;rollable display;sensor;usability	Bernard Grundlehner;Dilpreet Buxi	2011	2011 International Conference on Body Sensor Networks	10.1109/BSN.2011.22	packaging and labeling;piezoelectric sensor;speech recognition;acoustics;continuous wavelet transform;low-pass filter;soft sensor;speech;correlation;heart;quantum mechanics	Robotics	92.6388321641455	-23.663783777675913	115891

However, the existence of spatial resolution greatly decreases strain measurement accuracy especially around cracks. Meanwhile, the brittle feature of OF also hinders its further application. In this paper, the distributed OF sensor was firstly proposed as long-gauge sensor to improve strain measurement accuracy. Then, a new type of self-sensing fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bar was developed by embedding the packaged long-gauge OF sensors into FRP bar, followed by experimental studies on strain sensing, temperature sensing and basic mechanical properties. The results confirmed the superior strain sensing properties, namely satisfied accuracy, repeatability and linearity, as well as excellent mechanical performance. At the same time, the temperature sensing property was not influenced by the long-gauge package, making temperature compensation easy. Furthermore, the bonding performance between self-sensing FRP bar and concrete was investigated to study its influence on the sensing. Lastly, the sensing performance was further verified with static experiments of concrete beam reinforced with the proposed self-sensing FRP bar. Therefore, the self-sensing FRP bar has potential applications for long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) as embedded sensors as well as reinforcing materials for concrete structures.	brillouin scattering;embedding;experiment;functional reactive programming;new type;optical fiber;polymer;pyschological bonding;repeatability;super high material cd;tissue fiber;sensor (device);spiromustine	Yongsheng Tang;Zhishen Wu	2016		10.3390/s16030286	structural engineering	Mobile	91.6287022046177	-18.94488237831744	116289

In this paper, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation associated with embedded atom model (EAM) is applied on the PSBs formation in nickel-base superalloys with different microstructure and temperature under tensile-tensile loadings. Simulation results show that PSBs formed within the γ phase by massive dislocations pile-up and propagation which can penetrate the grain. Also, the temperature will affect the material fatigue performance and blur PSBs appearance. The simulation results are in strong agreement with the experimental test results published before.	computation;embedded atom model;embedded system;gaussian blur;molecular dynamics;pacific symposium on biocomputing;simulation;software propagation	Jianfeng Huang;Zhonglai Wang;Yuanxin Luo;Yun Li;Erfu Yang;Yi Chen	2015	2015 21st International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)	10.1109/IConAC.2015.7313999	molecular dynamics;superalloy	Robotics	87.17253564670787	-11.94140278606603	116384

The effects induced by the creation of an electron-hole pair on the atomic structure and on the optical spectra of hydrogenated silicon nanoclusters as a function of dimension are discussed showing the strong interplay between the structural and optical properties of the system. Starting from the hydrogenated clusters, (i) different Si/O bonding at the cluster surface and (ii) different doping configurations have been considered. We have found that the presence of a Si-O-Si bridge bond at the nanocrystal surface gives rise to significant excitonic luminescence features in the near-visible range that are in fair agreement with photoluminescence (PL) measurements on oxidized and SiO$_{2}$ embedded nanocrystals. The study of the structural, electronic and optical properties of simultaneously n- and p-type doped hydrogenated silicon nanocrystals with boron and phosphorous impurities have shown that B-P co-doping is energetically favorable with respect to single B- or P-doping and that the two impurities tend to occupy nearest neighbors sites. The co-doped nanocrystals present band edge states localized on the impurities that are responsible of a red-shifted absorption threshold with respect to that of pure un-doped nanocrystals in agreement with the experiment.	doping (semiconductor);wafer (electronics)	Rita Magri;Elena Degoli;Federico Iori;Eleonora Luppi;Olivia Pulci;Stefano Ossicini;Giovanni Cantele;Fabio Trani;Domenico Ninno	2007	J.

Only when these sensors are used for wall shear stress measurements, the detection of laminar/turbulent transition, or the measurement of certain flow velocities, they are operated in an active mode, i.e. heated by an electrical current (after an appropriate calibration). In our study we demonstrate how these R(T)-based sensors (temperature dependence of the electrical resistance R) can also be applied in an active mode for heat transfer measurements. These measurements can be made on cold, unheated bodies, provided certain requirements with respect to the flow field are fulfilled.

Generally speaking, current BWRs are mostly manually operated, remotely operated, or automated to simply follow predefined trajectory patterns for stacking and reclaiming operations. BWRs are indeed very large in size, heavy in weight, expensive in price, and slow in motion. It is commonly agreed in the industry that the current stacking/reclaiming efficiency can be largely improved in several areas to obtain huge amount of savings in dollar terms. However, as stockpiles and BWRs are always heavily engaged in production and cannot be long spared or frequently interrupted for the required studies and developments for efficiency improvement, a close to real simulation environment including stockpiles, BWRs, and the associated environment would be highly valuable and greatly beneficial to carry out necessary studies, planning, preparations, and evaluations. This paper presents the progresses of the modeling work achieved so far for the simulation of stockpile operations associated with bulk solid materials using BWRs.

Four typical temperatures, ranging from 20°C to 80°C, were selected to study the shear rate dependence of viscosity. The temperature tests show that the high temperature increases the critical shear rate and lower the shear thickening ratio. A viscosity function is proposed to represent the three characteristic regions in typical shear thickening fluid and to predict the viscosity at different temperatures.	curve fitting;numerical analysis;simulation	Tongfei Tian;Weihua Li;Jie Ding;Gürsel Alici;Haiping Du	2013	2013 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2013.6584197	materials science;ceramic materials;shear rate;temperature dependence of liquid viscosity;relative viscosity;viscosity;viscosity index;non-newtonian fluid;reduced viscosity;apparent viscosity;composite material;pure shear;dilatant	Robotics	88.91022664975154	-11.902195843528858	117164

The improvement has been found significant when the delta peak is shifted near the source end of the channel.

Inertial cavitation has been previously shown to result in increased heat deposition and to be associated with broadband noise emissions that can be readily monitored using a passive receiver without interference from the main HIFU signal. In the present study, the signals received passively by each of 64 elements on a standard diagnostic array placed coaxially with the HIFU transducer are combined using time exposure acoustics to generate maps of inertially cavitating regions during HIFU exposure of an agar-based tissue-mimicking material. The technique is shown to be effective in localizing single-bubble activity, as well as contiguous and disjoint cavitating regions instigated by creating regions of lower cavitation threshold within the tissue phantom. The cavitation maps obtained experimentally are also found to be in good agreement with computational simulations and theoretical predictions. Unlike B-mode imaging, which requires interleaving with the HIFU pulse, passive array-based mapping of cavitation activity is possible during HIFU exposure. If cavitating regions can be directly correlated to increased tissue damage, this novel cavitation mapping technique could enable real-time HIFU treatment monitoring.	acoustics;agar;chemical vapor deposition;computation;emission - male genitalia finding;experiment;forward error correction;high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation;imaging phantom;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;map;phantoms, imaging;real-time web;simulation;transducer;ultrasonography	Miklós Gyöngy;Constantin-C.

29d6cd7acbfd96ff020376837138d82e50bb55e3	future on-chip interconnect metallization and electromigration		Electromigration and resistivity of Cu, Co and Ru on-chip interconnections have been investigated. Non-linered Co and Ru interconnects can have better interconnect resistance than Cu, if the Cu liner cannot be scaled down below 2 nm in future interconnect technologies. A similar resistivity size effect increase was observed in Cu, Co, and Ru. Multi-level Cu, Co or Ru back-end-of-line interconnects were fabricated using 7 and 10 nm node technology wafer processing steps. EM in 18 nm to 88 nm wide Co lines, 18–24 nm wide Cu with a thin Co cap and 18 to 24 nm wide Ru lines were tested. The electromigration activation energies for Cu with Co cap, Co and Ru were found to be 1.5–1.7 eV, 2.4–3.1 eV and 1.9 eV, respectively. These data showed that Cu with Co cap, Co and Ru interconnects all had highly reliable electromigration.	back end of line;copper;electrical connection;electromigration;electron microscopy;energy, physics;futures studies;intel quickpath interconnect;liner device;metals;node - plant part;non-t, non-b childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia	C.-K.

7bf316984cc03201515952f25bdaf9bc0016bce6	numerical simulation and experimental comparison of flaw evolution on a bearing raceway: case of thrust ball bearing		Abstract Bearings are essential elements in the design of rotating machines. In an industrial context, bearing failure can have costly consequences. This paper presents a study of the rolling contact fatigue damage applied to thrust ball bearings. It consists in building a dynamic three-dimensional numerical model of the cyclic shift of a ball on an indented rolling surface, using finite element analysis (FEA). Assessment of the evolution in size of a surface spall as a function of loading cycles is also performed using FEM coupled with fatigue laws. Results are in good agreement with laboratory tests carried out under the same conditions using a fatigue test cell dedicated to ball bearings. This study may improve knowledge about estimating the lifetime of rolling components after onset of a spall using FEA and accounting for structural damage state.	computer simulation;flaw hypothesis methodology;thrust	M.

296405e111795c65e3bac541859df800bad95e8c	effect of skill level difference in the polishing process of the maki-e making technique		In this research, “Maki-e” technique was focused. Maki-e technique is a decoration technique of Urushi crafts technique. There is a polishing process in the Maki-e making process. Maki-e surface is polished by a charcoal and whetstone in the polishing process. Time-served technique is needed for this process. Because this process affects a finish of Urushi crafts work, this research aimed to clarify a relationship between a skill level difference of craftspeople and a finish of Urushi crafts work in the polishing process by using charcoal. Characteristics of the finish Urushi crafts work and how to use a body of craftspeople was analyzed. As the results of this research, it was confirmed that; 1. The expert’s Maki-e specimen was more brightness and yellow than the non-expert. 2. There was not much difference about the gloss and surface roughness between the expert and the non-expert. 3. The expert took the rhythmic activity in each muscle. Therefore it seemed that the finish of the work became more beautiful. These results suggest that how to use the body affects the finish of the Urushi crafts work in the polishing process. The non-expert can improve the finish of the work and the level of polishing skill by training the body position and motion like the expert.	maki kaji	Atsushi Endo;Hisanori Yuminaga;Chihiro Akatsuka;Takuya Sugimoto;Yutaro Shimode;Hiroyuki Hamada	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21073-5_3	operations management;management science;engineering drawing	Vision	85.842553600794	-14.241578811046184	118595
5573e64ef4f4fe65190de8575235ee55d410c53f	a ccd based digital detector for whole-breast digital mammography		We are developing an 18×27cm digital x-ray detector for whole-breast mammography based on CCD imaging technology [1]. In this paper we report the performance of a 10×20 cm, 2-CCD prototype we have built and tested. Similar to a film system, this detector uses a phosphor screen to convert an x-ray image to visible light. In the digital system the light photons are transferred onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) by a demagnifying fiber optic taper. Dedicated electronics then transfer the image to a PC based viewing station. The dynamic range of the detector is roughly 375 times greater than that of a typical screen film [2]. This difference increases our ability to discriminate low contrast differences in tissue, and allows image exposure to be determined solely by the desired signal-to-noise ratio and acceptable patient dose, whereas in a non-digital system, exposure is determined by film’s narrow linear response range.	charge-coupled device;x-ray detector	Laura Smilowitz;Daniel Rosen;Hua Qian;Walter Phillips;Martin Stanton;Alex Stewart	1998		10.1007/978-94-011-5318-8_5	photon;optical fiber;dynamic range;imaging technology;digital mammography;detector;visible spectrum;mammography;optics;materials science	EDA	94.5456963760959	-22.053288531868915	118639

A parameter SD defined as the ratio of the integrated intensities of two parts of this band allows to study the temperature and concentration dependences of the phase transition. Then, an easy and efficient signal processing and the exploitation of a modified Boltzmann equation give information on the phase transition. Validations were done on solutions with varying concentration of NaCl.	deconvolution;hazard analysis and critical control points;medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency;part dosing unit;phase transition;population parameter;raman scattering;salt (cryptography);secure digital;sensor;sialic acid storage disease, finnish type (disorder);signal processing;sodium chloride;solutions;thermodynamics	Rémy Claverie;Marc D.

ab3e548c5b4da3afe7f09377942dce0da985a970	effect of oxygen vacancy in tungsten oxide on the photocatalytic activity for decomposition of organic materials in the gas phase		Abstract The relationship between the oxygen vacancy of tungsten oxide and its ability to decompose organic materials under visible-light irradiation was investigated experimentally. In the field of rechargeable batteries, the highest charge-discharge rate is obtained when tungsten oxide is used as a negative electrode with an O/W ratio of 2.72. This result suggested that the number of oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxide affects the photocatalytic decomposition behavior of organic materials. Therefore, with the aim of increasing the photocatalytic activity of tungsten oxide to decompose organic materials, we attempted to clarify the role of the oxygen vacancy. WO 3 − x nanoparticles, including WO 2.83 and WO 2.72 nanoparticles, were fabricated by changing the annealing temperature in a 10% H 2 , 90% N 2 atmosphere to generate different densities of oxygen vacancies. Tungsten oxide with O/W ratios of 2.83 and 2.72 exhibited no photocatalytic activity for the photodecomposition of organic materials. The maximum decomposition rate was obtained for stoichiometric WO 3 (O/W = 3). The reason for the decrease or disappearance of the photodecomposition ability should originate in the increase in the number of electrons generated by the oxygen vacancies. These excess electrons promote the recombination reaction between electrons and holes in WO 3 − x , and hence reduce the lifetime of electron-hole pairs.

A typical emitter contact of the IGBTs or diodes consists of a front metallization and bond wires connecting the chips to the emitter lead. In this study, a novel method was implemented to the entire emitter contact to support and reinforce the mechanical as well as electrical durability and reliability. These modules were characterized in terms of the power cycling performance. The emitter contact of the standard wire bonded as well as heavy ribbon bonded HiPak modules were reinforced by Cu electroplating. The two groups of modules were subjected to power cycling tests.

The effectiveness of the acoustic-ultrasound Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technique for the determination of the depth of the surface crack was presented. A method for ultrasonic sizing of surface cracks combined with the time domain and frequency spectrum was adopted. The ultrasonic frequency spectrum was obtained by Fourier transform technique. A series of test specimens with various depths of surface crack ranging from 1 mm to 8 mm was fabricated. The depth of the surface crack was evaluated using the pulse-echo technique. In this work, three different longitudinal waves with frequencies of 2.25 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz were employed to investigate the effect of frequency on the sizing detection of surface cracks.

It was found that Poly-Si TFT electrical characteristics with the thinnest gate oxide thickness after RTA treatment exhibits the largest performance improvement compared to TFT with thick oxide as a result of the increased incorporated amounts of the nitrogen and oxygen. Thus, the combined effects can maintain the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of scaled-down oxide, which is suitable for small-to-medium display mass production.	gate oxide;rapid thermal processing;simulated annealing;thickness (graph theory);thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	Ching-Lin Fan;Yi-Yan Lin;Yan-Hang Yang;Hung-Che Chen	2010	IEICE Transactions		electronic engineering;mass production;thin-film transistor;equivalent oxide thickness;oxide thin-film transistor;electrical engineering;gate oxide;nitrogen;miniaturization;physics;quantum mechanics;time-dependent gate oxide breakdown	EDA	91.97789677637101	-12.122704176421363	119613

When the hyperspectral images are highly resoluted, we propose to select a limited number of pixels, therefore reducing dramatically the size of the data. Then, the related mixtures are used as inputs to a positive source separation algorithm. Our pixel selection procedure is based on a convex cone analysis of the data mixtures; indeed, positive mixtures of sources are embedded in a convex cone whose boundary contains complete available information regarding the sources. We search for the least number of mixtures embedding the convex cone and then store the corresponding pixel indices as the selected pixels. We apply this method to the analysis of hyperspectral images of bacterial cells obtained on a confocal microscope. The bacterial cells, acting as whole-cell biosensors, display great potential as living transducers in sensing applications.	algorithm;convex cone;embedded system;pixel;reduction (complexity);source separation;transducer	Charles Soussen;Sebastian Miron;Fabrice Caland;David Brie;Patrick Billard;Christian Mustin	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		computer vision;mathematical optimization;analytical chemistry;mathematics	Vision	96.07818936885201	-20.52923629544621	119654

To a large extent, the renewed interest in ZnO is fuelled by its wide direct band gap (3.3 eV at room temperature) and large exciton binding energy (60 meV) making this material, when alloyed with, e.g., Cd and Mg, especially attractive for light emitters in the blue/ultraviolet (UV) spectral region. Unfortunately, as with other wide-gap semiconductors, ZnO suffers from the doping asymmetry problem, in that the n-type conductivity can be obtained rather easily, but p-type doping proved to be a formidable challenge. This doping asymmetry problem (also dubbed as the p-type problem in ZnO) is preventing applications of ZnO in light-emitting diodes and potential laser diodes. In this paper, we provide a critical review of the current experimental efforts focused on achieving p-type ZnO and discuss the proposed approaches which could possibly be used to overcome the p-type problem.	diode;doping (semiconductor);exciton;microsoft outlook for mac;semiconductor	Vitaliy Avrutin;Donald J.

This cleaning technique is impractical, incomplete and frequently causes spatters of soldering tin or pewter at the place of work. This is unacceptable, especially when precision soldering electronic devices. This problem is solved by using an apparatus driven by an electric motor. The hot soldering iron bit or tip is momentarily placed between two cleaning bodies which rotate towards each other. These two rotating cleaning bodies thus enclose the soldering iron bit and protectively clean the same. The cleaning bodies are mounted in a removable holder or cage provided with a tin collection container or receptacle. For enhancing the self-cleaning action of the two cleaning bodies the spacing between the axes or shafts of the two cleaning bodies is smaller than the mean diameter of both cleaning bodies. Additionally, two strippers or scrapers engage into each cleaning body.

Melanin masks skin discoloration hindering visual inspection in people with darkly pigmented skin. The objective of the project is to develop a point of care technology capable of detecting erythema and bruises in persons with darkly pigmented skin. Two significant hardware components, a color filter array and illumination system have been developed and tested. The color filter array targets four defined wavelengths and has been designed to fit onto a CMOS sensor. The crafting process generates a multilayer film on a glass substrate using vacuum ion beam splitter and lithographic techniques. The illumination system is based upon LEDs and targets these same pre-defined wavelengths. Together, these components are being used to create a small, handheld multispectral imaging device. Compared to other multi spectral technologies (multi prisms, optical-acoustic crystal and others), the design provides simple, low cost instrumentation that has many potential multi spectral imaging applications which require a handheld detector. INTRODUCTION — PURPOSE Visual inspection of intact skin is a common means to identify and characterize bruising and erythema. In people with darkly pigmented skin, the presence of melanin greatly hinders visualization of discoloration. A need exists for clinically usable technology that assists clinicians in assessing dark skin. Previous Bruise Detection Methods During investigations of potential child and elder abuse, clinicians and forensic practitioners assess bruises to document shape, extent and estimate age. Visual inspection in vivo and photography of bruises are two conventional methods employed in clinical practice. However they are qualitative, subjective, inaccurate and hence unreliable. Statistics indicate that their best accuracy is only about 50% [1-4]. Further, their failure rate is even much higher if bruises happened on darkly pigmented skin. Recently spectroscopy has emerged to improve the reliability of bruise detection [5, 6]. It infers the fractional contents of various chromophores (oxy-hemoglobin (oxyHb), deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxyHb), bilirubin, melanin) by measuring the optical reflectivity of one sample point at a time of bruised region for a continuous range of wavelength at fine steps (e.g., at 2nm incremental step). It is a reliable tool to investigate the basic biochemical processes associated with bruised skin on both white and darkly pigmented skin. However, point spectroscopy can be too time consuming and tedious for clinical use since one must image multiple locations. Moreover, point spectroscopy is not conducive to create a distribution map of the chromophore concentration over time. Such a map is important since it contains the intrinsic features of the diseased skin such as its shape, size and age [7]. Previous Erythema Identification Methods Over the past decade, researchers have identified erythema identification using non invasive methods [8-10]. Additional studies [11, 12] analyzed erythema based on the changes in skin color using true color images. However, they did not report cases on darkly pigmented skin. Tissue Reflectance Spectroscopy (TRS) was clinically used to detect Stage I ulcers in subjects with different types of skin [13, 14]. They reported high sensitivity (85%) and specificity (75%). However, similar to the case of bruise detection, TRS is performed at one spatial point at a time which makes the practical clinical diagnostic procedure tedious, time consuming and laborious. Medical Imaging 2008: Computer-Aided Diagnosis, edited by Maryellen L. Giger, Nico Karssemeijer Proc. of SPIE Vol. 6915, 69153K, (2008) · 1605-7422/08/$18 · doi: 10.1117/12.770718 Proc. of SPIE Vol. 6915 69153K-1 Multispectral Imaging Method and Applications Multi-spectral imaging has matured into a technology with many applications, including classification of difficult targets in defense [15], produce sorting [16], precision farming in agriculture [17], product quality online inspection in manufacturing [18], contamination detection in food industry [19], remote sensing in mining [20], atmospheric composition monitoring in environmental engineering, and early stage diagnosis of cancer and tumors [21-24]. With great progressive pace, multi-spectral imaging is replacing many visual or visual experience based diagnostic methods as the most important disease diagnostic tool and post treatment diagnostic tool (in medical imaging). Both TRS and multispectral imaging methods measure light reflectivity of diseased skin. The difference is that the former samples more densely in the spectral domain and more sparsely over the spatial domain than the latter. Images of millions of samples (e.g. 600x800 pixels for a typical low-cost CCD camera) can be conveniently obtained at a set of discrete wavelengths using band pass filters to remove unimportant spectra. This makes a multi-spectral imaging system a cost effective and efficient tool for detecting and characterizing bruises and erythema. Results of initial efforts of using multi-spectral imaging to study erythema and cutaneous inflammation in vivo [25, 26] indicate that it allows for the construction of quantitative maps relating to erythema and edema. The most extensive study of bruise age using indexes of bilirubin and hemoglobin over time were reported in Randeberg and colleagues [27]. They used multi-spectral imaging to detect and characterize bruises on light pigmented skin at spectral ranges of 400 – 1000nm (VNIR) and 900 – 1700nm (SWIR). However they did not report using this approach on darkly pigmented skin. Current multispectral imaging applications require either multiple exposures or extensive post-processing. Examples of these current technologies include filter wheels, generalized Lyot filter, electrical tunable filter, optic-acoustic based SmartSpectra, NASA’s Multi Spectral Imager. These devices are not well suited for point of care applications with respect to durability, portability and cost. This paper describes the design and development of the key components required of a handheld multispectral imager. A mosaic filter has been developed containing four filters synchronized to chromophores of interest in bruise and erythema detection. As a companion to this filter, an illumination system has been developed that bathes the area of interest with light consisting of the same wavelengths targeted by the mosaic filter. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION The initial aspect of this research characterized bruising and erythema using a multispectral imaging system based upon a filter wheel. This work identified a small set of filters that provide needed spectral information and fusion algorithms to achieve contrast enhancement [5, 6]. Using these findings, we focused attention on hardware compatible with the goal of developing a handheld point-of-care device capable of detecting erythema and bruising in people with varying skin tones.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;ccir system a;cmos;charge-coupled device;color depth;color filter array;depolarizer (optics);durability (database systems);failure rate;handheld game console;image sensor;ion beam;lambertian reflectance;lumpers and splitters;medical imaging;multispectral image;nico habermann;pixel;sensitivity and specificity;software portability;sorting;thematic map;video post-processing;video-in video-out;visual inspection;wheels	Linghua Kong;Stephen Sprigle;Mark G.

Instead of the usual empirical or blind numerical optimization, a simple analytical formulation is developed, uniquely based on the impedance states of the modulating devices. This formulation allows obtaining some bounds on system performances and assessing the sensitivity to frequency and component characteristics variations. In particular, an optical modulation component, providing an advantage in terms of low invasiveness, is compared with the more common p-i-n diode-based modulators. The validity of the proposed approach, for high-resolution electrically small probes is demonstrated numerically and experimentally.	characteristic impedance;experiment;frequency band;image resolution;mathematical optimization;modulation;numerical analysis;pin diode;performance tuning;point of view (computer hardware company);reflection (computer graphics);short circuit	Jean-Charles Bolomey;Hamidreza Memarzadeh-Tehran;Jean-Jacques Laurin	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2013.2277533	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;optics;physics;modulation	Visualization	89.93356656612004	-14.797557261840112	120863

A few of these dry electrode prototypes have even progressed from labbased EEG acquisition to commercial sales. While the field has improved rapidly as of late, most dry electrodes share a number of shortcomings that limit their potential real world applications including: 1) multiple rigid prongs that require sustained pressure to penetrate hair and maintain solid scalp contact, creating higher levels of discomfort when compared to standard wet sensors; 2) cumbersome or chin-strap-type applications for maintaining electrode contact, creating barriers to end user acceptance; 3) rigid active electrodes to compensate for high input impedances that limit flexibility and placement of sensors; 4) inability to safely imbed sensors under protective headgear, restricting use in some fields where EEG metrics are most desired; and 5) expensive sensor manufacturing that drives costs high for use across subjects. Under a recent DARPA Phase 3 contract, Advanced Brain Monitoring has developed a novel semi-dry sensor that addresses the current dry electrode shortcomings, opening up the door for new real world applications without compromising subject safe-	electroencephalography;semiconductor industry;sensor	Gene Davis;Catherine McConnell;Djordje Popovic;Chris Berka;Stephanie Korszen	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39454-6_28	nanotechnology	HCI	90.17069466267003	-21.295610007725408	120904

Analytic doping profiles are reverse-engineered to measured transfer characteristics of FinFETs from literature and from this work and good agreement between Monte Carlo simulations and measurements is achieved without any device-parameter calibration. The ballistic ratio, defined as the ratio of the on-current with and without scattering in the channel region, varies between 60 % and 76 % at a metallurgical gate length of about 20 nm, the higher ratio being obtained for devices with gate overlap. This shows that scattering in the channel is still important in current FinFET technology with doping and geometry details having an influence on ballisticity beyond only the gate length. As a particular result, it is found that valley occupancies change in the channel also in the absence of scattering which is attributed to free propagation leading to valley changes.	doping (semiconductor);monte carlo method;reverse engineering;simulation;software propagation	F.

827b4a3e528a216d20663bdaf5d2cde5f6331a67	analysis and design of parameters in soft docking of micro/small satellites		Although substantial research has been conducted on the soft docking problem, the design of the docking mechanism is always conducted using experience. The challenge for conducting factor analysis and design lies in an accurate theoretical model, and the evaluation criteria of a successful docking. In this paper, the soft docking model of micro/small satellites is proposed using an analytical method and validated using a commercial FE package. The evaluation criterion of a successful docking is defined by considering the operational principle of the capturing mechanism used in micro (or small) paired satellites. The effect of the parameters on the soft docking result is discussed and their value domains are designed based on our proposed criteria of a successful docking.	bending stiffness;coefficient;docking (molecular);factor analysis;protein–ligand docking;soft error;theory;velocity (software development)	Xiang Zhang;Yiyong Huang;Xiaoqian Chen	2016	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-016-9034-7	simulation	HCI	86.69544059148444	-9.91204401968578	121120

However, among the various problems encountered in the mass production of fuel cells that have yet to be solved include those associated with the bipolar plate, flow channel, catalyst, membrane electrode assembly (MEA), gas diffusion layer (GDL) and components. Given the present non-uniformity of gas reactions and the difficulty of measuring the temperature in a fuel cell, this study employs micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) to integrate a micro temperature sensor and a stainless steel foil as a gas diffusion layer. Experimental results reveal that the micro temperature sensor had an accuracy and sensitivity of 0.5°C and 2.7×10−3/°C, respectively.	circuit complexity;flexible-fuel vehicle;microelectromechanical systems	Chi-Yuan Lee;Shuo-Jen Lee;Yuh-Chung Hu;Chen-Hen Lin;Yu-Ming Lee;Wei-Yuan Fan	2009	2009 4th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068551	materials science;ceramic materials;catalysis;chemistry;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;forensic engineering;physics	Robotics	92.29674299033435	-14.82331703690716	121185

7f794fe11d19a08b956c1e83eeeccb9ce0b1e784	design of thermal power generation system based on underwater vehicles		In this paper, a thermal power generation system is proposed to transform ocean thermal energy into electrical energy. Provide energy for marine exploration equipment, such as underwater glider, buoy, and can recycles. Marine exploration equipment driven by the novel system can extend the endurance, enhanced the detection capacity and duration, and reduce the impact of energy problems. The intermediate accumulator collects a slow volume change of Phase Change Material (PCM), completes a one-time release after the completion of phase change. This improves volume change rate of phase change material. An experimental method of hydraulic test system, temperature control system and phase change volume measurement system is proposed. The phase change material hexadecane was tested from the solidification state to the liquid. The liquid phase volume change parameter of hexadecane obtained by experiment was prepared for the next overall power generation experiment.

Microstructure, hardness distribution and mechanical properties of the welding joint are analysed. Results reveal that some defects, such as pores, cracks and softening in heat affected zone (HAZ), can be avoided in welding joints, and welding penetration depth and width increase compared with those of laser welding. The thermal conduction rate mounts up and the cooling rate of the welding joint ascends, laser energy is more absorbed by the lower aluminium alloy, which leads to Al element diffusion suppressed from the lower to the upper, and the Al content increasing in both sides of the weld in the molten state. The transverse area has increased in jointing steel to aluminium, and the shear load are shared by the adhesive and the weld, hence the mechanical properties of welding joint are significantly improved.

However, the droplet production rate has been very low, compared with other methods such as solid injection, pneumatic, and rotating. In a liquid-in-liquid system, nozzleless droplet formation was proposed using membrane filter and applying electrostatics. The atomization pattern was categorized into three modes, i.e., dripping, transient, and spray modes. Water glass aqueous solution was atomized in kerosene from 300 μm to 200 nm by applying 0-2 kV positive dc voltages. Comparing between a single nozzle and the proposed nozzleless system, based on the similar average diameters and size distributions, the production rate of the droplets was 53 times (in the dripping mode) and 6.4 times (in the spray mode) higher in the case of a nozzleless system than that of a single nozzle.	categorization;dots per inch;heap spraying	Masayuki Sato;Naomasa Okubo;Takayuki Ohshima;Tomoo Nakane;Bing Sun;Kuniko Urashima	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	10.1109/IAS.2009.5324901	electronic engineering;chemistry;analytical chemistry;forensic engineering	HPC	87.90012571627494	-13.208229328485709	121932

0b29b126b80997650a5de63b572dab9b62cfc949	parametric quantification of low gwp refrigerant for thermosyphon driven solar water heating system		Modern lifestyle, industrialization and economy thrive on energy which is getting expensive overtime. Thermosyphon based systems are getting attraction for their promising heat transfer efficiency and zero energy utilization. Refrigerants having ozone depletion potential (ODP) and high Global Warming Potential (GWP) have been banned or under time bared permission under Montreal (1987) and Kyoto (1997) protocols. We have devolved a Refrigerant Parametric Quantification (RPQ) method for the choice of optimal refrigerant for density driven solar water heaters. A set of 29 refrigerants are simulated Using REFPROP under various temperature and pressure conditions. The optimal parameters of thermosyphon system are identified from governing equations, international environment safety protocols and open literature. The proposed RPQ method shows most appropriate refrigerant for given temperature range. In second part, the proposed system is simulated in TRNSYS using forced circulation method.

The electromigration lifetimes and electrical breakdown field ( E  BD ) in single damascene copper lines/porous polyarylene ether (PAE) dielectric with different diffusion barrier materials (i.e., amorphous-SiC:H and TaN/Ta) were studied. The results showed a “wafer edge effect” in both groups of samples. The electromigration lifetime of samples taken from the center of the wafer is five to nine times longer of those taken from the wafer edge in the accelerated test. The samples from wafer edge showed a bi-modal failure characteristic. It was also found that electromigration resistance of the structure with new diffusion barrier a-SiC:H/Ta was comparable to that with the conventional TaN/Ta. On the other hand, the electrical testing showed that  E  BD  of the a-SiC:H/Ta structure is about twice of that with TaN/Ta barrier, indicating a significant improvement of the electrical performance.	electrical connection;physical address extension	Hung Son Nguyen;Z.

4920b61e147b1f587566ecc8b2184dc1f498a27c	new tool concept for grinding a plateau-like surface for tribological applications		bearings, gears, cylinder liners or guides influences the efficiency of the movement. In general, increased friction leads to higher wear, which decreases the resource efficiency. Besides design and material of machine elements, surface topography is a very important factor to affect friction. The finishing machining process generates the surface and thus it is necessary to understand its effect on surface quality. In most cases, machine elements are made of hardened steel, which is machined by abrasive processes like grinding or honing. For sliding or rolling contact it is common knowledge, that a low surface roughness with a plateau leads to less friction [1]. However, conventional roughness values like the arithmetic roughness Ra or the mean roughness Rz are not useful to describe the effects on friction behavior. Functional roughness parameters like the core roughness Rk, the peak roughness Rpk or the valley roughness Rvk are much more suitable [2]. As an example, cylinder liners are machined by a process combination of grinding and different honing processes to generate a surface with reduced friction [3]. Another combination is grinding and additional polishing processes [4]. These process combinations lead to a plateau-like surface with low roughness values. The material ratio curve becomes flat, so that Rpk is small in contrast to Rvk [5]. New processes, like laser machining, etching or micro milling are able to produce micro dimples [6], which are an effective feature to reduce friction in sliding contacts. In contrast to a deeper groove, as generated by honing, micro dimples are defined by the authors as closed, local structures within the surface. Micro dimples reduce the friction value in mixed friction because a hydrostatic lubrication film is promoted [7]. Besides, for the crossover from mixed friction to full lubrication at lower velocities [8], micro dimples work well as an oil reservoir [9]. Abstract One of the most important factors for energy efficiency is the reduction of friction in machine elements. The grinding process is often the final machining process in machining hardened steel parts and the resulting surface finish influences the tribological behavior. The combination of grinding with a honing process can generate a plateaulike surface to reduce friction and create an oil reservoir to decrease abrasive wear and improve the fluid film stability. Additional processes like laser machining, micro milling or etching are able to generate micro dimples to improve the reduction of friction. Today, grinding processes are limited to machine plateau-like surfaces. Within this paper, a new tool concept will be presented, composed of a grinding tool with two different grain sizes and a metallic bonding. The use of small abrasive grains generates a smooth surface with low roughness values. A few additional larger grains induce stochastic scratches and create the plateau-like surface. Grinding experiments are conducted to analyze the effect of feed rate, feed angle and ratio between small and large grains on the resulting surface.	cylinder seal;etching (microfabrication);experiment;micro-operation;topography	Berend Denkena;Thilo Grove;O.

The SiO2 film was grown at 850 C by means of a mixed dry-steam process, followed by a 60 min, 950 C furnace oxynitridation in N2O gas. A depth profile analysis was carried out by a progressive chemical etching procedure, reaching a residual oxide thickness of about 1.2 nm. XPS analysis of the Si 2p and N 1s photoelectron peaks pointed out that the chemistry of the oxynitride layer is a rather complex one. Four different nitrogen bonding environments were envisaged. Both the overall nitrogen content, which rises up to 2.5%, and its bonding configurations are progressively changing while moving towards the silicon interface. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

a5a03e6ed48f9eed7a339ea72bc92b720adc5c7f	high impedance holographic metasurfaces for conformal and high gain antenna applications		We present simulated and experimental results from a conformal meta-antenna that was designed with a holographic-derived surface impedance for placement on a cylindrical surface. This class of antenna relies on the interaction between a surface wave generated by a simple radiator, e.g., a vertical monopole, and a spatially modulated surface impedance to generate high gain and predictable far-field radiation profiles. The surface impedance profile was formed using a distribution of sub-wavelength isotropic metal patches printed on a thin grounded dielectric substrate. An analysis of the meta-antenna radiative performance on both planar and cylindrical substrate geometries illustrates the importance of appropriately tailoring the surface impedance profile to account for the influence of curvature.	characteristic impedance;high impedance;holography;modulation;norm (social);numerical analysis;planar (computer graphics);polarization (waves);printing;surface wave;variometer	Samuel Kim;David Shrekenhamer;Jeffrey Will;Ra'id Awadallah;Joseph A.

Their use in vivo, however, is currently limited by the low penetration of light through biological tissue. While electromagnetic fields at microwave frequencies can penetrate thick tissue, they do not provide direct control over molecular transducers. Here, we describe a miniaturized, wirelessly powered laser capable of delivering high intensity near-infrared light in tissue. The device is about 2.5 mm in the largest dimension, weighs less than 30 mg, and can be wirelessly powered through >1 cm of tissue.

562fcabd3f2b9a3ecaf829bb73b9052caf3fd6bb	oscillator-based approach for modeling process dynamics in nc milling with position- and time-dependent modal parameters		Oscillator models provide an efficient approach for simulating the dynamic behaviour of the machine, tool, or workpiece. In their application, however, these models are usually limited to describing the vibration behaviour at one specific position since they do not contain any information about the structure of the machine tool or the workpiece. Additionally, the variation in time dependent parameters caused by the material removal process is not taken into account. In this paper, an adapted model, which takes the position- and time-dependent modal parameters during NC milling into account, is presented and its experimental validation with respect to the machining of thin-walled components is discussed.	modal logic	Dirk Biermann;Tobias Surmann;Petra Kersting	2013	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-013-0454-6	control engineering;engineering;operations management;engineering drawing	Robotics	83.07561098685612	-13.10015305867618	123614

The effects of nanotube length and diameter on the buckling modes and the critical buckling loads are systematically studied. The lengths of SWCNTs vary from 1.5 to 30 nm and the diameters vary from 0.3 to 4.5 nm. The buckling modes and the critical buckling loads of different SWCNTs are obtained. The simulation results show that the diameter and the length evidently affect the buckling mode and the critical buckling load of SWCNTs. The critical buckling load decreases to a relatively stable value with the length increasing and in general increases with the diameter increasing. With the increase of length-diameter ratio, the buckling modes of SWCNTs change from shell-like buckling characteristics to space trusses-like buckling characteristics, especially for SWCNTs with small diameters. Therefore, the modeling method based on beam theory in nature can well simulate the buckling behaviors.	buckling;euler–bernoulli beam theory;finite element method;load profile;simulation	Lijie Chen;Qi Zhao;Hongtao Zhang	2010	2010 IEEE 5th International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2010.5592214	materials science;finite element method;nanotechnology;composite material;artificial neural network;physics	HPC	86.76766692489323	-11.777524651579803	123973

Cyclic voltammetry was used to electrodeposit the poly(2,6-DHN) on the carbon electrode surface. The surface morphology and structure of poly(2,6-DHN) film were investigated by SEM and FTIR analysis, and the electrochemical features by cyclic voltammetry. The poly(2,6-DHN)/SPCE sensor showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for PON oxidation in alkaline solutions at very low potentials (0-100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl pseudoreference). An amperometric FIA (flow injection analysis) system based on the developed sensor was optimized for PON measurements and a linear concentration range from 2 to 300 μM PON, with a LOD of 0.2 μM, was achieved. The optimized sensor inserted in the FIA system exhibited good sensitivity (4.12 nA·μM-1), selectivity, stability and intra-/inter-electrode reproducibility for PON determination.	2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene;carbon tetrachloride;clinical act of insertion;flow injection analysis;limit of detection;mathematical morphology;passive optical network;peroxynitrite;printing;selectivity (electronic);sensor;silver;solutions;spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;fluorescence immunoassay analyzer;oxidation	Ioana Silvia Hosu;Diana Constantinescu-Aruxandei;Maria-Luiza Jecu;Florin Oancea;Mihaela Badea Doni	2016		10.3390/s16111975	electronic engineering;chemistry;analytical chemistry;amperometry;flow injection analysis;physical chemistry;electrocatalyst;forensic engineering	Mobile	95.74004321811289	-17.610807461547733	124153

The experimental results showed that green LEDs submitted to reverse bias i) show a time-dependent failure when they are submitted to constant (reverse) voltage stress, at a bias point smaller than the BDV; ii) experience an increase of the reverse-bias electro-luminescence signal, well-correlated with the increase of the reverse leakage current; iii) the TTF (Time-To-Failure) related to the time-dependent breakdown process has an exponential dependence on stress voltage; iv) the TTF is Weibull distributed.

The interfacial adhesion between pULK film and SiCN (nitrogen doping silicon carbon) cap barrier layer played the important role for the package, wiring bond, chip package interaction (CPI), peeling, and reliability. In this work, the thin initial oxide and thin transition films were deposited in situ before depositing p-ULK film, which was used for improving the interfacial adhesion between p-ULK film and SiCN film, The ULK film with multilayer structure was characterized by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) for examining multilayer structure, focused ion beam (FIB) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) for observing interface, and four-point bending (4-PB) for testing interfacial adhesion. Results indicated that the interfacial adhesion was obviously improved by adding initial oxide and transition layer before the deposited p-ULK film, which hardly impact the capacitance using single layer structure. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that the thermal stability of composite films increases from 500°C to 100°C; the requirement of decomposition heat increases from 30 nw to 60 nw, which is twice as large as the requirement of pure PI; the initial decomposition temperature of composite films is remarkable higher than pure PI and when the weight loss is 5 wt% the temperature increases from 200°C to 520°C, which is 2.5 times. This suggests that adding inorganic nanoparticles can effectively improve the thermal properties of composite film. With increasing content, nanoparticles can form thermal network in the matrix, which is one of important reasons to improve the thermal properties of composite films.	3d film	Lei Yao;Lu Chen;Yuqiang Chen;Xiaoxiao Sun	2016	IJMTM	10.1504/IJMTM.2016.081593	nanotechnology;nanocomposite;thermal decomposition	ECom	92.67518293131458	-14.162826258961175	124406

Thermal copper-TSVs provide an elegant solution to effectively transfer heat from LED to the heat spreading structures on the backside of a substrate. But, the use of copper-TSVs generates also novel challenges for reliability as well as also for reliability analysis and prediction, i.e. to manage multiple failure modes acting combined - interface delamination, cracking and fatigue, in particular. In this case, the thermal expansion mismatch between copper and silicon yields to risky stress situations. Therefore, the authors performed extensive simulative work to overcome cracking and delamination risks in the vicinity of thermal copper-TSVs by means of fracture mechanics approaches. Especially, an interaction integral approach is utilized within a simulative DoE and X-FEM is used to help clarifying crack propagation paths in silicon. The DoE-based response surface methodology provided a good insight into the role of model parameters for further optimizations of the intended thermal TSV-approaches in LED packaging applications.	computer cooling;copper–tungsten;elmer fem solver;finite element method;interposer;mathematical optimization;password cracking;response surface methodology;software propagation;thermal grease;through-silicon via	Jürgen Auersperg;Rainer Dudek;R.

ed8d2a5f17112a2bd48724ed166f23d6d1a8c18e	coupling of gain medium and extraordinary optical transmission for effective loss compensation		Gain mediums attract much attention due to their excellent amplification characteristics. However, the potential applications of gain mediums are severely limited because of the requirement of a high external energy to excite the media, thereby compensating for the ohmic loss. In this paper, we developed a theoretical model by numerically solving the coupled Maxwell’s equations and semiclassical electronic rate equations using the finite-difference time-domain method. In the model, the active gain medium is represented by a four-level atomic system, and the atoms are pumped with a homogeneous pumping rate. Then, we investigated the loss compensation with the synergetic effects of gain mediums and extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) phenomena caused by the excitation of the surface plasmon polariton. With the proposal of a novel gain/metal/gain structure that is patterned to be a periodic subwavelength hole array, the self-consistent process of EOT phenomena coupled to the gain medium enables full compensation of the ohmic loss under a much lower pumping rate. This paper not only presents a novel structure but also provides deep insight into the interaction between nanostructures and gain mediums.	amplifier;computer simulation;equivalent oxide thickness;excite;finite-difference time-domain method;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical analysis;plasmon;polariton;pumping (computer systems);semiclassical physics;synergetics (haken)	Kaikun Niu;Zhixiang Huang;Ming Fang;Minquan Li;Xuanhua Li;Xianliang Wu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2815519	semiclassical physics;optical pumping;ohmic contact;surface plasmon polariton;computer science;excitation;atom;extraordinary optical transmission;distributed computing;active laser medium;electronic engineering	Vision	92.32916042343763	-14.527897385532567	124892

Methods: To this end, accurate temperature monitoring and subsequent heating control are critical. However, an economic, portable, and real-time temperature control solution is currently lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a novel portable close-loop system for hyperthermia temperature control, in which photoacoustic technique is proposed for noninvasive real-time temperature measurement. Exploiting the high sensitivity of photoacoustics, the temperature is monitored with an accuracy of around 0.18 °C and then fed back to a controller implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) for temperature control. Dubbed as portable hyperthermia feedback controller (pHFC), it stabilizes the temperature at preset values by regulating the hyperthermia power with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm; and to facilitate digital implementation, the pHFC further converts the PID output into switching values (0 and 1) with the pulse width modulation (PWM) algorithm. Results: Proof-of-concept hyperthermia experiments demonstrate that the pHFC system is able to bring the temperature from baseline to predetermined value with an accuracy of 0.3° and a negligible temperature overshoot. Conclusion: The pHFC can potentially be translated to clinical applications with customized hyperthermia system design. Significance: This paper can facilitate future efforts in seamless integration of close-loop temperature control solution and various clinical hyperthermia systems.	algorithm;artificial nanoparticles;baseline (configuration management);body tissue;control theory;controllers;customize;experiment;fever;field-programmable gate array;overshoot (signal);oximetry, pulse;pid;photoacoustic spectroscopy;photoacoustic techniques;pokeweed mitogens;protein array analysis;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;seamless3d;systems design;width	Feng Xiaohua;Gao Fei;Zheng Yuanjin	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2403276	computer science;physics	EDA	95.06747691686415	-21.268437749618432	125238
20eaebb32aad287589d42c60996b30f23fd95fae	review of recent metamaterial microfluidic sensors		Metamaterial elements/arrays exhibit a sensitive response to fluids yet with a small footprint, therefore, they have been an attractive choice to realize various sensing devices when integrated with microfluidic technology. Micro-channels made from inexpensive biocompatible materials avoid any contamination from environment and require only microliter-nanoliter sample for sensing. Simple design, easy fabrication process, light weight prototype, and instant measurements are advantages as compared to conventional (optical, electrochemical and biological) sensing systems. Inkjet-printed flexible sensors find their utilization in rapidly growing wearable electronics and health-monitoring flexible devices. Adequate sensitivity and repeatability of these low profile microfluidic sensors make them a potential candidate for point-of-care testing which novice patients can use reliably. Aside from degraded sensitivity and lack of selectivity in all practical microwave chemical sensors, they require an instrument, such as vector network analyzer for measurements and not readily available as a self-sustained portable sensor. This review article presents state-of-the-art metamaterial inspired microfluidic bio/chemical sensors (passive devices ranging from gigahertz to terahertz range) with an emphasis on metamaterial sensing circuit and microfluidic detection. We also highlight challenges and strategies to cope these issues which set future directions.	analyzer, device;biomaterials;british informatics olympiad;cubic millimeter;inspiration function;liquid substance;lossy compression;microfluidics;microwave;molecular weight;packet analyzer;patients;printed circuit board;printing;prototype;repeatability;selectivity (electronic);semiconductor device fabrication;wearable computer;analyte;nanolitre;sensor (device)	Ahmed Salim;Sungjoon Lim	2018		10.3390/s18010232	metamaterial;microfluidics;electronic engineering;engineering;network analyzer (electrical);review article;wearable technology;biosensor;ranging;microwave	HCI	94.39870049964213	-19.188961504475586	125365

This paper re-examines how some of these dimensions-particularly the cross-sectional dimensions of the comb teeth-affect this relationship in vertical comb drives. The electrostatic forces in several vertical comb drives fabricated for this study were measured and compared to predictions made with four different mathematical models in order to explore the amount of complexity required within a model to accurately predict the electrostatic forces in the comb drives.	arabic numeral 0;choose (action);cross-sectional data;dimensions;dirac comb;electric capacitance;finite element method;height;intrinsic drive;mathematical model;mathematics;odontogenic tissue;quantity;electric field;electrode;voltage;width	Else Gallagher;Walied A.

164a9f72f46a908c31ebf2cb6c01dbdbcb34bcbc	nanoporous gold nanocomposites as a versatile platform for plasmonic engineering and sensing	nanoporous gold disk;nanoporous nanocomposite;plasmonic sensing;surface-enhanced raman scattering	Plasmonic metal nanostructures have shown great potential in sensing applications. Among various materials and structures, monolithic nanoporous gold disks (NPGD) have several unique features such as three-dimensional (3D) porous network, large surface area, tunable plasmonic resonance, high-density hot-spots, and excellent architectural integrity and environmental stability. They exhibit a great potential in surface-enhanced spectroscopy, photothermal conversion, and plasmonic sensing. In this work, interactions between smaller colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and individual NPGDs are studied. Specifically, colloidal gold nanoparticles with different sizes are loaded onto NPGD substrates to form NPG hybrid nanocomposites with tunable plasmonic resonance peaks in the near-infrared spectral range. Newly formed plasmonic hot-spots due to the coupling between individual nanoparticles and NPG disk have been identified in the nanocomposites, which have been experimentally studied using extinction and surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Numerical modeling and simulations have been employed to further unravel various coupling scenarios between AuNP and NPGDs.	entity;exanthema;experiment;finite-difference time-domain method;gold colloid;interaction;intracellular calcium-sensing proteins;large;menthol 0.05 mg/mg medicated patch;nanocomposite;nanocomposites;nanostructured materials;numerical linear algebra;plasmon;raman scattering;resonance;simulation;small	Fusheng Zhao;Jianbo Zeng;Wei-Chuan Shih	2017		10.3390/s17071519	analytical chemistry;plasmon;engineering;photothermal therapy;spectroscopy;nanoporous;nanostructure;nanoparticle;nanocomposite;colloidal gold		93.55727412015227	-15.921495588368806	125554
9f167348484182624c373d81c278e21aad9c0b90	radical oxidation process for hybrid sam/hfox gate dielectrics in mos2 fets		This study describes the fabrication of hybrid SAM/HfOx gate dielectrics by the radical oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)field-effect transistors (FETs). The fabrication process involves the radical oxidation to form HfOx at the surface of metallic HfN, SAM formation by immersion, and deterministic transfer of MoS2 flakes. A subthreshold slope (SS) of 75 mV/dec and small hysteresis were demonstrated with the hybrid SAM/HfOx gate dielectrics accompanied by a low gate leakage current. TEM observation revealed a uniform formation of HfOx at the surface of HfN. This study opens up intriguing possibilities of radical oxidation process for research in the applications and developments for functional electronic devices.	hysteresis;immersion (virtual reality);molybdenum disulfide;semiconductor device fabrication;spectral leakage;transistor	Takamasa Kawanago;Ryo Ikoma;Tomoaki Oba;Hiroyuki Takagi	2017	2017 47th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)	10.1109/ESSDERC.2017.8066605		HCI	93.40285579142854	-13.085701571363666	125555
ad9e939266c6bd7fa8afde9554fd5a6296b2a306	a method for collecting single cell suspensions using an ultrasonic pump		The presence of cell aggregates in cell suspensions may reduce cell culture efficiency because they can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation. To avoid this problem, this study proposes a novel method for collecting single cell suspensions from culture chambers for subculture using an ultrasonic pump driven by the squeeze film effect. First, we developed a cell culture device consisting of a cell culture substrate with a piezoelectric ceramic disk glued to the back, so that we can elicit resonance vibration of the substrate. A glass pipe is then placed vertically against the cell culture substrate with a slight gap (corresponding to cell diameter) between the pipe and the substrate. By exciting an out-of-plane resonance vibration of the cell culture substrate, we can collect a cell suspension from the cell culture chamber. Since the gap distance between the glass pipe and the cell culture substrate corresponds to cell diameter, the collected cell suspension only contains single cells. We evaluated the capability of the developed cell suspension pumping system and the proliferation of the collected cells with C2C12 myoblast cells. The ratio of single cells in the cell suspension was improved by up to 9.6% compared with that of suspensions collected by the control method (traditional pipetting). Moreover, after cultivating the collected cells for 72 hr, the cells collected by our method proliferated 13.6% more than those collected by the control method. These results suggest that the proposed method has great potential for improving the cultivation efficiency of adhesive cell culture.	adhesives;apoptosis;cell culture techniques;cell signaling;diameter (qualifier value);glass;greater than;myoblasts;piezoelectricity;pumping (computer systems);resonance;suspensions;ultrasonics (sound);pump (device)	Misa Nakao;Yuta Kurashina;Chikahiro Imashiro;Kenjiro Takemura	2018	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2699291	electronic engineering;computer science;c2c12;nanotechnology;cell;suspension (vehicle);ultrasonic sensor;composite material;cell culture	Visualization	93.49604285572192	-16.420367733691876	125602
a25f260b258d4221278c99df7e4172e0cd2bce77	process research of seal ring groove based on magnetic abrasive finishing		Ring groove is widely used in sealing fields, the surface quality directly impacts on the sealing effect. But the size of ring groove is generally small, traditional polishing processes are difficult to improve surface quality. Magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) is an advanced finishing process in which the cutting force is primarily controlled by the magnetic field. In the present work, an experimental investigation has been carried out to study the 45Cr seal ring groove with three typeu0027s magnetic circuit. Based on the simulation and measured results, the layout of the magnet poles was determined, the design and manufacture of experimental device were finished. The bottom and two sides of external ring groove on the seals of a hydraulic system were synchronised finished with the experimental device. The material removal, surface roughness and surface micro-topography of the ring groove were detected after finishing. Experimental results indicated that the surface texture, burrs of the bottom and two sides were removed; the surface roughness of the three surfaces were significantly improved, and the consistency was better, their values can be reduced to Ra0.6 μm. It is suggested that MAF process can achieve on synchronise finishing the bottom and two sides of the ring groove.	seal (emblem)	Hong-Jun Quan;Sudan Shen;Zong-Ze Li	2018	IJMTM	10.1504/IJMTM.2018.10015217	operations management;engineering;magnet;surface roughness;magnetic circuit;magnetic field;surface finish;polishing;abrasive;hydraulic machinery;composite material	Crypto	86.44765430059147	-14.495693848512762	125776
6e1bde5651c62ac4f21067c546fd67c5499c38bc	a model that predicts the material recognition performance of thermal tactile sensing		Tactile sensing can enable a robot to infer properties of its surroundings, such as the material of an object. Heat transfer based sensing can be used for material recognition due to differences in the thermal properties of materials. While datadriven methods have shown promise for this recognition problem, many factors can influence performance, including sensor noise, the initial temperatures of the sensor and the object, the thermal effusivities of the materials, and the duration of contact. We present a physics-based mathematical model that predicts material recognition performance given these factors. Our model uses semi-infinite solids and a statistical method to calculate an F1 score for the binary material recognition. We evaluated our method using simulated contact with 69 materials and data collected by a real robot with 12 materials. Our model predicted the material recognition performance of support vector machine (SVM) with 96% accuracy for the simulated data, with 92% accuracy for real-world data with constant initial sensor temperatures, and with 91% accuracy for real-world data with varied initial sensor temperatures. Using our model, we also provide insight into the roles of various factors on recognition performance, such as the temperature difference between the sensor and the object. Overall, our results suggest that our model could be used to help design better thermal sensors for robots and enable robots to use them more effectively.	f1 score;image noise;mathematical model;robot;semiconductor industry;sensor;support vector machine	Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee;Haoping Bai;Haofeng Chen;Charles C.

A study has been conducted to investigate the effect of the manufacturing uncertainties on the reliability of MEMS. The parameters investigated, include the uncertainties in the characterization of the Young's modulus and the values of the residual stresses generated during the deposition process of MEMS thin films. The study was conducted on a CMOS micromachined thermistor gas sensor, recently proposed in the literature. A novel technique called adaptive multilevel substructuring was used to reduce the computational cost of the analysis. The numerical results suggest that, the uncertainty in the characterization of Young's modulus has a reduced effect on the fatigue life. At the other hand the change in the value of the residual stress has a significant effect in the maximum operational stress level encountered during the operation, equivalent alternating stress value and consequently on the expected operational life of the MEMS component. The maximum expected life was found to occur at residual stresses values ranging from 0 to 400 Mpa. At these residual stresses values, the equivalent alternating stress is found to be lower than the endurance limit of the material. These values of the residual stresses correspond to a deposition temperature of 850/spl deg/C and a SiH/sub 2/ Cl/sub 2//NH/sub 3/ ratio ranging from 2 to 4 for the Si/sub 3/N /sub 4/ film deposition process. The achieved results emphasize the important role that can be played by the numerical modeling of the end product. Using the numerical modeling, conclusions for the process parameters can be evaluated before proceeding to the actual microfabrication process.	cmos;microelectromechanical systems	Khaled Sadek;Walied A.

Then the experiment is carried out on the micro-EDM system composed of multifunctional micro non-traditional machine tool and RC pulse power supply with different parameters. The SEM photos of machined samples are taken, and according to these photos, the topographies of the surface machined in different parameters are compared. The conclusion is that the discharge craters will ascend with the increase of the voltage and capacitance. When the single pulse energy is same but the combinations of the voltage and capacitance are different, the experimental result shows that the size of the discharge craters depends on the single pulse energy, which is coincident with the theoretical analysis. The plainness of the surface machined with different voltage is measured and analysed.	ascend;discharger;multi-function printer;power supply;topography	B. X. Jia;W. F. Bian;Z. L. Wang;W. S.

Retinal vision prostheses are the best example for it. This paper presents a miniaturized 232-channel vision prosthesis, summarizing the studies on the individual technologies that were developed, improved and combined to fabricate a telemetrically powered retinal device sample. The implantable unit, which is made out of a high temperature co-fired alumina ceramic package containing hermetic feedthroughs, electronic circuitry and a radio frequency coil for powering is manufactured through a modified screen-printing/lasering process. The package is sealed with solder glass to provide unaffected inductive coupling to the telemetric transmitter. A 0.05 cc inner volume allows helium leak testing and mathematical lifetime estimations for moisture-induced failure of up to 100 years. The feedthroughs contact a thin-film polyimide electrode array that utilizes DLC and SiC coatings for improved interlayer adhesion of the metallic tracks to the polymer carrier. Two metal layers allow integrated wiring of the electrode array within the very limited space.	aluminum oxide;clomiphene;coil device component;electronic circuit;glass;helium;implants;inductive coupling;lasers;mathematics;polymer;power (psychology);printing;prosthesis implantation;radio frequency;retina;standard industrial classification;track (course);transmitter device component;wiring;anatomical layer	Juan S.

e68791343b32cf8d7789fad7d8751090f2e7b8de	editorial - outgoing editor-in-chief	outgoing editor-in-chief	A mechanical device for removing weeds or other plants comprising a clamp, tubular shaft handle, and a blade with a cutting edge shaped to be forced into the soil at an angle to engage the root immediately adjacent to the center of a weed. The blade and clamp are supported on an elongated tubular shaft which may be held in either hand on a curved section at the end opposite the blade and clamp. A leverage system controlled by the operatoru0027s thumb or hand actuates and holds the clamp open as the blade is positioned and inserted into the soil using hand or foot force movement of the blade to sever the weed root. The leverage system is released, causing the clamp to pin the weed between the clamp edge and blade. The operator then retracts the device at the same angle it was inserted with the weed firmly held between the blade and the clamp. The weed is released from the device by actuating the leverage system again to allow the weed to fall to any desired location or into a collector, without the operator having to bend or touch the weed. The only soil being removed or disturbed, if any, is a small amount immediately about the weed root.		David N.

However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.	3d printing;delta robot;distributed manufacturing;measuring network throughput;microcontroller;open-source software;polymer;printer (computing);rapid prototyping;reprap project;resultant;robot welding;schematic;software deployment;utility functions on indivisible goods	Gerald C.

MEMS COTS are components developed for mass markets and are so in general intended for applications on earth. They have thus only been tested for this type of application and before using them in space, their reliability must be assured in the harsh space environment (radiation,...). The presented reliability approach combines technological analyses, environmental testing and modeling techniques. It has been applied to a specific case: the part of a launch vehicles measurement system has been modeled as a virtual prototype and different MEMS models (accelerometers, pressure sensors...) can be inserted into this model. By the mean of simulation the impact of environmental constraints can be evaluated for a specific mission. In our case we have inserted a COTS accelerometer model, the ADXL150. The influence of two environmental constraints, humidity and radiation, has been considered.	microelectromechanical systems	Petra Schmitt;Xavier Lafontan;Francis Pressecq;B.

Spheron WLPe was developed with bump-on-polymer structure to decrease the input capacitance for high-speed applications. During development of the Spheron WLPe technology, a new polymer dielectric material was carefully selected from seven (7) materials that were tested in terms of reliability and manufacturability. The polymer selected demonstrated not only the best reliability but also provided exceptional manufacturability. The favorable mechanical toughness, high elongation, and excellent adhesion to organic and inorganic materials provided excellent performance in reliability tests. 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

7f37dd647105452221624fa239fbe4e6f7a99362	a distance compensated approach used in wireless passive pressure sensor readout system for high temperature application		This paper proposed a distance compensated measurement system for a wireless passive sensor based on the high temperature cofired ceramics (HTCC) applied to high temperature environment.The sensormodel is provided and fabricated. Also, a telemetric measurement system consists of a readout instrumentation and a heat insulation unit is described due to the thickness of heat insulationmaterial between the sensor and readout unit’s inductance coils in high temperature testing environment. Consideration of the leakage inductance and parasitic parameters which depend on the coupling distance is equivalent to the thickness of heat insulation material, and a distance compensated method is presented. The compensation is based on the mathematical feature of the testing results from readout unit which show us information about the relation between the extracted resonant frequencies.This method can be used simply and reliably in the other telemetric mutual inductance coupling readout system as a viable solution to compensate the coupling distance related error when inductive coupling is varied. It has been experimentally tested, and the results are in good agreement with those measured by a reference impedance analysis instrument. Theoretical explanations, experimental results, and discussion are reported.	characteristic impedance;co-fired ceramic;experiment;inductive coupling;spectral leakage;system of measurement;thickness (graph theory)	Ying-ping Hong;Ting Liang;Tingli Zheng;Qun Cao;Wendong Zhang;Wenyi Liu;Huixin Zhang;Jijun Xiong	2016	J.

Optimization of the operating conditions is one of the most significant studies in the hydroforming process, which affect the forming of successful components. In this work, a finite element model was established for bi-layered tube hydroforming process using ANSYS LS-DYNA pre-processor and LS-DYNA solver in order to predict the most efficient and acceptable operating condition for certain material properties and initial blank geometry. Experiments were conducted to check the model validation and the resultant bulge height and thickness reduction were seen in good agreement with the numerical results. The major failure modes of the process were investigated. Different sets of loading paths (relations between axial feed and internal pressure) were tested and compared to each others. Applying internal pressure in advance of the axial pushing was found to give the best formability for the process. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, this humidity dependence greatly differs for the two measurement frequencies, both in sign and magnitude.

7c5a19e58b38c3375bdfd88ae0c56c8ef95a2583	slope stability analysis of earth-rockfill dams using mga and ust		The nonlinear Unified Strength Theory (UST), which takes into account the effect of intermediate stress and nonlinear behavior on geotechnical strength, is applied in slope stability analysis of earth-rockfill dams (ERD) in this paper. The biggest drawback for general determination of slip surface is that it must presuppose the shape of slip surface and is unable to identify the critical noncircular slip surface more accurately. This paper proposes an optimal analytic model of slope stability analysis of ERD and employs modified genetic algorithm (MGA) to search for the slip surface on the basis of shear failure criteria of the nonlinear UST without prior assumption of the shape of slip surface. The application of MGA dependent on Matlab toolbox to the slope stability analysis of ERD shows that MGA can consequently overcome the weakness of easily falling into local optimal solutions brought by general optimal algorithms.	hercules graphics card	Nansheng Li;Bo Tang;Lihui Xie	2015	J.

A flexible tube has an important role as medical applications, for passing nutrients or fresh air, but inserting the tube has been largely dependent on experienced operators. Although X-ray have been applied to detecting the location of the tube, it is time consuming, high cost and they are bulky, which are not practical. On the contrary, a magnetic sensor has been studied for position/orientation detection due to compactness. In this study, a compact orientation sensor based on magnetic induction has been developed; both field generator and detector are designed along the flexible tube. Magnetic mutual inductance with design parameters are analyzed and optimized for an operational range of orientation angle along with magnetic field modelling method referred to Extended Distributed Multiple-Pole (eDMP) model. Performance of the sensors are numerically simulated and compared to experimental results. The comparisons show the accuracy in wide operational range and potentials in using many applications.	dennō coil;fiber optic sensor;flexible-fuel vehicle;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;sensor;simulation;tesla coil;voltage regulator;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Wu Fang;Jiyun Jeon;Hungsun Son	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222652	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	89.64297516660125	-18.586843110642388	128587

A single-crystal silicon sphere 93.6 mm diameter is used for this determination. A thin surface layer (typically 2 nm to 5 nm thick on flats and 10 nm or more on spheres) of contaminants such as oxide, water and hydrocarbons on the sphere can significantly affect the measurements due to corrections for density changes and to phase change on reflection in the diameter measurement by optical interferometry. The stability of this surface layer as a function of time is also of importance because of ongoing measurements. The nature of this contamination has been investigated using optical ellipsometry and ion beam analysis. It is concluded that the composition and structure of the surface layer are affected by a number of parameters and that the most appropriate method of achieving the desired accuracy is to remove the surface layer by etching and to form a hard stable coating of controlled thickness and composition. This coating may be either silicon dioxide or silicon nitride.	avogadro	Michael J. Kenny;Roger P. Netterfield;Leszek S. Wielunski;David Beaglehole	1999	IEEE Trans.

Recent experimental data indicates that as MOSFETs are scaled the performance gap between n and p-channel shrinks. Nonequilibrium transport effects and performance potentials of ‘Well Tempered’ Si p- MOSFETs with gate lengths of 50 and 25 nm are studied. Monte Carlo and calibrated Drift Diffusion simulations of these devices provide a quantitative estimate of the importance and the influence of non-equilibrium transport on submicron device performance.

The NAND and NOR RS latch topologies have been compared in terms of noise margin and switching times for different broken down transistors. Moreover, the influence of the additional current path due to BD and of the variation of the MOSFET parameters on the circuit functionality have been separately evaluated. The results show that RS latches do not lose functionality after BD. However, reductions on noise margin and variations on switching times are observed, which depend on the damaged transistor. The performance degradation of the circuit is mainly due to the additional post-BD gate current whereas the variation of the BD MOSFET parameters has only a small influence.	flip-flop (electronics)	R.

2f14c6d69ca42c8d1ef4b820870f70c5a859f79b	preservation mechanism of chitosan-based coating with cinnamon oil for fruits storage based on sensor data	cinnamon oil;sensor data;preservation mechanism;chitosan coating	The chitosan-based coating with antimicrobial agent has been developed recently to control the decay of fruits. However, its fresh keeping and antimicrobial mechanism is still not very clear. The preservation mechanism of chitosan coating with cinnamon oil for fruits storage is investigated in this paper. Results in the atomic force microscopy sensor images show that many micropores exist in the chitosan coating film. The roughness of coating film is affected by the concentration of chitosan. The antifungal activity of cinnamon oil should be mainly due to its main consistent trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is proportional to the trans-cinnamaldehyde concentration and improves with increasing the attachment time of oil. The exosmosis ratios of Penicillium citrinum and Aspergillus flavus could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of cinnamon oil. Morphological observation indicates that, compared to the normal cell, the wizened mycelium of A. flavus is observed around the inhibition zone, and the growth of spores is also inhibited. Moreover, the analysis of gas sensors indicate that the chitosan-oil coating could decrease the level of O₂ and increase the level of CO₂ in the package of cherry fruits, which also control the fruit decay. These results indicate that its preservation mechanism might be partly due to the micropores structure of coating film as a barrier for gas and a carrier for oil, and partly due to the activity of cinnamon oil on the cell disruption.	antifungal agents;atomic-force microscopy;attachments;biologic preservation;chitosan;cinnamon - dietary;cinnamon oil;coating excipient;denial-of-service attack;free radical scavenging;free radicals;fruit;mycelium;penicillium;plasma membrane;respiratory rate;scientific publication;source-to-source compiler;trans fatty acids;video-in video-out;antioxidant activity;cinnamic aldehyde;sensor (device)	Yage Xing;Qinglian Xu;Simon X.

A finite element analysis model was built and used by the non-linear finite element analysis method. It is obtained from the result of post-processing calculation and analysis that according to the Fourth Strength Theory, the maximum equivalent stress on the pole tooth root under the uniform load. Root strength should be strengthened to ensure the evenly stress overall the pole tooth, because pole tooth root department would be deformed easily. And the largest stress is at the end of pole tooth and decreases gradually from end to root, and deformation is also the same. Based on the analysis of strength and rigidity, the bearing forces and deformation of the film picking forks roller tooth in work were predicted and validated. It was found that the finite element analysis and the result of test were well coincided. The reliable tool was provided for the design of the film picking forks roller tooth by the finite element analysis. The Roller tooth was designed and improved according to the requirement of deformation and operation.	correctness (computer science);finite element method;mathematical optimization;new product development;nonlinear system;plasma cleaning;roller (beam);simulation;video post-processing	Xufeng Wang;Yonghua Sun;Shaohui Ma;Wei Wang;Jungang Wang;Xuejun Zhang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27275-2_58	structural engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	HPC	85.77720521380726	-13.085712845418424	129552

However, the performance of this type of detector is limited primarily by incomplete charge collection problems resulting from charge carriers trapping. This paper is a review of the progress in the development of CdZnTe unipolar detectors with some data correction techniques for improving performance of the detectors. We will first briefly review the relevant theories. Thereafter, two aspects of the techniques for overcoming the hole trapping issue are summarized, including irradiation direction configuration and pulse shape correction methods. CdZnTe detectors of different geometries are discussed in detail, covering the principal of the electrode geometry design, the design and performance characteristics, some detector prototypes development and special correction techniques to improve the energy resolution. Finally, the state of art development of 3-D position sensing and Compton imaging technique are also discussed. Spectroscopic performance of CdZnTe semiconductor detector will be greatly improved even to approach the statistical limit on energy resolution with the combination of some of these techniques. 	application-specific integrated circuit;cdznte;detectors;display resolution;extravasation;full width at half maximum;gamma rays;head - component of device;imaging techniques;integrated delivery systems;micron;next-generation network;noise (electronics);nymphalis lalbum;partial;radiation;rendering (computer graphics);semiconductor detector;shape optimization;signal processing;spectral leakage;theory;trap (computing);electrode	Qiushi Zhang;Congzhe Zhang;Yanye Lu;Kun Yang;Qiushi Ren	2013		10.3390/s130202447	medical research;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;biological engineering;optics;physics	Visualization	94.35910544168208	-16.880507290907904	129626

In this paper, we have applied the method of liquid-assisted laser processing (LALP) to reduce the temperature gradient, heat-affect zone region for achieving crack-free glass drilling. At the parameters of laser power 6 W, scanning speed 11.4 mm/s and 5 scanning passes by LALP, the crack-free hole with reduced heat-affect zone can be achieved compared to the traditional laser drilling in air. The alpha-step measured profile showed less bugle around the rim of LALP microstructure whose height was about 0.5–1.5 μm in 0.5–1.0 mm water depth while that in air was 6.9–10.5 μm. The relationship between cutting depth, scanning passes and water depths was studied. The ANSYS software was also used to analyze the temperature distribution and thermal stress field in air and water ambient during glass drilling. The higher temperature gradient in air induced higher stress for crack formation while the smaller temperature gradient in water had the less heat-affect zone range and eliminated the crack during processing.	gradient;pyrex;sibelius;simulation	S.

Even though there is no significant compressive strength increase compared to conventional concrete, it exhibits superior behavior in tension. The primary objective of the presented research is to develop a constitutive model that can be used to simulate structural components with SHCC under different types of loading conditions. In particular, the constitutive model must be efficient and robust for large-scale simulations. The proposed model, based on previous research Vorel and Boshoff (2012), for plane stress is outlined and the further focus of this paper is on the mesh objectivity of the model. It is shown to be mesh size independent. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By exploiting the Chladni figures effect, we demonstrate that particles (such as silver nanobeads, silicon oxide micro- and nanobeads, polyethylene microbeads) dispersed on top of the rectangular vibrating membranes can organize into diverse cluster patterns, in response to the devices' multimode resonances in liquid. These particles (-10nm-l0μm in diameters) are observed to aggregate at the antinodes of each mode within seconds, and controlling the excitation frequency can spatially reconfigure the particle assembly in situ. Computational results support the experimental observations and elucidate that the boundary streaming dominates the particle aggregation at the antinodal locations. Further, we realize a 3×3 array of square membranes to demonstrate parallel patterning on the same chip, exemplifying the scalability of this microdevice technology.		Hao Jia;Xia Liu;Philip X.-L.

In the first approach four FBGs are located 200 km from the monitoring station and a signal to noise ratio of 20 dB is obtained. The second improved version is able to detect the four multiplexed FBGs placed 250 km away, offering a signal to noise ratio of 6-8 dB. Consequently, this last system represents the longest range FBG sensor system reported so far that includes fiber sensor multiplexing capability. Both simple systems are based on a wavelength swept laser to scan the reflection spectra of the FBGs, and they are composed by two identical-lengths optical paths: the first one intended to launch the amplified laser signal by means of Raman amplification and the other one is employed to guide the reflection signal to the reception system.	congenital fiber type disproportion;decibel;experiment;fiber to the x;multiplexing;raman amplification;raman scattering;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;tissue fiber;wavelength	Montserrat Fernandez-Vallejo;Sergio Rota-Rodrigo;Manuel López-Amo	2011		10.3390/s110908711	electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise;fiber optic sensor;radio wave;geographic information system;strain;optics;scattering;physics;fiber bragg grating	Mobile	92.64617102968937	-22.000573873509495	130865

Due to conducting polymers’ better mechanical and interfacial compatibility with plastic substrates, integration of driving electrodes based on conducting polymer thin films in display devices can have some advantages over ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) for the improvement of display devices’ mechanical flexibility. As rigid alignment structures on the substrates sandwiching the liquid crystal components are not required, PDLC-type devices intrinsically can better tolerate mechanical bending than other types of LCD devices. With the integration of conducting polymer thin films as the driving electrodes, it can be expected that the flexibility of PDLC devices could be further enhanced. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

IS is a sensitive method for the quantification of changes in cell morphology and cell mobility, making it suitable to study aggregation kinetics. Various sizes of electrodes were compared for the real-time recording of the impedance of adhering cells, at eight frequencies (range: 5 Hz-20 kHz). The real part of the impedance showed to be most sensitive at frequencies of 10 and 20 kHz for the two largest electrodes (7850 and 125 600 μm2). Compared to simultaneous microscopic evaluation of cell coverage and cell spreading, IS shows more detail.	cardiography, impedance;cell mobility;cellular morphology;characteristic impedance;dielectric spectroscopy;embedded system;embedding;galaxy morphological classification;kilohertz;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;largest;nominal impedance;quantitation;quantitative impedance;real-time clock;electrode	R.

QCL-based PA sensors for NO(x) show a detection limit in the sub part-per-million range and are characterized by high selectivity and compact set-up. Electrochemically synthesized gold-nanoparticle FET sensors are able to monitor NO(x) in a concentration range from 50 to 200 parts per million and are suitable for miniaturization.

So far, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, studies of slow and stopped light (applicable to modern optical networks and future quantum networks) have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the past two decades. Here we demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal, using the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light by way of engineered photon–phonon interactions. Our device is fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon. At low temperature (8.7 kelvin), we report an optically tunable delay of 50 nanoseconds with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microsecond signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory, are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature in the analogous regime of electromagnetically induced absorption show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.	cold temperature;computer cooling;cool - action;dynamical system;electromagnetically induced transparency;experiment;interaction;kelvin;microsoft forefront;microwave;muscle rigidity;nanofabrication;nonlinear system;optics;optomechanics;phonon;photons;signal processing;silicon;thrust;velocity (software development)	Amir H.

For this purpose, three new types of magnetic attachment, i.e., split-pole type with a slant magnetization, modified split-pole type, and cylinder type, have been developed and evaluated in terms of the restoring force as well as the retentive force. The new attachments are designed to have high corrosion resistance, combining magnetic and nonmagnetic stainless steels and microlaser welding similar to the usual cup-yoke and sandwich-yoke types. It has been found that the two split-pole types have stronger restoring force and the cylinder type has weaker restoring force in comparison with the usual magnetic attachments. The attachments can be used properly and selectively according to individual requirement on abutment state and denture retention. As a result, the newly developed attachments may provide flexible retention performance useful for more effective and extensive applications of a magnetic attachment.	attachments;corrosion of medical device material;cylinder seal;denture retention;prosthesis implantation;robot welding;stainless steel;welding occupations;yoke device component;abutment	Yoshinori Tegawa;Yohsuke Kinouchi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2008.915730	biomagnetism;magnet;corrosion;magnetization;magnetic field;biological engineering;laser beam welding;forensic engineering;metallurgy;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	90.10229149080214	-17.348545153011344	131720
3bf735c1f8623f7fd233c78805d6d227605358e0	trap detection in electrically stressed algan/gan hemts using optical pumping		AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) with gate lengths of 0.14-0.17 mu m were electrically stressed under on-state (V-G = 0 V), off-state (V-G = -5 V) and typical operating conditions (V-G = -2 V) and subsequently illuminated with below band-gap light to monitor changes in drain current corresponding to the changes in trapping and de-trapping of carriers within the band-gap. The changes in drain current are indicators of a change in trap density as a result of electrical stressing, since the energy from a specific wavelength of light fills traps whose activation energies are less than or equal to that of the light source. Changes in trap densities were minimal after both off-state and on-state stressing but significant trap creation in the range E-C-0.4-0.6 eV were observed in HEMTs exhibiting gradual degradation during stressing. Energy levels corresponding to these values in the literature have been suggested to correlate with Ga-N and N-Ga substitutional defects, as well as Ga-I interstitials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ea36bc634c478f732253eaee84cfad5a12abfd90	early optical detection of infection with brown rust in winter wheat by chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra		Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici, the causative agent of brown rust disease is the reason for major yield losses in winter wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.). Early detection of fungal infections would allow a specific fungicide application. Aim of the current study was to develop an automated and computer based device that differentiate infected and healthy plants non-invasively in an early stage of infection. To achieve the target an optical sensor device has been designed (“MultiDetExc”), which excites chlorophyll fluorescence in discrete wavelengths and detects the induced emissions. Wheat plants were infected artificially with brown rust in a climate chamber experiment to survey the capability of the instrument. The chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra of whole wheat plants were measured on several days after infection. As reference methods, HPLC and qPCR analysis were included in the current study to measure the polyphenol content of the leaves and the level of infection. The recently developed sensor device is an efficient technique to differentiate the infected and not infected wheat plants as soon as four days after inoculation. The measured fluorescence quotients correlate high positive with the polyphenol contents and the relative amount of fungal DNA. An untreated healthy control was measured parallelly, in order to associate the increased synthesis of polyphenols to the fungal infection definitely.	computer;contactless smart card;daylight;environmental chamber;evert willem beth;excited state;experiment;prototype;rust	Ylva Katharina Tischler;Eiko Thiessen;Eberhard Hartung	2018	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2018.01.026	computer vision;fungal dna;fungicide;horticulture;puccinia recondita;artificial intelligence;chlorophyll fluorescence;rust;polyphenol;engineering;inoculation	AI	96.3757646832327	-19.271966773801633	132351

The normalization technique allows for the accurate assessment of damage localization with greater sensitivity irrespective of the damage location. In this study, damage to a simply supported beam was numerically and experimentally investigated on the basis of the changes in the NULS curvatures, which were estimated from the modal flexibility matrices obtained from the acceleration responses under an ambient excitation. Two damage scenarios were considered for the single damage case as well as the multiple damages case by reducing the bending stiffness (EI) of the affected element(s). Numerical simulations were performed using MATLAB as a preliminary step. During the validation experiments, a series of tests were performed. It was found that the damage locations could be identified successfully without any false-positive or false-negative detections using the proposed method. For comparison, the damage detection performances were compared with those of two other well-known methods based on the modal flexibility matrix, namely, the uniform load surface (ULS) method and the ULS curvature method. It was confirmed that the proposed method is more effective for investigating the damage locations of simply supported beams than the two conventional methods in terms of sensitivity to damage under measurement noise.	bending stiffness;binary prefix;decompression sickness;exbi;excitation;experiment;hepatitis b surface antigens;matlab;modal logic;normalize;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;performance;sensor;simulation;ultra-large-scale systems	Ho-Yeon Jung;Seung-Hoon Sung;Hyung-Jo Jung	2015		10.3390/s151026315	structural engineering;normalization;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;statistics	Robotics	88.06514439784164	-23.52132071798984	132795
b3fa425f8751aad2b7c3e71c8b3d6bf7625e1869	validation of the first prototype high temperature ultrasonic sensor for gas composition measurement		The measurement of substances mixtures properties by ultrasonic approach represents a high interest for industrial sector. In particular, the evaluation of fission gas mixtures in nuclear combustion rod under harsh temperature and radiative environment is of a great interest for fuel characterization and notably lifetime optimization. Previously, an acoustic sensor for in situ fission gases (mainly He and He-Xe mixtures) measurements was developed in our laboratory and tested under experimental condition in OSIRIS reactor (Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission facility). Its operational temperature was limited by 200°C [1]. In this paper, a first prototype for measurement in the temperature range from 300 to 400°C is presented. Piezoelectric material was deposit on alumina substrate by screen printing technique. Sodium Bismuth Titanate (NBT) was used as active material.

Hazards are possible due to the bonding of the heating system pipes to customer's grounding systems, as well as to possible high values of fault currents. These electrical safety issues due to grounding electrode interactions have been so far poorly treated in technical literature. District heating pipes are generally dielectrically separated in segments by means of insulating joints. A deeper analysis of such joints shows that the hot water circulating in the pipes may bypass their insulation, rendering the effectiveness of the dielectric separation strongly dependent on the joint geometry, and on the water electrical conductivity. The authors propose possible schemes for the hot water pipe connections, and discuss their efficiency based upon the electrical configuration of the generation plant. An experimental verification procedure to assess the electrical safety of the district heating system is also proposed.	computer cooling;electrical connection;embedded system;interaction;named pipe;pierce oscillator;pipeline (unix);technical standard	Giulio Cerino;Fabio Freschi;Massimo Mitolo;Alberto Poggio;Michele Tartaglia	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	10.1109/IAS.2015.7356921	engineering;electrical engineering;geotechnical engineering;forensic engineering	Embedded	83.80187121052536	-16.936162689467203	133390

Deburring voltage, gap between tool and burr tip, electrolyte concentration and time are considered as input parameters when the performance characteristics include change in burr height and base material removal are taken into consideration. Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array design is chosen for the experiments. An optimal parameter combination of ECD process is obtained by grey relational grade acquired from grey relational analysis (GRA). Optimal ECD parameters for multiple performance characteristics have been derived by the Taguchi method using grey relational grade as the quality index. Optimal setting has been validated using confirmatory test. Considering these ECD parameters, verification of the improvement in the quality characteristics was made with a confirmation test with respect to the chosen initial or reference parameter setting. The outcomes of these experiments indicate the application feasibility of the proposed optimisation technique for continuous improvement in electrochemical deburring process.	energy citations database;experiment;explanatory combinatorial dictionary;grey relational analysis;light-emitting electrochemical cell;mathematical optimization;short circuit;star height;taguchi methods	M.

442ff051dd065676d54b185637b87273ba730dd5	behavior of power mosfets during heavy ions irradiation performed after γ-rays exposure		The behavior of medium voltage commercial power MOSFETs, first degraded with increasing c-rays doses and subsequently irradiated with heavy ions, is presented. It is shown that the degradation of the gate oxide caused by the c irradiation severely corrupt the SEE robustness and drastically modify the physical behavior of the device under test after the impact of a heavy ion. A decrease of the critical voltages at which destructive burnouts and gate ruptures appear has been detected in all devices previously irradiated with c-rays, the amount of the critical voltage reduction is strictly related to the amount of the absorbed c-rays dose. Furthermore, at the failure voltage, the behavior of the device is affected by the conduction of a current through the gate oxide. Moreover the SEGR of the device appears at lower voltages due to the reduction of the Fowler–Nordheim limit in the c-irradiated devices. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, when closing the package, one has to ensure that the packaged components do not contain moisture that could rise humidity inside the package to critical levels by outgassing. For our miniature metal/ceramic packages, we found a drying procedure of 120°C at 180 mbar absolute pressure for one hour, followed by a dry helium purge sufficient to keep the relative humidity below 2.5% over a time span of 300 days at 80°C, corresponding to over 15 years at 37°C. The additional integration of a desiccant inside the package permits to keep the relative humidity below 0.1%, the detection limit of the integrated sensor. This sensor was selected based on an evaluation of 17 commercially available humidity sensors.	closing (morphology);corrosion of medical device material;eighty;electronic circuit;exposure to humidity;helium;housing;implants;license;microchip implant (human);record sealing;rhodium;sensor;span distance;sensor (device)	Martin Schuettler;Andreas Schatz;Juan S.

This work presents a flexible micro temperature sensor that is fabricated based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology and integrated into a flat micro methanol reformer to observe the conditions inside that reformer. The micro temperature sensor has higher accuracy and sensitivity than a conventionally adopted thermocouple. Despite various micro temperature sensor applications, integrated micro reformers are still relatively new. This work proposes a novel method for integrating micro methanol reformers and micro temperature sensors, subsequently increasing the methanol conversion rate and the hydrogen production rate by varying the fuel supply rate and the water/methanol ratio. Importantly, the proposed micro temperature sensor adequately controls the interior temperature during oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM), with the relevant parameters optimized as well.	conversion marketing;entity name part qualifier - adopted;fever;medication event monitoring system;methanol;micro-electrical-mechanical systems;microelectromechanical systems;open source routing machine (osrm);physiologic thermoregulation;temperature sensor device component;thermocouple device component;hydrogen biosynthetic process;sensor (device)	Chi-Yuan Lee;Shuo-Jen Lee;Chia-Chieh Shen;Chuin-Tih Yeh;Chi-Chung Chang;Yi-Man Lo	2011		10.3390/s110202246	redox;chemistry;temperature;electrical engineering;electrode;organic chemistry;methanol fuel;forensic engineering;waste management;physics	Mobile	92.39844735205043	-17.503946302930505	134252

We numerically examine the validity of the proposed hybrid laser structures through calculations of their modal propagation loss by metal's absorption and threshold current densities. We also propose another hybrid laser structure utilizing conductive direct semiconductor/semiconductor wafer bonding exploiting a spatial gain profile well overlapped with the waveguide mode and no metal-induced loss relative to those metal-mediated-bonded.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic study of hydrodynamic cell lysing in a high-throughput Circular Multi-Channel Microfiltration (CMCM) device integrated with a polycarbonate membrane. HeLa cells (cervical cancer cells) were driven into the CMCM at different flow rates. The viability of the cells in the CMCM was examined by fluorescence microscopy using Acridine Orange (AO)/ Ethidium Bromide (EB) as a marker for viable/dead cells. A simple analytical cell viability model was derived and a 3D numerical model was constructed to examine the correlation of between cell lysing and applied shear stress under varying flow rate and Reynolds number. The measured cell viability as a function of the shear stress was consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions when accounting for cell size distribution.	gene ontology term enrichment;high-throughput computing;mathematical model;numerical analysis;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;throughput;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Wuning Ma;Dongqing Liu;H.

This work evaluates the performance and potential of commercial perfluorinated polymer optical fibers (PF-POFs) for radiation monitoring applications. Gamma radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) of two commercial PF-POFs is evaluated in the VIS spectral region. Influence of a dose rate and temperature on RIA measurement is investigated, along with defect stability and measurement repeatability. Co-extruded PF-POFs are identified as more suitable for radiation monitoring applications due to lower dose-rate dependence. With co-extruded PF-POF, RIA measurement holds potential for highly-sensitive radiation monitoring with good reproducibility. The results show that operation in the blue part of the spectrum provides most favorable performance in terms of the largest nominal radiation sensitivity, lower temperature, and dose-rate dependence as well as higher defect stability. We demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge, that PF-POFs can be used for distributed detection of radiation with doses down to tens of Grays. The off-the-shelf, user-friendly PF-POF could be of interest as a cheap, disposable sensor for various applications, especially of a more qualitative nature.	20 ml baclofen 2 mg/ml injection;cisplatin 1 mg/ml injectable solution;dosimeter, device;numerical stability;optical fiber;pf (firewall);polymer;radiation monitoring;radiation pneumonitis;radiation tolerance;radioimmunoassay;reliability engineering;repeatability;rich internet application;software bug;therapeutic radiology procedure;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;usability;visual instruction set	Pavol Stajanca;Katerina Krebber	2017		10.3390/s17091959	analytical chemistry;repeatability;optical fiber;attenuation;engineering;radiation sensitivity;optoelectronics;radiation monitoring;radiation;ionizing radiation;dosimeter	Metrics	94.58850350200149	-20.994273518862244	134405

One method is based on a probabilistic fracture mechanistic model while the other one is based on statistical estimation of rupture frequencies from a large database. In order to be able to compare the approaches and their results, the rupture frequencies of some selected welds have been estimated using both of these methods. This paper highlights the differences both in methods, input data, need and use of plant specific information and need of expert judgement. The study focuses on one specific degradation mechanism, namely the intergranular stress corrosion cracking. This is the major degradation mechanism in old stainless steel piping in BWR environment, and its growth is influenced by material properties, stresses and water chemistry. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A COMSOL model for the MEMS based piezoelectric sensor shows high sensitivity to changes in attached mass at the tip. This would allow the sensor system to be used for detection of specific viruses by incorporating appropriate biomarkers that provide selective binding for such viruses.

The sensor was fabricated using photolithographic techniques, while monoclonal antibodies specific to human PSA were used as primary capture antibodies. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed as a detection technique. The sensor exhibited a detection limit of 1 pg/ml for PSA with minimal nonspecific binding (NSB). This detection limit is an order of magnitude lower than commercial PSA ELISA assays available on the market.

Ten different brands of certified pure Tualang honey were obtained throughout peninsular Malaysia and Sumatera, Indonesia. Various concentrations of two types of sugar solution (beet and cane sugar) were used in this investigation to create honey samples of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% adulteration concentrations. Honey data extracted from an electronic nose (e-nose) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were gathered, analyzed and compared based on fusion methods. Visual observation of classification plots revealed that the PCA approach able to distinct pure and adulterated honey samples better than the LDA technique. Overall, the validated classification results based on FTIR data (88.0%) gave higher classification accuracy than e-nose data (76.5%) using the LDA technique. Honey classification based on normalized low-level and intermediate-level FTIR and e-nose fusion data scored classification accuracies of 92.2% and 88.7%, respectively using the Stepwise LDA method. The results suggested that pure and adulterated honey samples were better classified using FTIR and e-nose fusion data than single modality data.	anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;beets;cane, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tip;eighty;electronic nose;extraction;high- and low-level;honey;indonesia zebrafish;linear discriminant analysis;modality (human–computer interaction);principal component analysis;score;spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;statistical classification;stepwise regression	Norazian Subari;Junita Mohamad-Saleh;Ali Yeon Md Shakaff;Ammar Zakaria	2012		10.3390/s121014022	electronic nose;chromatography;chemistry;computer science;analytical chemistry;sensor fusion;food contaminant;linear discriminant analysis;fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;principal component analysis	AI	97.32772315541128	-18.484738238102484	134672

From the results of capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, excellent n-type C-V characteristics of the devices with 1 and 2nm-thick Yb were observed even though the devices were measured in air. These results suggested that the n-type semiconductor characteristics of pentacene are able to be improved by the thin Yb interfacial layer. Furthermore, the improved n-type characteristics of pentacene will enable the fabrication of flexible complementary logic circuits utilizing one kind organic semiconductor.	diode	Young-Uk Song;Hiroshi Ishiwara;Shun'ichiro Ohmi	2011	IEICE Transactions		metal gate	EDA	91.72943501911611	-13.508834994576898	134780

However, the high costs of nanostructure fabrication and the absence of autonomous portable devices strongly limit the extensive use of LSPR biosensors outside the research laboratories. We designed, implemented, and tested a novel low cost multiparametric stand-alone LSPR imaging instrument for biosensing applications. This compact device (15 × 6 × 17 cm3 size and <;500-g weight) consists of a nanohole array biochip integrated with a microfluidic layer and a processing system. An optical apparatus focuses a light beam from an IR LED source and a digital image sensor captures the reflected light from the biochip surface. The signals are processed by the embedded ARM processor and shown on a touchscreen display by a user-friendly application, without the need for other external computational devices. Moreover, we propose an extremely simple analytical method to reduce the image noise without any sophisticated temperature control or external luminosity change compensation. The device sensitivity of $6 \times 10^{\mathrm {-5}}$ refractive index unit was measured using glycerol solutions with different concentrations. We demonstrated the efficiency of our system in biomolecular detection by monitoring the Ab-PTX3 antibody in a test that showed the instrument's potentialities in the detection of antibodies. These results confirmed the potential usefulness of the proposed system in several biomedical applications such as medical diagnostic procedures, immunoassays, or fast in loco preliminary analyses without the aid of specialized laboratory or trained personnel.	arm architecture;autonomous robot;biochip;digital image;embedded system;image noise;image sensor;loco linux;personal digital assistant;plasmon;resonance;touchscreen;usability	Sara Rampazzi;Giovanni Danese;Francesco Leporati;Franco Marabelli	2016	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2015.2465691	electronic engineering;sensitivity;nanotechnology;control theory;biosensor	Mobile	94.95655919798695	-19.583244102790083	134890

These nano-wires were submitted to laser exposure using gas immersion laser doping (GILD). The result was the formation of either periodic nano-structures or silicon balls. Since the process uses very short laser pulses, it involves rapid melting and solidification of silicon. Hence, the observed periodicity is ascribed to Rayleigh instability, which involves surface tension effects in melted silicon. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Liquids, such as degassed water or mineral oil, are used as acoustic coupling media between the ultrasound-generating transducer and the brain; however, they require a separate container that limits the spatial orientation of the transducers with respect to the sonication target. Nonliquid, gel-like materials that do not require a housing container have been sought after as coupling media to overcome such limitations. Polyvinyl alcohol PVA, when dissolved in water and undergone freeze-thaw cycles, forms a flexible hydrogel having a high level of acoustic transmission. To examine the feasibility of the PVA cryogel as the coupling material for transcranial FUS, the mechanical properties in terms of its Young's modulus and acoustic attenuation of the PVA cryogel were examined using different concentrations and number of freeze-thaw cycles. The cryogel with 6 or 7% w/v concentrations and two freeze-thaw cycles showed minimum pressure attenuation on the order of 1% across the different ultrasound frequencies 250-650 kHz. The cryogel was molded to fit around a single-element FUS transducer and was applied to a head phantom, showing the flexibility in orienting the sonication paths at different angles and depths. The use of the cryogel did not alter the location and shape of acoustic focal profile compared to the one measured in the degassed water. The present work suggests that PVA cryogel may be used as an alternative acoustic coupling medium for low-intensity FUS applications.	acoustic coupler	Wonhye Lee;Stephanie D.

For this purpose, the turret has a rotatable hub with a plurality of blocks on its periphery slidable relative thereto in directions parallel to the axis of rotation, into and out of slots on a fixed member, the location of the slots corresponding to the operative locations of the tool holders. The blocks are all secured to the keeper ring of an annular electromagnet, whose strength is sufficient to retain the keeper ring attracted when the blocks are out of the slots, but whose strength is insufficient to retain the keeper ring when the blocks are in the slots. Springs act between the hub and the blocks to urge the blocks into the slots; and cam surfaces on the fixed member cam the blocks out of the slots against the action of the springs in one direction of rotation of the hub. A driving ring for the hub has abutment surfaces that contact the hub only in that one direction of rotation; whereas the same driving ring has abutment surfaces that contact only the blocks in the other direction of rotation, and then only when the blocks are withdrawn from the slots.	thin-film transistor	Hamid Toutah;Jean-François Llibre;Boubekeur Tala-Ighil;Taieb Mohammed-Brahim;Youri Helen;G.

Moreover, the corrosion rate of tin increased with increased direct current bias voltage under different electric fields. The contributions of electric field gradient and leakage current to the corrosion rate of tin were quantified under different electric fields with different bias voltages.	biasing;triangulated irregular network	Hualiang Huang;Jing Tian	2017	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2017.08.013	engineering;electronic engineering;tin;corrosion;voltage;alternating current;electric field gradient;biasing;direct current;electric field	HCI	91.24951074198339	-11.761034379867453	135405

However, because of its low thermal conductivity and high strength, machining of titanium is very difficult. The heat generated in machining can dramatically shorten the tool life. Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) is a non-traditional machining process, and has been used to machine various difficult-to-machine materials. Investigations have been reported regarding effects of machining variables (including ultrasonic power, tool rotation speed, and feedrate) on several output variables in RUM, such as cutting force, torque, surface roughness, edge chipping, material removal rate, and tool wear. However, there have been few studies on cutting temperatures in RUM. This paper presents an experimental study on cutting temperature in Cutting temperature in rotary ultrasonic machining of titanium 251 RUM of titanium. It is the first study to utilise fibre optic temperature sensors to measure the cutting temperature in RUM. The results revealed effects of machining variables on cutting temperature in RUM, and demonstrated that Fabry-Perot (FP) fibre optic sensors offer more accurate localised measurement of temperature in RUM than thermocouples.

In the present study, we aimed to overcome this problem using a QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) sensor immersed in the water. Since the sensor has been already immersed in the water, it does not encounter the influence of the humidity in the ambient air.

Hu The response of single flash cell in a 180-nm flash technology to Total ionizing dose (TID) is studied. The results indicate that the erased cell flips at a dose level of 100 krad(Si), whereas the programmed cell does not even at the dose level up to 1 Mrad(Si). This asymmetric phenomenon is attributed to the difference between the reference current of the comparator circuit and the intrinsic current of the flash cell. For the first time, we show that the irradiation-induced flash cell drain-current variation does not saturate at the intrinsic value, i.e. the drain current of a device with neutrally charged floating gate. After degrading to the intrinsic state, the read current of the erased cell gradually increases while the programmed cell continues to increase and then slightly drops back. Radiation tolerance comparison of single flash cell, I/O transistors and high-voltage (HV) transistors demonstrates that HV NMOS is most susceptible to ionizing radiation. The radiation tolerance of the circuit level is also evaluated from the elementary devices. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

10e9282255df565e37ad4f08dffe36e3515d284f	piezoresistive effect in composite films based on polybenzimidazole and few-layered graphene		The paper reports experimental study of piezoresistive effect in composite films based on polybenzimidazole with few-layered graphene nanoparticles filler. Colloidal dispersions of few-layered graphene (FLG) were obtained by ultrasonic treatment of synthesized FLG in the solution of poly[2,2′-(p-oxydiphenylen)-5,52′-bisbenzimidazole] (OPBI) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Electroconductive films were formed from the dispersions by flow coating. To investigate dependence of electrical resistance on mechanical strain strips of the films were bonded onto beams of uniform strength (in bending) with cyanoacrylate adhesive, the beams being insulated with polymer glue. The strain gauge factors were measured for two films with filler content being 0.75 and 2.00 mass per cent. Electrical resistances were measured by two- and four-point methods, the factors being independent on the method used. The factors are the same within the error for both filler contents and equal to 21 on average.	3d film;experiment;graphene;polymer;strips;star filler	V. A. Kuznetsov;B. Ch. Kholkhoev;A. Ya.

In this work an Endex calcium looping system is modelled as a train of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) elements mass-coupled in series and thermally coupled in parallel. A novel simulator was developed that incorporates object-oriented design to describe the Endex reactor and its components, and used to study the effects of varying the most important design and operating parameters. From a reactor design point of view, varying the heat transfer coefficient and the sorbent flow rate amounts to testing the classic tradeoff between capital and running costs: we may choose between higher capital costs (larger heat transfer coefficient) and lower running costs (low sorbent flow rate) or vice versa, for similar scrubbing and regeneration efficiencies.	reactor (software);simulation	P.

99bb822f7d08de3ff70fc050291c3746ad676c90	numerical analysis of the formation of the dead metal zone with different tools in orthogonal cutting	dead metal zone dmz;tool edge geometry;friction coefficient;finite element size;finite element method fem	This work focuses on the mechanism of the dead metal zone (DMZ) formation and the effects of the cutting edge geometries (sharp, chamfered, double chamfered and blunt edges) and the cutting speed as well as the coefficient of friction on the formation of DMZ during orthogonal cutting of AISI 1045 material using finite element method (FEM). The different tool edge geometries are utilized to establish the finite element models to simulate the cutting process with Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) approach in ABAQUS/Explicit. The simulations are validated by the experimental findings and analytical data of cutting and thrust forces. The experiments are conducted with four kinds of tools at a velocity of 8 m/s and a chamfer tool at three different cutting speeds (4 m/s, 10 m/s and 16.7 m/s). The simulation results show that both the cutting speed and friction coefficient have some effects on the formation of the DMZ due to the thermal softening effect and friction. However, tool edge geometry has large influence on the formation of DMZ because of the missing region created by different edge. The machining forces both in the cutting and thrust directions increases as the size of the DMZ increases and decreases as the cutting speed increases. The DMZ is responsible for the increasing of thrust force. The finite element size is also studied in the paper, the comparisons with different FE sizes show that a smaller size contributes to a more accurate result at the cost of the computing time, so a balance between the accurate results and the computing time should be made.	cutting-plane method;numerical analysis	Dazhong Wang	2015	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2015.04.006	structural engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	Logic	86.40423988510027	-12.217465501514166	136389

High accuracy real-time distance measurements are needed in membrane fouling and compaction studies. The benefits of the sonic velocity compensation with a reference transducer are compared to the sonic velocity calculated with the measured temperature and pressure using the model by Belogol'skii, Sekoyan et al. In the experiments the temperature was changed from 25 to 60 °C at pressures of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 MPa. The set measurement distance was 17.8 mm. Distance measurements with sonic velocity compensation were over ten times more accurate than the ones calculated based on the model. Using the reference transducer measured sonic velocity, the standard deviations for the distance measurements varied from 0.6 to 2.0 µm, while using the calculated sonic velocity the standard deviations were 21-39 µm. In industrial liquors, not only the temperature and the pressure, which were studied in this paper, but also the properties of the filtered solution, such as solute concentration, density, viscosity, etc., may vary greatly, leading to inaccuracy in the use of the Belogol'skii, Sekoyan et al. model. Therefore, calibration of the sonic velocity with reference transducers is needed for accurate distance measurements.	3-mercaptopropionic acid;calibration;data compaction;experiment;real-time clock;tissue membrane;transducer;ultrasonics (sound);velocity (software development);benefit	Sam Stade;Mari Kallioinen;Mika Mänttäri;Tuure Tuuva	2014		10.3390/s140711682	medical research;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;biological engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	92.03637687630118	-19.785713666198724	136414

The base is formed with a plurality of apertures which open through the base, and a plurality of electrical connectors are mounted on the base. Specifically, the connectors are formed with a central portion, and each connector has two deflectable fingers which extend in opposite directions from this central portion. The central portion of the connector is embedded into the base to cantilever the fingers into juxtaposed apertures. When they are not deflected, one finger of the connector projects outwardly from its aperture and beyond the first surface of the base, while the other finger projects outwardly from its aperture and beyond the second surface of the base. In a plurality of apertures, one finger projects one way and another finger projects the other way. With this combination, the electrical contact tips of the fingers are arranged as two matrices, one over the first surface of the base and the other over the second surface.

The sensor consists of a tapered optical fiber, where an optical signal goes across, embedded into a PDMS-gold nanocomposite material (GNM). By applying different pressure forces onto the PDMS-based nanocomposite, changes in the optical transmittivity of the fiber can be detected in real time due to the coupling between the GNM and the tapered fiber region. The intensity reduction of a transmitted light is correlated to the pressure force magnitude. Light intensity is converted into an electric signal by a system suitable for robotic implementation. High sensitivity using forces by applying weights of a few grams is proved. Sensitivity on the order of 5 g is checked. A detailed algorithm for the detection of roughness and shapes by means of a robotic finger is proposed.	algorithm;embedded system;grams;nanocomposite;optical fiber;pdms;robot;sensor	Alessandro Massaro;Fabrizio Spano;Aimé Lay-Ekuakille;Paolo Cazzato;Roberto Cingolani;Athanassia Athanassiou	2011	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2011.2121290	electronic engineering;computer science;pressure sensor;optics;tactile sensor;physics	Robotics	91.09314566381205	-18.924225090194586	136914

For these MEMS devices, optical readout methods have proven to be superior to capacitive or piezoresistive strategies in terms of sensitivity as well as noise and interference immunity, however the integration of light sources and detectors is not easily possible. This paper presents an approach to use organic optoelectronic devices for the readout. OLED and OPD (organic photo detector) are structured on the glass substrate and cover encapsulating the MEMS devices, allowing for a tightly integrated sensor based on vertical light flux modulation by a horizontally moving proof mass. The paper describes the principle sensor structure as well as the fabrication of suitable organic devices.

An apparatus for performing photoacoustic (PA) measurements is constructed and the technique is verified in vitro and in vivo through measurements on glucose solutions and live tissue. The signal amplitude is observed to increase with the glucose concentration in both cases. A linear calibration method is applied on each individual to obtain a glucose concentration value from each PA measurement. The glucose values obtained are compared with reference glucose concentrations measured using a standard glucose meter, giving a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 23.75 mg/dl and a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 18.03%. A plot of 196 measurement pairs taken over 30 normal subjects on a Clarke Error Grid gives a point distribution of 67.86%, 31.12%, 0.0%, 1.02% and 0.0% over zones A to E of the grid. This performance is an improvement over those obtained previously using PAS and point to the potential of the technique for non-invasive glucose measurements. An FPGA based reconfigurable embedded architecture is proposed for high speed data acquisition, noise reduction and display of PA measurements. The architecture operates at 274.823 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA providing an SNR improvement of 30 dB and enabling a portable blood glucose monitoring system.	coherence (physics);data acquisition;edmund m. clarke;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;mad;mobile device;newton's method;noise reduction;pa-risc;photoacoustic doppler effect;relative change and difference;signal-to-noise ratio;video-in video-out;virtex (fpga)	Praful P.

CAT is present in almost all aerobic living organisms, where it catalyzes the disproportionation of H(2)O(2) into oxygen and water without forming free radicals. In order to study this catalytic mechanism in detail, the direct electrochemistry of CAT has been investigated at various modified electrode surfaces with and without nanomaterials. The results show that CAT immobilized on nanomaterial modified electrodes shows excellent catalytic activity, high sensitivity and the lowest detection limit for H(2)O(2) determination. In the presence of nanomaterials, the direct electron transfer between the heme group of the enzyme and the electrode surface improved significantly. Moreover, the immobilized CAT is highly biocompatible and remains extremely stable within the nanomaterial matrices. This review discusses about the versatile approaches carried out in CAT immobilization for direct electrochemistry and electrochemical sensor development aimed as efficient H(2)O(2) determination. The benefits of immobilizing CAT in nanomaterial matrices have also been highlighted.	catalase;cat state;computed tomography scanning systems;electrochemistry;exhibits as topic;free radicals;heme;hydrogen peroxide;immobiliser;mike lesser;nanostructured materials;organism;oxygen;schrödinger's cat;benefit;electrode;enzyme activity;respiratory electron transport chain process;sensor (device)	Arun Prakash Periasamy;Yogeswaran Umasankar;Shen-Ming Chen	2009		10.3390/s90301821	chemistry;nanomaterials;bioinformatics;organic chemistry;hydrogen peroxide;nanotechnology;electrocatalyst;biological engineering	HCI	95.81644673177605	-17.39440921383426	137497

This paper will describe generator pitch along with other generator design criteria that affect output harmonics.

7914da0c2142eca833597f493ec5a46403cf0af0	microstructure and properties of the ferroelectric-ferromagnetic plzt-ferrite composites		The paper presents the technology of ferroelectric-ferromagnetic ceramic composites obtained from PLZT powder (the chemical formula Pb0.98La0.02(Zr0.90Ti0.10)0.995O3) and ferrite powder (Ni0.64Zn0.36Fe2O4), as well as the results of X-ray powder-diffraction data (XRD) measurement, microstructure, dielectric, ferroelectric, and magnetic properties of the composite samples. The ferroelectric-ferromagnetic composite (P-F) was obtained by mixing and the synthesis of 90% of PLZT and 10% of ferrite powders. The XRD test of the P-F composite shows a two-phase structure derived from the PLZT component (strong peaks) and the ferrite component (weak peaks). The symmetry of PLZT was identified as a rhombohedral ferroelectric phase, while the ferrite was identified as a spinel structure. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) microstructure analysis of the P-F ceramic composites showed that fine grains of the PLZT component surrounded large ferrite grains. At room temperature P-F composites exhibit both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. The P-F composite samples have lower values of the maximum dielectric permittivity at the Curie temperature and a higher dielectric loss compared to the PLZT ceramics, however, the exhibit overall good multiferroic properties.	digital television adapter;electron;ferrite (magnet);guilty gear xrd;linear programming relaxation;material design;microelectromechanical systems;sensor;transducer;two-phase locking;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Dariusz Bochenek;Przemyslaw Niemiec;Joanna Korzekwa;Bartlomiej Durtka;Zbigniew Stoklosa	2018	Symmetry	10.3390/sym10030059	curie temperature;ceramic;dielectric;microstructure;dielectric loss;ferrite (magnet);ferroelectricity;ferromagnetic material properties;mathematics;composite material	Networks	91.97017760810091	-15.203909807156931	137706
f1353d0667fe2e4683dbc4058a01c80896a76e4e	equivalent circuit modeling of the bistable conduction characteristics in electroformed thin dielectric films	memristor;rram;mim	In the last few years a number of models based on simple circuital representations have been proposed to account for the resistive switching (RS) current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structures. These devices typically exhibit two well-defined conduction levels after electroforming often referred to as the low and high resistance states that can be cyclically reached by the application of bipolar periodic voltage or current. The resulting hysteretic behavior arises from a reversible change of the electron transmission properties of the insulating film driven by an external stimulus. In this paper, after an overview of a variety of RS model proposals relying on circuital descriptions and basic analytic expressions, a model based on the solution of the generalized diode equation is discussed. The model is simple and flexible and consists of two opposite-biased diodes with series and shunt resistances that represent the filamentary current pathway spanning the oxide layer as well as the possible parasitic effects. The model parameters are governed by a mathematical entity called the logistic hysteron that can be linked to the internal state equation of the so-called memristive systems. For illustrative purposes, the switching I–V characteristics of TiO2-based MIM structures electroformed with different current compliances are examined in detail using this approach. Experimental results on bipolar RS by other authors are also assessed within the same framework. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Both available power and cell life are functions of the local current allocated to each composite material, however there are no examples in literature of electrochemical-based models of composite electrode cells that are suitable for estimation and control. We present a reduced order, electrochemical model of a composite LiMn2O4 - LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cell that predicts bulk and surface concentrations of each composite material, as well as the local current allocated to each material. Observability properties are analyzed by approximating the system as linear over certain operating conditions.

The fluctuations are used as a marker of liquid flow as their time of flight in between two consecutive transducers is determined, thereby allowing for the measurement of liquid flow rates in the picoliter-per-minute regime.

In experimental comparisons of the effects of different pitch sizes on the plasmonic band-gap, the obtained SPGCEs were highly directional, with intensity increases as large as 10.38-fold. The FWHM emission spectrum was less than 70 nm. This method is easily applicable to detecting refractive index changes by using SP-coupled fluorophores in which wavelength emissions vary by viewing angle. The measurements and calculations in this study confirmed that the color wavelength of the SPGCE changed from 545.3 nm to 615.4 nm at certain viewing angles, while the concentration of contacting glucose increased from 10 to 40 wt%, which corresponded to a refractive index increase from 1.3484 to 1.3968. The organic plasmon-emitting diode exhibits a wider linearity range and a resolution of the experimental is 1.056 × 10-3 RIU. The sensitivity of the detection limit for naked eye of the experimental is 0.6 wt%. At a certain viewing angle, a large spectral shift is clearly distinguishable by the naked eye unaided by optoelectronic devices. These experimental results confirm the potential applications of the organic plasmon-emitting diodes in a low-cost, integrated, and disposable refractive-index sensor.	diode device component;emission - male genitalia finding;exhibits as topic;extraction;full width at half maximum;glucose;gold;interface device component;organic synthesis techniques;picolitre;plasmon;redshift;resonance;self-propelled particles;sensor;viewing angle;wavelength	Nan-Fu Chiu;Chih-Jen Cheng;Teng-Yi Huang	2013		10.3390/s130708340	analytical chemistry;optoelectronics;localized surface plasmon;optics	Vision	91.96501514194195	-14.534742714536486	137907

It permits to design optoelectronic devices such as laser diodes or LEDs, from the near ultraviolet to the infrared light spectrum. This sweeps indeed, the whole of the visible spectrum and, hence, appears to be very useful to the recent development of liquid crystal display screens, or designing photodiodes and perhaps solar cells (after studying their energetical efficiencies). Nevertheless, refractive indices of InxGa1 xN structure have not been studied. The refractive index of such structures is increasing from the GaN refractive index to the InN one, with therefore, a bowing of the curve due to the lattice mismatch between these two constituting binary alloys. The index is, in a certain range of the ‘‘n(x)’’ characteristic, less than the GaN one. This seems to be particularly interesting in the integrated optics domain or optical waveguides realization, because the growth of GaN is easier than the growth of InxGa1 xN. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This investigation represents a complete study of the short-length effect after a well-developed dual-damascene Cu process. Lifetime measurement and resistance degradation as a function of time were used to describe this phenomenon. It has been found that the sigma of log–normal distribution increased as the current density–length product decreased. The statistical distribution of the critical volume fits the sigma curve well. Lower jL values show large sigma values because of back-stress-induced TTF (time-to-fail) dispersion. A simplified equation is proposed to analyze the experimental data from various combinations of current density and line length at a certain temperature. The resulting threshold–length product (jL)C value appears to be temperature dependent, decreasing with an increase in temperature in a range of 250–300 C. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The luminophore application process is studied to enhance the characterization of the PC-PSP. A dipping deposition method is used to apply a luminophore on a polymer-ceramic coating. The method selects a solvent by its polarity index. The characterization includes the signal level, pressure sensitivity, temperature dependency, and response time. It is found that the luminophore application process affects the steady-state characterizations, such as the signal level, pressure sensitivity, and temperature dependency. A range of change for each characterization, which is based on the minimum quantity, is a factor of 4.7, 9, and 3.8, respectively. A response time on the order of ten microseconds is shown. The application process is not a dominant factor for changing the response time, which is within the uncertainty of the thickness variation. Comparisons of the effects on the luminophore application process and the polymer content are made to discuss the PC-PSP characterization results.	chemical vapor deposition;coating excipient;contain (action);flow;large;psp protein, phaseolus vulgaris;polymer;progressive supranuclear palsy;reg1a gene;response time (technology);signal-to-noise ratio;steady state;technical support;thickness (graph theory);emotional dependency;orders - hl7publishingdomain;polarity;ruthenium ru 106;solvents - non-drug agent	Hirotaka Sakaue;Tatsunori Hayashi;Hitoshi Ishikawa	2013		10.3390/s130607053	medical research;chemistry;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;operations research;mechanical engineering	Metrics	94.90605495523036	-15.589765313965568	138484
15cb1e614be472465390a7db352a9e1a572cadf2	a spatially offset raman spectroscopy method for non-destructive detection of gelatin-encapsulated powders	self modeling mixture analysis;subsurface detection;spatially offset raman spectroscopy;quality control	Non-destructive subsurface detection of encapsulated, coated, or seal-packaged foods and pharmaceuticals can help prevent distribution and consumption of counterfeit or hazardous products. This study used a Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) method to detect and identify urea, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen powders contained within one or more (up to eight) layers of gelatin capsules to demonstrate subsurface chemical detection and identification. A 785-nm point-scan Raman spectroscopy system was used to acquire spatially offset Raman spectra for an offset range of 0 to 10 mm from the surfaces of 24 encapsulated samples, using a step size of 0.1 mm to obtain 101 spectral measurements per sample. As the offset distance was increased, the spectral contribution from the subsurface powder gradually outweighed that of the surface capsule layers, allowing for detection of the encapsulated powders. Containing mixed contributions from the powder and capsule, the SORS spectra for each sample were resolved into pure component spectra using self-modeling mixture analysis (SMA) and the corresponding components were identified using spectral information divergence values. As demonstrated here for detecting chemicals contained inside thick capsule layers, this SORS measurement technique coupled with SMA has the potential to be a reliable non-destructive method for subsurface inspection and authentication of foods, health supplements, and pharmaceutical products that are prepared or packaged with semi-transparent materials.	101 mouse;acetaminophen;authentication;behavior;blepharipa tibialis;blind signal separation;chao (sonic);conflict (psychology);contain (action);containers;distance;dosage forms;effective method;experiment;extraction;foobar;food;gelatin;ibuprofen;list of system quality attributes;methamphetamine;peaks;pharmaceutical preparations;powder dose form;pushpa ratna sagar;rca spectra 70;ret protein, human;raman scattering;schmidt decomposition;semiconductor industry;sensor;specimen source codes - quality control;spectroscopy, near-infrared;stiff-person syndrome;sudden infant death syndrome;tsfm gene;urea;x-ray emission spectroscopy;anatomical layer;capsule (pharmacologic);hemoglobin queens park	Kuanglin Chao;Sagar Dhakal;Jianwei Qin;Yankun Peng;Walter F.

53806aabae17bb69d7695ebc0043869149bba8b6	influence of groove type on welding-induced residual stress, deformation and width of sensitization region in a sus304 steel butt welded joint	residual stress;finite element;welding deformation;sensitization region;groove type;numerical simulation	An advanced computational approach for simulating multi-pass welding process was developed.The influence of groove shape on welding residual stress distribution was studied.The influence of groove shape on angular distortion was examined.Groove shape has significant influence on residual stress, deformation and sensitization zone. To join a medium or thick plate weldment with a full penetration, a groove is usually prepared in the space between two sections of metal. Because weld metal needs to be deposited within the groove to form the joint, it is expected that different groove type will require different heat input, which may consequently have influence on welding residual stress and deformation. Generally, different groove corresponds to different bead layout, so it can be foreseen that the groove type has a significant effect on temperature history, shape and size of heat affected zone, and region of sensitization in certain alloys such as austenitic stainless steel. The influences of groove type on residual stress, angular distortion and width of sensitization region in a SUS304 butt-welded joint were investigated by means of numerical simulation and experiment. Based on ABAQUS code, a computational approach with considering thermo-mechanical coupling behaviors, moving heat source, strain hardening and annealing effect was developed to simulate temperature profile, stress field and deformation in multi-pass joint. Welding temperature cycles, residual stress distributions and deformations in V, K and X groove joints were calculated through using the proposed computational procedure. Meanwhile, experiments were carried out to obtain residual stress distributions and angular distortions. Through comparing the numerical results and the measured data, the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed computational approach were verified. The simulation results show that groove type has a significant influence on welding residual stress distribution, angular distortion and width of sensitization region.	residual stress	Yanhong Ye;Jianpeng Cai;Xiaohua Jiang;Deping Dai;Dean Deng	2015	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2015.04.001	computer simulation;structural engineering;computer science;residual stress;finite element method;engineering drawing;metallurgy	SE	86.69816044721287	-12.26106830239528	139333

The assumption of the developed computational approach was that pitting (pits on the contact surfaces) is a result of fatigue crack propagation under (rolling) contact loading conditions. Developed crack growth laws (based on the Paris law) allow to perform simulations of pitting crack growth with respect to the non-proportional and non-linear nature of loading of pitting crack tip, which result from specific loading condition. Specific crack tip loading and pitting crack growth was evaluated using the  J -integral criterion of fracture mechanics. Advance model of penetration of the fluid lubricant into fatigue (pitting) cracks was designed using special hydrostatic fluid finite elements, which allow to include the closure of pressured lubricant between fracture surfaces during the simulation of gearing meshing. A simplified distribution of residual stresses in the surface layers of teeth is included as well. The simulations were carried out under the commercial code ABAQUS CAE FEM programme which allows to develop in-house codes using the Python scripting language and user subroutines. Mentioned programme codes and user subroutines are the basis of all FEA including the simulation of the specific loading conditions of pitting crack tip and the incremental pitting crack growth. Wide sensitivity study of the influence of selected model parameters was carried out. Achieved results – final pitting crack shapes and time needed for their formation were compared with experimental results.	simulation	J. Jurenka;M.

Recently, MEM application has become a subject of interest in the semiconductor engineering field, in which devices utilize very thin films composed of many materials. For thin film fabrication, it is essential to thoroughly understand atomic-scale structures, internal fixed charges, and bulk/interface traps, and many experimental techniques have been developed for evaluating these. However, the difficulty in interpreting the data they provide prevents the improvement of device fabrication processes. As a candidate for a very practical data analyzing technique, MEM is a promising approach to solve this problem. In this paper, we review the application of MEM to thin films used in semiconductor engineering. The method provides interesting and important information that cannot be obtained with conventional methods. This paper explains its theoretical background, important points for practical use, and application results.	3d film;design of experiments;principle of maximum entropy;remote desktop services;semiconductor	Yoshiki Yonamoto	2013	Entropy	10.3390/e15051663	nanotechnology;trap	ML	92.20062899548923	-15.069436626611811	139375

Here, we study the kinetics of charge trapping in the InGaAs/Al2O3/HfO2 gate-stack using Capture and Emission Time (CET) maps. The existence of two oxide defect bands, respectively above and below the conduction band of InGaAs, is implied by sensing charge trapping at positive and negative oxide electric fields. Within each band, two distinct populations of defect states are observed. The first defect population with relatively higher capture and emission energy barriers is found to affect the long term reliability of the device since the charge trapping in these defect states is slow, while the second population with relatively smaller capture and emission energy barriers affects the device stability particularly under high frequency operation. We argue that it is essential to characterize and study both defect populations in order to accurately estimate device lifetime under different operating applications.	bands;cephalothin;elegant degradation;gate oxide;kinetics internet protocol;map;population;small;software bug	V.

Herein, we propose an impedance biosensor using new kinds of screen-printed interdigitated microelectrodes (SPIMs) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for signal amplification to detect E. coli O157:H7 with high sensitivity and time-efficiency. The SPIMs integrate the high sensitivity and short response time of the interdigitated electrodes and the low cost of the screen-printed electrodes. Self-assembling of bi-functional 3-dithiobis-(sulfosuccinimidyl-propionate) (DTSP) on the SPIMs was investigated and was proved to be able to improve adsorption quantity and stability of biomaterials. WGA was further adopted to enhance the signal taking advantage of the abundant lectin-binding sites on the bacteria surface. The immunosensor exhibited a detection limit of 102 cfu·mL(-1), with a linear detection range from 10(2) to 10(7) cfu·mL(-1) (r2 = 0.98). The total detection time was less than 1 h, showing its comparable sensitivity and rapid response. Furthermore, the low cost of one SPIM significantly reduced the detection cost of the biosensor. The biosensor may have great promise in food safety analysis and lead to a portable biosensing system for routine monitoring of foodborne pathogens.	agglutinins;amplifier;binding sites;biomaterials;cardiography, impedance;characteristic impedance;entity name part qualifier - adopted;escherichia coli infections;escherichia coli o157-h7;gene amplification technique;hazard analysis and critical control points;lectin;monumenta germaniae historica;nominal impedance;output impedance;pathogenic organism;printing;propionate;quantitative impedance;response time (technology);spim;self-assembled monolayer;sensitivity and specificity;whole genome amplification;dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate);electrode	Zhanming Li;Yingchun Fu;Weihuan Fang;Yanbin Li	2015		10.3390/s150819212	computer simulation;microelectrode;computer science;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology	AI	95.97696439646911	-18.48342986490792	139644

A formulation for the flexural vibrations of a composite drive shaft mounted on viscoelastic supports including shear effects is developed. In particular, an analytic stability criterion is developed to ensure the integrity of the system in the supercritical regime. Then it is shown that the torsional strength can be computed with the maximum stress criterion. A shell method is developed for computing drive shaft torsional buckling. The optimisation of a helicopter tail rotor driveline is then performed. In particular, original hybrid shafts consisting of high-modulus and high-strength carbon fibre reinforced epoxy plies were studied. The solutions obtained using the method presented here made it possible to greatly decrease the number of shafts and the weight of the driveline under subcritical conditions, and even more under supercritical conditions. This study yielded some general rules for designing an optimum composite shaft without any need for optimisation algorithms.	analytical engine;buckling;cylinder seal;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;modulus robot;optical fiber;ply (game theory);r.o.t.o.r.;software release life cycle;stacking;stiffness matrix	Olivier Montagnier;Christian Hochard	2011	CoRR	10.1016/j.matdes.2012.09.035	materials science;structural engineering;drive shaft;composite material;forensic engineering;physics	Robotics	84.72322150566556	-13.949704085872423	139737

806be2ba1a21df24f6667d0b8a657d73b4f77d57	modeling and simulation of milling processes including process damping effects		Especially in high speed milling of aluminum alloys in the aviation industry, chamfered milling tools have proven themselves. Due to the chamfer, an extended contact between the tool and the workpiece at the flank face is evoked, which leads to additional process damping forces opposed to tool vibrations. Hence, the cutting process shows improved stability characteristics. This article presents an approach for the identification and modeling of these process damping effects in transient milling simulations. For this purpose, a simulationand experiment-based procedure for the identification of required simulation parameters depending on the tool chamfer geometry is introduced and evaluated. Finally, the identified parameters are used for transient simulations of milling processes with extended stability due to the tool chamfer. The suitability of the proposed identification method and simulation model for milling with process damping is finally proved by a comparison between simulations and experiments.	algorithm;chamfer;coefficient;experiment;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;neural oscillation;simulation;transient state	Berend Denkena;Wladimir Bickel;Rafał Grabowski	2014	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-014-0544-0	structural engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	82.93262527354061	-12.938022669795497	140112

Using MEMS technology, an “Au, Pt, Pt” three-microelectrode system enclosed in a SU-8 micro pool was fabricated. Employing SAMs, a monolayer of protein A was immobilized on the cysteamine modified Au electrode to achieve the orientation-controlled immobilization of the human immunoglobulin (HIgG) antibody. The immunosensor aimed at low unit cost, small dimension, high level of integration and the prospect of a biosensor system-on-a-chip. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were conducted to characterize the immunosensor. Compared with the traditional immunosensor using bulky gold electrode or screen-printed electrode and the procedure directly binding protein A to electrode for immobilization of antibodies, it had attractive advantages, such as miniaturization, compatibility with CMOS technology, fast response (30 s), broad linear range (50–400 µg/L) and low detection limit (10 μg/L) for HIgG. In addition, this immunosensor was easy to be designed into micro array and to realize the simultaneously multi-parameter detection.	binary prefix;cmos;high-level programming language;immobiliser;microarray;microelectromechanical systems;printing;response time (technology);self-assembled monolayer;sensor;system on a chip	Yuanyuan Xu;Shanhong Xia;Chao Bian;Shaofeng Chen	2006	Science in China Series F	10.1007/s11432-006-0397-z	system on a chip;detection limit;computer science;self-assembled monolayer;antibody;binding protein	EDA	95.01266841749461	-17.753061885562733	140210

In this study, we examined the relationship between the CPA value due to an acidic bitter substance and the amount of the bitter substance adsorbed onto lipid/polymer membranes, which contain different lipid contents, used in the taste sensor. We used iso-α-acid which is an acidic bitter substance found in several foods and beverages. The amount of adsorbed iso-α-acid, which was determined by spectroscopy, showed a maximum at the lipid concentration 0.1 wt % of the membrane, and the same phenomenon was observed for the CPA value. At the higher lipid concentration, however, the amount adsorbed decreased and then remained constant, while the CPA value decreased monotonically to zero. This constant adsorption amount was observed when the membrane potential in the reference solution did not change with increasing lipid concentration. The decrease in CPA value in spite of the constant adsorption amount is caused by a decrease in the sensitivity of the membrane as the surface charge density increases. The reason why the peaks appeared in both the CPA value and adsorption amount is based on the contradictory adsorption properties of iso-α-acid. The increasing charged lipid concentration of the membrane causes an increasing electrostatic attractive interaction between iso-α-acid and the membrane, but simultaneously causes a decreasing hydrophobic interaction that results in decreasing adsorption of iso-α-acid, which also has hydrophobic properties, onto the membrane. Estimates of the amount of adsorption suggest that iso-α-acid molecules are adsorbed onto both the surface and interior of the membrane.	acids;arabic numeral 0;beverages;charge (electrical);cost per action;cyproterone acetate;estimated;food;interaction;membrane potentials;n(6)-cyclopentyladenosine;polymer;tissue membrane;contents - htmllinktype;sensor (device);substance	Kiyoshi Toko;Daichi Hara;Yusuke Tahara;Masato Yasuura;Hidekazu Ikezaki	2014		10.3390/s140916274	biochemistry;chemistry;electronic tongue;bioinformatics;nanotechnology	HCI	95.56843394974202	-16.69862253594743	140212

b1bf3db20bc5d2c8150decf7743c28fcd01c9236	characterization of a novel carbonized foam electrode for wearable bio-potential recording		A novel dry disposable electrode using carbonized foam as conductive material is presented. The conductive material is flexible and the manufacturing of it is inexpensive. In this paper, the preparation of the conductive material and the electrical properties of the electrode are investigated. A test protocol is designed to compare the in-vitro impedance, skin-electrode interface and the signal quality of the proposed electrode with that of the wet Ag/AgCl electrode. Experimental results reveal that the carbonized foam has good flexibility and conductivity. The proposed electrode can acquire ECG signal of promising signal quality when compared with Ag/AgCl electrode in the case of static and motion. Furthermore, raw data with less power line interference was observed by proposed electrodes without noise suppression circuits or algorithms. All these make the novel electrode a promising candidate for wearable bio-potential recording.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;characteristic impedance;interference (communication);wearable computer;zero suppression	Hongyu Chen;Yuting Zhao;Zhenning Mei;Yongfeng Mei;Sidarto Bambang Oetomo;Wei Chen	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	10.1109/BSN.2018.8329686	raw data;embedded system;electric potential;electrode;computer science;electronic circuit;wearable computer;conductivity;electrical impedance;electrical conductor;electronic engineering	Robotics	92.47875390952045	-20.81491069123668	140321

Interferences and gaps can be found when the parts and subassemblies from those design groups are to be assembled. When rainwater enters the spaces between parts and there is not sufficient drainage, the rainwater within the structure can backflow to gaps or unexpected outlets, which may cause severe problems of part corrosion and electric shock. We have developed a method and a program to simulate backflow of rainwater within spaces between automotive parts; the method can find unexpected outlets and gaps. The developed program can simulate not only simple liquid flows, but also division and joining of flows with multiple channels.

However, the current techniques are mainly focusing on the cell culture on a flat plate, which environment is different from the in vivo. In this paper, we proposed a direct writing method for 3D cell assembly based on the electrode deposition of calcium alginate. Sodium alginate solution (1%) with suspended CaCO3 particles (0.2%) are prepared and put on ITO plate substrate. One tungsten probe and the ITO plate are used as the anode and cathode respectively. By applying voltage on the electrodes, the gel will be formed on the tungsten probe. Therefore, gel with arbitrary shape can be written directly by controlling the position the tungsten probe. The reaction speed is controlled by adjusting the current density. The current results show the gel line can be written successfully with the moveable anode.	cell (microprocessor);chemical vapor deposition;hebbian theory;indium tin oxide;thin plate spline;video-in video-out	Yajing Shen;Masahiro Nakajima;Chengzhi Hu;Tao Yue;Hirotaka Tajima;Toshio Fukuda	2012	2012 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2012.6492416	materials science;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology	EDA	94.0785371593119	-15.970196490736761	141131

The simple fabrication process, high quality signal recording and proper biocompatibility are the main advantages of platinum black microelectrodes. When microelectrodes are exposed to actual biological system, various physical stimuli are applied. However, the porous structure of platinum black is vulnerable to external stimuli and destroyed easily. The impedance level of the microelectrode increases when the microelectrodes are damaged resulting in decreased recording performance. In this study, we developed mechanically stable platinum black microelectrodes by adding polydopamine. The polydopamine layer was added between the platinum black structures by electrodeposition method. The initial impedance level of platinum black only microelectrodes and polydopamine added microelectrodes were similar but after applying ultrasonication the impedance value dramatically increased for platinum black only microelectrodes, whereas polydopamine added microelectrodes showed little increase which were nearly retained initial values. Polydopamine added platinum black microelectrodes are expected to extend the availability as neural sensors.	biological system;characteristic impedance;display resolution;dopamine;electroplating;microelectrodes;platinum;quantitative impedance;semiconductor device fabrication;sensor;polydopamine	Raeyoung Kim;Yoonkey Nam	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609468	microfabrication;electroplating;neuroscience;platinum;microelectrode;nanotechnology;neurophysiology;bio-mems;porous medium	SE	91.78338784075862	-17.12149662016616	141270

The DRAGONS system is designed to detect impacts caused by particles ranging from 50 μm to 1 mm at both low-earth and geostationary orbits. DRAGONS utilizes a combination of low-cost sensor technologies to facilitate accurate measurements and approximations of the size, velocity, and angle of impacting micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). Two thin layers of kapton sheets with resistive traces are used to detect the changes in resistance that are directly proportional to the impacting force caused by the fast-traveling particles. Four polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensors are positioned in the back of each kapton sheet to measure acoustic strain caused by an impact. The electronic hardware module that controls all operations employs a low-power, modular, and compact design that enables it to be installed as a low-resource load on a host satellite. Laboratory results demonstrate that in addition to having the ability to detect an impact event, the DRAGONS system can determine impact location, speed, and angle of impact with a mean error of 1.4 cm, 0.2 km/s, and 5°. The DRAGONS system could be deployed as an add-on subsystem of a payload to enable a real-time, in-depth study of the properties of MMOD.	acoustic cryptanalysis;add-ons for firefox;approximation;clinical decision support system;electronic hardware;excited state;field-programmable gate array;kapton;leo (computer);low-power broadcasting;molecular orbital;on-board data handling;payload (computing);power supply;real-time clock;real-time computing;remote graphics software;sensor;software deployment;static random-access memory;switch;system of measurement;tracing (software);velocity (software development);waits;watchdog timer	Michael A.

717f3e3b054db8d2e13b6b06943c06c3c029cdbe	magnetomotive displacement of the tympanic membrane using magnetic nanoparticles: toward enhancement of sound perception		Objective: A novel hearing-aid scheme using magnetomotive nanoparticles (MNPs) as transducers in the tympanic membrane (TM) is proposed, aiming to noninvasively and directly induce a modulated vibration on the TM. Methods: In this feasibility study, iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were applied on ex vivo rat TM tissues and allowed to diffuse over ∼2 h. Subsequently, magnetic force was exerted on the MNP-laden TM via a programmable electromagnetic solenoid to induce the magnetomotion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), along with its phase-sensitive measurement capabilities, was utilized to visualize and quantify the nanometer-scale vibrations generated on the TM tissues. Results: The magnetomotive displacements induced on the TM were significantly greater than the baseline vibration of the TM without MNPs. In addition to a pure frequency tone, a chirped excitation and the corresponding spectroscopic response were also successfully generated and obtained. Finally, visualization of volumetric TM dynamics was achieved.  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of magnetically inducing vibrations on TMs containing iron oxide nanoparticles, manipulating the amplitude and the frequency of the induced TM motions, and the capability of assessing the magnetomotive dynamics via OCT. Significance: The results demonstrated here suggest the potential use of this noninvasive magnetomotive approach in future hearing aid applications. OCT can be utilized to investigate the magnetomotive dynamics of the TM, which may either enhance sound perception or magnetically induce the perception of sound without the need for acoustic speech signals.	acoustic cryptanalysis;baseline (configuration management);body tissue;cobalt oxide nanoparticles;displacement mapping;excitation;hearing aids;imagery;iron(ii,iii) oxide;metal nanoparticles;microcom networking protocol;modulation;motion;solenoid device component;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, optical coherence;transducer;transducers;tympanic membrane structure;vibration - physical agent;video-in video-out;volumetric display;ferric oxide;physical hard work;tomography;viral capsid secondary envelopment	Pin-Chieh Huang;Eric J.

The development of new antibacterial agents is emergently required, though it is difficult due to the lack of methods to find new action mechanisms of antibacterial agents. High resolution imaging with material mapping is one of the good approaches to find new action mechanisms for antibacterial agents. We developed microfluidic liquid cell which visualizes cellular morphology and material distribution using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and refluxes cell culture medium without any liquid leakage inside the SEM. Further, a cell culture chamber inside the SEM was also developed and could maintain the cell cultural condition. The combination of the liquid cell and the chamber achieved the visualization of in-liquid objects under controlled environment by using SEM. As a demonstration, we observed that a couple of bubbles flew through a microchannel from an observation window of the liquid cell where an 80-nm-thick silicon nitride membrane was suspended.	electron;galaxy morphological classification;spectral leakage	Tadashi Ishida	2017	2017 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2017.8305261	microfluidics;analytical chemistry;cell;visualization;scanning electron microscope;silicon nitride;nanotechnology;microchannel;leakage (electronics);materials science;membrane	Visualization	94.37761770974436	-15.762993666500405	142231

In this study, a new low-cost estimator based on spatial wavelength averaging along the slow-time domain is presented while assessing its performance through gelatin-based inclusion and homogeneous phantoms. Results showed favorable estimation mean accuracy (93.8%) on the homogeneous phantoms at different concentrations. However, underestimation is present in stiffer inclusions with size smaller than the true wavelength of the interference pattern (83.4% mean accuracy). Still, the new approach's differentiation of stiffness allows rapid visualization of a tissue as a qualitative imaging technique. Moreover, the estimator results are suitable for further processing as a reference mask implemented in several shear wave speed estimators.	elastography;interference (communication);velocity (software development)	Eduardo A.

Here, the transducer is employed for the localization of broadband acoustic events corresponding to the propagation of guided elastic waves in an isotropic plate. The WS-FSAT records the plate response and defines the source location through a time-frequency analysis of the received signal. This is achieved by exploiting the frequency selective response of the transducer which directly maps the dominant component of the received signal to the direction of arrival of the incoming wave. This feature is the result of the spatial filtering effect produced by the characteristic shape of the sensing surface, which is designed in the wavenumber domain. Experiments are performed on a prototype fabricated on a polyvinylidene fluoride substrate mounted on an aluminum test plate. Tests are conducted for various source locations, and with multiple sources activated simultaneously. The results highlight the robustness of the proposed device, its good sensitivity and angular resolution, as well as the low complexity of hardware and signal processing. This paper suggests the WS-FSAT as an attractive solution for the detection of broadband acoustic events, such as impacts on structural substrates, and its potential use as part of active structural health monitoring systems based on pitch-catch or pulse-echo operations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;angularjs;direction of arrival;frequency analysis;graphical user interface;internationalization and localization;matlab;map;microfabrication;prototype;semiconductor device fabrication;sensitivity and specificity;signal processing;software propagation;super high material cd;time–frequency analysis;transducer	Emanuele Baravelli;Matteo Senesi;Massimo Ruzzene;Luca De Marchi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2013.2255992	electronic engineering;time–frequency analysis;acoustics;engineering;beam steering;optics;physics;quantum mechanics	Mobile	92.27826207128852	-21.66432189113214	142551

The device includes a fixed micromachined coil and a movable magnet mounted on a resonant polymeric structure. The characterization of the fabricated prototypes has allowed to observe the presence of non linear effects that lead to the appearance of hysteretic vibrational phenomenon. These effects are likely related to the mechanical characteristics of the polymeric membrane, and determine an additional dependence of vibration frequency on the excitation amplitude. Under such non linear conditions, power densities up to 40 muW/cm3 are obtained for devices working with low level excitation conditions similar to those present in domestic and office environment.	amplitude damping channel;hysteresis;microelectromechanical systems;tesla coil	Christophe Serre;A.

Two major drawbacks to its use are the very high pressure differences required across the compressor and the large efficiency losses associated with the throttling process. One of potential advantages of screw machines over other types of positive displacement machine is their ability to perform both the compression and expansion functions simultaneously, using only one pair of rotors. A further feature is the use of the rotors which seal on both contacting surfaces so that the same profile may be used both for the expander and the compressor sections. By using the same profile for both, the compressor and expander rotors can be machined or ground in a single cutting operation and then separated by machining a parting slot in them on completion of the lobe formation. Computational Fluid Dynamics and Structure Analysis are used in this paper for investigation of fluid and solid interaction in such machines.	acoustic lobing;companding;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer simulation;displacement mapping	Ahmed Kovacevic;Nikola Stosic;Ian K.

A mesoporous film of alternate layers of Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (bilayers), deposited onto an optical fibre was used. The sensing film behaves as a Fabry-Perot cavity of low-finesse where the absorption of water vapour changes the optical thickness and produces a change in reflection proportional to humidity. Methods: The mesoporous film was deposited upon the cleaved tip of an optical fibre using the layer-by-layer method. The sensor was calibrated in a bench model against a commercially available capacitive sensor. The sensitivity and response time were assessed in the range from 5 % relative humidity (RH) to 95%RH for different numbers of bilayers up to a maximum of nine. Results: The sensitivity increases with the number of bilayers deposited; sensitivity of 2.28 mV/%RH was obtained for nine bilayers. The time constant of the response was 1.13 s ± 0.30 s which is faster than the commercial device (measured as 158 s). After calibration, the optical fibre humidity sensor was utilised in a bench top study employing a mechanical ventilator. The fast response time enabled changes in humidity in individual breaths to be resolved. Conclusion: Optical fibre sensors have the potential to be used to monitor breath to breath humidity during ventilator care. Significance: Control of humidity is an essential part of critical respiratory care and the developed sensor provides a sensitive, compact and fast method of humidity monitoring.		Francisco U.

For this reason it has been widely adopted in robotics. In a previous work we presented a compliant skin system based on capacitive technology consisting of triangular modules interconnected to form a system of sensors that can be deployed on non-flat surfaces. This solution has been successfully adopted to cover various humanoid robots. The main limitation of this and all the approaches based on capacitive technology is that they require to embed a deformable dielectric layer (usually made using an elastomer) covered by a conductive layer. This complicates the production process considerably, introduces hysteresis and limits the durability of the sensors due to ageing and mechanical stress. In this paper we describe a novel solution in which the dielectric is made using a thin layer of 3D fabric which is glued to conductive and protective layers using techniques adopted in the clothing industry. As such, the sensor is easier to produce and has better mechanical properties. Furthermore, the sensor proposed in this paper embeds transducers for thermal compensation of the pressure measurements. We report experimental analysis that demonstrates that the sensor has good properties in terms of sensitivity and resolution. Remarkably we show that the sensor has very low hysteresis and effectively allows compensating drifts due to temperature variations.	durability (database systems);emoticon;flexible electronics;humanoid robot;hysteresis;repeatability;robotics;sensor;skin (computing);tactile sensor;thermal head;transducer	Perla Maiolino;Marco Maggiali;Giorgio Cannata;Giorgio Metta;Lorenzo Natale	2013	IEEE Sensors Journal	10.1109/JSEN.2013.2258149	control engineering;electronic engineering;transducer;hysteresis;pressure measurement;engineering;humanoid robot;electrical engineering;capacitive sensing;stress–strain analysis;thin film;sensitivity analysis;tactile sensor;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	89.12144593714528	-18.046291254431377	143307

The sensors fabricated in this study are planar ones with interdigitated electrodes of Au or Pt. The vanadium content of the utilized VWT is 1.5 or 3.0 wt%. The resistance of VWT decreases with an increasing SO(2) concentration in the range from 20 ppm to 5,000 ppm. The best sensor response to SO(2) occurs at 400 °C using Au electrodes. The sensor response value is independent on the amount of added vanadium but dependent on the electrode materials at 400 °C.

84696af7753d0c5879c61d9f1504dc0340ebfe12	capacitance behavior of composites for supercapacitor applications prepared with different durations of graphene/nanoneedle mno2 reduction		Article history: Received 25 September 2013 Received in revised form 5 November 2013 Accepted 11 November 2013 Available online 7 December 2013 Graphene/MnO2 composites were prepared by hydrazine hydrate-mediated reduction of graphene oxide (GO)/MnO2 at various reduction times to determine the optimal conditions for obtaining materials with excellent electrochemical performance. Variations in the oxygen-containing surface functional groups were observed as the reduction time was varied. These changes were found to affect the electrical conductivity and density of nanoneedle MnO2, which influence the surface area and significantly affect the supercapacitive performance of the composites. Morphological and microstructural characterizations of the as-prepared composites demonstrated that MnO2 was successfully formed on the GO surface and indicated the efficacy of hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent for GO. The capacitive properties of the graphene/MnO2 electrodes prepared at a reduction time of 28 h (rGO(28)/MnO2) exhibited a low sheet-resistance value as well as a high surface area, resulting in a GO/MnO2 composite with excellent electrochemical performance (371.74 F g 1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s ). It is anticipated that the formation of MnO2-based nanoneedles on GO surfaces by the demonstrated 28-h hydrazine-reduction protocol is a promising method for supercapacitor electrode fabrication. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

98f271c080ffcc1239c07e741d8d03f359309890	challenges of in-situ thermal characterization of thin-film isolation layers for printed electronics		The growing miniaturization of electronic components increases the local heat emission per unit square and PCBs are a critical bottleneck in thermal terms. The integration of the electronic components into the heatsink material surface itself becomes a necessity. Therefore, electric isolation layers with a high thermal conductivity are needed. In this work, isolation layers were fabricated using plasma-electrolytic oxidized Al substrates. Since such layers are porous in general, a polyamide-imide resin was used to increase the electric breakdown voltage while simultaneously only minimal influences the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of the layers were quantified by use of a 3-omega measurement approach. A heating element structure was evaporated on the surface and a sinusoidal current was applied. The higher harmonics of the resulting voltage across the heater is an indication for the thermal conductivity of the isolation layer. The measurement approach was verified with a commercial available insulated metallic substrate and the fabricated layer system exhibits thermal conductivities of 2.4 W/(mK). Additionally, finite element method models were used to investigate the influence of complex heater geometries, such as constrictions and holes in the heating element that occur due to the rough surfaces.	electronic component;evaporation;finite element method;heat sink;plasma active;printed electronics;resin;rough set	Harald Steiner;Thilo Sauter;Marlies Schlauf;Thomas Schalkhammer;Roman Fuhringer;Dietmar Kieslinger	2018	2018 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433750	control engineering;heat sink;breakdown voltage;voltage;printed circuit board;engineering;conductivity;thin film;heating element;thermal conductivity;composite material	Arch	91.44419995829914	-14.845928840417896	143699
10c6909b0fa302ae6058bb368a1fdf9157a0f780	anodic bonding using gorilla glasses		For the first time, this paper investigates anodic bonding using the latest chemically-strengthened glass called Gorilla Glass (from Corning). Gorilla Glass has many excellent properties for MEMS/NEMS applications, including hardness (resistance to scratching), flexibility, high fracture toughness and antibacterial resistance. However, the high thermal expansion coefficient of Gorilla Glass (7.58ppm/°C) makes it doubtful for anodic bonding, where high temperature (200∼4000C) and high electrical field are applied to facilitate silicon to glass bonding. We show that the presence of the potassium ions at the surfaces of Gloria Glass not only makes the glass more resistant to damage but also facilitates the process of anodic bonding (including lower bonding temperature and voltage). With the proper cooling conditions, it is also feasible to develop silicon-glass microstructures based on the principle of stress engineering.	anodic bonding;coefficient;computer cooling;glass;microelectromechanical systems	ChingHung Hsu;Gui Chen;Yen-Heng Lin;Mark Ming-Cheng Cheng	2017	2017 IEEE 12th International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (NEMS)	10.1109/NEMS.2017.8017086	nanoelectromechanical systems;gorilla glass;microstructure;microelectromechanical systems;composite material;anodic bonding;thermal expansion;materials science;silicon;fracture toughness	Visualization	92.44659159752624	-14.878597473874207	143764
cc50c6ab648e7f3a5af7309fc8010b0f7d4a6f9f	self-reference refractive index sensor based on independently controlled double resonances in side-coupled u-shaped resonators	plasmon-induced transparency;plasmonic waveguide;refractive index sensor;surface plasmon polaritons	A plasmonic, refractive, index nanosensor is investigated theoretically and numerically in two U-shaped cavities side-coupled to a metal⁻dielectric⁻metal (MDM) waveguide. A transparency window between two transmission dips is observed. The physical origin of the transmission phenomenon is revealed by mapping the magnetic field distribution. Independent double resonances are realized through the proposed design. Double resonances showed diverse responses to the variations of the structural dimensions. In particular, they presented different dependences on a refraction index of the medium in an individual resonator. One resonance exhibited a remarkable shift with the increase of the refraction index; however, the other resonance remained unchanged. On the basis of this unique characteristic of differing sensitivities, self-reference sensing is discussed. The nanosensor yielded a high sensitivity of 917 nm/RIU and a figure of merit of 180 RIU−1. This work is helpful in terms of the design of on-chip optical sensors with high sensitivity and improved detection accuracy in complicated environments.	dimensions;magnetic fields;master data management;nanosensor;numerical analysis;palmoplantar keratosis;plasmon;resonance;resonator device component;self-reference;waveguide device component;sensor (device)	Xiaobin Ren;Kun Ren;Chengguo Ming	2018		10.3390/s18051376	plasmon;analytical chemistry;waveguide;engineering;surface plasmon polariton;refraction;resonance;refractive index;resonator;optics;phenomenon	Mobile	92.16899323349978	-14.721638663252815	143769

The focusing properties are examined both experimentally and numerically. The results confirm that a pinhole zone plate lens can be an alternative to a Fresnel lens. A smooth filtering effect is created in pinhole zone plate lenses, giving rise to a reduction of the side lobes around the principal focus associated with the conventional Fresnel zone plate lens. The manufacturing technique of the pinhole zone plate lens allows the designing and constructing of lenses for different focal lengths quickly and economically and without the need to drill new plates.	experiment;focal (programming language);lens (device);numerical analysis;pzp gene;lobe;pinhole	Constanza Rubio;Jose Miguel Fuster;Sergio Castiñeira-Ibáñez;Antonio Uris;Francisco Belmar;Pilar Candelas	2017		10.3390/s17071690	focal length;simple lens;side lobe;ultrasound;zone plate;engineering;cylindrical lens;optics;fresnel lens;lens (optics)	HCI	89.84223746475453	-15.373437769477654	144000

Current methods normally involve extraction of blood samples and counting of cells ex vivo, or the use of microscopy-based fluorescence in vivo flow cytometry. The goal of this work is to develop an instrument for non-invasively enumerating very rare circulating cells in small animals with diffuse light with several orders of magnitude sensitivity improvement versus current approaches. In this work, we describe the design of our system and show that single, fluorescent microspheres can be detected in limb-mimicking optical flow phantoms with varying optical properties chosen to simulate in vivo conditions. Further, we demonstrate single cell counting capabilities using fluorescently (Vybrant-DiD) labeled Jurkat and Multiple Myeloma cells. Ongoing work includes in vivo testing and characterization of our system in mice.	cell count;flow cytometry;fluorescence;microspheres;multiple myeloma;optical flow;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;quantitation;simulation;tracer;video-in video-out	Eric Zettergren;Dwayne Vickers;Judith Runnels;Charles P.

1daf056fc6879ebb8d4daf9a3264c3faa3fc85de	development of a rigid one-meter-side and cooled coil sensor at 77 k for magnetic resonance sounding to detect subsurface water sources	77 k;snr;coil sensor;magnetic resonance sounding	Magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) using the Earth's magnetic field is a noninvasive and on-site geophysical technique providing quantitative characteristics of aquifers in the subsurface. When the MRS technology is applied in a mine or tunnel for advance detecting the source of water that may cause disastrous accident, spatial constraints limit the size of coil sensor and thus lower the detection capability. In this paper, a coil sensor for detecting the weak MRS signal is designed and the signal to noise (SNR) for the coil sensor is analyzed and optimized. The coil sensor has a rigid structure and square size of 1 m for deploying in a narrow underground space and is cooled at a low temperature of 77 K for improving the SNR. A theoretical calculation and an experimental test in an electromagnetically shielded room (EMSR) show that the optimal design of coil sensor consists of an 80-turn coil and a low-current-noise preamplifier AD745. It has a field sensitivity of 0.17 fT / Hz in the EMSR at 77 K, which is superior to the low temperature Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (LT SQUID) that is the latest application in MRS and the cooled coil with a diameter of 9 cm when detecting the laboratory NMR signal in kHz range. In the field experiment above the Taipingchi Reservoir near Changchun in China, the cooled coil sensor (CCS) developed in this paper has successfully obtained a valid weak MRS signal in high noise environment. The field results showed that the quality of measured MRS signal at 77 K is significantly superior to that at 298 K and the SNR is improved up to three times. This property of CCS makes the MRS instrument more convenient and reliable in a constricted space underground engineering environment (e.g., a mine or a tunnel).	automatic sounding;chchd2 gene;coil gene;coil device component;cold temperature;diameter (qualifier value);etoposide/ifosfamide/mesna/mitoxantrone;hertz (hz);image noise;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;kilohertz;level of measurement;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;minimal recursion semantics;muscle rigidity;operating tables;optimal design;preamplifier device component;quantum;reservoir device component;sting;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;status epilepticus;tesla coil;transmitter device component;tunneling protocol;sensor (device);voltage	Jun Lin;Guanfeng Du;Jiang Zhang;Xiao-Feng Yi;Chuan-Dong Jiang;Tingting Lin	2017		10.3390/s17061362	engineering;electronic engineering;squid;electromagnetic coil;magnetic field;preamplifier;nuclear magnetic resonance;field experiment;search coil;shielded cable;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	93.07516381290841	-21.004308658998706	145020

Based on the linear relationship between the TOF of a guided wave and temperature, analyses show that the TOF of the baseline signal can be compensated by the temperature measurement of the inspected materials without estimating the temperature compensation parameters. The inversion is based on the optimization of the TOF misfit function between the inspected and compensated baseline TOFs of the guided waves, and is applied by the elastic net penalty approach to perform thickness change mapping in a structural health monitoring (SHM) application. Experiments that are conducted in isotropic plates by piezoelectric sensors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. According to the results, our approach not only eliminates the artefacts that are caused by a temperature variation from 25 °C to 70 °C but also provides more accurate and clearer imaging of damage than conventional ray tomography methods.	baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);ct scan;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);correctness (computer science);elastic net regularization;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;estimated;experiment;isotropic position;mathematical optimization;morphologic artifacts;natural science disciplines;optimization problem;piezoelectricity;super high material cd;thickness (graph theory);tomography;waveform;x-ray computed tomography;funding grant;sensor (device);spiromustine	Dan Li;Ming Shi;Feng Xu;Chengcheng Liu;Jianqiu Zhang;Dean Ta	2018		10.3390/s18103518	analytical chemistry;piezoelectric sensor;electronic engineering;tomography;engineering;guided wave testing	Vision	92.2279039324233	-22.355763369009562	145210

The operation of the mobile Hall sensor array system is based on the principle of magnetic flux leakage to describe the shape of the ferromagnetic material. Two permanent magnets are used to generate the magnetic flux flow. The distribution of magnetic flux is perturbed as the ferromagnetic material is brought near the permanent magnets and the changes in magnetic flux distribution are detected by the 1-D array of the Hall sensor array setup. The process for magnetic imaging of the magnetic flux distribution is done by a signal processing unit before it displays the real time images using a netbook. A signal processing application software is developed for the 1-D Hall sensor array signal acquisition and processing to construct a 2-D array matrix. The processed 1-D Hall sensor array signals are later used to construct the magnetic image of ferromagnetic material based on the voltage signal and the magnetic flux distribution. The experimental results illustrate how the shape of specimens such as square, round and triangle shapes is determined through magnetic images based on the voltage signal and magnetic flux distribution of the specimen. In addition, the magnetic images of actual ferromagnetic objects are also illustrated to prove the functionality of mobile Hall sensor array system for actual shape detection. The results prove that the mobile Hall sensor array system is able to perform magnetic imaging in identifying various ferromagnetic materials.	biological specimen;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;dimensions;displacement mapping;embedded system;embedding;experiment;extravasation;fast flux;ferrous;flux;hall effect sensor;image processing;image sensor format;magnet <device>;magnet device component;malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia;netbook;physical object;preparation;psychologic displacement;signal processing;spectral leakage;thickness (graph theory);walls of a building;algorithm;sensor (device);voltage;width	Norhisam Misron;N.

Recently, to solve the problem, fabrication of sample group which can be evaluated efficiently and high throughput evaluation using MEMS are studied by integrating MEMS and combinatorial technology. In this report, high throughput evaluation using integration of MEMS technology and combinatorial technology including recent research is introduced. Combinatorial arc plasma deposition (CAPD) was applied to deposit for compositionally-graded thin film. The deposited thin film was separated into 1,089 samples (thin film library) by lift-off process, and the thickness, composition and phase of each sample was evaluated without detaching them from the library. For evaluation of the library, various novel methods are studied. MEMS process and technology are applied to fabricate and evaluate of the samples. Customized library for measurement of crystallization temperature and high frequency fatigue test method are introduced.	cgal;chemical vapor deposition;gnu nano;lift-off (microtechnology);microelectromechanical systems;plasma active;thickness (graph theory);throughput	Seiichi Hata	2012	2012 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2012.6492388	materials science;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology	Arch	93.2518836343908	-16.97875761953032	145340
2f30b31ac9b6d878ffcf76bfb8fb37c1e538869d	cmos scaling beyond the 100-nm node with silicon-dioxide-based gate dielectrics	theoretical framework;temperature dependence	The limitations of reliability of silicon dioxide dielectric for future CMOS scaling are investigated. Several critical aspects are examined, and new experimental results are used to form an empirical approach to a theoretical framework upon which the data is interpreted. Experimental data over a wide range of oxide thickness (TOX), voltage, and temperature were gathered using structures with a wide range of gate-oxide areas, and over very long stress times. This work resolves seemingly contradictory observations regarding the temperature dependence of oxide breakdown. On the basis of these results, a unified, global picture of oxide breakdown is constructed, and the resulting model is applied to project reliability limits for the wear-out of silicon dioxide. It is concluded that silicon-dioxide-based materials can provide a reliable gate dielectric, even to a thickness of 1 nm, and that CMOS scaling may well be viable to the 50-nm-technology node using silicon-dioxide-based gate insulators.	cmos;coherence (physics);gate dielectric;gate oxide;image scaling;linear equation;percolation;semiconductor device fabrication;software bug;thickness (graph theory)	Ernest Y.

Vibration measurement is a non-destructive method for diagnosing the failure of structures by assessing natural frequencies and other vibration patterns. The hetero-core fiber optic sensor utilized in the proposed accelerometer can serve as a displacement sensor with robustness to temperature changes, in addition to immunity to electromagnetic interference and chemical corrosions. Thus, the hetero-core sensor inside the accelerometer measures applied acceleration by detecting the rotation of an internal pendulum. A series of experiments showed that the hetero-core fiber sensor linearly responded to the rotation angle of the pendulum ranging within (-6°, 4°), and furthermore the proposed accelerometer could reproduce the waveform of input vibration in a frequency band of several Hz order.	corrosion;displacement mapping;experiment;fiber optic technology;fiber optic sensor;frequency band;hertz (hz);interference (communication);optical fiber;optics;passive optical network;psychologic displacement;tissue fiber;waveform;accelerometers;cellular targeting	Hiroshi Yamazaki;Ichiro Kurose;Michiko Nishiyama;Kazuhiro Watanabe	2018		10.3390/s18082528	electronic engineering;optical fiber;fiber optic sensor;accelerometer;structural health monitoring;pendulum;low frequency;engineering;vibration	Mobile	91.78355627472672	-20.633405575788565	145397

The observed decrease in the on-state current is directly related to the mobility of a damaged region extended over a length of about 0.53 lm beside the drain, which is evaluated through analysis of the transfer characteristics at low drain voltage. The mobility degradation in the damaged region is due to the formation of traps located near the polysilicon/gate oxide interface as evidenced by the 1/f noise measurements. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Though resistance thermometers can routinely measure industrial temperatures with uncertainties of 10 mK, they are sensitive to mechanical shock which causes the sensor resistance to drift over time requiring frequent off-line, expensive, and time consuming calibrations. These fundamental limitations of resistance thermometry have produced considerable interest in developing photonic temperature sensors to leverage advances in frequency metrology and to achieve greater mechanical and environmental stability. We are developing a suite of photonic devices that leverage advances in microwave and C-band light sources to fabricate cost-effective photonic temperature sensors. Our preliminary results indicate that using photonic devices such as the ring resonator we can measure short term temperature fluctuations of 80 μK at room temperature. Photonic sensor technology provides a low cost, lightweight, portable and electromagnetic interference (EMI) resistant solution which can be deployed in a wide variety of settings ranging from controlled laboratory conditions, a noisy factory floor, advanced manufacturing, to the variable environment of a residential setting.	emi;interference (communication);microwave;online and offline;sensor;tamper resistance	Zeeshan Ahmed;Gregory Strouse	2014	2014 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)	10.1109/ISSNIP.2014.6827616	materials science;electronic engineering;optoelectronics;optics	Robotics	92.09546200040106	-20.46386736076042	145766

The continuity and Navier-Stokes equations with the k- turbulence model and standard wall functions were used. The effects of the wall roughness height, impeller blade height and diffuser vane height, and the number of diffuser vanes on the performances of the first pump stage were analyzed. The results achieved demonstrate that the selected parameters affect the pump stage head, brake horsepower and efficiency in a strong yet different manner. To validate the approach developed, the results of the numerical simulations were compared with the experimental results.	angularjs;centrifugal governor;computer simulation;handbrake;holography;integrated circuit layout design protection;multistage amplifier;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;performance;radial (radio);scott continuity;turbulence kinetic energy;turbulence modeling;velocity (software development);volumetric display	Nicolas La Roche-Carrier;Guyh Dituba Ngoma;Walid Ghie	2013		10.5220/0004486903610368	centrifugal pump	AI	86.59328843292384	-10.858709673762068	146140

The measurement of glucose and sodium ion levels in the hydrogel is required for estimating glucose levels in blood; therefore, we developed a small, enzyme-fixed glucose sensor with a high-selectivity, all-solid-state, sodium ion-selective electrode (ISE) integrated into its design. The glucose sensor immobilized glucose oxidase showed a good correlation between the glucose levels in the hydrogels and the reference glucose levels (r > 0.99), and exhibited a good precision (coefficient of variation = 2.9%, 0.6 mg/dL). In the design of the sodium ISEs, we used the insertion material Na0.33MnO2 as the inner contact layer and DD16C5 exhibiting high Na+/K+ selectivity as the ionophore. The developed sodium ISE exhibited high selectivity ( logkNa,K pot = −2.8) and good potential stability. The sodium ISE could measure 0.4 mM (10−3.4 M) sodium ion levels in the hydrogels containing 268 mM (10−0.57 M) KCl.

To move from the gigaseal cell-attached configuration to whole-cell recording, suction is applied inside the pipette. We have designed and developed a novel “Pushpen patch-clamp electrode,” in which a W wire insulated and wound with Ag/AgCl wire can move linearly inside the pipette. The W wire has a conical tip, which can protrude from the pipette tip like a push pen, a procedure we call the “Pushpen Operation.” We use the Pushpen operation to impale the cell membrane in cell-attached configuration to go whole cell without disruption of the gigaseal. We successfully recorded whole-cell currents from Chinese hamster ovarian cells expressing influenza A virus protein A/M2, after obtaining whole-cell configuration with the Pushpen operation. This novel method of achieving whole-cell configuration may have a higher success rate than the conventional patch-clamp technique.	cell (microprocessor);clamper (electronics);clamping (graphics);denial-of-service attack;murine sarcoma viruses;patch-clamp techniques;pipette (physical object);plasma membrane;series and parallel circuits;silver;stationary process;suction drainage;viral proteins;way to go	Samsoon Inayat;Yan Zhao;Donald R.

The process of inkjet printing is based on the emission of a fixed quantity of material in liquid phase, usually called ink, in the form of small drops, contained in a chamber through a nozzle. The emitted drop falls on a substrate, forming a pattern. The solidification of the liquid can occur through the evaporation of the solvent, chemical modifications (eg by cross-linking of polymers) or crystallization. Often post-processing treatments are required, such as thermal annealing or sintering. For the realization of the sensors, the nanocrystalline silver ink, which is a biocompatible ink, was chosen. The substrate is Kapton and several studies demonstrate its biocompatibility. A preliminary analysis of the material and its compatibility with the chosen printer, the description of the developed devices and finally the experimental results with the calculation of the relative Gauge Factor are reported. The research allowed to study, in a preliminary way, light, thin, flexible, inexpensive, and biocompatible sensors for applications inside the human body.	evaporation;ink cartridge;kapton;printer (computing);printing;sensor;simulated annealing;thermal grease;video post-processing	Michela Borghetti;Emilio Sardini;Mauro Serpelloni	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD14)	10.1109/SSD.2014.6808790	materials science;ceramic materials;nanotechnology	Mobile	92.46385825939721	-17.08423275520991	146693

For each layer, it is fabricated point by point along its contours of cross-sections. So it is necessary to generate process points one by one along the contours. In this paper, the contours of cross section of a model are supposed to be B-spline curves. An efficient algorithm is presented to generate process points for B spline curve. In the proposed algorithm, the parametric increment is adjusted based on the estimation bounds of second derivative.	approximation algorithm;b-spline;contour line;cross section (geometry);scott continuity;spline (mathematics)	Jin Jin Zheng;X.

This paper presents a numerical method for predicting the ITZ percolation threshold of concrete with elliptical aggregates. With the simulated mesostructure of concrete with periodic boundary conditions, the ITZ percolation threshold is determined by the forest fire algorithm. Based on the numerical results, the effects of various factors on the ITZ percolation threshold are evaluated in a quantitative manner. It is found that the ITZ percolation threshold increases with the increase of the aspect ratio and maximum diameter of elliptical aggregates, but decreases by increasing the ITZ thickness. It is also found that the aggregate gradation has a significant influence on the ITZ percolation threshold.	algorithm;percolation		2010		10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583736	materials science;ceramic materials;geotechnical engineering;composite material	DB	88.39060699961415	-11.078917211304342	146825

Continuous deflection devices (CDDs) can safely measure pavement deflection (or other related properties) while traveling at highway speed, which reduces traffic disruption. However, CDD measurements are contaminated with relatively high noise levels compared to stop-and-go devices such as the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD). The objective of this article is to evaluate the structural condition of pavement sections using Traffic Speed Deflectometer (TSD) deflection slope measurements. The authors use wavelet transform denoising to: (1) identify localized weak spots such as those that are caused by pavement reflection cracking; and (2) denoise deflection slope measurements to calculate the effective structural number of the pavement. Results show that failure to denoise deflection slope measurements can lead to calculated values that are highly variable (unstable). Attempting to filter these highly variable measurements can lead to erroneous results.	noise reduction;tsd;wavelet	Samer Wehbe Katicha;Gerardo Flintsch;James Bryce;Brian Ferne	2014	Comp.-Aided Civil and Infrastruct.

The mathematical model was based on magnetohydrodynamics and numerical results were obtained using a finite volume method. The magnetohydrodynamic characteristics with consideration of wall effect and skin effect were investigated. The results show that the blood flow is appreciably influenced by the application of the traveling magnetic field. The wall effect and skin effect reduce the eddy current greatly and thus lower the effective electromagnetic force and pressure head largely when the flow rate is constant.	butterfly effect;finite volume method;mathematical model;numerical analysis	Lingzhi Zhao;Yan Peng;Ciwen Sha	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098475	classical mechanics;magnetohydrodynamics;duct;pipe flow;compressible flow;magnetic field;electromagnetism;eddy current;blood flow;laminar flow;hemodynamics;skin effect;nuclear magnetic resonance;thermodynamics;physics	EDA	86.92978114025158	-10.767103818036468	147220

An influence of the transient and stationary stress induced leakage current on the FN current voltage characteristic could be observed, which can be explained by the trapping and detrapping of electrons using a simple energy band diagram.

Young's modulus is one of the fundamental parameters to design MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) components. Gold electroplated MEMS structures can be used to develop highly-sensitive MEMS sensors, such as accelerometers. With a resonant frequency method, we evaluate gold-electroplated Ti/Au cantilevers by varying both the length and the width. The experimental results showed that the Young's modulus was dependent on the width, and it was found that the Young's modulus increased with an increase in the width, which would be useful to design MEMS devices.	microelectromechanical systems;modulus robot;resonance;sensor	Hideaki Nakajima;Tso-Fu Mark Chang;Chun-Yi Chen;Toshifumi Konishi;Katsuyuki Machida;Hiroshi Toshiyoshi;Daisuke Yamane;Kazuya Masu;Masato Sone	2017	2017 IEEE 12th International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (NEMS)	10.1109/NEMS.2017.8017021	electroplating;cantilever;microelectromechanical systems;composite material;young's modulus;materials science	EDA	90.45392273600751	-17.8410757186198	147771

Transient thermo-mechanical analysis simulating the ingestion of cold and hot drinks was performed to determine the temperature distribution in the models of the teeth, followed by linear elastic stress analyses. The thermal loads were applied on the occlusal and lingual surfaces. Subsequently, coupled variation of the temperature and mastication loading was considered. The vertical loading was distributed at occlusal points, adding up to 180 N. Maximum stresses were verified in resin restoration under thermal loads. When studying coupled effect of mechanical loading with that arising from thermal effects, higher tensile stress values occurred in porcelain restorations, especially at the restoration–dentin interface. Regions of high tensile stress were detected and their possible clinical significance with respect to restoration damage and microleakage were discussed.	circuit restoration;dental porcelain;drink (dietary substance);esthetics (discipline);finite element analysis;occlusal surface of tooth;odontogenic tissue;resin;simulation;tongue	Tulimar P.

In the first molten bath reaction vessel, the carbonaceous material is thermally devolatilized. Part of the first melt from the first reaction vessel containing non-volatile constituents is passed to the second molten bath reaction vesel which contains a different melt at a higher temperature. The two melts are only partially soluble in each other so that they can be easily separated. Oxygen, air or oxides are charged to the second reaction vessel for gasifying residual quantities of carbon by oxidation. The first melt is returned to the first reaction vessel from the second reaction vessel. The melt in the first reaction vessel may comprise lead or zinc and be maintained at a temperature of 500 DEG C., while the melt in the second reaction vessel may comprise raw iron and be maintained at a temperature of 1200 DEG C.

Human health is always under a potential threat, including from biological warfare, due to these dangerous pathogens. The agricultural and food production chain consists of many steps such as harvesting, handling, processing, packaging, storage, distribution, preparation, and consumption. Each step is susceptible to threats of environmental contamination or failure to safeguard the processes. The production process can be controlled in the food and agricultural sector, where smart sensors can play a major role, ensuring greater food quality and safety by low cost, fast, reliable, and profitable methods of detection. Techniques for the detection of pathogens and toxins may vary in cost, size, and specificity, speed of response, sensitivity, and precision. Smart sensors can detect, analyse and quantify at molecular levels contents of different biological origin and ensure quality of foods against spiking with pesticides, fertilizers, dioxin, modified organisms, anti-nutrients, allergens, drugs and so on.

Different with the previous methods, we designed a mechanical amplification structure based on flexure hinges to amplify the micro/nano scale displacement and using strain gauges to convert the deformation into electrical signals. However, after the original displacement is amplified by amplification mechanism, the output electrical signal is still very weak. Measure the weak electrical signal effectively or not, will determine whether the sensor can achieve nanometer resolution. A signal conditioning and data acquisition system including hardware and software implementation which can effectively measure such weak signal is presented in this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the whole system, some correlative experiments have been made. The experiment results show that the sensor with this set of system can detect the displacement of the PZT actuator in micro/nano scale. In addition, the sensor we proposed has the characteristic of large range, high resolution, small size and low cost than other micro/nano displacement sensor.	amplifier;computer hardware;data acquisition;displacement mapping;experiment;gnu nano;image resolution;sensor	Hanyu Sun;Yong Yu;Renbing Chen;YunJian Ge	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723401	control engineering;electronic engineering;strain gauge;engineering;electrical engineering;data acquisition	Robotics	90.58374154560497	-19.184424179970705	148218

The microchannel PCHE was tested for Reynolds numbers in the range of 100‒850 varying the hot-side inlet temperature between 40 °C–50 °C while keeping the cold-side temperature fixed at 20 °C. It was found that the average heat transfer rate and heat transfer performance of the countercurrrent configuration were 6.8% and 10%‒15% higher, respectively, than those of the parallel flow. The average heat transfer rate, heat transfer performance and pressure drop increased with increasing Reynolds number in all experiments. Increasing inlet temperature did not affect the heat transfer performance while it slightly decreased the pressure drop in the experimental range considered. Empirical correlations have been developed for the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop factor as functions of the Reynolds number.	coefficient;experiment;printed circuit board;printing;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations	Jang-Won Seo;Yoon-Ho Kim;Dongseon Kim;Young-Don Choi;Kyu-Jung Lee	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17053438	micro heat exchanger;dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger;ntu method;microchannel;plate heat exchanger;heat spreader;film temperature;heat transfer coefficient;thermodynamics	HCI	87.97631187137434	-11.85952105861877	148504
5296b71b4a24c0fd2f2c97ec61f99c985f82d883	a specification methodology for the optimal layout of a 2-stage interconnect bus for massively parallel architectures		A braking device for the spool of a fishing rod is disclosed which contains two separate braking adjustments. The first braking adjustment adjusts the coarse breaking force. The second braking adjustment adjusts a finer braking force. The embodiment discribed uses two springs to bias braking boards to friction boards, the two springs being adjustable separately. The first spring is adjustable by varying the linear displacement of an adjusting cylinder which is threaded into a portion of the fishing spool apparatus. A second adjusting mechanism uses a cam with a varying radius pending on the location of the cam. This varying radius is biased against a leaf spring, thus varying the displacement of the one end of the lead spring depending on the location of the variable cam.

By utilizing nanotubes functionalized with the dendron methyl 3,5-di(methyltrigycoloxy)benzylic alcohol (IPEG), ultrasonic blending in the sol phase prior to gelation yields excellent dispersion characteristics of the nanotube phase. The glasses were densified by heating to 600 C yielding 80% of theoretical density with little change in the optical appearance or behavior. These materials exhibited intrinsic Rayleigh scattering, suggesting near ideal dispersion. Nonlinear optical transmission was observed for 1064 and 532 nm light suggesting that the matrix has a strong broad band coupling to the optical field. Such composites allow for a host of applications based on the novel confinement properties of carbon nanotubes in a robust inorganic host. 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The measurement system comprising of a charge-based front-end amplifier, which feeds subsequent stages for adjusting gain, offset voltage and filtering, uses a unique mechanical impulse wave as input signal. This signal is passed through an analogue-to-digital converter for digitisation before being transferred to a computer via a USB port using a microcontroller for signal processing. The system response, tested with a Bose Electroforce and a laser vibrometer, showed a linear response over the measurement range necessary for DSPU prevention and detection and thus it was confirmed that the described development can provide an accurate measurement system for DSPU.

505286b2632f52f54d91bcc065d82d4c3a37fb10	study of the effect of reflow time and temperature on cu-sn intermetallic compound layer reliability	intermetallic compound;mean time to failure;probability distribution function	In terms of various reflow time and temperature, an analysis of Cu–Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) layer reliability is presented in this paper. Temperature cycling test data reported in existing publications for the solder paste material of 63Sn/37Pb eutectic alloy is used to model the probability distribution functions of solder joint lifetime due to the IMC layer fatigue. The relationship of the IMC layer thickness as a function of reflow time and temperature is studied. A reliability and mean time to failure function of the IMC layer in terms of various reflow time and temperature are presented. Calculation suggests that to achieve a higher IMC layer reliability, a shorter reflow time and a lower reflow temperature should be used, while lowering reflow temperature may be more efficient than controlling reflow time. In general, a reflow temperature ranged by 240–280 C should be avoided. For a specified reliability goal, how to choose proper reflow time and temperature is discussed. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AE-3000 (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), which is a dielectric liquid and has a boiling point of 56 °C, was selected as a working fluid. A boiling surface was electrically grounded, and an electrode was placed above the boiling surface at various heights of 200-400 μm. The slits were made in the electrode, which had several hundred micro meters, so as to remove vapor bubbles from the boiling surface by electrostatic force. In this study, the effect of the electric field and of the electrode heights over the boiling heat transfer was investigated. As a result, the maximum heat flux showed 64 W/cm2 by the application of electric field of -5kV/mm, which was three times over pool boiling. The theoretical model exhibits the essential feature of the effect of electric field on the boiling heat transfer and shows good agreement with experimental results.	flux qubit;theory	Ichiro Kano	2013	2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2013.6682446	ceramic materials;nucleate boiling;chemistry;analytical chemistry;critical heat flux;thermodynamics	Robotics	91.37936827630381	-12.98245935597404	149108

a40aaac9b89c0ea2c7c5ce0bca9e6bce22bb03c5	a possible new system for the non-invasive assessment of thermal stress in continuous welded rails		This paper describes a new nondestructive evaluation method to measure the axial stress of thick beams with the aim of developing a new intelligent system to monitor continuous welded rails subjected to thermal stress. The method relies on the propagation of highly nonlinear solitary waves within a granular medium made of a monoperiodic chain of spherical particles. The hypothesis of the investigation is that, while one end of the chain is in contact with the rail or beam to be probed, a solitary wave is triggered in the chain and the amplitude and speed of the waves reflected at the chain/structure interface is affected by the axial stress. To verify this hypothesis a finite element model of thermally stressed beams was developed and coupled to a discrete finite element model able to predict the propagation of the solitary waves along a L-shaped granular medium. The models were validated experimentally and the results show that the amplitude and the time of flight of the reflected waves are a function of the axial stress. In the future, these findings may be used to develop a new intelligent sensing system to increase the safety or rail transportation.

One of the famous stress markers, cortisol, was detected using our method. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method with a twin sensor was used in this study. One channel detected stress marker corresponding to antigen-antibody interaction and the other channel was used as a reference to remove environmental influences. Although nonspecific adsorption was monitored on each channel, frequency difference between them was within a few Hz on the injection of sample solution. One determination cycle including regeneration step could be performed within 10 minutes. The system could detect the cortisol level from 0.1 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL. These results show that our system has a potential to check the daily feeding condition for cows in terms of animal welfare.

For comparison, the films are grown side by side at cryogenic (∼100 K) and at room temperature (∼300 K) by e-beam evaporation. Based on the observed structural differences, it was hypothesized that the cryogenic OAD silver films should show an increased surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensitivity. COMSOL simulation results are presented to validate this hypothesis. Experimental SERS results of 4-aminobenzenethiol (4-ABT) Raman test probe molecules in vapor phase show good agreement with the simulation and indicate promising SERS applications for these nanostructured thin films.	3d film;brewster's angle;chemical vapor deposition;evaporation;finite element method;mathematical morphology;metal (api);oblique projection;plasmon;raman scattering;simulation	Piyush Shah;Dongquan Ju;Xiaoxu Niu;Andrew M.

The experimental results focus on optimizing the thicknesses of the layer stack. The device operation relies on the polarization reversal of the HZO layer, while electron tunneling occurs through the dielectric layer. The ferroelectric response of the HZO shows high remanent polarization values and good endurance with only weak wake-up and fatigue behavior. Adding the additional dielectric tunneling layer, the device becomes operational as a ferroelectric tunnel junction in the nanoampere current range.

In dependence on the preparation conditions we obtained nanostructures containing an either ultra-thin single-crystalline Si quantum-well buried in single-crystalline oxide matrix with sharp interfaces or Si-nanocrystals (ncs) embedded into single-crystalline oxide layer. As an example, we demonstrate the growth of Si buried in Gd2O3 and the incorporation of epitaxial Si clusters into single-crystalline Gd2O3 on silicon as well as silicon carbide substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The leakage current of the obtained nanostructures exhibited negative differential resistance at lower temperatures. For structures containing Si-ncs a large hysteresis in capacitance–voltage measurements due to charging and discharging of the Si-ncs was obtained. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A modifier with local stenosis was developed. The luminal surface LDL concentration at the distal of stenosis was analyzed with numerical stimulation and was measured by confocal microscopy. ECs were incubated with low density lipoprotein(LDL). Then, ECs were exposed to shear stress(15dyn/cm2) and F-actin was examined by fluorescence staining. Numerical stimulation showed that the luminal surface LDL concentration was higher than the bulk concentration. The relative luminal surface LDL concentration varied with the velocity and degree of stenosis. The experimental detection result was very good agreement with the numerical analysis. After treated with LDL, F-actin reorganization was observed. Under flow, the adhesion and retention of ECs were negatively relative to LDL concentration. Therefore provided concentration polarization of LDL occurs at the distal end of stenosis, and in turn effect the adhesion of ECs under flow.	modifier key;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);velocity (software development)	Dang-heng Wei;Gui-xue Wang;Chao-jun Tang;Lu-shang Liu;Zuo Wang;Chao-ke Tang;Chang-geng Ruan	2009	2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305751	biochemistry;endothelial stem cell;shear stress;fluorescence;numerical analysis;microscopy;adhesion;confocal laser scanning microscopy;adhesive;nanotechnology;concentration polarization;stress;molecular biophysics	Robotics	97.23528728162664	-15.95661575234582	150319

The process of converting the biomass into useful energy is known as gasification. The implementation of gasification technology in remote areas needs more theoretical and experimental studies. Several models have been proposed to explain the geometrical parameters and the optimization of gasification process. Hence, the paper presents the numerical simulation of the gasifier using the speciestransport model in CFD by incorporating all the zones of the gasifier and the experimental studies are conducted on a 40 kW downdraft gasifier with rice husk (Oryza Sativa) available in remote villages situated in South India. The factors affecting the producer gas such as equivalence ratio, gas composition, higher heating value and the temperature distribution inside the gasifier have been studied. Both the studies established that the higher heating value and the producer gas composition are 5.19 MJ/N m with CO–22%, CH4–1.7%, CO2–8%, H2–13% and N2–40.1% respectively. Also, it is predicted that the zone temperatures are maximum when ER is 0.30. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This procedure utilizes a suction sweeper on the bottom of the tank. By administering a predetermined amount of food to the tank and measuring how much food is not eaten by the fish, it is possible to reduce the amount of excess food. In addition, by cleaning the tank immediately prior to feeding and prompt recovery of the excess food, it is possible to recycle excess food without suffering from contamination, bacterial degradation or other unhealthy effects.	simulation	Tim Schulze;Vasilios Alexiades;Xiaobing Feng	2008	J.

aedb167e220eda5393359e8b0ef137c5eb4e6d40	tcad study of dlc coatings for large-area high-power diodes		Abstract The most relevant transport features of doped diamond-like carbon (DLC) films have been implemented in a TCAD setup to provide a theoretical tool to assess the reliability expectations for high-voltage device passivation. Starting from the band structure and boundary conditions of a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) device, trap states in the bandgap have been used to determine the characteristics of differently doped DLC layers against experiments. The role of the DLC as a passivation layer on top of the bevel termination of a high-voltage diode has been studied and compared with experiments. The breakdown voltage is significantly influenced by the properties of the DLC as clearly explained by the TCAD simulation results.	diode;traffic collision avoidance system	Susanna Reggiani;L.

In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed sensor to perform high-sensitivity sensing in a variety of applications, the sensor has been used to measure the RI of binary liquid mixtures. Such measurements can accurately determine the salinity of salt water solutions, and detect the water content of adulterated alcoholic beverages. The largest sensitivity of the RI sensor that has been experimentally demonstrated is 3,119 nm per Refractive Index Units (RIU) for the RI range from 1.3160 to 1.3943. On the other hand, our results suggest that the sensitivity can be enhanced up to 3485.67 nm/RIU approximately for the same RI range.	alcoholic liver diseases;approximation algorithm;cladding (fiber optics);decompression sickness;exhibits as topic;experiment;fiber optic technology;fiber optic sensor;large;largest;liquid substance;numerical analysis;optic axis of a crystal;optical fiber;optics;passive optical network;preparation;programming computable functions;psyllium 14.2 mg/ml oral suspension;rs-232;redshift;refractive index;solutions;surface tension;tissue fiber;tor carding forum;mixture;sensor (device)	José R.

The schematic diagram of lateral pressure sensor is shown in Fig.1 which operating mechanism is based on transferring radial pressure into axial strain to induce Bragg wavelength shift with the sensitivity of 2.2×10-2Mpa-1, which is 10900 times higher than that of using a bare FBG.. For being used in water-level measurement, a sensitivity of 1.526×10-5 cm-1 is experimentally obtained with a very nice linear relationship between the center-wavelength shift and water level. For a temperature-independent differential pressure sensor, by extending the previous packaged-structure design, a temperature independent differential pressure sensor as shown in Fig.2 is based on two fiber Bragg gratings with the sensitivity of the differential pressure of 5.27×10-1 Mpa-1. This device can also be used measuring differential pressure and temperature simultaneously for applying in liquid level, liquid density or specific gravity detection.	cylinder seal;diagram;experiment;fractal dimension;lateral thinking;optical fiber cable;polymer;radial (radio);schematic;sensor	Wen-Fung Liu	2013	2013 6th IEEE/International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)	10.1109/ICAIT.2013.6621525	materials science;ceramic materials;electronic engineering;fiber optic sensor;optics;fiber bragg grating	Robotics	90.86975613962798	-19.06288380298296	151780

The microstructure and the development of the conductive phase were investigated by optical microscope, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder-diffraction analysis. Sheet resistivities and temperature coefficients of resistivity were measured as a function of firing temperature. The conductive phase of the PTC thermistor is based on a mixture of RuO2, CuO and ruthenate. Pb2Ru2O6.5 decomposes and the cubic-like CuO particle grows up to spinel-like particle during firing at temperature over 750 1C, while the sheet resistivities decrease from high values to a lowest values. & 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	coefficient;copper(ii) oxide;cubic function;electron;ptc integrity	Zhixiang Cai;Xiangyou Li;Qianwu Hu;Xiaoyan Zeng	2008	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2008.04.019	lithography;temperature coefficient;microstructure;optical microscope;optics;physics;quantum mechanics	AI	92.90193305703237	-11.829445017444721	152067

Certain polymers such as polyimide exhibit an electro-optic response, after appropriate doping and poling, that permits direct measurement of the internal fields with a laser probe. We have built MCM circuit structures using electro-optic polyimides for the dielectric layer. We report thermal, electrical, optical, and electro-optic properties for these dielectric layers. The optical properties of doped and poled polyimides make them attractive for building optical waveguides. We report results for poled polyimide use in both multiple layer structures and optical waveguide formation, and recommend processing guidelines. Further development of doped and poled polyimides may permit optical and electrical interlayers on the same thin-film MCM-D structure.	multi-chip module	Deborah M. Mechtel;Harry K. Charles;Arthur S.

The computer also receives signals representative of the fuel line pressure and the air pressure in a region adjacent one or more injectors and uses this in adjusting the supply of fuel to the injector(s) to obtain a predetermined constant pressure difference thereacross. A unique digital flow control valve may also be used to precisely adjust the air flow rate. The system eliminates automobile hesitation while satisfying the requirements of fuel economy and low emissions.

This probe is able to simultaneously measure temperature and one component of the electric field (e-field) in a continuous wave (CW) or in a pulsed regime. For this purpose, linearity, selectivity, and sensitivity measurements are performed in air and in a cuvette filled with a water solution. The media are exposed to 1800-MHz CW electromagnetic wave through a transverse electromagnetic cell. Numerical characterization is also performed using finite-difference time-domain simulations. The EO probe presents a dynamic range exceeding 70 dB. Selectivity up to 25 dB is measured, demonstrating the ability of the EO probe to measure one unique component of the e-field. The EO probe sensitivity is equal to 0.77 and to 0.18 V · m-1Hz-½, in the air and in the water solution, respectively. This millimeter-sized EO probe is particularly suited for the measurement of ultrawide bandwidth and high-voltage e-fields up to a few megavolts per meter.	bandwidth (signal processing);crystal oscillator;dynamic range;eo personal communicator;finite-difference time-domain method;frequency band;probe effect;radio frequency;selectivity (electronic);sensitivity and specificity;simulation;transverse wave;ultra-wideband	Pierre Jarrige;Nicolas Ticaud;Sophie Kohler;Rodney P.

Thus, in principle, solar energy could supply all the present and future energy needs of the world on a continuing basis. This makes it one of the most promising of the unconventional energy sources. In this study, the effect of longitudinal fins on heat absorbing media in air type solar collector is studied experimentally. In the solar air heater, the value of the heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and the air is low and this result in a lower efficiency ranging 40% to 50%, to overcome this problem, the surfaces are sometimes roughened or longitudinal fins are provided in the air flow passages. The addition of continuous longitudinal fins to the upper or bottom side of the absorber plate improves the heat transfer rate. This is desirable because it increases the overall efficiency of the air heater. Heat transfer is strongly base upon the area of contact of sun radiations, by using this criteria the maximum total radiation is collected and is used to heat the air by solar energy. By changing the collector tilt angle for at least three positions (as above 5°C and 10°C to the latitude angle) and checked the performance of the air heater, also the effect of varying air mass flow rate on the heat transfer is studied. It is found that effective heat transfer coefficient is maximum for the smallest pitch of the longitudinal fins, in addition the friction factor and pressure drops are found lowest with largest Reynolds number.	coefficient;experiment;microwave;profiling (computer programming);reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations	P.

Methods: We design a cavity resonator based wireless power transfer (WPT) system and utilize our previously developed optimal impedance matching methodology to achieve effective WPT performance for operating sophisticated implantable devices, made with miniature receive coils (<8 mm in diameter), within a large volume (dimensions: 60.96 cm × 60.96 cm × 30 cm). We provide unique cavity design and construction methods which maintains electromagnetic performance of the cavity while promoting its utility as a large animal husbandry environment. In addition, we develop a biaxial receive resonator system to address device orientation insensitivity within the cavity environment. Functionality is demonstrated with chronic experiments involving rats implanted with our custom designed bioelectric recording device. Results: We demonstrate an average powering fidelity of 93.53% over nine recording sessions across nine weeks, indicating nearly continuous device operation for a freely behaving rat within the large cavity resonator space. Conclusion: We have developed and demonstrated a cavity resonator based WPT system for long term experiments involving freely behaving small animals. Significance: This cavity resonator based WPT system offers an effective and simple method for wirelessly powering miniaturized devices implanted in freely moving small animals within the largest space.	animal assisted therapy;body cavities;characteristic impedance;coil device component;dental caries;diameter (qualifier value);dimensions;electron microscopy;experiment;housing, animal;impedance matching;implants;largest;modular programming;on-board data handling;power module device component;power semiconductor device;promotion (action);quantitative impedance;resonator device component;rodent;video-in video-out	Henry Mei;Kyle A.

The hydrothermally synthesized nanotubes have inner diameter of 70 nm and wall thickness 20 nm, on average. The nanotubes are hydrophilic due to oxygen groups attached on their wall surfaces. Segregated liquid inclusions contained in the nanotubes under high pressure can be mobilized by heating. A resistive heating stage is utilized to heat a thin membrane inside a nanotube, causing the membrane to evaporate slowly and eventually pinch off. Focused electron beam heating is employed as a second means of thermal stimulation, which results in localized heating. With the latter method, gas/liquid interface motion is observed inside the thin channel of a carbon nanotube. Experiments like the ones presented herein may help understand the dynamics of fluids contained in nanoscale channels.	electron	Almila G. Yazicioglu;Constantine M.

Owing to their unique localized surface plasmon resonance, well-defined metal nanostructures arrays could be used to develop applications in nano-photonics, nano-plasmonics, and nano-electronics. This article proposes an alternative pathway of a controllable approach to assemble and weld together the gold nanostructures. As a typical plasmonic nanostructure, the gold nanorods (Au NRs) was synthesized by the classical seed-mediated growth method. Based on the recognition of biomolecules through complementary DNA hybridization, we used DNA origami strategy for controllable assembly of Au NRs. Rectangular DNA origami as a template can induce the geometrically assembled of Au NRs. We designed and fabricated tip-to-tip Au NRs dimers on the DNA templates. Then,the follow-up formation of nanojunctions between assembled tip-to-tip Au NRs dimers Au NRs was conducted by irradiating infrared femtosecond pulses laser. The ability to coupling plasmonic nanostructures by assembly and nano-welding could be fundamental to developing novel optical properties and ensuring materials.	clinical use template;dna barcoding;dna microarray;drug delivery systems;follow-up report;gnu nano;gene regulatory network;gold sodium thiosulfate;information processing;maxima and minima;nanorods;nanostructured materials;nanotechnology;neoplasms;nucleic acid hybridization;photoelectric effect;photonics;robot welding;salvia miltiorrhiza;surface plasmon resonance;weld device component;welding occupations;standards characteristics	Yanting Liu;Yang Liu;Yajing Shen	2018	International Journal of Intelligent Robotics and Applications	10.1007/s41315-018-0074-6	plasmon;dna origami;surface plasmon resonance;artificial intelligence;computer vision;welding;nanostructure;nanotechnology;computer science;laser;nanorod	Robotics	94.94626811718328	-16.47096129592948	152940

CeSrO films have superior chemical stability, because of the decrease in reactiveness on surface due to their fluorite structure. The discharge voltage is 50 V lower than that of MgO films for a pure discharge gas of Ne/Xe = 85/15 at 60 kPa. However the topmost surface, monolayer, of the CeSrO film relevant to the discharge property is hardly recovered from the damage by CO2 impurity in discharge gas. We can expect that by pumping down to a sufficiently low CO2 partial pressure (lower than 1 × 10−3 Pa), PDP panels with very high efficiency are realized with CeSrO protective layer. key words: PDP, γ, protective layer, discharge, MgO	discharger;plasma display;pumping (computer systems)	Yasuhiro Yamauchi;Yusuke Fukui;Yosuke Honda;Michiko Okafuji;Masahiro Sakai;Mikihiko Nishitani;Yasushi Yamauchi	2012	IEICE Transactions		electrical engineering;forensic engineering;discharge	AI	91.37227871441847	-12.902532364179924	153002

The model simulates a linear array consisting of 128 PZT-5A crystals, a tungsten-epoxy backing layer, an Araldite matching layer, and a Perspex lens layer. The thickness of the crystal layer is chosen to simulate pulses centered at 4MHz.Themodel is used to investigate whether changes in the electromechanical properties of the individual transducer layers (backing layer, crystal layer, matching layer, and lens layer) have an effect on the simulated in-air reverberation image generated. Changes in the electromechanical properties are designed to simulate typicalmedical transducer faults such as crystal drop-out, lens delamination, and deterioration in piezoelectric efficiency. The simulations demonstrate that fault-related changes in transducer behaviour can be observed in the simulated in-air reverberation image pattern. This exploratory approach may help to provide insight into deterioration in transducer performance and help with early detection of faults.

A UV nanosecond laser was used to remove materials with determined size at certain point on the vibratory structure of the micro-gyroscope. The peak-peak voltage of the mode coupling error signal of the gyroscope prototype studied in this paper could be reduced from 3.52V to 0.082V. Furthermore, the zero-velocity output of the same gyroscope prototype was decreased from 244mV to 14mV after coarse trimming and fine trimming. Demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, this structural trimming by UV nanosecond laser is an effective way to reduce mode coupling error for improving the microgyroscope performance.	experiment;gyroscope;mode coupling;prototype;uv mapping;velocity (software development)	Songqi Hu;Hongjuan Cui;Kun He;Zhanqiang Hou;Peng Chen;Dingbang Xiao;Xuezhong Wu	2013	The 8th Annual IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2013.6559847	gyroscope;etching;nanotechnology;prototype;coupling;physics	Robotics	89.1277347384083	-17.839524474577683	153499

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to investigate the machining parameters affecting the SR. The result shows that pulse peak current, pulse-OFF time and wire feed are the significant parameters to minimise the surface roughness. The machined surfaces of HSS were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Taylor Hobson Talysurf Range to determine the surface roughness. The surface texture was found to have greater dependency on pulse peak current and pulse-OFF time.	mathematical optimization;taguchi methods	Kapil Kumar;Akshay Dvivedi;Sudhir Kumar	2011	IJMTM	10.1504/IJMTM.2011.046762	surface roughness;engineering;nanotechnology;electrical discharge machining;forensic engineering;scanning electron microscope;engineering drawing;metallurgy;statistics	Vision	86.92001570780292	-14.288372821364137	153616

d839a9d94e48932c769f6f20eb05b92aade87c96	joining by forming of piezoceramic macro-fiber arrays within micro-structured surfaces of aluminum sheets		Functional integration of smart materials in sheet metal enables lightweight composite parts which are enhanced by new functionalities. Locally integrated piezoceramic/metal composites consist of a prefabricated array of ten parallel piezoceramic macro-fibers with dimensions of 0.277 mm by 0.232 mm by 10 mm which are joined in micro-formed cavities within the surface of an aluminum sheet metal. By the use of joining by forming, the interference–fit, preload and form–fit of macro-fiber arrays are achieved in a single process step. The paper describes investigations of the joining by forming process in formal planned experiments using the design of experiments method. The influence of the dimensions and preparation of the joining partners, the maximum forming force and the velocity of the forming stamp are varied. The interference–fit and preload depend on the maximum forming force. In contrast, the quality of the form–fit is primarily related to the geometric dimensions and the forming force. Fiber fractures and incipient cracks are the major failure mechanisms during joining by forming of the macro-fibers. The number of cracks is significantly reduced by the use of lower die velocities, lower maximum joining forces and the introduction of additional geometric elements in the microstructure of the metal surface. Concluding, constraints with regard to the design of parts and the process are derived from the experiments.	piezoelectricity	Andreas Schubert;Volker Wittstock;Stephan F.

34c0cf2ed834dafb4e72eaacff4cf8afe87d4e49	an in-situ real-time optical fiber sensor based on surface plasmon resonance for monitoring the growth of tio2 thin films	fiber optic technology;surface plasmon resonance;equipment design;optical fibers;optical fiber sensor;titanium	An optical fiber sensor based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is proposed for monitoring the thickness of deposited nano-thin films. A side-polished multimode SPR optical fiber sensor with an 850 nm-LD is used as the transducing element for real-time monitoring of the deposited TiO2 thin films. The SPR optical fiber sensor was installed in the TiO2 sputtering system in order to measure the thickness of the deposited sample during TiO2 deposition. The SPR response declined in real-time in relation to the growth of the thickness of the TiO2 thin film. Our results show the same trend of the SPR response in real-time and in spectra taken before and after deposition. The SPR transmitted intensity changes by approximately 18.76% corresponding to 50 nm of deposited TiO2 thin film. We have shown that optical fiber sensors utilizing SPR have the potential for real-time monitoring of the SPR technology of nanometer film thickness. The compact size of the SPR fiber sensor enables it to be positioned inside the deposition chamber, and it could thus measure the film thickness directly in real-time. This technology also has potential application for monitoring the deposition of other materials. Moreover, in-situ real-time SPR optical fiber sensor technology is in inexpensive, disposable technique that has anti-interference properties, and the potential to enable on-line monitoring and monitoring of organic coatings.	3d film;fiber optic sensor;gnu nano;interference (communication);online and offline;optical fiber device component;physical vapor deposition;real-time clock;surface plasmon resonance;thickness (graph theory);tissue fiber;tree rearrangement;disease transmission;sensor (device)	Yu-Chia Tsao;Woo-Hu Tsai;Wen-Ching Shih;Mu-Shiang Wu	2013		10.3390/s130709513	telecommunications;analytical chemistry;optical fiber;fiber optic sensor;optics;physics	Embedded	94.00850586985653	-18.492467500665352	154248

The voltage was varied from DC 100 V to 160 V, the load current was fixed at 5 A constant, and the electromagnetic contactor was operated continuously up to 100,000 times. The experiments were carried out under the three operation modes which are classified by the arc discharge. As a result, the relation between the operation mode and contact resistance was clarified. When only a make arc was generated, the contact resistance was smallest. In addition, the contact resistance was not affected by the source voltage.	discharger	Kiyoshi Yoshida;Koichiro Sawa;Kenji Suzuki;Masaaki Watanabe	2012	IEICE Transactions		electric arc;engineering;electrical engineering;contact resistance;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;metallurgy;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	89.53572046621277	-12.449491676590247	154282

The reamer comprises a cylindrical forward portion joined to the front end of a conical rear portion, the rear portion tapering outwardly from its front end. The forward and rear portions have co-incident longitudinal axes and at least three cutting flutes extending continously on the forward and rear portions and which are unequally spaced about the longitudinal axes. In one embodiment the flutes are either aligned with or helical about the longitudinal axes; and furthermore are misindexed about the axes and therefore are unequally spaced apart. In another embodiment the flutes have different helix angles about the longitudinal axis. In other embodiments the cylindrical forward portion is eliminated leaving only the conical rear portion making a reamer suitable for enlarging holes having existing tapers.	benefield anechoic facility;pervasive informatics	Olivier Brousse;Gilles Sassatelli;Thierry Gil;Yoann Guillemenet;Michel Robert;François Grize;Eduardo Sanchez;Yann Thoma;Andres Upegui;Juan Manuel Moreno;Jordi Madrenas	2008			cylinder;geology;acoustics;reamer;conical surface;tapering;front and back ends	HCI	82.96621240732442	-19.97857632503276	154316

It can detect more than half of the periodic table of elements. And it is widely used in industry, agriculture, biology, chemistry, medicine, geology, hydrology, archeology, environmental protection and other fields. When measuring on low energy β-ray and low penetration α-ray with liquid scintillation analyzer, the number of its excitation photons is small. So, demand on the measuring instruments is very high.

Two sets of electrodes, alongside the tip, are used for parallel-plate type of electrostatic actuation of the 200 m long beam in the plane of the wafer. Another set of buried electrodes is aligned with the plate electrode at the free-standing tip and is used as a differential capacitor for the simultaneous detection of the displacement, with the purpose to determine the stability border and thus the pull-in voltage. The single-end clamping ensures that the pull-in voltage is insensitive to technology-induced stresses. A two-dimensional (2–D) energybased analytical model for the static pull-in is compared with measurements. Bifurcation diagrams are computed numerically, based on a local continuation method. Devices have been designed and fabricated in an epi-poly process. Measurements are in agreement with modeling and confirm a pull-in voltage in the 9.1–9.5 V range. Reproducibility is limited by hysteresis and charging of the dielectric layer in between the electrodes. The device can be operated in feedback or as a seesaw, by using the two sets of electrodes.	2d computer graphics;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;clamping (graphics);continuation;displacement mapping;epi info;hysteresis;lateral thinking;numerical analysis;pull-up resistor;voltage reference	Edmond Cretu;Luís Alexandre Rocha;Reinoud F.

Tests were conducted to study the running performances of diesel engines in the whole operating range. The law of variation of the exhaust energy rate under various engine operating conditions was also analyzed. A diesel engine-ORC combined system was designed, and relevant evaluation indexes proposed. The variation of the running performances of the combined system under various engine operating conditions was investigated. R245fa and R152a were selected as the components of the mixed working fluid. Thereafter, six kinds of mixed working fluids with different compositions were presented. The effects of mixed working fluids with different compositions on the running performances of the combined system were revealed. Results show that the running performances of the combined system can be improved effectively when mass fraction R152a in the mixed working fluid is high and the engine operates with high power. For the mixed working fluid M1 (R245fa/R152a, 0.1/0.9, by mass fraction), the net power output of the combined system reaches the maximum of 34.61 kW.

The aim of the setup is to take hyperspectral fluorescence images of viscous materials. Based on these images, fluorescent and non-fluorescent impurities in the viscous materials can be detected. For the illumination of the measurement object, a narrow-band high-power light-emitting diode (LED) with a center wavelength of 370 nm was used. The low-cost acquisition unit for the imaging consists of a linear variable filter (LVF) and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 2D sensor array. The translucent wavelength range of the LVF is from 400 nm to 700 nm. For the confirmation of the concept, static measurements of fluorescent viscous materials with a non-fluorescent impurity have been performed and analyzed. With the presented setup, measurement surfaces in the micrometer range can be provided. The measureable minimum particle size of the impurities is in the nanometer range. The recording rate for the measurements depends on the exposure time of the used CMOS 2D sensor array and has been found to be in the microsecond range.	cmos;common variable immunodeficiency;diode device component;fluorescence;immunoglobulin lambda-chains;magnetic resonance imaging;micron;oled;particle size;preparation;semiconductor;spectrometers;x-ray exposure time;confirmation - responselevel;metal oxide;wavelength	Patrik J.

The comparison between the analytical models and finite-element results shows that the simplified analytical model has similar accuracy as the analytical model accounting for all slots together. The influence of various design parameters, such as conductor layout, slot width, slot opening width, tooth-tip height, magnet pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio, and gap between tooth-tips and conductors, on the open-circuit AC winding loss is investigated. It shows that the open-circuit AC winding loss gradually decreases with the number of radial conductor layers if the number of circumferential layers is larger than 1, although the radial segmentation is ineffective when there is no circumferential segmentation. The loss decreases greatly when the number of circumferential layers changes from 1 to 2, but reduces slowly when the conductors are further circumferentially segmented.	analytical engine;federal enterprise architecture;mathematical model;nested context language;radial (radio);super paper mario;total loss	Liang Wu;Zi Qiang Zhu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2272284	electronic engineering;magnetic field;engineering;eddy current;electrical engineering;finite element method;engineering drawing;physics;quantum mechanics	Vision	86.8938125227286	-11.803297939511035	155214

When the mirror is in an inoperative state, the multi-function backing plate can be rotated so as to expose the spot or approach light. Various light pipe configurations enable transmission of light projected from a light source mounted to and behind the multi-function backing plate to project light through the light pipe externally to the mirror housing to provide an indicator light function.	bayesian inference in phylogeny;computational phylogenetics;computer;multi-core processor	Glauber Dias Gonçalves;Gesil Sampaio Amarante Segundo;Martha Ximena Torres Delgado	2009			performance improvement;inference;multi-core processor;acoustics;pattern recognition;computer science;bayesian probability;artificial intelligence	ML	87.22901999167112	-21.12356594593754	155234
31773c373e565d128f0efdda569a746d88e69008	design of a passive irrigation controller for efficient water use in low-income countries		Efficient irrigation water usage is vital for low-income countries to keep up with projected population and income growth. Current weather- and soil-moisture-based smart irrigation controllers are not easily transferable to the economic and technological context of low-income countries and small remote farms. This paper presents the design of a passive automated irrigation controller that uses standard PVC fittings locally available to our community partner in Nicaragua. The actuation of the valve in the controller is driven by the soil water tension (SWT) from unsaturated soil. The key components of the controller are a ceramic tip connected to a tube of water, a rubber membrane, and a piston that acts like a stopper for the irrigation. The piston length is designed with an initial deflection in the membrane, causing it to push back against the inlet to shut off irrigation. A model of the system composed of the Green-Ampt equation for soil-water dynamics, empirical data for the relationship between soil moisture and controller pressure, and finite element model of the membrane is used to design a controller. The initial system consists of a 2″ diameter rubber membrane and a 1″ diameter piston. The initial deflection is 1.6cm to create enough force to stop the irrigation until the SWT reaches −35kPa. The controller costs approximately $CDN130 with PVC parts purchased in Canada with retail prices. The cost is expected to drop when discounts from retail prices are actualized. The design has the potential to greatly reduce water usage in drip irrigation systems.	controller (computing);experiment;finite element method;irrigation informatics;security engineering;seeds (cellular automaton);shutdown (computing);spatial variability;standard widget toolkit;uncontrolled format string;vii	Anna Jiang;Amy M.

The rim of the goal is pivotally mounted to the backboard and held in place by means of a spring and fluid filled hydraulic piston-cylinder mechanism which are mounted between the backboard and the rim. A downward force on the rim is opposed primarily by a vertical coil spring surrounding the cylinder. The cylinder and spring are coaxial with the axis being substantially parallel to the plane of the backboard. The downward motion of the rim opens a valve in the piston-cylinder allowing the cylinder to be moved upwardly with the downward movement of the rim with substantially no hydraulic restrictions. When the rim begins its return to normal position under spring pressure, the valve is closed. The piston has a predetermined diameter smaller than the inside diameter of the cylinder. Expansion of the compressed spring forces the piston upwardly, with the space between the piston wall and cylinder wall creating a limited flow of the fluid so as to cushion and dampen the return of the rim to its normal position.

In the absence of an applied field, individual domains still exhibit Faraday rotation, though the bulk material does not. Using single mode fiber where the half power beam width is smaller in dimension than the magnetic domains of the material, individual magnetic domains of BIG samples are identified. A method for differentiating domains and determining domain alignment is presented. The Faraday rotation of individual domains is measured and reported.	domain engineering;faraday cage;faraday effect;iron man	Sasha Kemmet;Greg Bonett;Mani Mina;Robert J.

4b3c7401c87affd5e452925453161d38e6cbe39a	a high-sensitivity flexible eddy current array sensor for crack monitoring of welded structures under varying environment	crack detection;effects of stress and temperature variations;flexible eddy current array sensor;sensitivity;structural health monitoring	This paper develops a high-sensitivity flexible eddy current array (HS-FECA) sensor for crack monitoring of welded structures under varying environment. Firstly, effects of stress, temperature and crack on output signals of the traditional flexible eddy current array (FECA) sensor were investigated by experiments that show both stress and temperature have great influences on the crack monitoring performance of the sensor. A 3-D finite element model was established using Comsol AC/DC module to analyze the perturbation effects of crack on eddy currents and output signals of the sensor, which showed perturbation effect of cracks on eddy currents is reduced by the current loop when crack propagates. Then, the HS-FECA sensor was proposed to boost the sensitivity to cracks. Simulation results show that perturbation effect of cracks on eddy currents excited by the HS-FECA sensor gradually grows stronger when the crack propagates, resulting in much higher sensitivity to cracks. Experimental result further shows that the sensitivity of the new sensor is at least 19 times that of the original one. In addition, both stress and temperature variations have little effect on signals of the new sensor.	current loop;experiment;finite element method;fractional excretion of calcium;hs algorithm;protein array analysis;sensor;simulation	Tao Chen;Yuting He;Jinqiang Du	2018		10.3390/s18061780	electronic engineering;engineering;welding;eddy current	HCI	91.4658470657775	-19.530639126022752	156168

For instance, the needed selectivity can be sought by modifying some of the components required for the preparation of such membranes. In this study, a new class of materials -trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium based ionic liquids (ILs) were used to modify the properties of ion exchange membranes. We determined selectivity coefficients for iodide as model ion utilizing six phosphonium-based ILs and compared the selectivity with two classical plasticizers. The dielectric properties of membranes plasticized with ionic liquids and their response characteristics towards ten different anions were investigated using potentiometric and impedance measurements. In this large set of data, deviations of obtained selectivity coefficients from the well-established Hofmeister series were observed on many occasions thus indicating a multitude of applications for these ion-exchanging systems.	anions;characteristic impedance;coefficient;iodides;ion exchange;ionic liquids;ions;liquid substance;plasticizers;polymer;potentiometer;quantitative impedance;selectivity (electronic);tissue membrane;whole earth 'lectronic link	Lukasz Mendecki;Nicole Callan;Meghan Ahern;Benjamin Schazmann;Aleksandar Radu	2016		10.3390/s16071106	chromatography;selectivity;chemistry;ionic liquid;electrical engineering;organic chemistry;inorganic chemistry	AI	93.64305847813559	-17.45756894455569	156172

Visual inspections after bonding found nothing that would compromise the integrity of the structure.

965df87305220b8d9390d9258d7806495ff2f790	a highly selective sensor for cyanide in organic media and on solid surfaces	ir 786;near infrared fluorophores;anion sensing;optical sensors;cyanine dyes;article;chemical sensors;cyanide sensing	The application of IR 786 perchlorate (IR-786) as a selective optical sensor for cyanide anion in both organic solution (acetonitrile (MeCN), 100%) and solvent-free solid surfaces was demonstrated. In MeCN, IR-786 was selective to two anions in the following order: CN(-) > OH(-). A significant change in the characteristic dark green color of IR-786 in MeCN to yellow was observed as a result of nucleophilic addition of CN(-) to the fluorophore, i.e., formation of IR 786-(CN), which was also verified by a blue shift in the 775 nm absorbance peak to 430 nm. A distinct green fluorescence emission from the IR-786-(CN) in MeCN was also observed, which demonstrated the selectivity of IR-786 towards CN(-) in MeCN. Fluorescence emission studies of IR-786 showed that the lower detection limit and the sensitivity of IR-786 for CN(-) in MeCN was 0.5 μM and 0.5 to 8 μM, respectively. The potential use of IR-786 as a solvent-free solid state sensor for the selective sensing and monitoring of CN(-) in the environment was also demonstrated. On solvent-free solid state surfaces, the sensitivity of the IR-786 to CN(-) in water samples was in the range of 50-300 μM with minimal interference by OH(-).	anions;binary prefix;buffers;carbon;cyanides;dots per inch;dyes;emoticon;excitation;fluorescence;hydroxide ion;hydroxyl radical;ir-786;interference (communication);internet backbone;mobile device;near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy;probability;selectivity (electronic);sensor;solid-state drive;solochrome cyanine r;titration method;turing completeness;vertebral column;water;acetonitrile;mixture;perchlorate	Belygona Barare;Ilknur Babahan;Yousef M.

To monitor the indoor air quality, a portable and uncomplicated separation and sampling device is required. Here, we present the design of fine particles separation and sampling system which is based on air-microfluidic technology. We use the color polystyrene microspheres with different diameters to simulate the air fine particles. The microspheres are mixed up with clean air and then travel into the microfluidic chip through the inlet. Based on the principle of virtual impactor, fine particles with different size will separate in the chip and exit through the two different outlets respectively. Two filters are placed after the two outlets in order to collect the particles travelling through the micro-channels. In this paper, we demonstrate with numerical simulations and experimental tests of the separation based on virtual impactor. The experimental results match well with the simulations.

To overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods, a new approach for the dynamic measurement of ring gear strains using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the installation of FBGs is determined according to the analysis for the strain distribution of the ring gear. Secondly, the parameters of the FBG are determined in consideration of the accuracy and sensitivity of the measurement as well as the size of the ring gear. The strain measured by the FBG is then simulated under non-uniform strain field conditions. Thirdly, a dynamic measurement system is built and tested. Finally, the strains of the ring gear are measured in a planetary gearbox under normal and faulty conditions. The experimental results showed good agreement with the theoretical results in values, trends, and the fault features can be seen from the time domain of the measured strain signal, which proves that the proposed method is feasible for the measurement of the ring gear strains of planetary gearboxes.	fiber optic technology;fiber to the x;planetary scanner;simulation;system of measurement;tissue fiber	Hang Niu;Xiaodong Zhang;Chenggang Hou	2017		10.3390/s17122872	fiber bragg grating;engineering;electronic engineering;time domain;strain (chemistry);transmission (mechanics)	Metrics	91.28303422451671	-20.529892732798867	156683

The theory of water jet impact has been used to demonstrate the principle of removing material by exploiting the existence of a Rayleigh wave that excites the formation of surface cracks and the lateral outflow of water that extends the cracks and removes material. A mathematical model has been developed that predicts changes in the response characteristics of materials owing to an idealised representation of a finite jet of water impacting a plane surface. The analytical approach used is applicable to the first stages of impact where the compressibility of water in the droplet is significant. The predicted response characteristics are compared with experimental data generated using controlled water jet impacts produced by a specially constructed pulsed water jet machining centre. The predicted response of selected materials compare well with experimental data. The results presented in this paper illustrate the importance of using pulsed water jets as a way of machining materials in a non-traditional manner.	excited state;lateral thinking;mathematical model;rayleigh–ritz method	M.

36cf1e4b62eb4c1c9a0d714da0df4859f22f8758	preliminary study for the implementation of electrical capacitance volume tomography (ecvt) to display fruit content		There are some problems in the Indonesian fruit export that need a solution which is a non-destructive tool on fruit to distinguish the conditions of raw, ripe and rotten fruits. In this preliminary research, the first step is to measure the electrical characteristic which is the capacitance of fruit. The result shows, in general, the value of the capacitance decreases when frequency is enlarged. It also can be concluded that the differences in capacitance seen more clearly at high frequencies. On the use of multi channel ECVT scanner, the resulting image shows only the outside of the fruit, so it is difficult to distinguish the condition of each fruits. Further studies are to make a sensor that can wrap the fruit inside so that the inner of the fruit can be more clearly seen. The algorithm used for the image reconstruction in this research is Linear Back Projection (LBP).

Using this new process, the moving parts are """"recessed"""" in the substrate which can be packaged and handled easily compared to non-recessed structures. In the fabrication process, spin coated liquid photoresist is used. There is a common problem of thinning of photoresist on convex edges of the cavity during photolithography steps. As a result, silicon dioxide is etched away from these edges. During subsequent anisotropic etching of silicon to release the microstructures, the unprotected convex edges are also etched resulting in failure of the process. To overcome this problem, two different methods are used. In the first method, high viscosity positive photoresist (Shipley STR-1045) is used and the multiple coatings are carried out to cover the convex edges adequately. This protects the oxide on convex edges in buffered hydrofluoric acid. In the second method, standard low viscosity positive resist (Shipley 1400-27) and negative resist (E. Merck N60) are used and the convex edges are diffused heavily with boron (P).

Polymerization of acrylic acid was performed on the surface of a microchannel using an inline atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier microplasma technique. The surface treatment changes the wettability of the microchannel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. This is a challenging task due to the fast hydrophobic recovery of the PDMS surface after modification. This modification allows the formation of highly monodisperse oil-in-water (O/W) droplets. The generation of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsions was successfully achieved by connecting in series a hydrophobic microchip with a modified hydrophilic microchip. An original channel blocking technique to pattern the surface wettability of a specific section of a microchip using a viscous liquid comprising a mixture of honey and glycerol, is also presented for generating W/O/W emulsions on a single chip.	3d film;blocking (computing);integrated circuit;nethack;pdms;plasma active;polymer;series and parallel circuits	Shazia Bashir;Muhammad Bashir;Xavier Casadevall i Solvas;Julia M.

Optimum piezoresistors locations are calculated with the help of simulations carried out using finite element method (FEM) based tool COMSOL© Multiphysics. Since the sensitivity and non-linearity of conventional and bossed diaphragm structures showed a linear trend, empirical formulae are proposed using linear fit for quick and approximate calculation of sensitivity and non-linearity for a particular sensor structure. It is observed that high stress regions are also present near the boss - diaphragm interface and hence a design with piezoresistors placed at these regions is also proposed. This design is found to be enhancing the performance of piezoresistive pressure sensor compared to the conventional piezoresistor placement.	approximation algorithm;corner case;diaphragm (acoustics);distortion;finite element method;mesa;multiphysics;nonlinear system;simulation	Ramprasad Nambisan;S.

The thermal resistances of the Cu nanoparticle joints between Al2O3 heater chips and Cu–65Mo baseplates were measured. The thermal conductivities of the Cu nanoparticle joints were estimated from the thermal resistances using finite element method. The Cu nanoparticle joint exhibited the much higher thermal conductivity (>125 W/m K) than ordinary solders. The thermal resistance of the Cu nanoparticle joint was almost constant after the power cycling for 3000 cycles up to 200 °C even though that of the solder joint was rapidly increased.	semiconductor device;thermal grease	T.

In this research, a flow network was built representing the structural and ventilation characteristics of a 330-MW turbogenerator. The fan inlet velocity and pressures (boundary conditions) of each end-region outlet were obtained by the flow network method. The 3-D transient electromagnetic field in the turbogenerator end was calculated, and the eddy current losses (heat sources) of the end parts were obtained by the finite-element method. To study the surface heat-transfer coefficient distribution on the stator-end winding surface, fluid and thermal mathematical and geometric models of the whole turbogenerator end region were given. Using the finite-volume method, the surface heat-transfer coefficient distribution on the complex 3-D stator-end winding surface, fluid-flow distribution, and temperature distribution of the end parts were investigated under rated-load conditions. The calculated temperature results match well with measured data. This research can provide a theoretical basis for calculating the heat-transfer coefficients of the outer surfaces of large turbogenerators.	coefficient;finite element method;finite volume method;flow network;velocity (software development)	Jichao Han;Weili Li;Likun Wang;Xingfu Zhou;Xiaochen Zhang;Yong Li	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2297293	control engineering;electronic engineering;flow;engineering;control theory;heat transfer;physics;thermal analysis	Visualization	85.40864359257637	-10.430490875473975	157447

cc1ed896a9c9aa89c5a50225c0f240d7ff07b306	a micro-scale investigation on the behaviors of asphalt mixtures under freeze-thaw cycles using entropy theory and a computerized tomography scanning technique		The thermodynamic behavior of asphalt mixtures is critical to the engineers since it directly relates to the damage in asphalt mixtures. However, most of the current research of the freeze-thaw damage of asphalt mixtures is focused on the bulk body from the macroscale and lacks a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamic behaviors of asphalt mixtures from the microscale perspective. In this paper, to identify the important thermodynamic behaviors of asphalt mixtures under freeze-thaw loading cycle, the information entropy theory, an X-ray computerized tomography (CT) scanner and digital image processing technology are employed. The voids, the average size of the voids, the connected porosity, and the void number are extracted according to the scanned images. Based on the experiments and the CT scanned images, the information entropy evolution of the asphalt mixtures under different freeze-thaw cycles is calculated and the relationship between the change of information entropy and the pore structure characteristics is established. Then, the influences of different freezing and thawing conditions on the thermodynamic behaviors of asphalt mixtures are compared. The combination of information entropy theory and CT scanning technique proposed in this paper provides an innovative approach to investigate the thermodynamics behaviors of asphalt mixtures and a new way to analyze the freeze-thaw damage in asphalt mixtures.	aggregate data;ct scan;digital image processing;entropy (information theory);experiment;failure cause;image scanner;software propagation;the void (virtual reality);tomography	Huining Xu;Hengzhen Li;Yiqiu Tan;Linbing Wang;Yue Hou	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20020068	entropy (information theory);mathematical optimization;digital image processing;mathematics;tomography;porosity;composite material	Vision	89.60279008417658	-14.808012060956672	157570

The measurement of blood gases is conventionally done using glass electrode sensors. The development of ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) has created a high potential in multiparameter chemical sensor devices. This microsensor is essentially based on the established MOSFET technology. In the design and characterisation of a pH ISFET sensor, the ISFET model was characterised and a final design has been evolved with the assistance of MATLAB and HSPICE software. Silicon nitrate (Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/) and aluminium oxide (Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/) were the ion-sensitive membranes considered in the model. pH analyses were performed on both the membranes to evaluate the electrical responses of the sensor to the change in pH. The effect of the physical parameters of the ISFET on the drain-source current output is studied. Various physical and electrical parameters have been analysed to propose an optimal output response of the ISFET sensor. The sensor achieved an average sensitivity of 50 mV/pH, which is comparable to other published works. By being capable of miniaturization, further advantages are gained, namely easier fabrication, better performance characteristics of the sensor, and the ability to integrate with other biomedical sensors on the same die without any electrical or spatial interferences.	sensor;system of measurement	S.

814664847e0a8b949e06d134c17faf3498ea3875	investigation of the required clamping force at multidirectional undercut-forging		A hot forging process allows to produce parts of excellent quality and technical properties. Nevertheless, it is not possible to forge undercut geometries like piston pin bores, it is usually necessary to manufacture them in subsequent processes. Thus, an undercut-forging process was newly developed. Such a process requires a multidirectional forming tool, which is challenging due to a high clamping force of the tool during the process. With the research results, the requirements to the crucial tool components of heavy springs diminish, allowing using standard spring devices instead of large and expensive custom designed devices. The aim of this study is to analyze the clamping force, its origin, and influencing factors in order to facilitate the tool design. Therefore, in forming simulations the input parameters press velocity, initial temperature, and punch shape were investigated, and their effect on the clamping force was statistically evaluated. The press velocity has the major impact on the resulting clamping force. The initial part temperature and the shape of the punch tool showed minor but still significant effects. This combination of input parameters reduces the load and the stress on the tool, enabling to perform the process on smaller forging presses. Eventually, forging trials validated the results.	clamping (graphics)	Jonathan Ross;Jan Langner;Malte Stonis;Bernd-Arno Behrens	2018	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-018-0830-3	manufacturing engineering;clamping;gudgeon pin;forging;finite element method;engineering;undercut;mechanical engineering	DB	85.62148499833201	-14.096225675786373	158210

The influence of capacitance, pulse off-time, pulse on-time and pulse current on both the average and variability of surface roughness and material removal rate of a titanium alloy was investigated. The analysis revealed that to attain robustness against the impact of noise parameters, no capacitance should be applied. Furthermore, increasing pulse on-time and its current increased the average of both the surface roughness and material removal rate. Two approaches were suggested to deal with the trade-off between minimizing the former and maximizing the latter. The study confirmed empirically the inferiority of Taguchi’s S/N ratios to a robust design method involving the use of log(s) together with a simple graphical tool for determining the appropriate data transformation called lambda plot. In fact, it was revealed that the employed S/N ratios were driven mainly by the average and involved unaided, unexplained and unjustified transformations. The log(s), on the other hand, provided an independent means of quantifying the variability and, when integrated with lambda plot, rendered not only a simplified analysis but also a better process understanding. The study is the first to report the use of this powerful approach in the context of electrical discharge machining parameter design.

Besides examining the sensor components, factors such as sensor position, motion artifact, contact force and bad contact were also investigated. All sessions resulted in direct effects on the wave shape, AC and DC levels of the PPG signal. We concluded that the impacts of components, position and motion artifact can occur during measurement and suggested some subroutines in system algorithms to prevent them in practice. The bad contact and contact force were also influential though may not occur in practice credited to the advancements in commercialized sensors currently available in the marketplace.	algorithm;artifact (error);power management;sensor;subroutine	Ammar Y.

2e2fcba411d858b25533ed8d68c43d659398d982	energy dissipation in laser-based free form heading: a numerical approach		Cold forming generally allows the fast generation of parts with very low tolerances. In addition, mechanical properties are improved, if work hardening materials are used. Transferring the cold forming process to micro range leads to a decrease in the maximum achievable upset ratio so that the forming process becomes inefficient. Therefore, a laser-based free form heading process has been developed to generate preforms which can be calibrated in a secondary cold forming step. The achievable upset ratios reach values of several hundreds instead of 2.1 which is common for single step mechanical upsetting. In this article, heat losses arising in the material accumulation process using laser-based free form heading are analyzed and discussed. For this purpose, the process is modeled within the framework of continuum mechanics and simulated by a finite element method. By using a numerical approach, a systematic study on heat losses is performed in order to identify the influence of radiation, heat transfer due to convection and thermal conduction during laser irradiation time. The simulation results, which are validated with experimental data, show that the radiation is the most important mechanism reducing the efficiency of the accumulation process.	course (navigation);numerical analysis	Mischa Jahn;Heiko Brüning;Alfred Schmidt;Frank Vollertsen	2014	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-013-0509-8	forensic engineering;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	SE	86.0299724290369	-12.285260015469678	158898

In this context the suitability of metal bonded cubic boron nitride (CBN) tools for discontinuous profile grinding of gears is examined. Metal bonded grinding tools usually provide a high wear resistance. Furthermore CBN has high thermal conductivity which can affect the residual stress state of the ground gear positively. In this context the influence of the CBN grain size, grain coating as well as the grain concentration on the ground gear surface and subsurface was investigated. For the examined grinding tools a bronze bonding system is used. A nickel coating of the CBN grains caused an enhanced embedding of the grains in the bond in comparison to the uncoated grains. For all tested tools and process parameters compressive residual stress could be measured as well as maximum height of roughness profile values around Rz = 4 µm.		Berend Denkena;D.

However, the formation processes of toroidal-like spheroids may not be considered efficient, as most of them are manual. In this paper, we suggest the possibility and effectiveness of applying microfluidics for formation of toroidal-like spheroids. The concept of our method is that cells are compressed by rotational flow in a microchannel and dielectrophoretic force. Some types of microchannels that can generate rotational flow were designed and were analysed with flow analysis software. A superior microchannel was fabricated, and a flow of NIH3T3 cell suspension was supplied to the channel. As the flow rate was changed, the cells were rotated in the microchannel according to our concept, and approximately 30% of them remained in the channel. This result supports our concept: toroidal-like spheroids can be formed under the influence of forces of rotational flow and dielectrophoresis.

Spectroelectrochemistry has provided not only information about the type of nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on the electrode surface, but also about the electrosynthesis process. Small NPs without plasmon band are initially generated. Next, these nuclei grow to form bigger NPs in the reduction pulses with a characteristic plasmon band centered at 400 nm. Most of the NPs are generated during the first reduction pulses and a linear growth of the absorbance at a lower reaction rate was obtained in the subsequent pulses. Oxidation pulses do not redissolve completely silver NPs but only partially, meaning that very stable NPs are generated. AgNPs-modified electrodes have been successfully used to determine hydrogen peroxide. Spectroelectrochemistry has also yielded very useful information to understand the voltammetric signal obtained during the reduction of H2O2 on silver modified electrodes.	artificial nanoparticles;greater;hydrogen peroxide;linear function;peroxides;plasmon;printing;silver;electrode;sensor (device)	Cristina Fernández-Blanco;Álvaro Colina;Aránzazu Heras	2013		10.3390/s130505700	silver nanoparticle;text mining;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrochemistry;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;physical chemistry;biological engineering	HPC	95.57580663926592	-17.325521385551102	159144

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis exhibit the highly crystalline nanoparticles of silicon. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra at different pH values, such as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, reveal the origins of light emission from the silicon NC suspension, which includes both the quantum confinement effect and surface bonding. The quantum confinement effect dominates the PL origins of silicon NCs, especially determining the tunability and the emission range of PL, while the surface bonding regulates the maximum peak center, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and offsets of PL peaks in response to the changing pH value. The peak fitting of PLE curves reveals one of the divided PLE peaks shifts towards a shorter wavelength when the pH value increases, which implies correspondence with the surface bonding between silicon NCs and hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl groups. The consequent detailed analysis of the PL spectra indicates that the surface bonding results in the transforming of the PL curves towards longer wavelengths with the increasing pH values, which is defined as the pH sensitivity of PL. These results suggest that the present silicon NCs with pH-sensitive tunable light emission could find promising potential applications as optical sources, bio-sensors, etc.	british informatics olympiad;computed tomography scanning systems;cyanobacteria;full width at half maximum;guilty gear xrd;hydrogen;hydroxyl radical;multi-band excitation;nanocrystalline materials;national origin;nodoventricular mahaim-type pre-excitation;pattern recognition;photoluminescence;potential well;pyschological bonding;sensor;silicon;suspensions;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;transmission electron microscopy;viola <angiosperm>;zinostatin;wavelength	Jing Wang;Junhong Guo;Jing Chen	2017		10.3390/s17102396	photoluminescence;transmission electron microscopy;analytical chemistry;engineering;spectral line;potential well;nanocrystal;nanoparticle;photoluminescence excitation;silicon	Graphics	94.89368250450781	-15.159405371181137	159162

The studied devices consist of approximately 80 nm wide and 1 µm long bi-layer graphene nanoribbons with different lateral kink angles. We discuss the ambipolar transport characteristics and we show a systematic dependence of the overall conductance with the kink angle, i.e. with the shape of the etched bi-layer graphene nanoribbon. The measurements can be well described with the self-consistent Boltzmann equation for diffusive transport where the kinked angle appears to have an influence on the effective charge carrier mobility, thus revealing the presence of geometry-dependent ballistic transport effects. These results are crucial for the design and fabrication of future single-layer or bi-layer graphene interconnects in potential all-carbon monolithic systems.	buckling;conductance (graph);electrical connection;electron mobility;experiment;graphene;lateral thinking	Bernat Terres;Nick Borgwardt;Jan Dauber;Christian Volk;Stephan Engels;Stefan Fringes;Peter Weber;Uwe Wichmann;Christoph Stampfer;Stefan Trellenkamp	2011	2011 6th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2011.6017523	materials science;ballistic conduction;transport;ceramic materials;electron mobility;boltzmann equation;nanotechnology;graphene;etching;graphene nanoribbons;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	89.91341602731137	-11.458739699098565	159389

Due to the low level of NOx emission enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology is currently one of the most feasible solutions. SCR technology uses diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), which is a urea solution of 32.7% urea with 67.3% water to reduce NOx emission. The urea solution is converted to ammonia (NH3), which reacts with NOx over a catalyst to form N2 and water. In this paper, a practical and dynamic model for modeling and controlling ammonia surface coverage or storage on an SCR system with a vanadia-based catalyst is implemented. It also included modeling of NH3 slip. This work was implemented on an electronic control module and tested on a medium-duty diesel engine. The improved NOx efficiencies observed with the corresponding reduction in urea usage illustrate a successful solution, indicating that this new dynamic modeling of ammonia surface coverage and its effective usage to manage urea dosing is a valuable tool for SCR after-treatment systems.	computational fluid dynamics;diesel;electronic control unit;mathematical model	Abdul R.

Among other emerging applications, the detection of magnetic fields in the picotesla range is crucial for biomedical applications. In this work Picosense reports a millimeter-scale, low-power hybrid magnetoresistive-piezoelectric magnetometer with subnanotesla sensitivity at low frequency. Through an innovative noise-cancelation mechanism, the 1/f noise in the MR sensors is surpassed by the mechanical modulation of the external magnetic fields in the high frequency regime. A modulation efficiency of 13% was obtained enabling a final device's sensitivity of ~950 pT/Hz1/2 at 1 Hz. This hybrid device proved to be capable of measuring biomagnetic signals generated in the heart in an unshielded environment. This result paves the way for the development of a portable, contactless, low-cost and low-power magnetocardiography device.	csf2ra protein, human;csf2ra wt allele;cell hybridization;contactless smart card;electrocardiography;hertz (hz);infant, extremely premature;low-power broadcasting;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetocardiography;malaise;mathematical optimization;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;modulation;noise (electronics);piezoelectricity;pink noise;sensor web;software portability;spectral efficiency;waveform;magnetometers;millimeter;sensor (device)	André Guedes;Rita Macedo;Gerardo Jaramillo;Susana Cardoso;Paulo P.

Specifically, the atomic-level description of bi-polar hafnia-based RRAM, which operations involve the repeatable rupture/recreation of a localized conductive path, reveals that its performance is determined by the outcome of the initial forming process; defining the structural characteristics of the conductive filament and distribution of the oxygen ions released from the filament region. The ion distribution, in turn, is found to be linked to the level of dielectric oxygen deficiency, which may either assist or suppress the resistive switching process. With this improved understanding of the connection between RRAM performance and materials properties the optimization of RRAM devices may be more readily achieved.	angular defect;mathematical optimization;resistive random-access memory;steam rupture	Gennadi Bersuker;Brian Butcher;David Gilmer;Paul Kirsch;Luca Larcher;Andrea Padovani	2013	2013 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)	10.1109/ESSDERC.2013.6818844	materials science;ceramic materials;electronic engineering	HPC	91.60863410583912	-13.20174824017396	159686

The main focus of the paper is to determine the geometry and parameters of the nose cones that provide minimum aerodynamic drag and heating. Studies on spherically blunted and parabolic nose cones are performed for different fineness ratios at zero angle of attack. It is observed that for fineness ratio 1.2, parabolic nose cones provide superior drag reduction. Detailed comparison of the flow/shock features in the vicinity of the blunted and parabolic nose cones for different fineness ratios is also shown in order to determine its influence on aerodynamic drag. An empirical correlation developed for the total drag coefficient based on regression analysis for a parabolic nose cone reveals that it is mainly a function of the maximum pressure coefficient and f...

The working mechanism of respiration signal generation is based on the periodical deformations on a human chest wall during the respiratory movements, which in turn mechanically stretch the piezoelectric PVDF film to generate the corresponding electrical signals. In this study, the PVDF sensing film was completely encapsulated within the sensor patch forming a mass-spring-damper mechanical system to prevent the noises generated in a dynamic condition. To verify the design of sensor patch to prevent dynamic noises, experimental investigations were carried out. Results demonstrated the respiration signals generated and the respiratory rates measured by the proposed sensor patch were in line with the same measurements based on a commercial respiratory effort transducer both in a static (e.g., sitting) or dynamic (e.g., walking) condition. As a whole, this study has developed a PVDF-based sensor patch which is capable of monitoring respirations in a dynamic walking condition with high fidelity. Other distinctive features include its small size, light weight, ease of use, low cost, and portability. All these make it a promising sensing device to monitor respirations particularly in home care units.	ability to sit question;chest wall structure;damper device component;home care of patient;movement;musculoskeletal diseases;periodicals;piezoelectricity;polymer;respiration;respiratory rate;sensor;sodium fluoride 0.0024 mg/mg toothpaste;transducer;usability;polyvinylidene fluoride	Kin Fong Lei;Yi-Zheng Hsieh;Yi-Yuan Chiu;Min-Hsien Wu	2015		10.3390/s150818801	electronic engineering;chemistry;respiration;electrical engineering;electricity;physical chemistry;forensic engineering	HCI	91.35723335016714	-20.301868429658718	159877

However, measurement values from electronic noses have a tendency to vary under humidity or alcohol exposure conditions, since several types of sensors in the devices are affected by such variables. Consequently, we show three techniques for reducing the variation of sensor values: (1) using a trapping system to reduce the infering components; (2) performing statistical standardization (calculation of z-score); and (3) selecting suitable sensors. With these techniques, we discriminated the volatiles of four types of fresh mushrooms: golden needle (Flammulina velutipes), white mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), shiitake (Lentinus edodes), and eryngii (Pleurotus eryngii) among six fresh mushrooms (hen of the woods (Grifola frondosa), shimeji (Hypsizygus marmoreus) plus the above mushrooms). Additionally, we succeeded in discrimination of white mushroom, only comparing with artificial mushroom flavors, such as champignon flavor and truffle flavor. In conclusion, our techniques will expand the options to reduce variations in sensor values.	agaricales;agaricus;cosmetics;drink (dietary substance);electronic health records;ethanol;exposure to humidity;flavoring;grifola;inference;lentinula edodes;lentinus;nose;pleurotus;shiitake;statistic (data);wood material;sensor (device);z-score	Kouki Fujioka;Nobuo Shimizu;Yoshinobu Manome;Keiichi Ikeda;Kenji Yamamoto;Yasuko Tomizawa	2013		10.3390/s131115532	electronic nose;food science;standard score;chemistry;humidity;olfaction;theme and variations;physics;standardization	HCI	96.65790079699606	-18.80849800051122	159923

Compared with normal ultrasound transducers, a FUT is a piezoelectric film made of a PZT/PZT sol-gel composite which has advantages due to its high sensitivity, curved surface adaptability and high temperature durability. By operating a pulsed laser in B-scan mode along with the integration of FUT and LUT, a multi-mode dispersion spectrum of a stainless steel pipe at high temperature can be measured. In addition, dynamic wave propagation behaviors are experimentally visualized with two dimensional scanning. The images directly interpret the reflections from the interior defects and also can locate their positions. This hybrid technique shows great potential for non-destructive evaluation of structures with complex geometry, especially in high temperature environments.	amiga reflections;behavior;ct scan;compiler;durability (database systems);experiment;fever;frequency response;heater device component;johnson–nyquist noise;lexical group unique identifier;lutein;manufacturing industry;megahertz;metal nanoparticles;numerous;piezoelectricity;reflection (computer graphics);signal processing;software bug;software propagation;sol-gel;stainless steel;thickness (graph theory);transducer;transducers;ultrasonics (sound);ultrasonography, prenatal	Tai Chieh Wu;Makiko Kobayashi;Masayuki Tanabe;Che-Hua Yang	2017		10.3390/s17061285	electronic engineering;acoustics;nondestructive testing;ultrasonic testing	HCI	91.77329693065803	-19.82584800680233	160034

The welding procedure uses an open electric arc between an electrode and the metals to be joined. Besides the obvious risks of burns and inflammation of the cornea, which are prevented by using proper personal protective equipment, the operator may also be subject to the risk of electric shock from the exposed parts of the welding circuit, both the electrode and the workpiece. In addition, the welding current, by straying from the intended path, can cause localized heating of parts, with the risks of triggering fires and/or explosive atmospheres. Because of the high current required by the arc welding equipment, operators are exposed also to strong electromagnetic fields. This paper seeks to clarify the aforementioned issues, especially in light of the fact that the risk associated with electric shocks may be unknown to welders and their supervisors.	robot welding	Fabio Freschi;Luca Giaccone;Massimo Mitolo	2016	2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2016.7731954	structural engineering;electric resistance welding;engineering;welding power supply;forensic engineering;metallurgy	DB	89.86980414915294	-21.272792858472727	160089

One tapered exterior surface engages a matching tapered interior surface of a hollow rotatable shaft that receives it. The other tapered exterior surface engages a matching tapered interior surface of a wedge received in the shaft and movable axially relative to it. The angles of the tapers are such that they are self holding. The collet is closed by moving the wedge which compresses the basket sequentially at the two tapered surfaces, locking the tapers. The force on the wedge is released after this, leaving the tapers locked without external force as the tool is gripped in two locations during operation of it. The collet is actuated by a pneumatic power cylinder with two pistons having portions that engage an extension of the wedge for moving it, after which these portions are spaced from the wedge extension so that they do not interfere with the operation of the tool. The position of the power cylinder is adjustable to assure clearance at the wedge extension.

The investigations were done in two parts: i) the formation and evolution of interconnection microstructures in AuSn | Cu, AuSn | Ni and AuSn | Pt systems were studied with bulk diffusion couples and ii) thin film structures (i.e. adhesion layers and diffusion barriers) for Pt metallization on AuSn SLID bonded wafers were investigated from manufacturability and reliability viewpoints. The failure analysis was carried out on as bonded as well as aged interconnections. Distinct thin film structures showed clear differences in shear strength and fracture mechanisms. The mechanical reliability of the interconnection was increased by i) introducing sputtered Ni metallization between TiW and AuSn bond, ii) increasing the Pt thickness from 100 nm to 200 nm and iii) using Mo diffusion barrier underneath the Pt layer.

AlN thin films were deposited by RF magnetron sputter system. Deposition parameters such as N2 contents, Ar and N2 partial pressures, and the distance between metal target and substrate were found to affect the piezoelectric response. To fabricate the suspended thin film resonator (STFR) using the piezoelectric AlN thin film, the etching of AlN and the surface micromachining process were conducted. The thickness of AlN film and membrane for the STFR are 2 and 15 lm, respectively. This membrane was fabricated by SOI technology. The device with the dimension of 160 · 160 lm has a resonant frequency of 1.653 GHz, a K eff of 2.4%, a bandwidth of 17 MHz, and a quality factor of 91.7. The device with the dimension of 200· 200 lm has a resonant frequency of 1.641 GHz, a K eff of 1.2%, and a bandwidth of 9 MHz, and a quality factor of 50.2. 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	3d film;bandwidth (signal processing);chemical vapor deposition;debian;design for manufacturability;physical vapor deposition;piezoelectricity;radio frequency;resonance;silicon on insulator;substrate (electronics);thickness (graph theory)	Hyun Ho Kim;Byeong Kwon Ju;Yun Hi Lee;Si Hyung Lee;Jeon Kook Lee;Soo Won Kim	2004	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2003.09.007	surface micromachining;electronic engineering;resonance;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;band-pass filter;q factor;thin film;physics	HCI	91.7477850000356	-15.118262697012238	160573

The strong ferromagnetic coupling between the free layer and the pinned layer of spin valve sensors is achieved by reducing the spacer thickness, while the hysteresis of the free layer is eliminated by the interplay between shape anisotropy and the strength of coupling. The increased ferromagnetic coupling field up to the remarkable 70 Oe, which is five-times larger than conventional solutions, brings key advantages for dynamic sensing, e.g., a larger biasing field giving rise to larger detection signals, facilitating the operation of devices without saturation of the sensors. Studies on the fundamental effects of an external magnetic field on the evolution of the shape of droplets, as enabled by the non-visual monitoring capability of the device, provides crucial information for future development of a magnetofluidic device for multiplexed assays.	analyzer device component;anisotropy;biasing;csf2ra protein, human;drug emulsion;estrone 3-oleate;hysteresis;large;layer 2 tunneling protocol;magnetic resonance imaging;microfluidics;multiplexing;oersted (unit of measure);openembedded;particle;saturated;signal-to-noise ratio;solutions;spacer device component;thickness (graph theory);ferrofluid;sensor (device)	Gungun Lin;Denys Makarov;Oliver G.

For example an acoustic/mechanical wave generates a dynamic density variation; such a variation may be affected by local temperature, strain, vibration and birefringence. By detecting changes in the amplitude, frequency and phase of light scattered along a fiber, one can realize a distributed fiber sensor for measuring localized temperature, strain, vibration and birefringence over lengths ranging from meters to one hundred kilometers. Such a measurement can be made in the time domain or frequency domain to resolve location information. With coherent detection of the scattered light one can observe changes in birefringence and beat length for fibers and devices. The progress on state of the art technology for sensing performance, in terms of spatial resolution and limitations on sensing length is reviewed. These distributed sensors can be used for disaster prevention in the civil structural monitoring of pipelines, bridges, dams and railroads. A sensor with centimeter spatial resolution and high precision measurement of temperature, strain, vibration and birefringence can find applications in aerospace smart structures, material processing, and the characterization of optical materials and devices.	a fibers;acoustic cryptanalysis;arabic numeral 100;birefringence;brillouin scattering;capability maturity model;carrier recovery;fiber optic technology;instrument - device;optical fiber;passive optical network;photons;pipeline (computing);railroads;raman scattering;rayleigh–ritz method;time series;tissue fiber;centimeter;sensor (device)	Xiaoyi Bao;Liang Chen	2012		10.3390/s120708601	birefringence;raman scattering;brillouin scattering;temperature;distributed acoustic sensing;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;fiber optic sensor;vibration;strain;optics;rayleigh scattering;physics;quantum mechanics	Mobile	93.1578272603613	-20.76563349475345	160713

We find that the impact ionization in reverse bias p-i-n diodes with ultrathin (less than 50 nm) intrinsic regions is triggered by Zener tunneling rather than by thermal generation. The impact generation of hot carriers occurs mainly in the low-field junction regions rather than in the high field intrinsic zone. The calculations predict significantly more minority carriers on the n-side than on the p-side.	cellular automaton;diode	Günther Zandler;Ralph Oberhuber;D.

A simultaneous or direct solution procedure is employed to solve the solution variables of fluid/structural domain together. Therefore, this approach can provide better visualization of the actual plastic encapsulation process by considering FSI phenomenon during the process. Different epoxy molding compound (EMC) rheological properties have resulted dissimilar fluid flow characteristics, pressure distribution, air void entrapment level, structural displacement and von Mises stress, which are discussed in the paper. Unfavorable results are obtained when higher viscous flow takes place. EMC flow front prediction has been validated with the experimental results from literature. The numerical approach and results presented in this paper are able to provide useful information for the works in optimizing plastic encapsulation process.	encapsulation (networking);stanford university centers and institutes;three-dimensional integrated circuit;through-silicon via	Ernest E.

New tests are sought with greatest demand not only for new analytes, but also to reduce costs, complexity and lengthy analysis times of current techniques. Among the myriad of possibilities available today to develop new test systems, amperometric biosensors are prominent players-best represented by the ubiquitous amperometric-based glucose sensors. Electrochemical approaches in general require little and often enough only simple hardware components, are rugged and yet provide low limits of detection. They thus offer many of the desirable attributes for point-of-care/point-of-need tests. This review focuses on investigating the important integration of sample preparation with (primarily electrochemical) biosensors. Sample clean up requirements, miniaturized sample preparation strategies, and their potential integration with sensors will be discussed, focusing on clinical sample analyses.	biosensors;glucose;requirement;rugged computer;analyte;sensor (device)	Natinan Bunyakul;Antje J.

On the other hand, the meniscus-dragging deposition (MDD) process can produce a uniform surface of the substrate. Graphene oxide (GO) is the oxidized form of graphene that has high hydrophilicity and protein absorption. It is widely used in biomedical fields such as drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering. Herein, we fabricated uniform GO micropatterns via MDD and photolithography. The physicochemical properties of the GO micropatterns were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, cell migration on the GO micropatterns was investigated, and the difference in cell migration on triangle and square GO micropatterns was examined for their effects on cell migration. Our results demonstrated that the GO micropatterns with a desired shape can be finely fabricated via MDD and photolithography. Moreover, it was revealed that the shape of GO micropatterns plays a crucial role in cell migration distance, speed, and directionality. Therefore, our findings suggest that the GO micropatterns can serve as a promising biofunctional platform and cell-guiding substrate for applications to bioelectric devices, cell-on-a-chip, and tissue engineering scaffolds.	atomic-force microscopy;cmos;cell signaling;chemical vapor deposition;drag and drop;drug delivery systems;gnu nano;graphene;major depressive disorder;microscopy, atomic force;migration, cell;model-driven engineering;physical vapor deposition;raman scattering;regenerative medicine;scanning electron microscopy;substrate (electronics);tissue engineering;x-ray emission spectroscopy	Sung Eun Kim;Min Sung Kim;Yong Cheol Shin;Seong Un Eom;Jong Ho Lee;Dong-Myeong Shin;Suck Won Hong;Bongju Kim;Jongchul Park;Bo Sung Shin;Dohyung Lim;Dong-Wook Han	2016		10.3390/mi7100186	materials science;cell migration;ceramic materials;nanotechnology;photolithography		94.17282737156663	-15.953984955184097	161416

d1dc379c831c878fe8a0713ff66218dbfa55aafb	gap engineering for improved control of memristor nanosensors		Memristor biosensors are electronic systems very recently born electronic systems in the quest for highly sensitive biodetection approaches. The presence of charged species in the vicinity of a semiconductor channel connecting a source and a drain electrode opens a voltage gap between the two current minima in the semi-logarithmic output curve. Despite the tremendous sensitivity demonstrated in the past, the initial state of the gap limits the charge sign of the analyte to be detected, i.e. with an initial closed gap the detection of analytes with a gap-closing effect will remain challenging. Here, we propose a gap controlling process using a third electrode that mimics the presence of charged molecules of the desired sign. We test the function of the gap-control terminal via a back-gate in dry condition and we demonstrate the operation in liquid environment using a top-gate electrode. Finally, toward (bio)chemical sensing applications, we discriminate solutions with different pH values. The hereby proposed method is critical to allow broadening the range of analytes that can be sensed directly in liquid environment regardless their charge sign.	closing (morphology);maxima and minima;memristor;operational amplifier applications;semi-log plot;semiconductor industry	Bergoi Ibarlucea;Larysa Baraban;Gianaurelio Cuniberti;Ki Hyun Kim;Taiuk Rim;Chang-Ki Baek;Alon Ascoli;Ronald Tetzlaff	2017	2017 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2017.8093293	nanosensor;voltage;memristor;semiconductor;electrode;electronic engineering;maxima and minima;computer science;analyte;nanotechnology;biosensor	EDA	95.12869439077014	-17.803453313701667	161649

Long-term exposure to nitrate causes Blue Baby Syndrome, a leading cause of infant mortality, and various cancers in adults. Spectroscopic nitrate detection methods, while sensitive and accurate, are prohibitively expensive, time consuming and not available at the point of use. Electrochemical detection methods are poised to offer accurate point of use measurements, but so far these methods require expensive modified electrodes and are not commercially available. To aid in water quality interventions, we have demonstrated a low-cost, microfluidic, electrochemical sensor capable of rapid and affordable nitrate detection at the point of use. This platform for water quality testing could serve as a crucial public health tool, especially in rural areas that lack the technical and human resources to adequately monitor water quality.	blue frog	Lillian Tatka;Unyoung Kim	2016	2016 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)	10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857363	environmental science;environmental engineering;analytical chemistry;environmental chemistry	Visualization	95.5435091783795	-19.52510385040284	161746

Under an UV source, this material has displayed an intense blue emission colour. Upon excitation with a red wavelength at 688 nm (H6 ! F3), this glass has shown two upconverted blue emissions at 452 nm (D2 ! F4) and 474 nm (G4 ! H6), respectively. Possible mechanisms involved in such upconverted blue emissions are explained via ground state absorption and excited state absorption processes through an energy-level structure diagram of Tm3þ(4f12). By the successful application of Judd–Ofelt calculations, the luminescence results have successfully been analysed. Besides obtaining a clear understanding of the optical characteristics of this glass, we have also measured its physical properties such as the refractive indices at three different wavelengths in order to evaluate its light dispersion performance, glass density and other related parameters as well. q 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

d57799c20bd581fc6539300a36e37f7ea189d8d5	homogeneous neurolike structures for solving the optimum control problem		In an earth boring bit of the type having a rotatable cone secured to a bearing shaft, an improved pressure compensating and relief system. A flexible diaphragm has an enlarge peripheral portion in an o-ring configuration sealingly secured in a compensator cavity to form a mud region and a lubricant region. A central portion of the diaphragm has a perforated and ridged protrusion extending into the mud region to form a self energizing area, exposed to the mud region, that seals the perforation when the pressure of the lubricant is less than or substantially equal that of the mud. A wall at the end of the compensator cavity surrounds the mud passage and engages an area around the protrusion when the diaphragm is fully extended by lubricant pressure build-up that exceeds the hydrostatic pressure. Thus, the resulting pressure differential opens the perforation, releases lubricant and relieves the build-up of lubricant pressure. However, the configuration of the protrusion is such as to prevent the entrance of mud into the lubricant reservoir since the exterior area of the protrusion exceeds that of the interior area. The differential pressure to open the perforation is selected to be not less than about fifty psi and the preferred form of the protrusion is substantially cylindrical, its perforation and lubricant entrance being beveled. An absence of metal bonded to the diaphragm helps avoid failures due to stress induce separations and debonding due to chemical attack. Clearances are used between the diaphragm and the end of the cavity and the end of the protector cup to provide self centering with the lubricant and drilling mud passages.		I. A.

Furthermore, turbidity measurements are applied in the chemical (e.g., process monitoring), pharmaceutical (e.g., drug discovery), and food industries (e.g., the filtration of wine and beer). The most common measurement technique is nephelometric turbidimetry. A nephelometer is a device for measuring the amount of scattered light of suspended particles in a liquid by using a light source and a light detector orientated in 90° to each other. Commercially available nephelometers cost usually-depending on the measurable range, reliability, and precision-thousands of euros. In contrast, our new developed GRIN-lens-based nephelometer, called GRINephy, combines low costs with excellent reproducibility and precision, even at very low turbidity levels, which is achieved by its ability to rotate the sample. Thereby, many cuvette positions can be measured, which results in a more precise average value for the turbidity calculated by an algorithm, which also eliminates errors caused by scratches and contaminations on the cuvettes. With our compact and cheap Arduino-based sensor, we are able to measure in the range of 0.1-1000 NTU and confirm the ISO 7027-1:2016 for low turbidity values.	arduino;cuvettes;detectors;drinking function;drug discovery;gradient-index optics;lens diseases;network interface device;one thousand;particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay;quorum sensing;turbidimetry;turbidity measurement;algorithm;filtration	Michael Metzger;Alexander Konrad;Felix Blendinger;Andreas Modler;Alfred J.

The integrated multifunction micro-sensor is fabricated on silicon wafers by micromachining technology. Different doping doses of boron ion, placement and structure of resistors are tested for the force sensor, pressure sensor and temperature sensor to minimize the cross interference and optimize the properties. A glass optical fiber, with a ladder structure and sharp tip etched by buffer oxide etch solution, is glued on the micro-force sensor chip as the tactile probe. Experimental results show that the minimum force that can be detected by the force sensor is 300 nN; the lateral sensitivity of the force sensor is 0.4582 mV/μN; the probe length is linearly proportional to sensitivity of the micro-force sensor in lateral; the sensitivity of the pressure sensor is 0.11 mv/KPa; the sensitivity of the temperature sensor is 5.836 × 10(-3) KΩ/°C. Thus it is a cost-effective method to fabricate integrated multifunction micro-sensors with different measurement ranges that could be used in many fields.	baresthesia;boron;buffers;debian;doping (semiconductor);doping in sports;effective method;etching (microfabrication);fever;interference (communication);ions;lateral thinking;microtechnology;multi-function printer;optical fiber;oral wafer;pressure sensor device component;silicon;temperature sensor device component;wafer (electronics);sensor (device)	Weizhong Wang;Yulong Zhao;Yafei Qin	2012		10.3390/s120404051	electronic engineering;temperature;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;physics	Robotics	93.37859430784873	-17.802679817797344	162332

Therefore the novel trimming methods are necessary for microresistors, especially when they are embedded in LTCC substrate. This paper compares electrical (normalized temperature dependence of resistance, low frequency noise) and stability properties (relative resistance drift, changes of current noise index) of untrimmed, voltage pulse trimmed and laser trimmed unglazed thick-film resistors after step-increased long-term thermal ageing at 162 C, 207 C and 253 C. Moreover the effect of long term exposure (1000 h, 125 C) and thermal shocks (1000 shocks between 55 C and 125 C) is analysed for untrimmed and voltage pulse trimmed buried LTCC resistors. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Cathodoluminescence studies at the SEM revealed a direct correlation between the intensity of the blue luminescence (BL) band and the carbon doping concentration. Observing this, carbon depletion zones were found around threading dislocations in the active GaN layer, as well as a deep depletion in growth columns concluded from a reduction of the BL intensity. Using the given results a model of a defect, here called the deep carbon depletion (DCD), is proposed to explain the correlation between carbon variations and the vertical breakdown. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	bl (logic);column (database);deep blue (chess computer);depletion region;doping (semiconductor);eniac;epitaxy;power electronics;software bug;thread (computing);titanium nitride	Michael Knetzger;Elke Meissner;Joff Derluyn;Marianne Germain;Jochen Friedrich	2016	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2016.09.014	nanotechnology	SE	91.58862591559345	-12.319945804234264	162410

The layers were grown by varying substrate temperature and the V/III ratio. The relative difference between refractive index of film and substrate results in pronounced easily detected interference oscillations in the reflected beam intensity. The oscillations period provides an accurate and immediate measure of growth rate. In addition, the variations of extrema of oscillations and the average value of reflectance provide an estimate of the quality and surface roughness. A procedure for quantifying the roughening observed during the in situ LR monitoring of growth was presented. Furthermore, the measured interference effects were analyzed by calculating the reflectance. In order to explain the reflectometry behavior, the film was also characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy.	metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy;reflectometry	A. Rebey;M. M.

This SAPD design used the diffusion of p-wells to create a low p layer doping density as the guard ring to prevent the premature breakdown at the edge of the device. The result demonstrated that the proper gap length between p-wells to create the guard ring allows SAPD to work in the Geiger mode. This showed that by developing a low-doped guard ring at the edge of the junction, it will reduce the electric field, minimize the avalanche current and the edge breakdown can be prevented. In this paper, the SAPD with square shape active area of 2 × 2 μm2 and low doped p-well guard ring has VBD of 27 V and avalanche current of 0.85 pA.	diode;doping (semiconductor);impact ionization;ion implantation;p–n junction;simulation;spectral leakage;traffic collision avoidance system	Suhaila Isaak;Wan Haszerila Wan Hasan	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)	10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072739	materials science;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;optoelectronics	Robotics	90.8393776885913	-12.851835991531393	162730

These structures are locally released from the wafer by undercut etching. By sending an electric current through them, a Lorentz force component is induced in some sections, resulting in deformation of the thin-film structure. First, different shapes of 1-turn coils are presented. The arrangement of vertical and parallel magnetic field is discussed. Micromachine fabrication using IC thin-film, lithography and etching technology is presented. An x-y table was built as an application example for the use of Lorentz force in micromachines. For protection and the ease of handling the microactuators are packaged into a standard IC case. As examples of further applications of Lorentz force actuators, a micromirror device, a ciliary motion system and microrelays are discussed.

The cell adhesion and assembly is further controlled by concentration of cells (2,500-10,000 cells/cm(2)) and fetal bovine serum (0-15%). The cells are characterized by fluorescence microscopy of actin fibers and nuclei. The serum protein adsorption is studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The cells are arranged selectively on O-terminated patterns into 30-200 μm wide arrays. Higher cell concentrations allow colonization of unfavorable H-terminated regions due to mutual cell communication. There is no cell selectivity without the proteins in the medium. Based on the AFM, the proteins are present on both H- and O-terminated surfaces. Pronounced differences in their thickness, surface roughness, morphology, and phase images indicate different conformation of the proteins and explain the cell selectivity.	atomic-force microscopy;bos taurus;cell adhesion;cell communication;diamond;hydrogen;mathematical morphology;microscopy, atomic force;microscopy, fluorescence;null-terminated string;osteoblasts;oxygen;selectivity (electronic);self-assembly;serum proteins;thickness (graph theory);tissue fiber	Bohuslav Rezek;Lenka Michalíková;Egor Ukraintsev;Alexander Kromka;Marie Kalbacova	2009		10.3390/s90503549	atomic force microscopy;bioinformatics;material properties of diamond;nanotechnology;biological engineering;tissue engineering;cell adhesion;biosensor	Visualization	94.58094122692746	-15.922986474740561	162968

The clamp includes an inverted U configuration adapted to extend about the curtain rod. The U-configuration includes one leg that is joined integrally to the tail portion, and the other leg is provided with a detent tip. A detent lever extends from the tail portion proximate to the detent tip, and includes an array of closely spaced detent teeth adapted to engage the detent tip. The detent lever is resiliently biased toward the detent tip, so that the tip remains engaged with the teeth unless otherwise disturbed. The two legs of the clamp may be squeezed together to engage the curtain rod frictionally to immobilize the device on the curtain rod, and the device will remain in this disposition until released. The tail portion may comprise an inverted T configuration to engage a wide portion of shower curtain and spread the force of impingement thereabout.	smart card	Hossein Rezaei Ghaleh;Mohammad-Ali Doostari	2009			computer security;inverted t;computer science;clamp;intrusion;integrally closed;limiting;lever;detent	Security	83.20991829102518	-19.810878582544287	163295
e0a85892ac44e3f7a8215b4369d11e5afb9c4c55	representation of the heat specific creep rupture behavior of 9%cr steels using neural networks	neural network	The present work aims to demonstrate an innovative way of application of modern data analysis tools for structural power plant materials, such as 9%Cr-steels. The purpose is the optimized prediction of the material behaviour considering the stress/time to rupture data and the determination of position of the specific melt in the scatter band for the given steel. This data is needed for an effective life time assessment of power plant components. The material behaviour is influenced by the multidimensional interdependencies between the individual elements of the chemical composition, the heat treatment parameters, product form, tensile properties and microstructure, which are difficult to describe using simple analytical methods. Modeling with neural network techniques therefore seems to be an interesting alternative. Moreover, the applied method takes away the requirement for long and expensive experiments. A large variety of data was used for training of a commercial neural network. By means of sensitivity studies the influence of specific data features was investigated with regard to an optimized correlation factor r. The interpretations of the neural network have been checked whether basic physical and metallurgical backgrounds are reflected. The results are compared with the real material behaviour gained by material tests. The applicability of the neural network tool for technical use in life time assessment was investigated.	artificial neural network;experiment;feature creep;instruction creep;interdependence;steam rupture	Olga Frolova;Karl Maile;Wolfhart Müller	2010			creep;artificial neural network;composite material;materials science	ML	85.39236302004849	-11.553496747124953	163313
12c7e2337403582ab4498ac6ba4b1fc1ee4cb96d	development of a multiwavelength visible-range-supported opto–ultrasound instrument using a light-emitting diode and ultrasound transducer	light-emitting diode;multiwavelength;ultrasound transducer;visible light	A new multiwavelength visible-range-supported opto⁻ultrasound instrument using a light-emitting diode and ultrasound transducer was developed in order to produce multiwavelength visible light with minimized color aberration errors, and detect ultrasound signals emitted from the target. In the instrument, the developed optical systems can provide multiwavelength optical transmission with low optical aberration within 10-cm ranges that are reasonably flat in the modulation transfer function at spatial frequencies of 20 and 40 lp/mm, except at the end of the diagonal edge of the samples. To assess the instrument capability, we performed pulse⁻echo responses with Thunnus obesus eye samples. Focused red, green, blue and white light rays from an integrated red, green and blue LED source were produced, and echo signal amplitudes of 33.53, 34.92, 38.74 and 82.54 mV, respectively, were detected from the Thunnus obesus eye samples by a 10-MHz focused ultrasound transducer. The center frequencies of the echo signal when producing red, green, blue and white LED light in the instrument were 9.02, 9.05, 9.21 and 8.81 MHz, respectively. From these tests, we verify that this instrument can combine red, green and blue LED light to cover different wavelengths in the visible-light range and detect reasonable echo amplitudes from the samples.	acoustic cryptanalysis;biological science disciplines;cns disorder;conflict (psychology);distance;echo (command);experiment;eye;focal (programming language);immunoglobulin lambda-chains;light emitting diode device component;light, visible;manuscripts;megahertz;melanins;modulation;optical system;patients;preparation;pupil;radiation;ray (optics);transducer device component;transfer function;ultrasound transducer;sensor (device);wavelength	Hojong Choi;Jung-Yeol Yeom;Jaemyung Ryu	2018		10.3390/s18103324	analytical chemistry;engineering;light-emitting diode;optoelectronics;ultrasound;ultrasonic sensor	Vision	93.55953355592746	-21.634811278322285	163704
53ea24a8fb42d5fcd600069297e1760caee8a994	simulation of media behaviour in vibration assisted abrasive flow machining	abrasive flow machining media;ultrasonic assisted abrasive flow machining;abrasive workpiece interaction;simulation;computational fluid dynamics	Abrasive flow machining (AFM) is an abrasive-based precision finishing process used for achieving surface finish in micro and nano-level. The AFM polishes surfaces by extruding a visco-elastic media in contact with the workpiece. The media, also called a ‘flexible tool’, plays a key role in the performance of the process. Ultrasonic assisted abrasive flow machining (UAAFM) is a new variant of the AFM process in which the workpiece is subjected to mechanical vibration orthogonal to the media flow direction. In this process a high frequency, in the range of about 5–20 kHz, is given to the workpiece with the help of a piezo actuator and a specially designed fixture. The present work highlights on the possible behaviour of the tool (media) during UAAFM and its effect on the machining process through a computation based approach. Commercially available simulation tool was used to study the effect of the media in response to different set of machining conditions. The responses were evaluated in terms of changes in the fluid pressure, velocity profile of the fluid, temperature distribution in the working fluid and the possible wall shear on the work surface. A three-dimensional model was constructed for simulating the UAAFM process. The simulation shows that the abrasive particles tend to hit the target surface at an angle ‘θ’ which significantly affects the basic mechanisms involved and enhances the effectiveness of the process. The computed wall shear explains that the process will have higher finishing rate and hence the performance. The enhanced interaction of abrasive media in UAAFM while compared to simple AFM could be explained by the resultant pressure–velocity phenomena. Results show that while changes in the amplitude of applied vibration (10 μm and 50 μm) significantly affect the wall shear, the media velocity and pressure profiles are only marginally sensitive to this parameter. The simulation results also confirm that the rise in temperature during the process will not affect the media stability. Results have been discussed vis-a-vis the basic mechanism of the process through suitable illustrations.	simulation	Venkatesh Gudipadu;Apurbba Kumar Sharma;Nitish Singh	2015	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2014.10.009	simulation;computational fluid dynamics;computer science;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering;mechanical engineering	SE	86.45638148159296	-13.631033980312049	163879

Squares of 8 to 40 μm were patterned to (100) oriented silicon wafers through DWL (Direct Writing Laser) photolithography. The wet etching process was performed inside an open HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) flask with ultrasonic agitation. IPA volume and evaporation was studied in a dynamic etching process, and subsequent influence on the silicon etching was inspected. For the tested conditions, evaporation rates for water vapor and IPA were determined as approximately 0.0417 mL/min and 0.175 mL/min, respectively. Results demonstrate that IPA availability, and not concentration, plays an important role in the definition of the final structure. Transversal SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis demonstrates a correlation between microloading effects (as a consequence of structure spacing) and the angle formed towards the (100) plane.	debian;electron;etching (microfabrication);evaporation;flask;maxima and minima;open system (computing);uninterruptible power supply	Tiago S.

A special apparatus was developed to fulfill deep magnetic targeting. Due to special shape of poles and magnetic shields, the magnetic field produced by this apparatus was stronger at the center of the air gap than any other place along two directions. The magnetic field could make deep capturing along these directions. To test the aggregation property of this apparatus, the accumulation of 500-nm paramagnetic particles was observed as flowing through a tube served as a model of blood vessels. The relationship of the accumulation of the paramagnetic particles and effectiveness of the magnetic shielding was studied.

189edb7f20061a645fcd912fe4c6375ed0f2e15f	evaluation of apple maturity with two types of dielectric probes	apple shelf-life;dielectric dispersion;dielectric probe	The observed dielectric spectrum of ripe apples in the last period of shelf-life was analyzed using a multipole dielectric relaxation model, which assumes three active relaxation processes: primary α-process (water relaxation) and two secondary processes caused by solid-water-ion interactions α' (bound water relaxations), as well as β' (Maxwell-Wagner effect). The performance of two designs of the dielectric probe was compared: a classical coaxial open-ended probe (OE probe) and an open-ended probe with a prolonged central conductor in a form of an antenna (OE-A-probe). The OE-A probe increases the measurement volume and consequently extends the range of applications to other materials, like granulated agricultural products, soils, or liquid suspensions. However, its measurement frequency range is limited as compared to the OE probe because, above 1.5 GHz, the probe with the antenna generates higher propagation modes and the applied calibrations and calculations are not sufficient. It was shown that data from measurements using the OE-A probe gave slightly stronger correlations with apples' quality parameters than using the typical OE probe. Additionally, we have compared twelve multipole fitting models with different combinations of poles (eight three-pole and four two-pole models). It was shown that the best fit is obtained using a two-pole model for data collected for the OE-A probe and a three-pole model for the OE probe, using only Cole-Cole poles in both cases.	antenna device component;calibration;capability maturity model;curve fitting;dyskeratosis congenita;estrone 3-oleate;excretory function;frequency band;fruit;heart rate variability;interaction;ions;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;maxwell (microarchitecture);nonlinear gameplay;oersted (unit of measure);perceived quality of life;skin (computing);software propagation;soil;spatial variability;standard deviation;suspensions;twice (numerical qualifier)	Marcin Kafarski;Andrzej Wilczek;Agnieszka Szyplowska;Arkadiusz Lewandowski;Piotr Mariusz Pieczywek;Grzegorz Janik;Wojciech Skierucha	2018		10.3390/s18010121	computational physics;conductor;calibration;engineering;analytical chemistry;dielectric;coaxial;bound water;measurement frequency;multipole expansion	Metrics	91.6191311638972	-21.48516603688893	164446
19e4e000745fe60f2da0661889306d14689b1c0c	fpga based moving objects controller using remote distance sensors		In this work, the change of sound wave speed by temperature is used in order to improve accuracy of ultrasonic distance measurement. Ambient temperature directly effects air density, thus air density effects sound wave speed. However most of ultrasonic distance measurement system assumes the sound speed is a constant. With this work, lower error rated system is suggested by considering adaptively changing soundwave speed according to ambient temperature. For the experimental work, a physical area is set and the ambient temperature is fluctuant changing, so several measurements performed with suggested and common way. In these conditions, highly sensitive sensors are used to measure ambient temperature and new soundwave speed is calculated for the temperature. When process repeated with new soundwave speed, it is observed that measurement accuracy is improved.	field-programmable gate array;sensor	Oguzhan Kemal Gultekin;Hakan Erdol;Mehmet Ali Çavuslu	2017		10.1109/SIU.2017.7960688	computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;field-programmable gate array;speed of sound;density of air;control theory;temperature measurement;electronic engineering;accuracy and precision;ultrasonic sensor;electrical engineering	Robotics	89.7845912351787	-22.333147822191503	164593

Sensitive and rapid detection methods to assess product safety before retail distribution are highly desirable. Since Salmonella is most commonly associated with poultry products, an evanescent wave fiber-optic assay was developed to detect Salmonella in shell egg and chicken breast and data were compared with a time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) assay. Anti-Salmonella polyclonal antibody was immobilized onto the surface of an optical fiber using biotin-avidin interactions to capture Salmonella. Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody (MAb 2F-11) was used as the reporter. Detection occurred when an evanescent wave from a laser (635 nm) excited the Alexa Fluor and the fluorescence was measured by a laser-spectrofluorometer at 710 nm. The biosensor was specific for Salmonella and the limit of detection was established to be 10(3) cfu/mL in pure culture and 10(4) cfu/mL with egg and chicken breast samples when spiked with 10(2) cfu/mL after 2-6 h of enrichment. The results indicate that the performance of the fiber-optic sensor is comparable to TRF, and can be completed in less than 8 h, providing an alternative to the current detection methods.	avidin;biotin;colony-forming unit;evanescent field;eye;fibrin split products;fluor vaginalis trichomonal or due to trichomonas vaginalis;fluorescence;gene ontology term enrichment;interaction;optical fiber;pathogenic organism;salmonella xxx cult;salmonella infections;tissue fiber;polyclonal antibody	Angela M.

Piezoresistive composites are one of the most widely employed materials for this purpose, combining simple and low cost preparation with high flexibility and conformability to surfaces, low power consumption, and the use of simple read-out electronics. This work provides a review on the different type of composite materials, classified according to the conduction mechanism and analyzing the physics behind it. In particular piezoresistors, strain gauges, percolative and quantum tunnelling devices are reviewed here, with a perspective overview on the most used filler types and polymeric matrices. A description of the state-of-the-art of the tactile sensor solutions from the point of view of the architecture, the design and the performance is also reviewed, with a perspective outlook on the main promising applications.	architecture as topic;classification;conditioning (psychology);conflict (psychology);converter device component;dimensions;electric capacitance;emitter device component;field electron emission;filler (substance);hysteresis;infectious bursal disease virus ag:prthr:pt:bursa of fabricius:ord:immune diffusion;lambert's cosine law;manuscripts;microsoft outlook for mac;multi-function printer;percolation theory;performance;point of view (computer hardware company);polymers;polyradiculopathy;population parameter;quantum tunnelling;reaching;repeatability;requirement;robot;robot (device);robotic materials;solutions;star filler;tactile sensor;transduction (machine learning);transistor;transistors;tunneling protocol;sensor (device)	Stefano Stassi;Valentina Cauda;Giancarlo Canavese;Candido F.

These materials are applied in liquid form, cured at elevated temperatures and then cooled down to room temperature. During these processing steps residual stresses are built up resulting from both cure and thermal shrinkage. In order to minimize these stresses inorganic fillers are added. These fillers have several opposing effects on the residual stresses because they decrease the cure shrinkage and thermal contraction but increase the modulus below and above the glass transition temperature. In this paper an extensive study on the cure-dependent rubbery moduli of a series of silica spheres filled epoxy resins is carried out both experimentally and theoretically. Low frequency dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to measure the rubbery modulus build-up during cure. A model based on scaling analysis was applied to describe the evolution of the rubbery shear modulus. The effect of the filler percentage on the rubbery shear and bulk moduli as well as the coefficients of thermal expansion were measured and compared with models from the theory of particulate-filled composites. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is critical to monitor the concentration of hydrogen sulfide. Multivariate optical computing (MOC) is a method that can monitor analytes while minimizing responses to interferences. MOC is a technique by which an analogue calculation is performed entirely in the optical domain, which simplifies instrument design, prevents the drift of a calibration, and increases the strength and durability of spectroscopic instrumentation against physical perturbation when used for chemical detection and identification. This paper discusses the detection of hydrogen-sulfide gas in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region in the presence of interfering gaseous species. A laboratory spectroscopic measurement system was set up to acquire the UV spectra of H₂S and interference gas mixtures in high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. These spectra were used to guide the design and fabrication of a multivariate optical element (MOE), which has an expected measurement relative accuracy of 3.3% for H₂S, with a concentration in the range of 0⁻150 nmol/mL. An MOC validation system with the MOE was used to test three samples of H₂S and mercaptans mixtures under various pressures, and the relative accuracy of H₂S measurement was determined to be 8.05%.	analog;calibration;computation (action);data collection;durability (database systems);experiment;flow;instrument - device;interference (communication);mickey;moe;odor:type:pt:wound.exudate:nom;odors;one thousand;optical trap;optical computing;preparation;prototype;revision procedure;sensor;stationary process;sulfhydryl compounds;sulfides;symantec endpoint protection;system of measurement;analyte;mixture;negative regulation of hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process;part per million (ppm);pump (device)	Bin Dai;Christopher Michael Jones;Megan Pearl;Mickey Pelletier;Mickey Myrick	2018		10.3390/s18072006	analytical chemistry;hydrogen sulfide;engineering;optical computing;multivariate statistics	Metrics	95.73735472765944	-18.487603580621226	165271

Such transient states are caused by electric pulse with high energy and short time of duration. It leads to short but the very violent temperature increase and – as result – defects or parameter changes of active layer. The mathematical function which describes the instantaneous temperature changes was presented in this paper in order to provide more accurate analysis of reliability and thermal properties measurement problems. The two-layer structures (with different thermo-physical properties) were the subject of conducted research, especially one of them, namely heat source excited by electric pulse. Such configuration is typical for microcircuits made in hybrid technology such as LTCC (low temperature co-fired ceramic), HTCC (high temperature co-fired ceramic) as well as thick – film technology in which polymer and photoimageable (photosensitive) materials are used. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Thick film sensors (~35 μm) were fabricated that showed a highly porous interconnected structure made of high density small grained nanoparticles. Using Pt as catalyst improved sensor response and reduced the operating temperature for achieving high sensitivity because of the negative temperature coefficient observed in Pt-loaded SnO2. The highest sensor response to 1000 ppm H2 was 10,500 at room temperature with a response time of 20 s.

The proposed system solves the problem of detecting the Black Ice on various surfaces using a depth imaging sensor based on Kinect device. In some places where ice cannot be seen easily from a distance, especially in low visibility, by a human eye, it would be highly dangerous and causes slip. The designed system can detect the forming ice at a distance from 82cm up to 1.52m from the camera.

31b93225450f2f61362ba3c064863ec2870897ba	spoken dialogue system evaluation: a first framework for reporting results		A bust developing brassiere having a pair of cups made from a stiff, semi-rigid plastic fitted with rims of a relatively soft, rubbery character, adapted to fit snugly against the chest, around the breasts, and seal the cups against substantial leakage of air when the brassiere is worn. Each of the cups has an opening in its upper side, and the opening is covered by a small piece of thin resilient material partially attached to the cup above the opening, so that the piece of material lies naturally over the opening unless forced out of this position by air pressure within the cup. The brassiere is fitted with straps over the shoulders and around the back so that it can be worn in the same way as a conventional brassiere. The brassiere cups should be sufficiently large to hold the weareru0027s breasts with a certain amount of room left over. When the brassiere is worn, the natural breathing of the wearer creates a massage action on the breasts. Thus, when the wearer breathes in, her chest expands and pushes some of the air out of the cups through the upper openings covered by the resilient flaps. When the wearer breathes out, her chest contracts, and the air pressure on the outside of the cups holds the flaps in position over the openings. The flaps are not held tightly over the openings, however, so that some air leaks into the cups, to repressurize them, as the wearer is breathing outward.	dialog system;spoken dialog systems	Norman M.

This paper presents the modelling and simulation of non-kinematical conical roll bending process with cylindrical rolls. Such process is achieved by using attachments to reduce the velocity on the area close to the top edge of the plate. In contrast with a kinematical conical roll bending machine, the driving outer rolls of a non-kinematical conical roll bending machine are allowed to slide on the plate close to the top edge. The modelling is based on finite element method under ANSYS/LSDYNA environment. The bent cones obtained from numerical simulations compare well with the desired cones. Numerical simulation investigations show that the adaptive capacity of the model is available within a range of the top–bottom radius ratio of the desired cones between 0.44 and 0.8. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Improved techniques, currently under research, permit more control over line width and shape, and make it easier for scientists to design and produce reliable radiation-tolerant microelectronic components. This ability is one of several recent advances made in plasma etching by researchers at Sandia Laboratories' Center for Radiation-hardened Microelectronics (CRM) in the USA (Figure 1). Other contributions include improved insight into the fundamental chemistry and physics of reactive ion etching (a specific type of plasma etching), and identification of a variety of ways to enhance chip reliability, radiation hardness, and miniaturization.	integrated circuit;plasma active;plasma etching;radiation hardening;reactive-ion etching;semiconductor	J.

7e234a0b3d57704d5f34ec4bbd315fc61c996164	effect of feed composition on cryogenic distillation precooling configurations		Abstract Precooling the feed of cryogenic distillation columns is achieved by using the cold distillate and bottoms streams. The distillate is typically removed from the top of the reflux drum as a vapor to reduce the condenser refrigeration heat duty. The bottoms stream is typically a liquid at a somewhat higher temperature than the distillate. The colder vapor distillate can only provide sensible heat removal. The warmer bottoms liquid stream can provide more heat removal because of vaporization. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the appropriate arrangement of the precooling heat exchangers depends on the column feed composition. If the feed contains little light key component, the bottoms stream is large and the feed can be easily precooled.

The high spatial resolution and fast frequency response of PSP effectively captures the spatial and temporal detail of surface pressure resulting in the acoustic pressure field. In this work, a high-speed camera is used to generate a continuous time record of the acoustic pressure fluctuations with PSP. Since the level of the acoustic pressure is near the resolution limit of the sensor system, advanced analysis techniques are used to extract the spatial modes of the pressure field. Both dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) are compared with phase averaging for data analysis. While all three techniques effectively extract the pressure field and reduce the impact of sensor noise, DMD and POD are more robust techniques that can be applied to aperiodic or multi-frequency signals. Furthermore, DMD is better than POD at suppressing noise in particular regions of the spectrum and at effectively separating spectral energy when multiple acoustic excitation frequencies are present.	acoustic cryptanalysis;active pixel sensor;algorithm;body cavities;cmos;data acquisition;excitation;frequency response;image noise;numerous;principal component analysis;resonance;small;traffic enforcement camera;yag rx mode:prid:pt:eye.left:nom	Mohd Y.

We have calculated the temporal evolution of the film flow by using the CLSVOF and GF methods, and obtained the steady state film and velocity distributions. It is found that the film flow goes inside the fluted part due to the effect of the surface tension for the fluted plate and the thickness near the fluted edge is thinner. This may lead to the heat transfer enhancement. Therefore, the temperature distribution is calculated in the thermally inlet region, which corresponds to the problem of two-phase version of the well-known Graetz-Nusselt's problem. Finally, we show the relation among the heat transfer, fluted geometries and the surface tension effect.	grammatical framework;steady state;thickness (graph theory);two-phase commit protocol;velocity (software development);whole earth 'lectronic link	Shouta Satou;Takahiro Adachi	2014	2014 4th International Conference On Simulation And Modeling Methodologies, Technologies And Applications (SIMULTECH)	10.5220/0005104306070612	engineering drawing;heat transfer	Robotics	87.37106586923709	-11.120608314687479	166684
4683f261fb24018e181d7718f52244fce723beee	photothermal activated failure mechanism in polymer-based packaging of low power ingan/gan mqw led under active storage		Article history: Received 22 May 2015 Received in revised form 15 June 2015 Accepted 23 June 2015 Available online xxxx GaN-based LEDs often use polymermaterial as chip coating. The most used polymer coatings are siloxane-based materials such as poly(methyl-phenyl-silixane) – PMPS – or poly(dimethylsiloxane) — PDMS. Although their thermal properties offer great possibilities to justify their integration in optoelectronic devices, pellicular effect may occur. This paper points out a pellicular failuremechanism occurring inMQWGaN-based LED submitted to active storage (1500 h/30 mA/85 °C) determined from their environment stresses. Before aging, an absorption/ reemission fluorescence process has been extracted. By performing fluorescence analysis, we have found out the cause of such mechanism coming from silicone oil (polymer coating). Additional physico-chemical analyses, consisting of H NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, have been investigated to work out the origin of the absorption/reemission process. The presence of low molecular weight molecules (LMWM) playing the role of fluorophoremolecules is responsible for it. After aging, 65% optical power losses have been reported. A combination of electro-optical characterizations andphysico-chemical analyses has led to themain failuremechanismextraction that is the molecular change of silicone oil activated by photothermal phenomenon. Such pellicular failure mechanism has been suggested to be linked to polymerization or cross-linking of silicone oil usually present in GaN-based LEDs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed design has several advantages, including high performance, low cost, low-power consumption, and high portability. A LT1789-1 low-supply-voltage instrumentation amplifier (IA) was used to measure and amplify the open-circuit potential (OCP) between the working and reference electrodes. An MSP430 micro-controller was programmed to process and transduce the signals to the custom-developed software by ZigBee RF module in wireless mode and UART in able mode. The immobilized urease sensor was prepared by embedding urease into the polymer (aniline-co-o-phenylenediamine) polymeric matrix and then coating/depositing it onto a MEMS-fabricated Au working electrode. The linear correlation established between the urea concentration and the potentiometric change is in the urea concentrations range of 3.16 × 10(-4) to 3.16 × 10(-2) M with a sensitivity of 31.12 mV/log [M] and a precision of 0.995 (R² = 0.995). This portable device not only detects urea concentrations, but can also operate continuously with a 3.7 V rechargeab-le lithium-ion battery (500 mA·h) for at least four days. Accordingly, its use is feasible and even promising for home-care applications.	aniline;coating excipient;controllers;embedding;gold;instrumentation (attribute);instrumentation amplifier;iontophoresis;lithium;low-power broadcasting;medication event monitoring system;microcontroller;microelectromechanical systems;mobile device;open core protocol;phenylenediamines;polymer;potentiometer;radio frequency;software portability;ti msp430;urea;urease;electrode	Wei-Jhe Ma;Ching-Hsing Luo;Jiun-Ling Lin;Sin-Houng Chou;Ping-Hung Chen;Mei-Jywan Syu;Shin-Hung Kuo;Shin-Chi Lai	2016		10.3390/s16040474	biochemistry;electronic engineering;chemistry;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;potentiometric titration	Mobile	94.97739781843825	-18.98848559139307	167230

In a regular document inkjet printer, the main task of the media positioning drive is to shift the medium after the printhead has finished a pass. Most media have the tendency to deform while it is being printed due to variations in temperature and moisture content. In order to improve print quality, we propose to move the medium during printing to counteract the deformation. These small scale trajectories are performed in an operating regime of which the dynamics considerably differ from the regular transportation step. Using iterative learning control with basis functions for both positioning tasks, the positioning accuracy of the drive is improved substantially; while keeping numerical cost low.	3d printing;basis function;control theory;iterative method;numerical analysis;printer (computing);printing	Joost Bolder;Bas P.

63a29837ca7579ca71de3d8bfc8aead931117286	an experimental study on static and dynamic strain sensitivity of embeddable smart concrete sensors doped with carbon nanotubes for shm of large structures	carbon nanotubes;cement-based materials;self-sensing materials;smart concrete sensors;strain sensitivity;structural health monitoring	The availability of new self-sensing cement-based strain sensors allows the development of dense sensor networks for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of reinforced concrete structures. These sensors are fabricated by doping cement-matrix mterials with conductive fillers, such as Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs), and can be embedded into structural elements made of reinforced concrete prior to casting. The strain sensing principle is based on the multifunctional composites outputting a measurable change in their electrical properties when subjected to a deformation. Previous work by the authors was devoted to material fabrication, modeling and applications in SHM. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of several sensors fabricated with and without aggregates and with different MWCNT contents. The strain sensitivity of the sensors, in terms of fractional change in electrical resistivity for unit strain, as well as their linearity are investigated through experimental testing under both quasi-static and sine-sweep dynamic uni-axial compressive loadings. Moreover, the responses of the sensors when subjected to destructive compressive tests are evaluated. Overall, the presented results contribute to improving the scientific knowledge on the behavior of smart concrete sensors and to furthering their understanding for SHM applications.	carbon dioxide;column (database);compression;cost efficiency;cut, copy, and paste;dental cement material;doping (semiconductor);doping in sports;embedded system;embedding;exposure to humidity;filler (substance);full scale;futures studies;multi-function printer;nanocomposite;nanocomposites;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;reaching;short interspersed nucleotide elements;super high material cd;contents - htmllinktype;replication compartment;sensor (device);spiromustine	Andrea Meoni;Antonella D'Alessandro;Austin Downey;Enrique García-Macías;Marco Rallini;A.

e1c52f0f60869c44d2e9488c617025aed52fb871	properties of contactless and contacted charging in mems capacitive switches		The dielectric charging in MEMS capacitive switches is a complex effect. The high electric field during pull-down causes intrinsic free charge migration and dipole orientation as well as charge injection. The macroscopic dipole moment of the first two mechanisms is opposite to the one arising from charge injection. This causes partial compensation hence mitigates the overall charging and increases the device lifetime. The charging due to intrinsic free charge migration and dipole orientation can be monitored under contactless electric field application in the pull-up state. The paper investigates the characteristics of contactless charging and compares them with the ones of contacted charging. The characteristics of the discharging process that follows each charging procedure are also presented. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In one embodiment this may be achieved by forming the edge of the electrode in an undulating shape. It may also be done by increasing the surface resistance of the electrode near its edge by, for example, forming the edge so that it is wedge-shaped in cross-section. More uniform current density may also be achieved by using an electrode which has a resistivity that is greater than that of the resistive heating layer. It may also be achieved by use of a high resistivity layer located between the electrode and the resistive heating layer.	sorting	David A.

Device quality amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H), nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si), and amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiN/sub x/) films and thin film transistors (TFTs) were made using existing industrial plasma deposition equipment at the process temperatures as low as 75/spl deg/C and 120/spl deg/C. The a-Si:H TFTs fabricated at 120/spl deg/C demonstrate performance similar to their high-temperature counterparts, including the field effect mobility (/spl mu//sub FE/) of 0.8 cm/sup 2/V/sup -1/s/sup -1/, the threshold voltage (V/sub T/) of 4.5 V, and the subthreshold slope of 0.5 V/dec, and can be used in active matrix (AM) displays including organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. The a-Si:H TFTs fabricated at 75/spl deg/C exhibit /spl mu//sub FE/ of 0.6 cm/sup 2/V/sup -1/s/sup -1/, and V/sub T/ of 4 V. It is shown that further improvement in TFT performance can be achieved by using n/sup +/ nc-Si contact layers and plasma treatments of the interface between the gate dielectric and the channel layer. The results demonstrate that with appropriate process optimization, the large area thin film Si technology suits well the fabrication of electronic devices on low-cost plastic substrates.	am broadcasting;active matrix;chemical vapor deposition;diode;field effect (semiconductor);flexible electronics;gate dielectric;mathematical optimization;oled;physical vapor deposition;plasma active;plasma display;process optimization;semiconductor;series and parallel circuits;software bug;thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	Andrei Sazonov;Denis Striakhilev;Czang-Ho Lee;Arokia Nathan	2005	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2005.851497	electronic engineering;thin-film transistor;oled;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;physics	EDA	92.40443008750614	-11.112976730861803	167382

Specifically, devices with Pd Schottky contacts were fabricated with: (1) un-doped ZnO active layers; (2) Pd-doped ZnO active layers; and (3) un-doped ZnO layers on top of Pd microstructure arrays. All ZnO films were grown on p-type Si(111) substrates by the sol-gel method. For devices incorporating a microstructure array, Pd islands were first grown on the substrate by thermal evaporation using a 100 μm mesh shadow mask. We have estimated the sensitivity of the sensors for applied voltage from −5 to 5 V in air ambient, as well as with exposure to LPG in concentrations from 500 to 3,500 ppm at room temperature (300 K). The current-voltage characteristics were studied and parameters such as leakage current, barrier height, reach-through voltage, and flat-band voltage were extracted. We include contributions due to the barrier height dependence on the electric field and tunneling through the barrier for the studied MSM devices. The Pd-enhanced devices demonstrated a maximum gas response at flat-band voltages. The study also revealed that active layers consisting of Pd microstructure embedded ZnO films resulted in devices exhibiting greater gas-response as compared to those using Pd-doped ZnO thin films or un-doped active layers.

bf062ac2e4b0c60646cca3cc156117e47a6dbf1d	review of the strain modulation methods used in fiber bragg grating sensors		Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is inherently sensitive to temperature and strain. By modulating FBG&#x2019;s strain, various FBG sensors have been developed, such as sensors with enhanced or reduced temperature sensitivity, strain/displacement sensors, inclinometers, accelerometers, pressure meters, and magnetic field meters. This paper reviews the strain modulation methods used in these FBG sensors and categorizes them according to whether the strain of an FBG is changed evenly. Then, those even-strain-change methods are subcategorized into (1) attaching/embedding an FBG throughout to a base and (2) fixing the two ends of an FBG and (2.1) changing the distance between the two ends or (2.2) bending the FBG by applying a transverse force at the middle of the FBG. This review shows that the methods of &#x201c;fixing the two ends&#x201d; are prominent because of the advantages of large tunability and frequency modulation.	modulation;sensor	Kuo Li	2016	J.

661d0c2e8428b65d10ba402696b8576bc582c17b	estimation of mutual induction eddy current testing method using horizontal exciting coil and spiral search coil		The mutual induction type eddy current testing using a spiral type search coil is one of the eddy current testing (ECT). In this type ECT probe, since the thickness of a spiral search coil is very thin, the distance (lift-off: L o) between the ECT probe and the specimen is able to set small. Therefore, the high detection sensitivity is obtained. However, since the wire is coiled in the shape of spiral, the evaluation of the flux density inside the spiral search coil is made difficult by experiment. Moreover, the phenomenon elucidation of inspection using this ECT probe is not carried out. In this paper, the inspection characteristic of a surface defect on an aluminum plate using this probe was investigated by 3-D alternating electromagnetic finite element method (FEM). Moreover, the evaluation in consideration of the characteristic of the spiral search coil in this ECT probe is also investigated by (1 + 1) evolution strategy. It is shown that high detection sensitivity is obtained using the spiral search coil.	mutual exclusion	Tatsuya Marumoto;Yuta Motoyasu;Yuji Gotoh;Tatsuo Hiroshima	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-43506-0_65	search coil;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;electromagnetic coil	Robotics	91.11467184239778	-15.953766558945834	168692

The assay time ranges from about 30 min to 3 h, depending on accuracy. The deflection of the microcantilever due to specific CRP-antiCRP binding is detected using a position-sensitive detector. The converted bio-signal is transmitted by a custom designed wireless amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) transceiver IC fabricated in a 0.18 mum CMOS process. CRP concentrations from 1 mug/mL to 500 mug/mL can be detected. A 0.2-Hz 1-V ac signal instead of traditional bases/acids is applied to the bio-MEMS sensor to unbind the CRP from the microcantilever for reusability.	amplitude-shift keying;base;british informatics olympiad;c-reactive protein measurement;cmos;detectors;key (cryptography);maxima and minima;microelectromechanical systems;position sensitive device;shift-work sleep disorder;transceiver device component;tritium;disease transmission	Chun-Hao Chen;Rong-Zhang Hwang;Long-Sun Huang;Shi-Ming Lin;Hsiao-Chin Chen;Yu-Che Yang;Yu-Tso Lin;Shih-An Yu;Yo-Sheng Lin;Yiao-Hong Wang;Nai-Kuan Chou;Shey-Shi Lu	2006	2006 IEEE International Solid State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/TBME.2008.2003262	cantilever;embedded system;reusability;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;lab-on-a-chip;computer science;electrical engineering;microelectromechanical systems;cmos;bio-mems;nanomechanics;biosensor;transceiver;molecular biophysics	Robotics	94.98727308765913	-18.97039611696671	168804

82da62d0f50e85c05fe01e79e4a5e5c9580dbf19	simple models of central heating system with heat exchangers in the quasi-static conditions		A characteristic element of heating systems is heat exchanger dedicated to efficient heat transfer from one medium to another. The paper presents simple models of a heating system with heat exchangers designed for studies of control systems based on a control of heat carriers flow. Presented studies are necessary for a development of new control strategies in heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Three variants of heat exchangers models were examined – a typical model containing the logarithmic mean of temperatures, a model including assumptions about the arithmetic mean of temperatures and a model with an assumption of perfect mixing of medium in an exchanger. Usefulness of the models in designing of control systems was verified under quasi-static conditions.

The possibility of using alternative materials has been investigated for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) because of the increased importance of scatter and more complex imaging geometries. We have investigated the use of PMMA in combination with polyethylene (PE) to simulate a range of typical breasts using a computation model of the imaging system. The scatter-to-primary ratios (SPRs) of both breast and phantom were also investigated and a difference up to 18% is found. Neglecting this difference in SPR in designing phantoms for DBT may lead to dosimetry errors. Taking into account estimated SPR values and relevant X-ray spectra, a combination of PMMA-PE slabs has been proposed to simulate typical breasts of thicknesses 30, 60 and 90 mm. The dosimetric error associated with using these phantoms for relevant X-ray spectra is less than 10%.	tomosynthesis	Ramona Bouwman;Oliver Díaz;Kenneth C. Young;Ruben E. van Engen;Wouter J. H.

c6ce4c4bef99ecb5cc36cfce71565defa98bc3e8	electromigration behavior of dual-damascene cu interconnects--structure, width, and length dependences	reliability assessment;layered structure;failure mechanism;electromigration;median time to failure	Experiments were performed to study the effect of line width and length, and the results revealed interesting differences in electromigration behavior of via-fed upper and lower layer dual-damascene test structures. The observed location of electromigration induced void in upper and lower layer test structures cannot be completely explained by the theory of current gradient induced vacancy diffusion. The electromigration median time to failure (MTF) were found to be dependent upon the line width for the lower layer test structures while it remained unaffected in the case of upper layer test structure. Cu/dielectric cap interface acting as the dominant electromigration path and the current crowding location being near the Cu/dielectric cap interface for lower layer structures due to structural differences, explain this behavior. Similarly, short length upper and lower layer test structures exhibited completely different characteristics. The back stress effect on short lines was evident on both upper and lower layer structures, however, only the upper layer showed two distinct via and line failure mechanisms. These observed effects are specific to Cu dual-damascene structures and can have major technological implications for electromigration reliability assessment.	electrical connection;electromigration	A.

In this Spice study, the thermal behavior of 6H-SiC NMOS transistors is analyzed through their conductance and transconductance changes with temperature in the range 200 to 700 1C. The performances in two basic applications, current mirrors and differential amplifiers, are compared to similar circuits with silicon transistors.

However, the Fenton-like reaction system using heavy metal ions in wastewater to decompose organics seems a promising method, which would have a positive effect on pollution reduction and wastes re-utilization. This paper is set out to comparatively study the effectiveness of UV/H2O2/metal ion systems on a representative substrate as Rhodamine B. Results show that the UV/Cu2+/H2O2 system exhibited high degradation efficiency on Rhodamine B which was completely degraded in 30 min. Also the degradation obeyed first-order kinetic equation. Furthermore, influences of Cu2+ concentration, methods of H2O2 addition, pH and UV radiation on RhB degradation were studied, respectively, for the UV/Cu2+/H2O2 system. Optimal reaction conditions were found to be [Cu2+]=0.324 mmol/L, [H2O2]=0.118 mmol/L and ways of adding H2O2 by two or more times rather than one, pH=3, necessity of UV radiation. Moreover, the coexistence of Mn2+ with UV/Cu2+/H2O2 enhanced the degradation efficiency.	elegant degradation	Jun Hong;Chengcheng Wu;Sijia Lu;Yanping Cui	2009		10.1109/ESIAT.2009.301	kinetic theory;degradation;environmental engineering;pollution;environmental chemistry;environmental degradation;metal;copper;waste management;ecology;iron;recycling;wastewater	Robotics	94.95335688550493	-11.155040548375629	170399
ec366b13b2b11f0c93e29996ebcb41b7c451443c	springback compensation for a vehicle's steel body panel		This paper analyses the structural element of a vehicle which is made fromHigh Strength Steels. Application of this kind of material considerably reduces construction mass due to its high durability. Nevertheless, it also results in the appearance of springback that dependsmainly on thematerial used, as well as the specific part being fabricated. Springback reduction helps to reach the reference geometry of the element by using Finite ElementMethod software. The authors compared twomethods for optimisation of die shape. The first method defines the compensation of the die shape only for OP-20 and the second, multi-operational, method defines the compensation of the die shape for the OP-20 and OP-50 operations. Prediction of springback by the trial-and-errormethod is difficult and labour intensive. The design of dies requires the use of the appropriate FEM software to make the dies more economical and less time consuming. Virtual compensation methods make it possible to receive precise results in a short time. Die compensation with software application was experimentally verified by the prototype die. Therefore, springback deformation becomes a critical problem especially for HSS steel when the geometry is complex.

Once the stopper mechanism 10 is secured in place, the toilet bowl 40 is filled with water up to the rim 80. A cleaning solution 120 is then added to the water in the toilet bowl 40 and allowed to remain for a desired length of time soaking and cleaning the toilet bowl 40 as it sits.	graph rewriting;unified modeling language	Elhillali Kerkouche;Allaoua Chaoui;El-Bay Bourennane;Ouassila Labbani	2009			computer science;theoretical computer science;graph rewriting	SE	82.94598390408623	-19.346860754100074	170531

d04050e1f71ffa80b7f21649eb0406805dd70321	effects of sulfur addition on the wettability and corrosion resistance of sn-0.7cu lead-free solder		Abstract The effects of sulfur on the wettability of Sn-0.7Cu on Cu and on the corrosion behavior of Sn-0.7Cu in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution were investigated. The results reveal that sulfur considerably improves the wettability of Sn-0.7Cu and the optimal sulfur content is 0.08 wt%. SnS and SnSO 4 phases form on the surface of the sulfur containing Sn-0.7Cu solder alloy after soldering characterized by XPS and XRD analysis. The addition of sulfur decreases the dross formation of the solder melt and the formation of SnO 2 is inhibited. The potentiodynamic polarization tests show that the corrosion resistance of Sn-0.7Cu solder alloy is obviously enhanced by sulfur element. Analyses by SEM and XRD indicate that sulfur promotes the formation of the corrosion product, Sn 3 O(OH) 2 Cl 2 , on the surface of sulfur containing Sn-0.7Cu solder and it keeps the solder alloy from further corrosion.

36f71dde25a045c4dddaf90a3a141efe4c56565a	optimization of an optical test bench for tire properties measurement and tread defects characterization	sensors;tire;contact pressure;frustrated total internal reflection	Tire characteristics and behavior are of great importance in vehicle dynamics since the forces transmitted in the tire-road contact are the main contributors to global vehicle performance. Several research groups have focused on the study and modeling of tires. Some of the most important factors that need to be known are tread characteristics and pressure distribution in the tire-ground contact patch. In this work, a test bench has been used to adequately determine the aforementioned factors. The measurement principle of the test bench is the frustration of total internal reflection (FTIR) of light. It makes use of a laterally illuminated glass on which the tire leans. An interposed plastic interface between them causes the reflection of light. Finally, a video camera captures the bright image formed through the glass. The brightness level in each pixel of the image is related to existing normal pressure. A study of the parameters that affect the test bench calibration such as type of interface material used, diffuse light, hysteresis, creep and transverse light absorption is performed. Experimental tests are conducted to relate tire inflation pressure and camber angle to the pressure distribution. Furthermore, the test bench is used to detect and evaluate the influence of defects in the tire on the contact pressures.	calibration;hysteresis;instruction creep;interface device component;photophobia;pixel;spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;test bench;transverse wave;webcam;brightness;disease transmission	Juan Jesús Castillo Aguilar;Juan Antonio Cabrera Carrillo;Antonio Jesús Guerra Fernández;Sergio Postigo Pozo	2017		10.3390/s17040707	structural engineering;simulation;total internal reflection;engineering;sensor;tire;optics;tire uniformity;forensic engineering;physics	Robotics	88.7138173044883	-21.274787980468904	171056

However, the scanning range of conventional AFM systems hardly exceeds hundreds of micrometers due to the piezoelectric actuation. In this research, we develop a large scanning-range AFM system with a z-scanner separated from the xy-scanner. The z-scanner actuated by piezoelectric stack provides high speed scanning and the homemade xy-scanner actuated by electromagnetic actuation is capable of 2 mm×2 mm large field positioning with 17 nm rms error. The overall AFM system consists of a commercial piezoelectric positioner, four sets of electromagnetic actuator, a monolithic parallel compliant mechanism, and an eddy current damper. Moreover, a compact disk/digital versatile disk pick-up-head (CD/DVD PUH) is applied to measure the amplitude of the cantilever. Furthermore, we design an adaptive complementary sliding mode controller to deal with the unknown parameters, unmodeled system uncertainties, and the external disturbances. Finally, preliminary experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed system.	image resolution;piezoelectricity;topography	Kuan-Chia Huang;Jim-Wei Wu;Jyun-Jhih Chen;Chih-Lieh Chen;Mei-Yung Chen;Li-Chen Fu	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426057	cantilever;control engineering;electronic engineering;atomic force microscopy;engineering;shock absorber;control theory	Robotics	89.02966605564845	-19.07661007535298	171176

The evaluation of the THz wave performance in the applications requires supportive THz based devices such as emitter, detectors and filters. The efficient integration of the THz devices with the state of the art silicon based devices is limited by its typical diffraction limit (millimeters). In this abstract, a subwavelength Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) based Bragg reflector is using Indium antimonide (InSb), Silicon-dioxide (SiO2) and Porous-SiO2, is proposed. The SPPs based wave propagation at THz allows the nanoscale realization of the THz based devices. The proposed plasmonic Bragg reflector utilizes the periodic changes of the dielectric material in the core layer, while InSb is used in the cladding layer.

In this paper, we designed a planar microfluidic reactor which can overcome the limitations of mass transfer and photon transfer in the previous photocatalytic reactors and improve the photoreaction efficiency by 2 orders of magnitude. The microreactor consisted of two TiO2-coated glass slides and a microstructured UV-cured NOA81 layer, forming a planar chamber (5 cm × 1.8 cm × 100 µm). In our studies, methylene blue (MB) was used as the model chemical. 3 ml MB solution (3×10−5 M) was degraded by more than 60% within 15 min using the microfluidic reactor, and the reaction rate constant was found to be 100 times higher than that by using the bulk reactor. The photodegradation performance of the microreactor was also optimized by adjusting the TiO2 film thickness and flow rate and achieved a reaction rate of 8% s−1 under solar irradiation.	3d film;deep blue (chess computer);maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;performance evaluation;planar (computer graphics);reactor (software);thickness (graph theory)	Nana Wang;Lei Lei;Xuming Zhang;Helen L.

e839c5ed51bc301d528615137fad55172fd5823f	highlighting the distribution path of transient disturbances by near field scanning techniques		Many different measurement techniques are currently available to characterize the electromagnetic compatibility of electronic devices and systems. One of these techniques is known as the so-called “Surface Scan Method”. It is based on a near-field scanning technique and enables the visualization of the distribution of magnetic near field being present at the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs). This technique provides an efficient way to find the sources of electromagnetic emission problems, as it can be used to pinpoint areas on the PCB which are usually the sources of the electromagnetic emission. In this paper it will be shown how such a surface scan technique can additionally be used to visualize the distribution path of transient disturbance currents. Such current surges can be caused by touching the PCB and thereby causing an electrostatic discharge directly into e.g. the connectors of the PCB.	near field communication	Bernd Deutschmann;Sandra Schindlbacher;Gunter Winkler	2016	Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik	10.1007/s00502-015-0382-6	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	HCI	89.79716672609894	-19.80841084358152	171260

The latter results in a so-called smart structure. One example of a smart structure is a component with integrated strain sensing for continuous load monitoring. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, now also enables such integration of functions inside components. As a proof-of-concept, the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique was used to integrate a strain sensing element inside polymer (ABS) tensile test samples. The strain sensing element consisted of a closed capillary filled with a fluid and connected to an externally mounted pressure sensor. The volumetric deformation of the integrated capillary resulted in pressure changes in the fluid. The obtained pressure measurements during tensile testing are reported in this paper and compared to state-of-the-art extensometer measurements. The sensitivity of the 3D printed pressure-based strain sensor is primarily a function of the compressibility of the capillary fluid. Air- and watertightness are of critical importance for the proper functioning of the 3D printed pressure-based strain sensor. Therefore, the best after-treatment procedure was selected on basis of a comparative analysis. The obtained pressure measurements are linear with respect to the extensometer readings, and the uncertainty on the strain measurement of a capillary filled with water (incompressible fluid) is ±3.1 µstrain, which is approximately three times less sensitive than conventional strain gauges (±1 µstrain), but 32 times more sensitive than the same sensor based on air (compressible fluid) (±101 µstrain).	3d printing;additive model;calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease;capillary vessel;chemical vapor deposition;fill;finite difference method;fused filament fabrication;polymer;pressure sensor device component;qualitative comparative analysis;reading (activity)	Michaël Hinderdael;Zoé Jardon;Margot Lison;Dieter de Baere;Wim Devesse;Maria Strantza;Patrick Guillaume	2017		10.3390/s17020328	structural engineering;3d printing;forensic engineering	HCI	90.88102755460936	-18.866954476233204	171561

At present, the commercial gas sensor technologies comprise metal oxide semiconductors, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors, organic conducting polymers, and piezoelectric crystal sensors. Further sensors based on fibreoptic, electrochemical and bi-metal principles are still in the developmental stage. Statistical analysis techniques range from simple graphical evaluation to multivariate analysis such as artificial neural network and radial basis function. The introduction of electronic noses into the area of food is envisaged for quality control, process monitoring, freshness evaluation, shelf-life investigation and authenticity assessment. Considerable work has already been carried out on meat, grains, coffee, mushrooms, cheese, sugar, fish, beer and other beverages, as well as on the odor quality evaluation of food packaging material. This paper describes the applications of these systems for meat quality assessment, where fast detection methods are essential for appropriate product management. The results suggest the possibility of using this new technology in meat handling."""	agaricales;artificial neural network;behavior;calibration;cheese;coffee;cosmetics;electronic nose;field effect (semiconductor);halitosis;handling (psychology);hybrid system;instrument - device;irritants;mammals;multivariate analysis;numerous;odors;online and offline;pattern recognition;piezoelectricity;radial (radio);radial basis function;replay attack;selectivity (electronic);semiconductor;semiconductors;sensitivity and specificity;smell perception;specimen source codes - quality control;sugars;transducer;transducers;transistor;metal oxide;mixture;sensor (device)	Mahdi Ghasemi-Varnamkhasti;Seyed Saeid Mohtasebi;Maryam Siadat;Sundar Balasubramanian	2009		10.3390/s90806058	food science;sensory analysis;computer science;engineering;sensor;nanotechnology;biological engineering;artificial neural network	HCI	96.20811730952315	-19.080800743972407	172697

The SEG process could be explained in conjunction with the loading effect, the mask pattern shape/size, and the process parameters of RPCVD. The growth rates showed a large non-uniformity up to 40% depending upon the pattern size of the dielectric mask films, but as the SEG film becomes thicker, the growth rate difference converged on -15% between the narrow 2-μm and the wide 100-μm patterns. The evolution of SEG was controlled dominantly by the surface migration control at the initial stage, and converted to the surface topology control. The design of pattern size and distribution with dummy patterns must be useful to accomplish the reliable and uniform LT-SEG.	epitaxy;silicon-germanium	A-Ram Choi;Sang-Sik Choi;Byung-Guan Park;Dongwoo Suh;Gyungock Kim;Jin-Tae Kim;Jin-Soo Choi;Deok Ho Cho;Tae-Hyun Han;Kyu-Hwan Shim	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e91-c.5.767	electronic engineering;epitaxy;nanotechnology;engineering drawing;physics	Vision	92.73131492515907	-11.404297491165615	172898

The crosstalk of cores shows different diameter dependence although the difference in core parameters is very small. The behavior is explained by taking into account the change of propagation constant caused by the fluctuation in the diameter and the refractive index of cores. The diameter dependence simulated with coupled-power theory shows the same tendency with the measured crosstalk.	bending stiffness;crosstalk;experiment;meta content framework;multi-core processor;propagation constant;quantum fluctuation;software propagation	Shoichiro Matsuo;Katsuhiro Takenaga;Yoko Arakawa;Yusuke Sasaki;Shoji Tanigawa;Kunimasa Saitoh;Masanori Koshiba	2011	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.8.385	electronic engineering;crosstalk;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;distributed computing;engineering drawing	Theory	88.9889144407811	-10.43470924879407	172976

d93ec5584887f98283303231ce9cd0ff862fd528	a novel acoustic filtering sensor for real-time tension monitoring of hoist wire ropes	acoustic filtering sensor;filtering characteristics;real-time tension monitoring;structural and acoustic parameters	The real-time tension monitoring of wire ropes is a universal way to judge whether the hoist is overloaded in the special working environment of the coal mine. However, due to the strong drafts, unevenness of guide and flexible vibration of wire ropes, it is a challenge to monitor the tension with high accuracy. For this purpose, a new type of acoustic filtering sensor is designed in this study. To adapt to the violent vibration during the monitoring process, a structure with a cylindrical cavity and a narrow gap is designed in the sensor. The coupling between the internal fluid and sensor structure can greatly absorb the vibration energy. With the view of optimizing the filtering performance of the sensor, the influences on the filtering characteristics are presented and analyzed through employing different structural and acoustic parameters in simulations. Finally, acoustic filtering sensor prototypes based on optimized parameters are calibrated and tested in a real coal mine. The results have revealed that our acoustic filtering sensor can not only address the deficiencies of current pressure sensors in coal mining and achieve tension monitoring in real-time, but is also able to diagnose and forecast the occurrence of tension imbalance accidents.	acoustic cryptanalysis;anthracosis;behavioral tic;body cavities;chara;coal;conflict (psychology);excretory function;experiment;integrated services;javascript syntax;new type;optimization problem;projections and predictions;real-time clock;simulation;sion's minimax theorem;tellurium;tension;moira protein, drosophila;sensor (device)	Xiaoguang Zhang;Beatrice A Windmöller;Jianpu Da;Janell Chen	2018		10.3390/s18092864	engineering;filter (signal processing);electronic engineering;hoist (device)	Mobile	91.86603430823338	-20.62444983752215	173318
64d6a535a3999800beb06f43a8d4d39ad79d67fd	finite-element-analysis of the relationship between chip geometry and stress triaxiality distribution in the chip breakage location of metal cutting operations	stress state;chip geometry;chip breakage;stress triaxiality	Chip breakage is a major machinability criterion of metal cutting operations. Favorable broken chips enable their efficient removal and prevent mechanical damages to the machined surface. Ductile failure on the chip free surface initiates chip breakage. The ductility of most materials depends on the stress triaxiality. Its relationship to the manufacturing parameters has to be understood in order to develop predictive methodologies of tool/process design. The problem can be approached by assessing the relationship between triaxiality and chip geometry, which is an integral representation of all tool/process parameters and material properties. This work presents a novel Finite-Element (FE) modeling approach of the relationship between the 3D chip geometry and the distribution of the stress triaxiality in the chip breakage location. For the derivation of the proposed approach it is shown that the stress state in the chip breakage location mainly develops during the chip bending phase. The approach enables for the first time to study the separate impacts of chip helical radius, helical angle, helical pitch and the shape of the deformed chip cross section on the triaxiality distribution. A sensitivity analysis of all input parameters is conducted and it is shown that all parameters but the helical pitch have characteristic impacts on the triaxiality distribution. The computational effort of the proposed modeling approach is significantly lower of than of available FE-models of metal cutting processes. The validation includes longitudinal turning experiments on steel AISI 1045 and 3D FE-process simulation modeling. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose an original thermally actuated gripper based on the use of ice to manipulate submerged artificial micro-objects sized under 100 mum. Manipulating in liquid surroundings can indeed be more interesting than in dry conditions. A comparative analysis on the impact of dry and liquid media on surface forces, contact forces and hydrodynamic forces shortly given first shows it. Concerning the use of ice for micromanipulation, cryogenic grippers are a flexible solution. Nevertheless, as they currently work in air, water must be provided by an external device and capillary force occurs during the release. Our submerged freeze microgripper takes advantages of the aqueous surroundings for the handling process as explained. The thermal principle, based on the Peltier effect, the characteristics of the microgripper prototype and the first micromanipulation tests are also presented. To control and optimize the heat exchanges in the developed gripper, a static thermal model using electrical analogy has been developed and validated for the Peltier elements and a 3D heat sink of the gripper. Further work will focus on the dynamic equivalent electric model.	finite element method;heat sink;peripheral;prototype;qualitative comparative analysis;robot end effector;steady state;thickness (graph theory)	Beatriz Lopez Walle;Michaël Gauthier;Nicolas Chaillet	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363088	structural engineering;qualitative comparative analysis;heat exchanger;heat sink;nanotechnology;surface force;contact force;cryogenics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	85.63816722534499	-15.536855831410195	173501

For sensor electrodes, we used commercially available BDD, Ag, and Pt plate electrodes. We tested this approach on a hybrid species in the genus Opuntia (potted) and three different trees (ground-planted) at different places in Japan. For the Opuntia, we artificially induced bioelectric potential changes by the surface potential using the fingers. We detected substantial changes in bioelectric potentials through all electrodes during finger touches on the surface of potted Opuntia hybrid plants, although the BDD electrodes were several times more sensitive to bioelectric potential change compared to the other electrodes. Similarly for ground-planted trees, we found that both BDD and Pt electrodes detected bioelectric potential change induced by changing environmental factors (temperature and humidity) for months without replacing/removing/changing electrodes, BDD electrodes were 5-10 times more sensitive in this detection than Pt electrodes. Given these results, we conclude that BDD electrodes on live plant tissue were able to consistently detect bioelectrical potential changes in plants.	anemia, diamond-blackfan;brachydactyly, type d;boron;diamond;doping (semiconductor);exposure to humidity;fingers, unit of measurement;genus;optical amplifier;opuntia;potting (electronics);silver;trees (plant);electrode	Tsuyoshi Ochiai;Shoko Tago;Mio Hayashi;Akira Fujishima	2015		10.3390/s151026921	boron;electronic engineering;chemistry;nanotechnology	SE	95.97195432498334	-19.07754989084005	173659

The compression step is applied to the stack of laminations at least during the time the stack is at the elevated soaking temperature of the stress-relief anneal cycle.

Additionally, NPs also offer other special properties that depend on their nanometric size, and this is also a source of new sensing applications. This review focuses on the current status of research in the use of NPs within coatings in optical fiber sensing. Most used sensing principles in fiber optics are briefly described and classified into several groups: absorbance-based sensors, interferometric sensors, fluorescence-based sensors, fiber grating sensors, and resonance-based sensors, among others. For each sensor group, specific examples of the utilization of NP-embedded coatings in their sensing structure are reported.	embedded system;magnetic storage;maxima and minima;optical fiber;resonance;response time (technology);sensor;thickness (graph theory);unified model	Aitor Urrutia;Javier Goicoechea Fernández;Francisco J.

The paper proposes an original methodology to analyze the whole system by means of a single 2d-FEA model, avoiding the need to approach very complex three-dimensional finite element simulations or co-simulation of separated bi-dimensional models. The proposed equivalent permeability method easily allows solving the problem of different stack axial lengths of the electrical machines, that represents the real limit of most of the today commercially-available 2d-FEA software. The basic theory of the proposed methodology is presented and validated by the case of study of a wound field synchronous generator excited by a rotating exciter.	co-simulation;f9 embryonic antigen gene;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;flat ductal epithelial atypia of the breast;simulation	Pei Yulong;Chai Feng;Andrea Cavagnino;Silvio Vaschetto;Alberto Tenconi	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216327	exciter;control engineering;excited state;engineering;software;permanent magnet synchronous generator;finite element method;permeability (electromagnetism)	Robotics	83.37615962808825	-12.352494899204396	173915
4f9f412f128bf1cf1163b7c464bb7de2a69cb728	microfluidic prototype of a lab-on-chip device for lung cancer diagnostics		Cell sorting for disease diagnostics is often achieved by fluorescence based identification of specific markers. However, in lung cancer diagnostics, cytological analysis of pleural fluids is not always reliable and immunofluorescence essays demand for specific sample preparation. Hence, this paper addresses the development of a microfluidic device for lung cancer diagnostics which infers on the potential of a diagnosis based on analysing the cell deformability (stiffness) that alters the rheological properties and consequently the flow characteristics. Cell deformability will be induced by external actuation. Electrowetting is used to transport the samples in an open configuration system using microdroplets. Effects of the test chip configuration, sample physico-chemical properties and potential adsorption mechanisms are discussed. Wettability plays here a vital role in the sample transport and in the diagnostic method to be tested. Hence, an innovative approach is presented, the 3D Laser Scanning Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy (3D-LSCFM) to provide a detailed reconstruction of the surface topology at the liquid-solid interface region thus allowing contact angles measurement with high spatial resolution.	3d film;3d scanner;cell (microprocessor);cell signaling;d. e. shaw research;data acquisition;electrowetting;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;item unique identification;knowledge-based configuration;prototype;sorting;video post-processing	Dalila Vieira;Filipa Mata;Ana S.

Mesa ridges with various angles between sidewall and substrate (1 0 0) plane were prepared by wet chemical etching. The QWIP structures were grown at a temperature of 700 1C by use of low-pressure MOVPE. Electrical properties and spectral sensitivity of QWIP structures prepared on tilted sidewalls were measured. Our results showed that mesa ridges confined at the sides by facets tilted at 301 to (1 0 0) were most suitable for the QWIP preparation. Asymmetry in room temperature I–V characteristics and a small photovoltaic effect observed at 77K was ascribed to asymmetric position of delta doping plane in the quantum well. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

48a661787e7532cce992c681700d2dd9952fa6b3	label-free fluorescence assay of s1 nuclease and hydroxyl radicals based on water-soluble conjugated polymers and ws2 nanosheets	s1 nuclease;ws 2 nanosheet;label free;conjugated polymers;hydroxyl radicals;fluorescent sensing	We developed a new method for detecting S1 nuclease and hydroxyl radicals based on the use of water-soluble conjugated poly[9,9-bis(6,6-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)-fluorene)-2,7-ylenevinylene-co-alt-2,5-dicyano-1,4-phenylene)] (PFVCN) and tungsten disulfide (WS₂) nanosheets. Cationic PFVCN is used as a signal reporter, and single-layer WS₂ is used as a quencher with a negatively charged surface. The ssDNA forms complexes with PFVCN due to much stronger electrostatic interactions between cationic PFVCN and anionic ssDNA, whereas PFVCN emits yellow fluorescence. When ssDNA is hydrolyzed by S1 nuclease or hydroxyl radicals into small fragments, the interactions between the fragmented DNA and PFVCN become weaker, resulting in PFVCN being adsorbed on the surface of WS₂ and the fluorescence being quenched through fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The new method based on PFVCN and WS₂ can sense S1 nuclease with a low detection limit of 5 × 10(-6) U/mL. Additionally, this method is cost-effective by using affordable WS₂ as an energy acceptor without the need for dye-labeled ssDNA. Furthermore, the method provides a new platform for the nuclease assay and reactive oxygen species, and provides promising applications for drug screening.	acceptor (semiconductors);atypical lipoma;buffers;charge (electrical);cost efficiency;dna, single-stranded;dyes;fluorescence resonance energy transfer;hydrochloric acid;hydroxyl radical;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);interaction;polymer;polymers;reactive oxygen species;sensor;sum of radicals;thiourea;tracer;tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate;tromethamine;waardenburg syndrome, type iia;wash (cleansing action);endonuclease;incubated;nuclease;tungsten	Junting Li;Qi Zhao;Yanli Tang	2016		10.3390/s16060865	biochemistry;photochemistry;chemistry;organic chemistry	Comp.	96.3455305250213	-17.301454326825993	175444

The silicon nanopillar array was prepared by nanosphere lithography. Electrical measurements were performed on its sensing performance with and without UV irradiation. It was found that UV light improved the humidity sensitivity with different UV light wavelengths and power. The sensor response and recovery time were reduced. Furthermore, the turn-on threshold voltage and the operating voltage both decreased. These sensing characteristics can mainly be attributed to the electron-hole pairs generated by UV light. These electron-hole pairs promote the adsorption and desorption processes. The results indicate that silicon nanopillar array materials with UV irradiation might be competitive as novel sensing materials for fabricating humidity sensors with high performances.	acorn electron;electron hole;exposure to humidity;immunoglobulin lambda-chains;nanospheres;performance;relative humidity:relative mass concentration:point in time:air:quantitative;silicon;silicon:scnt:pt:tiss:qn;uv mapping;ultraviolet therapy;voltage regulator module;sensor (device);wavelength	Wei Li;Chao Ding;Yun Cai;Juyan Liu;Linlin Wang;Qingying Ren;Jie Xu	2018		10.3390/s18020660	analytical chemistry;nanopillar;humidity;nanosphere lithography;engineering;adsorption;threshold voltage;electrical measurements;silicon;relative humidity	HCI	92.88436942042523	-15.743986522042873	175917

9e6983c1cb60e8588f06df71d0f682883ad081d5	performance dependence on initial free-end levitation of a magnetically levitated piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with a composite cantilever beam		"""Vibration energy harvesting by using piezoelectric materials provides a promising alternative solution for a wide range of self-powered systems. In this paper, performance dependence on initial free-end levitation position (IFLP) of a magnetically levitated piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (PVEH) with a composite cantilever beam is presented. A prototype consisting of a high-stiffness lead zirconate titanate beam with a proof mass and a flexible brass beam with a tip mass as well as an auxiliary structure adjusting repulsive magnetic force was fabricated to evaluate the IFLP effects. Experimental results showed that the performance of the magnetically levitated PVEH was varied with different IFLPs. With declining of the IFLP, the peak power output at the first resonance frequency decreased monotonically from 1541 to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$343.2~\mu \text{W}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, meanwhile, the power output initially decreased from 2735.6 to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$904.5~\mu \text{W}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and then constantly increased from 904.5 to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$2220.9~\mu \text{W}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> at the second resonance frequency. The frequency variation at the first and second resonance points was 1.5 and 4 Hz, respectively. It was found that the IFLP had a stronger impact on the performance when it was above the horizontal orientation than below the horizontal orientation. Moreover, the IFLP brought a more significant influence on the second resonance frequency than the first one. In addition, the IFLP had a larger effect on the power output than the resonance frequency."""	harvester;piezoelectricity;prototype;resonance	Zhonghua Zhang;Junwu Kan;Shuyun Wang;Hongyun Wang;Can Yang;Song Chen	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2775652	cantilever;nuclear magnetic resonance;beam (structure);piezoelectricity;computer science;levitation;magnetic levitation;resonance;distributed computing;lead zirconate titanate;vibration	HPC	89.35189506271472	-17.648100183123137	176409

The method uses a single free-standing, thermally controlled piezoresistive microcantilever biosensor. In a commonly used sensing arrangement of conventional dual cantilevers in the Wheatstone bridge circuit, reference and gold-coated sensing cantilevers that inherently have heterogeneous surface materials and different multilayer structures may yield independent responses to the liquid environmental changes of chemical substances, flow field and temperature, leading to unwanted signal disturbance for biosensing targets. In this study, the single free-standing microcantilever for biosensing applications is employed to resolve the dual-beam problem of individual responses in chemical solutions and, in a thermally controlled system, to maintain its sensor performance due to the sensitive temperature effect. With this type of single temperature-controlled microcantilever sensor, the electrical detection of various CRP concentrations from 1 µg/mL to 200 µg/mL was performed, which covers the clinically relevant range. Induced surface stresses were measured at between 0.25 N/m and 3.4 N/m with high reproducibility. Moreover, the binding affinity (KD) of CRP and anti-CRP interaction was found to be 18.83 ± 2.99 µg/mL, which agreed with results in previous reported studies. This biosensing technique thus proves valuable in detecting inflammation, and in cardiovascular disease risk assays.	biosensors;bridge circuit;c-reactive protein;cardiovascular diseases;dual;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;processor affinity;semiconductor;semiconductors;sensor;solutions;wheatstone bridge	Yi-Kuang Yen;Yu-Cheng Lai;Wei-Ting Hong;Yotsapoom Pheanpanitporn;Chuin-Shan Chen;Long-Sun Huang	2013		10.3390/s130809653	electronic engineering;chemistry;analytical chemistry;reproducibility;nanotechnology;miniaturization;microelectromechanical systems;biosensor;conductometry	HCI	93.35452499749624	-18.528005528640218	176475

In this method, the sensor height “h” and the phase change factor “a” of the generated magnetic field are selected as ah ± 1 so that the positional error caused by the pen inclination is readily compensated. The phase change factor of the magnetic field, in addition, is made so large that the reading accuracy is improved.

The compound exhibited good photochromism both in solution and in PMMA film with alternating irradiation by UV/Vis light, and the maxima absorption of its closed-ring isomer (1b) are 582 and 599 nm, respectively. The compound also showed a photoinduced anisotropic phenomenon accompanying the photochromic reaction. Using diarylethene 1b/PMMA film as recording medium and a linearly polarized 650 nm laser diode for recording and readout, polarization multiplexed image recording can be carried out in this film. The results demonstrated that the diarylethene can be potentially used as polarization multiplexing holographic recording medium.	anisotropic diffusion;diode;holography;maxima;multiplexing;polarization (waves)	Anyin Chen;Shouzhi Pu;Zhanggao Le;Gang Liu	2009	2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems	10.1109/PACCS.2009.83	magnetoresistance;fluorescence;photochromism;quantum mechanics	EDA	95.10438834340208	-14.62707690189353	176625

The first filter is a row of fluidic microchannels that block microbeads with a size greater than the channel's width. Another filtration method has been examined using a magnetically driven microtool (MMT) to separate the beads using the centrifugal force created by this MMT actuated with a DC motor. Separated gel microbeads were recovered after filtration and used to fabricate functional microtools, for example, a tether-shaped gel tool, by contact with other gel microbeads under UV illumination. The produced gel tool is manipulated using optical tweezers in a microchip.

A field-based detection system was designed and implemented for the simultaneous determination of heavy metals in soil samples. The detection principle is based on electrochemical differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). In order to fulfill the requirements of field screening usage, a fast soil pretreatment process using ultrasonic-assisted extraction was applied. A disposable and integrated sensor, incorporating a three-electrode configuration (working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode), was fabricated by the screen-printing technology and further modified with Nafion polymer and bismuth film. Coupled with the portable and flexible analysis instrument which was developed by virtual instrument technology, this system was used for trace determination of cadmium and lead content in soil. For accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of heavy metals, the detection methodology based on the statistical algorithm and chemometrics method was proposed.

The escaping velocity of a granulocyte was 0.80 µm/s and the trapping force was 0.077 pN when the power was 60 mW. The escaping velocity of the blood cancer cell (K562) was 1.13 µm/s and the trapping force was 0.13 pN when the power was 30 mW.

In HyperMesh, firstly we classify and manage model surface, then check surface edges, and then mesh automatically. We must check element quality to ensure successful calculation in ANSYS.

The material property of the cylindrical test piece can be inversely determined from the sensor output capacitance based on a theoretical model. For the modeling process, the electrostatic Green's function due to a point source exterior to a dielectric rod is derived. The sensor output capacitance is numerically calculated using the method of moments (MoM), in which the integral equation is set up based on the electrostatic Green's function. Numerical calculations on sensor configuration optimization are performed. Calculations also demonstrate the quantitative relationship between the sensor output capacitance and the test-piece dielectric and structural properties. Capacitance measurements on different dielectric rods with different sensor configurations have been performed to verify the validity of the numerical model. Very good agreement (to within 3%) between theoretical calculations and measurement results is observed.	boundary element method;capacitive sensing;computer simulation;high-κ dielectric;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;sensor	Tianming Chen;Nicola Bowler;John R.

bb4d50d806c93aada353109636e939982abf659e	enhanced throughput for electrokinetic manipulation of particles and cells in a stacked microfluidic device	dielectrophoresis;parallel operation;particle concentration;particle separation;reservoir	Electrokinetic manipulation refers to the control of particle and cell motions using an electric field. It is an efficient technique for microfluidic applications with the ease of operation and integration. It, however, suffers from an intrinsic drawback of low throughput due to the linear dependence of the typically very low fluid permittivity. We demonstrate in this work a significantly enhanced throughput for electrokinetic manipulation of particles and cells by the use of multiple parallel microchannels in a two-layer stacked microfluidic device. The fabrication of this device is simple without the need of a precise alignment of the two layers. The number of layers and the number of microchannels in each layer can thus be further increased for a potentially high throughput electrokinetic particle and cell manipulations.	align (company);british informatics olympiad;concentrate dosage form;densely packed decimal;electric conductivity;heating;intrauterine devices;joule;joule, unit of energy;mental suffering;microchip analytical devices;microfluidics;occur (action);pack unit;particle system;reservoir device component;suspending agents;throughput;anatomical layer	Lin Zhu;Saurin H.

81e92dd318f9883a061c1b3969f1824955bf6eb7	wireless point-of-care platform with screen-printed sensors for biomarkers detection		Measurement systems for early and reliable detection of degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are extremely important in clinical diagnosis. Among these, biochemical assays represent a commonly used method to distinguish patients from healthy population thanks to the sensitive recognition of specific biomarkers in biological fluids. In order to overcome actual limitations of these techniques in term of cost, standardization, and sensitivity, this study aimed to realize a low-cost highly sensitive portable point-of-care (PoC) testing system based on screen-printed electrochemical sensors. The development of the platform specifically included both the design of the sensing probe and the electronic circuit devoted to condition and acquires the transduced electric signal. The designed circuit was implemented in a printed circuit board and interfaced to a wireless system based on bluetooth data transmission in order to improve the portability of the proposed solution. Preliminary results were obtained by using controlled concentrations of electrolytic solutions and calibrating the sensors for antibodies and for a well-known protein (i.e., interleukin 8) quantified by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Findings from ASV measurements showed a sensitivity of  $38~\mu \text{A}$ /(ng/ml) with a tested range from 1.25 to 20 ng/ml, with a limit of detection of 2 ng/ml. Further investigation will include the validation of this PoC device by testing the concentration of a specific p53 protein isoform, which was recently identified to early correlate to AD development.	alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;bluetooth;electronic circuit;emoticon;printed circuit board;printing;sensor;software portability;stripping (fiber)	Sarah Tonello;Giulia Abate;Michela Borghetti;Mariagrazia Marziano;Mauro Serpelloni;Daniela Letizia Uberti;Nicola Francesco Lopomo;Maurizio Memo;Emilio Sardini	2017	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2692308	point of care;electronic engineering;electronic circuit;detection limit;data transmission;software portability;bluetooth;mathematics;population;biosensor	Mobile	94.5754865317741	-20.592597991403785	177613

Conventionally for SERS application, Au is deposited on a rigid substrate such as glass or silicon. The rigid substrates severely limit analyte collection efficiency as well as portability. Here, flexible substrates like carbon cloth and carbon paper were investigated as potential substrate candidates for SERS application. The flexible substrates were coated with Au nanostructures by electrodeposition. Model analyte, Rhodamine 6G was utilized to demonstrate the capabilities of the flexible SERS substrates. Additionally, the pesticide paraoxon was also detected on the flexible SERS substrates as well as on a real sample like the apple fruit.	carbon;electroplating;gold;muscle rigidity;nanostructured materials;paraoxon;pesticides;plasmon;raman scattering;silicon;spectroscopy, near-infrared;analyte;biocompatibility	Minh Tran;Ahmad Fallatah;Alison Whale;Sonal Padalkar	2018		10.3390/s18082444	electronic engineering;biochemical engineering;engineering;carbon	Robotics	94.20033840039346	-17.356231332342603	177661

A micro particle image velocimetry (μPIV) system was used to visualize the flows and the shape of meniscus. Transparent flip chip specimens with quadrilateral bump arrangements were fabricated by etching silicon on glass wafer. Six bump pitches from 60 to 160 μm were tested and glycerin was dispensed to fill into the flip chip specimens. From the present experiments, it is shown that the overall filling speed becomes faster at larger bump pitch and changes abruptly when the bump pitch is twice the bump diameter. The detailed meniscus movement also has different behavior if the bump pitch gets smaller and larger than twice the bump diameter. The variation of dynamic contact angle is synchronized with that of the meniscus velocity throughout the whole process. During the interaction with the flip chip bumps, the contact line of the meniscus becomes concave or convex. The curvature of the concave and convex lines is larger at the smaller bump pitch.Graphical Abstract[IMAGE]	bump mapping	Young-Bae Kim;Jaeyong Sung;Myeong Ho Lee	2011	J.

Especially in medical electronics like pace makers the minimisation of the whole product size is an important factor. So flip chip technology becomes more and more attractive to reduce the height of an electronic package. At the same time the use of flexible and foldable substrates offers the possibility to create complex electronic devices with a very high density. In terms of human health the reliability of electronic products in medical applications has top priority. In this work flip chip interconnections to a flexible substrate are studied with regard to long time reliability. Test chips and substrates have been designed to give the possibility for electrical measurements. Solder was applied using conventional stencil printing method. The flip chip contacts on flexible substrates were created in a reflow process and underfilled subsequently. The assemblies have been tested according to JEDEC level 3. The focus in this paper is the long time reliability up to 10,000 h in thermal ageing at 125 C and temperature/humidity testing at 85 C/85% relative humidity as well as thermal cycling (0 C/+100 C) up to 5000 cycles. Daisy chain and four point Kelvin resistances have been measured to characterise the interconnections and monitor degradation effects. The failures have been analysed in terms of metallurgical investigations of formation and growing of intermetallic phases between underbump metallisation, solder bumps and conductor lines. CSAM was used to detect delaminations at the interfaces underfiller/chip and underfiller/substrate respectively. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

f0ed3468d0705531c975fde2ffa3a1b073341b4f	generic method to determine coefficients of mechanistic milling force model	cutting coefficients;serrated tapered ball end mill;force modelling;milling	Precise estimation of cutting coefficients is the fundamental stage of every mechanistic force model to achieve a reliable prediction of cutting forces. This paper presents an efficient method to determine the cutting coefficients for milling operations. The unique feature of the proposed method is that only a single cut is needed to extract the cutting coefficients and calibrate the force model. The single cut enables successive determination of the lumped discrete values of the various cutting coefficients along the cutter axis while the size effect parameters are determined based on the variation of undeformed chip thickness during tool rotation. In order to approve the effectiveness of the proposed model, a serrated tapered ball end mill tool, which has one of the most complicated geometries among milling tools, has been selected to run the tests. The efficiency of this method in determining the cutting coefficients has been confirmed experimentally with a series of verification experiments.

Diesel particulate filter (DPF) has been established as a key technology in reducing diesel PM, however, technological improvements are still required to reduce pressure drop and to assure the regeneration. Therefore, we focused on an electrostatic precipitation by taking advantage of its small pressure drop and efficient collection of nano-sized particles. However, one of the problems with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is abnormal dust re-entrainment. To cope with this problem, we studied the effect of gas temperature on electrostatic precipitation of diesel PM and surface roughness of the collecting electrode. As a result, lower gas temperature showed stable collection and high collection efficiency of particles. In addition, varying the surface roughness of collecting electrode was effective for improving the collection efficiency by installing a metal mesh on it.	brainwave entrainment;diesel;digital photo frame;electrostatic spray-assisted vapour deposition;gnu nano;probability of precipitation	Mitsuhiro Takasaki;Hirofumi Kurita;Toma Kubota;Kazunori Takashima;Masahiro Hayashi;Akira Mizuno	2015	2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2015.7356755	diesel particulate filter;chemistry;environmental engineering;automotive engineering;waste management	Arch	92.304099761525	-17.480283475422354	178060

The transponder is designed to make the implantation surgery simple while still measuring the true IOP through direct hydraulic contact with the intraocular space. Furthermore, when IOP monitoring is complete, the design allows physicians to easily retrieve the transponder. The device consists of three main components: 1) a hypodermic needle (30 gauge) that penetrates the sclera through pars plana and establishes direct access to the vitreous space of the eye; 2) a micromachined capacitive pressure sensor connected to the needle back-end; and 3) a flexible polyimide coil connected to the capacitor forming a parallel LC circuit whose resonant frequency is a function of IOP. Most parts of the sensor sit externally on the sclera and only the needle penetrates inside the vitreous space. In vitro tests show a sensitivity of 15 kHz/mmHg with approximately 1-mmHg resolution. One month in vivo implants in rabbits confirm biocompatibility and functionality of the device.	capacitor device component;coil device component;eye abnormalities;hypodermic needles;implantation procedure;implants;in vitro [publication type];interoperability;intracranial hypertension;ion implantation;kilohertz;lc circuit;minimally invasive education;patients;physiologic intraocular pressure;pressure sensor device component;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;random access;resonance;sclera;structure of pars plana;tire-pressure monitoring system;transponder device component;video-in video-out;vitreous humor;biocompatibility;inflammatory response;torr	Girish Chitnis;Teimour Maleki;Brian Samuels;Louis B.

Synthesized fluorescence reporter complexes used in a displacement-based assay format were used for TNT identification. For field deployment the TNT immunosensor was configured onto a submersible moored steel frame along with frame controller, pumps and TNT plume generator and deployed pier side for intermittent plume sampling of TNT (1h increments). Under varying current and tidal conditions trace levels of TNT in natural seawater were detected over an extended period (>18 h).

The sensor is based on an optical fibre Extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) combined with a Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG). The EFPI provides pressure measurements while the Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) provides temperature measurements. The sensor is mechanically robust, corrosion-resistant and suitable for use in underwater applications. The combined pressure and temperature sensor system was mounted on-board a mini remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) in order to monitor the pressure changes at various depths. The reflected optical spectrum from the sensor was monitored online and a pressure or temperature change caused a corresponding observable shift in the received optical spectrum. The sensor exhibited excellent stability when measured over a 2 h period underwater and its performance is compared with a commercially available reference sensor also mounted on the ROV. The measurements illustrates that the EFPI/FBG sensor is more accurate for depth measurements (depth of ~0.020 m).	baresthesia;corrosion of medical device material;drug vehicle;fabry disease;fiber to the x;hemp fiber ab.ige:acnc:pt:ser:qn;observable;on-board data handling;optical fiber;tissue fiber;negative regulation of lens fiber cell differentiation;sensor (device)	Dinesh Babu Duraibabu;Sven Poeggel;Edin Omerdic;Romano Capocci;Elfed Lewis;Thomas Newe;Gabriel Leen;Daniel Toal;Gerard Dooly	2017		10.3390/s17020406	remotely operated underwater vehicle;fabry–pérot interferometer;electronic engineering;sensor;optics;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	92.98324772605854	-20.611011883767407	178737

In addition, slot-waveguides can be fabricated by employing CMOS compatible materials and technology, enabling miniaturization, integration with electronic, photonic and fluidic components in a chip, and mass production. These advantages have made the use of slot-waveguides for highly sensitive biochemical optical integrated sensors an emerging field.

faf708cd0d5ff399e98d8f7034b8567890ac9efb	electrochemical behaviour of low carbon steel in aqueous solutions	aqueous solution	An effective way of assessing corrosion in pipelines before serious consequences occur is to use tools that can predict the future of a pipeline through an understanding of its present state and the mechanisms of corrosion. In this work electrochemical methods such as liner and tafel polarization resistance were used to evaluate corrosion. Most metal corrosion occurs via electrochemical reactions at the interface between the metal and an electrolyte solution and, therefore, since corrosion occurs via electrochemical reactions, electrochemical techniques are ideal for the study of the corrosion processes. This particular study has examined the corrosion that occurred in different grades of low carbon steels with particular aggressive solutions. Corrosion rate measurements were obtained using different aqueous environments such as a plain sodium chloride solution, a sodium chloride and carbon dioxide solution, and a sodium chloride and sulphuric acid solution that also contained a small amount of carbon dioxide. The corrosion morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in which the surfaces examined showed general corrosive attack with some shallow pits.	carbon cycle;electron;mathematical morphology;pipeline (computing);polarization (waves)	Farhad Nabhani;A.

The temperature reading of the proposed system is based on a distributed Brillouin optical fiber sensing technique. A thermal cable acts as the main component of the system, which consists of a heating belt, armored optical fibers and heat-shrinkable tubes which run parallel to the pipeline. The scour-induced free span can be monitored through different heat transfer behaviors of in-water and in-sediment scenarios during heating and cooling processes. Two sets of experiments, including exposing different lengths of the upper surface of the pipeline to water and creating free spans of various lengths, were carried out in laboratory. In both cases, the scour condition was immediately detected by the proposed monitoring system, which confirmed the system is robust and very sensitive. Numerical study of the method was also investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) with ANSYS, resulting in reasonable agreement with the test data. This brand new system provides a promising, low cost, highly precise and flexible approach for scour monitoring of subsea pipelines.	behavior;brillouin scattering;computer cooling;cool - action;experiment;finite element method;heating;line source;numerical analysis;numerical method;optical fiber;pipeline (computing);pressure:pres:pt:pipeline.nitrous oxide:qn;real-time clock;scour inc.;sediment;span distance;specimen source codes - tube;test data;vascular thermometry;sensor (device)	Xuefeng Zhao;Weijie Li;Gangbing Song;Zuo Zhu;Jun Du	2013		10.3390/s130201490	structural engineering;embedded system;text mining;medical research;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;mechanical engineering	Robotics	92.34936633207212	-18.264549403790102	180374

The catalyst was characterized by BET, XRD and FT-IR. The effects of the initial pH, the concentration of H2O2 and the reaction temperature on the rate of decolorization were investigated in detail. In addition, the reaction kinetics for the decolorization process was also investigated. The catalytic reaction results showed that at a reaction temperature of 333 K, pH=3.0 and 24 mM H2O2, 97.9% decolorization of OII was achieved after 60 min treatment.

This unique bistable feature consists of a low-stiffness torsion/cantilever beam system with circular-shaped support and a permanent magnet for holding the closed state with a permalloy soft magnetic circuit. The special circular support is designed to enhance the stiffness of the overhang beams. First, mechanical modeling of the leveraged torsion/cantilever beams was performed by Castigliano’s theorem so as to deduce the spring stiffness of system. Then the device has been prepared by a laminated photoresist sacrificial layer process (LPSLP). Finally, mechanical performance was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), combined with finite element simulation using ANSYS package and analysis model as well.

According to the experimental results, the diameter of 20 μm yielded the best sensitivity. In addition, the experimental results showed that the wavelength sensitivity was -0.01 nm/%RH and the linearity was 0.996. Furthermore, the measurement results showed that when the relative humidity was increased, the refractive index of the sensor was decreased, meaning that the TFBG cladding mode spectrum wavelength was shifted. Therefore, the proposed graphene oxide film TFBG humidity sensor has good potential to be an effective relative humidity monitor.	cladding (fiber optics);diameter (qualifier value);exposure to humidity;fiber to the x;graphene;optical fiber;piezoelectricity;psyllium 14.2 mg/ml oral suspension;sensor;tissue fiber;wavelength	Yung-Da Chiu;Chao-Wei Wu;Chia-Chin Chiang	2017		10.3390/s17092129	humidity;engineering;fiber bragg grating;cladding mode;analytical chemistry;refractive index;graphene;optics;grating;wavelength;relative humidity	Robotics	92.83917653741514	-17.211031191486608	180956

The combustor includes a combustor housing defining an inner combustion chamber and an outer chamber between the combustor housing and the support housing. Compressed air from the compressor outlet is communicated to the combustion chamber into which fuel is injected and ignited so that the resulting combustion products expand through a turbine nozzle and into the turbine expander. The novelty of the present invention resides in the construction of a diffuser assembly integrated with both the turbine nozzle and combustor. The diffuser assembly comprises a plurality of diffuser tubes, each tube having one end open to and in registration with the compressed air outlet of the compressor. The other ends of the tubes are arranged in at least two discharge planes for the combustor to improve and increase induced mixing and swirl in the combustion chamber. Preferably, at least one set of diffuser tubes discharges compressed air within the mixing zone of the combustion chamber and at a predetermined axial angle with respect to the turbine engine axis to provide a more uniform temperature into and through the turbine nozzle.

The addition of a custom-designed 2-SQUID gradiometer coupled to an S-shaped current concentrator is expected to provide an improvement in the flux sensitivity, as well as a reduction in the stray coupling of external fields. In the longer term, when the limiting factors have been fully identified, the technique may be considered for potential applications in fundamental metrology, for example, in a physical determination of the faraday by an ion-collection method.	comparator;dynamic range;faraday cage;high-throughput satellite;prototype	Ling Hao;John C.

Over the years to relieve the heating problem in 3-D ICs various passive cooling techniques were proposed. However due to their passive nature, performance is already saturated. So a new technique is proposed to overcome this limitation, called as active cooling technique. This technique uses the Peltier element to mitigate the heat at different IC layers. To demonstrate the advantages of this technique, thermal simulation of a stack consisting of three IC layers bonded face up is performed and extensive case studies are carried out using finite element modeling. It has been observed that by inserting an electrically isolated Peltier element that extends across IC layers to substrate reduced the temperature by ~ 15° K. The initial temperature difference between top IC layer and sink is reduced from ~ 172° K to ~ 16° K i.e a reduction of ~ 90 % compared to ~ 61.7 % with TTSV.	computer cooling;finite element method;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation	Pramod Kaddi;Basireddy Karunakar Reddy;Shiv Govind Singh	2014	2014 27th International Conference on VLSI Design and 2014 13th International Conference on Embedded Systems	10.1109/VLSID.2014.92	thermoelectric effect;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;engineering drawing	EDA	89.22567922980114	-13.09881935747379	181153

The physical properties of the high-k films were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared with the MONOS capacitor with BaTiO3 as charge-trapping layer, the one with nitrided BaTiO3 showed higher program speed even at lower operating voltage (4.3 V at +8 V for 100 μs), better endurance property and smaller charge loss (charge loss of 10.6 % after 10 s at 85 C), due to the nitrided BaTiO3 film exhibiting higher charge-trapping efficiency caused by nitrogen incorporation and suppressed leakage induced by nitrogen passivation. ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ a) Electronic mail: laip@eee.hku.hk		X.

57f2c8403d5d0009bbb8266641fd355528c26c26	single-bit failure analysis at a nanometer resolution by conductive atomic force microscopy		Failure analysis (FA) at nanometer or micrometer scale on integrated circuit (IC) becomes progressively more challenging as the complexity of new IC devices increases and their sizes decrease. In this paper, conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) was employed as an alternative technique for single-bit failure analysis. Using CAFM current imaging, one can screen out each failure bit and locate its position quickly and simply by applying suitable bias during CAFM scanning. Furthermore, using CAFM current–voltage (I–V) measurements, one can acquire the full electrical characteristic of each failure bit, which is very useful to determine the associated mechanism of the physical defect. The results show that CAFM current imaging together with the I–V measurement can be a suitable candidate for FA at the single-bit level.	atomic-force microscopy;failure analysis	Yong Jiang;Li-Lung Lai;Jian-Jun Zhou	2012	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2011.08.008	electrical engineering;nanotechnology;forensic engineering	Robotics	94.10191726141139	-14.70812632534011	181254

A hydrophobic hexamethyldisiloxane plasma-polymerized film (HMDS PPF) was deposited on a glass substrate and this surface was partially modified by subsequent nitrogen plasma treatment (hydrophilic surface, HMDS-N PPF) with a patterned shadow mask. An antibody protein (F(abu0027) 2 fragment of anti-human immunoglobulin G) was selectively adsorbed onto the HMDS-N area and was not adsorbed onto the HMDS area. Distinct 80x80 μm 2 square spots surrounded by a non-protein adsorbed 80 μm-wide grid were observed. Then, when the protein modified by fullerene was used, the reversible patterning was obtained. This indicated that the modification by fullerene changed the hydrophilic nature of F(abu0027) 2 protein to hydrophobic one, as a result, the modified protein was selectively adsorbed onto hydrophobic area.

The accurate characterization of the memory effect of these materials is therefore mandatory for the technology's success. The shape memory characterization is normally accomplished using mechanical testing coupled with a heat source, where a detailed knowledge of the heat cycle and its influence on the material properties is paramount but difficult to monitor. In this work, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors were embedded into SMPU samples aiming to study and characterize its shape memory effect. The samples were obtained by injection molding, and the entire processing cycle was successfully monitored, providing a process global quality signature. Moreover, the integrity and functionality of the FBG sensors were maintained during and after the embedding process, demonstrating the feasibility of the technology chosen for the purpose envisaged. The results of the shape memory effect characterization demonstrate a good correlation between the reflected FBG peak with the temperature and induced strain, proving that this technology is suitable for this particular application.	congenital fiber type disproportion;embedding;fiber to the x;mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;memory effect;polyurethanes;tissue fiber;sensor (device)	Nélia Alberto;Maria A.

In order to clarify this issue, short-term NBT stress measurements are performed using different temperatures, stress voltages, and oxide thicknesses. The data shows a clear temperature activation and a super-linear voltage dependence, thereby effectively ruling out elastic hole tunneling. Rather, our data supports an explanation based on a thermally activated hole capture mechanism. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The improvements include a casing which has a stationary upper portion with an oil inlet, an oil outlet and a vapor vent. The lower portion is removable and is releasably secured to the upper portion. The lower casing portion contains a disposable filter cartridge. A vaporization plate completely separates the filter cartridge from the vaporization chamber so that oil filtered by the filter cartridge can reach the vaporization chamber only by means of a narrow central conduit which leads to an atomization screen through which oil is atomized and laterally dispersed into the vaporization chamber. A vent includes a check valve to prevent air from flowing into the vaporization chamber and to prevent oil from leaving through the vent should the oil level rise into the vent. The vaporization plate is formed with a raised center and concentric, descending tiers, the peripheries of which are configured to guide cascading oil into downward spiral paths of flow to increase the time during which oil is heated in the vaporization chamber.	schedule (project management)	Cord-Ulrich Fündeling	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-69995-8_84	fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;operations management;deadline-monotonic scheduling;scheduling	AI	85.15400411405098	-19.08318030144742	181778

It is based on laboratory measurements of dark signal temperature dependence at few different integration times. A set of parameters are calculated which make it possible to estimate dark signal at any temperature and integration time within reasonable range. In field conditions, it is not always possible to take frequent dark signal readings during spectral measurements. If temperature is recorded during the measurement, this method can be used for estimating dark signal for every single spectral measurement. The method is validated on two different miniature spectrometers.		Joel Kuusk	2011	J.

It has several applications such as chemistry, biomedicine and biology, among others. Microfluidics enable the development of systems capable of cell manipulation and very precise chemical reactions with substantial improvements over common or bulk synthesis, let us fabricate nanocarriers with specific characteristics. In fact, the customization of variables is what makes it so versatile. One of the main issues we deal with is the control and injection of small volume fluids inside the microfluidic cell, ranging in some microliters per hour with a controlled and constant velocity. Commercial systems of this kind are expensive but instead they can be replaced by a home-made system. Here we present the design and implementation of a low cost 4-channel microinjection system by using 3D printing, Arduino and LabView. The implemented pumps are capable to deliver a minimum of 70 μl/h and a maximum of 54 ml/h of fluid, are scalable, easy to reproduce and low cost, making available for a wide range of researchers, the time of development is small compared with the acquisition and importation time, from a couple of days against months, with a price in the range of hundreds instead thousands of dollars and with similar characteristics to those commercially available.	3d printing;arduino;labview;scalability;velocity (software development)	A.

Furthermore, moxibustion provokes the release of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) to treat and prevent diseases. However, inherent drawbacks, such as pain, burn scars, smoke and bad smells, limit its use. A novel noncontact-type laser therapy device having effect similar to that of commercial moxibustion is being developed using a 1,064-nm infrared (IR) diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser. The therapy device allows direct interaction of laser light with the skin rendering temperature distribution both on the skin surface and deep under the skin. We devised a sample holder containing a tissue phantom to measure the three-dimensional temperature distribution with thermocouples inserted deep inside the phantom. Agar gel of 2.5% concentration was used as the tissue phantom in our experiments. Our results revealed that the maximum temperature occurred far below the surface of the tissue phantom, which was heated by laser irradiation at 1,064 nm. This occurrence was also confirmed by a thermal imaging method. In contrast, temperature gradually decreased through the depth of the tissue phantom heated with commercial moxibustion. Simple analytical models were constructed to explain the underlying heat-transfer mechanisms involved in moxibustion and laser irradiation.	code smell;diode;experiment;imaging phantom;phantom reference;scar (physics);sol-gel;solid-state drive;under the skin	Jiyong Cho;Hyuk Byun;Seungdeok Lee;Jung Kyung Kim	2011	J.

It would help, for example, to avoid possible structural damages. However, not all the existing devices are suitable to accomplish this task for a great number of applications, because of the characteristics of measurement environment, which prevent the use of batteries or wired connections. The use of telemetric devices may overcome these limitations, since they rely on the magnetic coupling between two inductors for wireless sensor supply and data transmission. The work treated in this paper presents a technique that permits us to calculate the output of a resistive strain gauge from a measurement of system impedance phase performed at a specific frequency, when distance between the inductors is fixed. We validated the method using a real device working with a low-cost sensor fabricated through inkjet-printing technology on a flexible substrate. We applied successive deformations, until 1% of sensor length at rest position. Calculated strain presents a percentage deviation from measured values going from 0.7% to 7%, whereas the highest uncertainty is 0.02% of sensor length at rest. Experimental results put in evidence, on one hand, the potential of inkjet printing to fabricate valid sensing elements and, on the other hand, that the proposed approach is successful in strain estimation.	antenna analyzer;characteristic impedance;class implementation file;electronic circuit;inductive coupling;low-power broadcasting;nominal impedance;polyethylene terephthalate;printed circuit board;printing;resistive touchscreen;resonance;sensor	Michele Bona;Mauro Serpelloni;Emilio Sardini;Cristian O.

This involves the representation and analysis of processes at the atomic-scale, one billionth of a meter. In order to understand and model the physical principles that govern the operation of nano-systems, this paper investigates the utilization of the bond graph modeling technique to model nano-scale phenomena based on the basic concepts of physics that govern nanotechnology. This paper investigates its use at the nano-scale to describe an interesting force only measurable at the sub micron level. Submicron metal and dielectric objects experience an attractive or repulsive force with other metal or dielectric objects not related to any exchange of particles, electromagnetic charge, or mass, but rather originates from fluctuations in the vacuum's electromagnetic energy. A method is proposed to represent this force, called the Casimir force, when modeling two object systems with simple geometry in nano-scale. Specifically, a bond graph compliance system is derived to simulate the Casimir force between two parallel plates. The compliance field can be used in conjunction with other bond graph elements to represent systems with more than two objects or that experience multiple forces simultaneously. Accounting for the Casimir effect when modeling systems at the nano-level will aid in the progression of understanding, predicting, and controlling atomic, molecular, and nano-system behavior. It contributes to better understand phenomenon such as stiction and adhesion in MEMS and NEMS (micro- and nano-electromechanical systems).	color gradient;gnu nano;microelectromechanical systems;simulation	Luke J.

Transformations of voltammetric data can help to extract specific information, e.g., the number of transferred electrons, and can reveal aspects of the studied electrochemical system, e.g., the contribution of adsorption phenomena. In this communication, we introduce a LabView-based software package, 'eL-Chem Viewer', which is for the analysis of voltammetric and amperometric data, and enables their post-acquisition processing using semiderivative, semiintegral, derivative, integral and elimination procedures. The software supports the single-click transfer of peak/wave current and potential data to spreadsheet software, a feature that greatly improves productivity when constructing calibration curves, trumpet plots and performing similar tasks. eL-Chem Viewer is freeware and can be downloaded from www.lchem.cz/elchemviewer.htm.	calibration;electrons;excretory function;height;labview;point and click;source of protocol in which patient enrolled:type:pt:cancer.xxx:nom;spreadsheet;web page;cell transformation	Jan Hrbac;Vladimir Halouzka;Libuse Trnkova;Jan Vacek	2014		10.3390/s140813943	embedded system;data processing;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;data science;amperometry;data mining;nanotechnology;biological engineering;data analysis;statistics	HCI	96.76685778500267	-17.401513026327205	182670

Remedial actions to solve short shot can be dune by injection molding experts based on their empirical knowledge. Modifying mold and part, changing resin to less viscous one, and adjusting process conditions are general remedies. Experts of injection molding might try to adjust process conditions such as mold temperature, melt temperature, injection time based on their empirical knowledge as the first remedy because adjustment of process conditions is the most economic way in time and cost. However it is difficult to find appropriate process conditions as they are highly coupled and there are so many elements to be considered. In this paper, a fuzzy logic algorithm has been proposed to find an appropriate mold temperature. With the percentage of the insufficient quantity of an injection molded part, an appropriate mold temperature can be obtained by the fuzzy logic algorithm.	fuzzy logic	Seong-Nam Kang;Yong-Jeong Huh	2002	Int.

Acoustic pressures generated by different breast tissue targets are investigated by finite-difference time-domain simulations of the entire TAI process including the feeding antenna, matching mechanism, fluidic environment, 3-D breast model, and acoustic transducer. Simulation results achieve quantitative relationships between the input microwave peak power and the resulting specific absorption rate as well as the output acoustic pressure. Microwave frequency dependence of the acoustic signals due to different breast tissues is established across a broadband frequency range (2.3-12 GHz), suggesting key advantages of spectroscopic TAI compare to TAI at a single frequency. Reconstructed thermoacoustic images are consistent with the modeling results. This model will contribute to design, optimization, and safety evaluation of microwave-induced TAI and spectroscopy.	acoustic cryptanalysis;antenna device component;body tissue;breast cancer detection research;choose (action);computer simulation;contrast media;electric power supplies;embedded system;embedding;fatty acid glycerol esters;finite-difference time-domain method;foreign bodies;frequency band;kidney calculi;matching;mammary gland parenchyma;mammary neoplasms;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;microwave;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;pulse-width modulation;realms;simulation;stage 0 breast carcinoma;thermoacoustic imaging;transducer;waveform;waveguide device component;biomedical engineering field;width	Xiong Wang;Daniel R.

Its embryos are used extensively in biology and medicine to perform chemical screens to identify drug candidates or to evaluate teratogenicity and embryotoxicity of substances. Behavioral readouts are increasingly used to assess the effects of compounds on the nervous system. Early stage zebrafish show characteristic behavioral features at stages between 30 and 42 hours post fertilization (hpf) when exposed to a short and bright light flash. This so-called Photomotor Response (PMR) is a reaction of the nervous system of the fish and can be used as a marker in screenings for neuroactive chemicals. To probe a broad and diverse chemical space, many different substances have to be tested and repeated observations are necessary to warrant statistical significance of the results. Although PMR-based chemical screens must use a large number of specimens, there is no sophisticated, automated high-throughput platform available which ensures minimal human intervention. Here we report a PMR platform that was developed by combining an improved automatic sample handling with a remotely controllable microscope setup and an image analysis pipeline. Using infrared illumination during automatic sample preparation, we were able to eliminate excess amounts of visible light that could potentially alter the response results. A remotely controlled microscope setup allows us to screen entire 96-well microtiter plates without human presence that could disturb the embryos. The development of custom video analysis software, including single egg detection, enables us to detect variance among treated specimens and extract easy to interpret numerical values representing the PMR motion. By testing several neuroactive compounds we validated the workflow that can be used to analyze more than one thousand zebrafish eggs on a single 96-well plate.	cns disorder;chemical space;chemical vapor deposition;egg food product;embryo;fertilization;handling (psychology);high-throughput computing;image analysis;light, visible;microscope device component;numerical analysis;offset binary;one thousand;p-value;pmr446;photopsia;post-traumatic stress disorder;preparation;remote control;sample variance;specimen;teratogenesis;throughput;video content analysis;zebrafish;substance	Daniel Marcato;Rüdiger Alshut;H.

The performance has been demonstrated by finite element analysis, including the acoustic intensity, acoustic pressure, acoustic potential energy, gradient force, and particle distribution. The acoustic tweezers use an ultrasound beam produced by a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer operating at 2.4 MHz and 100 Vpeak-to-peak in a water medium. The design of the Fresnel lens (zone plate) is based on air reflection, acoustic impedance matching, and the Fresnel half-wave band (FHWB) theory. This acoustic Fresnel lens can produce gradient force and acoustic potential wells that allow the capture and manipulation of single particles or clusters of particles. Simulation results strongly indicate a good trapping ability, for particles under 150 µm in diameter, in the minimum energy location. This can be useful for cell or microorganism manipulation.	3-mercaptopropionic acid;acoustic cryptanalysis;arabic numeral 0;axis vertebra;beamforming;cdisc sdtm microorganism terminology;classical lissencephalies and subcortical band heterotopias;computer simulation;diameter (qualifier value);effective method;focal (programming language);finite element method;gnu nano;gradient;gradient descent;impedance matching;joule;joule, unit of energy;megahertz;microwave;optic axis of a crystal;pico;quantitative impedance;simulation;transducer;water wells;lead titanate zirconate;newton;voltage	You-Lin Tu;Shih-Jui Chen;Yean-Ren Hwang	2016		10.3390/s16111973	analytical chemistry;optics	Robotics	91.11824868922037	-15.925326137496839	183093

b9cfaef99b769766d772189e2d1e1fedb071932e	visualization of potential sink marks using thickness analysis of finely tessellated solid model		Abstract Sink marks are unwanted shallow depressions on the molded plastic surface caused by localized shrinkage during the hardening process of injection molding. Sink marks appearing in the exterior impair the aesthetic quality of the product. In this study, a novel method for extracting potential sink marks that can occur on the part surface is proposed. The thicker portion of the part shrinks with a greater amount than that of the thinner portion. This difference in the shrinkage amount is the main cause of the sink mark. In the plastic part design practice, engineers often check the thickness distribution to predict potential sink marks in the part surface. Our method can be considered as an automated technique of such manual inspection task. A polyhedral solid model of the part with sufficiently small triangles of nearly the same size is prepared. The amount of shrinkage at each polygon is estimated based on its thickness and the shrinkage ratio of the part. The developed algorithm extracts the potential sink marks by analyzing the shrinkage distribution on the part surface.	solid modeling;thickness (graph theory)	Masatomo Inui;Shunsuke Onishi;Nobuyuki Umezu	2018	J.

The variations in the size of the abrasive grains of a grinding wheel affect the surface quality of a ground wafer. We propose a simulation-based approach for analyzing the effect of the variations in grain size on surface quality. Rapid and accurate geometric simulation of the wafer grinding process is a key technology of the analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method for simulating infeed grinding.

There also exist dynamic or transient models of the CMP process; however, the effect of slurry particle size and distribution is typically neglected in these dynamic models. The present work combines these different approaches by attempting to develop a dynamic model of the CMP process capable of representing MRR decay, which can also account for the effects due to slurry particle size and distribution.	chemical-mechanical planarization;topography	Changxue Wang;Peter Sherman;Abhijit Chandra	2005	IJMTM	10.1504/IJMTM.2005.007700	stochastic process;systems modeling;erosion;particle-size distribution;surface weather analysis;nanotechnology;forensic engineering;steady state;semiconductor device fabrication;contact mechanics;transient response;engineering drawing;chemical-mechanical planarization;wafer;mechanical engineering	HCI	87.04251056120674	-13.450092169927988	183481

The principle of MI-MAT generation and magnetoacoustic detection are theoretically deduced in formula. It is proved that the acoustic waveforms are mainly generated at the conductivity boundaries and only the configuration of the scanned layer can be reconstructed without the inner conductivity distribution using the waveforms detected around the object with the cone shaped transducer. The performance of MI-MAT, including the improved resolution at high frequency excitation and the favorable SNR dependence, provides a noninvasive means for conductivity differentiation in diagnostic imaging. The numerical simulations of the proposed theory for a cylindrical sample phantom have good agreements with the former published results and suggest the potential applications for bioimpedance imaging.

Stainless steel wire can overcome the breakable defects of traditional quartz fiber, so it has been widely used as SPME fiber matrix. In order to develop a sample preparation instrument which use less organic solvent, own high enrichment quality and automated, this paper studied and developed a gas purge syringe micro extraction system, which only use stainless steel needle as extraction phase. The stainless steel needle is etched by hydrofluoric acid, without any coating adsorbent material. It is an automated and open system which contains heating sample matrix, condensing extraction phase and inert gas purging. Under optimized parameters, extraction experiments were performed, for enriching volatile and semi-volatile target compounds from the sample of 15 PAHs standard mixture. GC-MS analysis results indicated that a high enrichment factor was obtained from the system. The results demonstrate that system is potential in determination of volatile and semi-volatile analyzes from various kinds of samples.

Conventional 3D ICs consist of vertically stacked several thin IC chips those are electrically connected with lots of through-Si vias (TSVs) and metal microbumps. Metal microbumps are surrounded by organic adhesive. An epoxy-based material, so-called underfill, has been widely used to fill the gap between several chips. In general, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the underfill material is larger than that of metal microbumps. This CTE mismatch induces local bending stress in thinned IC chips. This local bending stress would affect CMOS circuit in thinned IC chips. Therefore, we should suppress the local bending stress to realize 3D IC with high reliability. In this work, we propose a novel underfill with negative-CTE filler which can suppress the local bending stress in 3D IC.	555 timer ic;cmos;coefficient;metal (api);star filler;tail value at risk;three-dimensional integrated circuit;zero suppression	Hisashi Kino;Takafumi Fukushima;Tetsu Tanaka	2016	2016 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)	10.1109/3DIC.2016.7970031	bending;epoxy;three-dimensional integrated circuit;thermal expansion;adhesive;flip chip;cmos;silicon;composite material;materials science	EDA	90.89239252967998	-14.139977281036753	184502

With the development of high density interconnect (HDI), via-in-pad has emerged as one of the key enabling technologies for increasing the I/O density. Via-in-pad permits the use of sub-surface layers for fan out and consequently, smaller packages with higher I/O can be utilized in the design. Additionally, since traces no longer need to be routed between pads, the solder joint pitch can also be decreased. The reliability of via-in-pad under mechanical bend fatigue is examined in this study. Mechanical cycling fatigue reliability is especially critical for portable products where keypad actuation often induces repeated bending in the printed circuit board. HDI boards manufactured by both the photovia and the laser via processes were examined. A three dimensional, non-linear, parametric finite element model was developed to predict failure mechanisms. For the bend fatigue experiments, globtop BGA packages were mounted on HDI boards containing via-in-pad structures. The number of cycles required for material fatigue was obtained as a function of applied bending loads. Failure analysis was conducted to determine the failure modes. Experimental results were correlated with finite element predictions.		K.

Since one layer of LTCC tape is not always fulfilling the requirements of the force sensor’s loading capacity, the influence of lamination parameters for different number of layers were investigated. The measurements were carried out with miniaturized (2 1 mm) beam samples of four different LTCC tape materials, namely Heraeus AHT01-005, AHT08-047, CT707; and CeramTec GC. The results of the measurements can be used to determine the proper LTCC tape material, the lamination pressure and the number of layers to allow the development of customized force sensors, not only for musical wind instruments. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper introduces the enhancement of both fluorescence emission and lifetime through adding gold nanoparticles. The reason is due to possible coupling between the plasmonic resonance of gold nanoparticles and the fluorescence emission of ceria that has been achieved, along with enhanced formation of trivalent cerium ions. Both factors lead to higher fluorescence intensity peaks and shorter fluorescence lifetimes. As an application, gold-ceria nanoparticles have been used as an optical sensing material for lead particles in aqueous media based on fluorescence quenching.

54e8f03e5b07114f9f73aebf7e03c6fc1ccdec74	electrical characteristics of amorphous in-ga-zn-o thin-film transistors prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering with varying oxygen flows	composition;amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide a igzo;carrier concentration;oxygen flow;total resistance method;article	This study investigates impacts of oxygen flow during the deposition of amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) channel layer with a radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputter on the electrical characteristics of the fabricated thin-film transistors (TFTs). Results indicate that as the film was deposited with a higher oxygen flow, the transfer curves are positively shifted while the field-effect mobility (lFE) is significantly decreased. To get more insight about the effects, channel resistance (RCH) and the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (RSD) of the fabricated devices are extracted using the total resistance method. The extracted a-IGZO channel resistance per unit length (rch) and RSD are found to increase while the extracted effective mobility (lE) is decreased with increasing oxygen flow during sputtering. These observations are postulated to be related the decrease in the In/(In + Ga + Zn) ratio and the increase in the Zn/ (In + Ga + Zn) ratio of the a-IGZO films with increasing the oxygen flow rate which lead to higher resistivity and lower carrier concentration. The extracted RSD can be comparable with RCH for the devices prepared with high oxygen flow, resulting in the roll-off of lFE as the channel length is shorter than 20 lm. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The maximum boron composition of 5.8% is obtained at the optimum growth temperature of 580 1C. RMS roughness over the surface area of 1 1mm is only 0.17 nm at such growth conditions. Based on the experimental results, it has been clearly shown that boron incorporation will decrease significantly at higher temperature (4610 1C) or at much lower temperature (p550 1C). r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A hanger adapted to be driven into a wooden frame member includes a one-piece stamped metal member having a head and a flat elongate symmetrical shank with a series of lands and grooves disposed on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the shank between its tip and a pair of laterally extending shoulders on its head. Inclined camming surfaces extend between the lands and grooves and cooperate therewith to compress the wood fibers laterally of the shank as it is driven into the wood. A lateral gripping surface behind each land surface engages the wood fibers which expand into the distally adjacent groove to provide a positive gripping action which resists disengagement.

39484ef7d89f8688f88061cb97d96f09e5ba03f2	a fully-papertronic biosensing array for high-throughput characterization of microbial electrogenicity		For the first time, we report a low-cost, disposable fully-papertronic screening platform for rapid screening and identification of electroactive microorganisms. This novel papertronic device is capable of simultaneous characterizing the electrogenicity of 10’ s of the newly discovered, genetically engineered, bacteria. This work explored an exciting range of possibilities with the goal of fusing microbial fuel cell technology with ‘papertronics,’ the emerging field of paper-based electronics. Spatially distinct 64 sensing units of the array were constructed by patterning hydrophilic anodic reservoirs in paper with hydrophobic wax boundaries and utilizing 3-D multi-laminate paper structures. Full integration of a high-performance microbial sensor on paper can be achieved by improving the microbial electron exchange with the electrodes in an engineered conductive paper reservoir and reducing cathodic overpotential by using a solid electron acceptor on paper. Furthermore, the intrinsic capillary force of the paper and the increased capacity from the engineered reservoir allowed for rapid adsorption of the bacterial sample and promote immediate microbial cell attachment to the electrode, leading to instant power generation with even a small amount of the liquid.	acceptor (semiconductors);attachments;bacteria;cell-matrix junction;electroactive polymers;electron;electron transport;genetic engineering;hereditary diseases;laminate device component;microorganism;numerous;oxidants;polychlorinated biphenyls;quantitation;reservoir device component;resistance paper;throughput;waxes;electrode	Mehdi Tahernia;Maedeh Mohammadifar;Daniel J Hassett;Seokheun Choi	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513677	cathodic protection;overpotential;microbial fuel cell;microfluidics;electronic engineering;analytical chemistry;electron acceptor;anode;biosensor;computer science	EDA	94.54089247493215	-17.50315781594816	185636

In this paper, a novel method of optimisation for the loading paths is developed for T-part. On the basis of the theoretical analysis proposed in the previous research, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with FE codes is employed to search the optimal stress ratios. According to the optimal stress ratios, the optimal internal pressure and axial feed are obtained by using the engineering computation expressions deduced. The results show that the simulation results have good agreements with the experiment results. The optimal loading paths have successfully been applied for producing tee coupling.	code;computation;finite element method;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;simulation;software release life cycle;time complexity;williams tube	Yong Zhang;Lijuan Ge;Haijun Li;Lijun Gao	2010	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2010.032202	structural engineering;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;finite element method;engineering drawing	AI	85.5097032578771	-13.2372190132269	185866
76fb4b200586a4441053f39a9d3be41769f7aabe	gadolinium-based metal oxide for nonvolatile memory applications		Abstract   In this study, the memory characteristic of a gadolinium (Gd)-based oxide charge storage layer was demonstrated. The metal/oxide/high-k/oxide/silicon (MOHOS)-type memories were fabricated by using two different charge storage layers. The Gd 2 O 3  nanocrystal (Gd 2 O 3 -NC) was used as a charge storage layer due to the discrete nodes, while the HfGdO high-k material was used as a charge storage layer due to the existence of discrete traps. In the case of Gd 2 O 3 -NC memory, a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet (UV)–visible spectrophotometer analysis was used in this study to extract the valence band location and the band-gap of the Gd 2 O 3 -NC layer. The retention characteristic was also analyzed to extract the trapping level in Gd 2 O 3 -NC, based on the relationship between trapping energy and discharging time. A band diagram was created to characterize the memory effect of the Gd 2 O 3 -NC memory. In the case of HfGdO SONOS-type memory, the electrical and physical studies were conducted for HfGdO charge-trapping layers deposited by a dual-sputtered method for silicon–oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon (SONOS)-type nonvolatile memory. The Hf/Gd dual-sputtered power ratio and the Ar/O 2  gas flow ratio were optimized. It was observed that the nonstoichiometric GdO (2 0 0) structure may be the main charge-trapping site for the memory. The memory samples with Hf/Gd = 150/150 and Ar/O 2  = 20/5 exhibited better electrical performance. A physical model is proposed to further explain the retention mechanism.	non-volatile memory;nonvolatile bios memory	Jer Chyi Wang;Chih-Ting Lin;Pai-Chi Chou;Chao-Sung Lai	2012	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2011.09.032	electronic engineering;analytical chemistry	EDA	91.914561867706	-13.17775599190896	185936

Most devices irradiated in the fields of medium-dose-rate breaking radiation failed to operate after absorption of very small total doses of ionizing radiation, in the range of 37―132 Gy(SiO 2 ). However, all samples irradiated in the gamma radiation environment remained completely functional, even after deposition of a total dose of 500 Gy(SiO 2 ). Devices irradiated with higher input voltages failed after absorption of low total doses, whereas the load current increase mitigated and even prevented circuit failures in X radiation fields. The high radiation sensitivity of the LM2990T-5 voltage regulators operating in the bremsstrahlung fields was a consequence of the dose enhancement on the gold―aluminum connection between the silicon chip and ground contact. Computer model simulations indicated that the primary failure mechanisms were the generation of radiation-induced leakage currents alongside the npn transistors in the operational amplifier circuit. The difference between the voltage regulator responses in various bremsstrahlung environments was affected by the time-dependent effects, leading to the partial recovery of radiation-induced trapped charge.	voltage regulator	Vladimir Dj.

The ultimate goal for OLED manufacturing, however, is to replicate the widespread success of photoresist lithography without the use of the types of resists, solvents, and etchants traditionally used—organic small molecules are simply not compatible with these tools. Hence, there is motivation for a renewed examination of variants of this inherently parallel, high speed approach. This work investigates the use of chemically inert resists that rely on clearance mechanisms not found in traditional lithography. These primarily include employing phase changes for lift-off patterning thin films of organic semiconductors and metals, and also propose and discuss the use of combustible and magnetic materials.

The nanocomposite film was dropped onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), and then the anti-chlorpyrifos monoclonal antibody was covalently immobilized onto the surface of MWCNTs-THI-CHIT/GCE using the crosslinking agent glutaraldehyde (GA). The modification procedure was characterized by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under the optimized conditions, a linear relationship between the relative change in peak current of different pulse voltammetry (DPV) and the logarithm of chlorpyrifos solution concentration was obtained in the range from 0.1 to 1.0 × 10(5) ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.046 ng/mL. The proposed chlorpyrifos immunosensor exhibited high reproducibility, stability, and good selectivity and regeneration, making it a potential alternative tool for ultrasensitive detection of chlorpyrifos residues in vegetables and fruits.	chit1 gene;carbon tetrachloride;carbon-carbon lyases;characteristic impedance;chitosan;chlorpyrifos;cross link;cyclic gmp;delegated path validation;dielectric spectroscopy;dropping;fruit;glutaral;google compute engine;immobilization;monoclonal antibodies;nanocomposite;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;nonketotic hyperglycinemia;numerous;output impedance;pesticides;preparation;quantitative impedance;relative change and difference;selectivity (electronic);sensitivity and specificity;software release life cycle;thionine;transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy;x-ray emission spectroscopy	Xia Sun;Yaoyao Cao;Zhili Gong;Xiangyou Wang;Yan Zhang;Jinmei Gao	2012		10.3390/s121217247	analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;nanocomposite	Vision	95.7554857404357	-17.268012531920437	187464

It is perceived that diamond cannot be used for cutting ferrous materials due to the high affinity of carbon to iron. Nevertheless, under certain conditions it is possible to use diamond materials for cutting ferrous metals. In order to avoid graphitization of the diamond matrix, it is necessary to keep the cutting temperature below the critical level of diamond graphitization. This paper presents the influence of a cryogenic CO2 coolant strategy on the cutting process using PCD tools for cutting high strength compacted graphite iron (CGI). Investigations show, that tool wear behavior strongly correlates with the cutting speed, the cutting forces, cutting temperatures, and surface roughness of the workpiece. The test results show, that the tool life of PCD for cutting cast iron is dependent on the diamond grain size, the binder material, and the cutting parameters.	common gateway interface;process-centered design	Eberhard Abele;Burkhard Schramm	2008	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-008-0104-6	surface roughness;engineering;iron;metallurgy;grain size	DB	88.19602565951786	-13.268246320712882	187828

However, limitations of current nanoscale vibration detecting methods remain the major obstacle for scientific study and cell vibration experiments. Due to the absence of effective method of feeble nanoscale vibration detecting, most sorts of quantitative and dynamic cell vibrations cannot be observed. Therefore, a real-time tracking detection method is vital for the study of cell physiology. In this paper, a real-time tracking detection of nanoscale vibrations based on sweep frequency (SF) - amplitude modulation (AM) method using cantilever sweep frequency as a carrier frequency was proposed. Furthermore, the process of tip-sample vibration coupling is analyzed by using the idea of amplitude modulation model. The nanoscle vibration detecting experiments were carried out on a piezoceramic disc, which can mimic cell vibrations. The experiment results show that the SF-AM AFM real-time vibration tracking and detecting approach can accurately detect and track feeble sample vibration within few nanometers amplitude.	atomic-force microscopy;carrier frequency;delta-sigma modulation;effective method;experiment;mathematical model;piezoelectricity;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sensor	Jialin Shi;Lianqing Liu;Peng Yu;Peng Li	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353637	frequency modulation;control engineering;electronic engineering;resonance;computer science;vibration;nanotechnology	Robotics	95.43146528721434	-23.0356911715341	187834
f3b63278be116c74e77d4cddf578e4beeaee2be9	a comb-gate silicon tunneling field effect transistor with improved on-state current	tunneling transistor on state current comb gate	In this paper, a new tunneling field effect transistor with comb-shaped gate (CG-TFET) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Source implantation masked by the comb-shaped gate can result in combshaped channel region. With this comb-shaped gate configuration, increased tunneling area can be obtained and hence higher on-state current without area penalty. Moreover, an optimized CG-TFET with silicide source is fabricated to further improve the on-state current by introducing Schottky barrier tunneling current which is much more efficient than band-to-band tunneling. In addition, the electron barrier in the comb-shaped channel region is raised due to the self depleted effect, which can effectively suppress the Schottky injection leakage from the silicide source in the off-state. 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than conventional TFET with the same footprint on-state current and more than 106 on-off current ratio can be achieved.	electron;experiment;field effect (semiconductor);ion implantation;quantum tunnelling;schottky barrier;spectral leakage;switch;transistor;tunneling protocol	Zhan Zhan;Qianqian Huang;Ru Huang;Wenzhe Jiang;Yangyuan Wang	2012	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-012-4713-5	computer science;gate oxide;time-dependent gate oxide breakdown	EDA	91.44530246327254	-12.736170336919297	187929
d474cb0f8d8fd558e098ec1de0030184a9cd5c78	experimental characterization and physical modeling of resolution limits in proximity printing x-ray lithography	tk7855 m41 r43 no 565;electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	Image resolution in x-ray proximity printing is influenced by diffraction, photo and Auger electron range, and in some instances, shot noise. In this thesis each of these issues is addressed. For the first time, 30 nm-wide lines were replicated using A1K radiation ( = 0.8 nrm). No degradation in linewidth was seen for these lines as compared with lines imaged from the same mask with either CK ( = 4.5 nm) or CUL ( = 1.3 rnm) x-rays, indicating that, contrary to previous assumptions, photoelectron range is not an obstacle to resolution in the 50 nm linewidth regime for wavelengths as short as 0.8 nm. For reasons of process latitude and ease of mask fabrication slightly longer wavelengths are preferred. A chemically amplified resist, Ray-PF, was used to pattern 100 nm-wide lines in a 1 Am-thick film with a dose of 5 mJ/cm2 ; this dose corresponds to 100 photons/pixel where the pixel height is 100 nm and the pixel area is the linewidth squared. Based on image quality, 100 photon/pixel is taken as the shot-noise-limited minimum acceptable x-ray dose; higher doses are recommended for industrial processes. The question of maximum acceptable mask-to-substrate gap was explored by shadow casting a mask pattern onto a sloped wall. The pattern consisted of isolated lines, spaces, and gratings of nominal 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 pm width. The smallest features, 0.17 Mm-wide spaces printed to gaps as large as 35 Am with significant image degradation becoming apparent at 18 Am. Exposures were compared to theoretical linewidth-gap plots, each of which contained a family of equi-irradiance contours of diffracted linewidth as a function of gap. Correlation was seen between image degradation and divergence of the equi-irradiance contours. A slow widening of linewidth with gap was seen; but, linewidth oscillations with changing gap, predicted by theory, were not detected in the exposures. Thesis Supervisor: Henry I.

f773a9e9cb94c4922733febd0fe287c3950d97a7	residual stress prediction in quick point grinding		The paper investigates the dependency of residual stresses on process parameters of grinding in the quick point mode. It is evaluated whether the area-specific grinding power or energy is correlated to the residual stresses in the surface and to the maximum residual stresses in the surface layer. Firstly, the paper derives an analytical model for the area-specific grinding power and energy based on models from literature. Secondly, the residual stress distribution of workpieces machined under varied cutting conditions is depicted for each process point. It is found that the area-specific grinding energy is correlated to residual stresses whereas the area-specific grinding power is an unsuitable residual stress predictor. Due to the limited experimental scope future research should seek to validate the findings with a broader variation of process conditions in quick point grinding.	residual stress	Stefan Tönissen;Fritz Klocke;Björn Feldhaus;Steffen Buchholz;Markus Weiss	2012	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-012-0382-x	forensic engineering;engineering drawing	HCI	87.26133827075877	-12.596560628962777	188264

851c22b1f823e964efbb278d2cdfcd9a2ca843f7	power consumption model of a circulating wet runner pump		In this paper the power consumption model of a circulating wet runner pump is presented. Such a model provides several advantages since it can be used for example to detect issues during operation of the pump. For instance, dry running which might damage the bearings of the pump can be detected based on deviations between the measured power and the power predicted by the model. Furthermore, based on the power model the volume flow which passes the pump can be determined without a volume flow sensor and thus save costs. As the overall power consumption of the pump is influenced by different components such as electrical and friction losses, models of the individual components which have an influence on the power consumption are presented. Then, the components are combined to one overall power consumption model and the model parameters are identified by measurements. Finally, the model is validated by comparison of the dynamic behaviour of the model with the actual measured power consumption.	bearing device component;display resolution;microsoft outlook for mac;pulse-width modulation;width	Benedikt Meier;Martin Oettmeier;Jens O.

Here, we demonstrate in-line monitoring of flow fluctuations with a cantilever-like sensor integrated in a microfluidic channel. The cantilevers are fabricated in different materials (SU-8 and SiN) and with different thicknesses. The integration of arrays of holes with different hole size and number of holes allows the modification of device sensitivity, theoretical detection limit and measurement range. For an average flow in the microliter range, the cantilever deflection is directly proportional to the flow rate fluctuations in the microfluidic channel. The SiN cantilevers show a detection limit below 1 nL/min and the thinnest SU-8 cantilevers a detection limit below 5 nL/min. Finally, the sensor is applied for in-line monitoring of flow fluctuations generated by external pumps connected to the microfluidic system.	british informatics olympiad;conflict (psychology);cubic millimeter;decompression sickness;dots per inch;experiment;flow rate;large;limit of detection;maxima and minima;microfluidics;nano;thickness (graph theory);pump (device);sensor (device)	Nadine Noeth;Stephan Sylvest Keller;Anja Boisen	2013		10.3390/s140100229	flow measurement;electronic engineering;microfluidics;engineering;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;physics	Embedded	91.88097669894996	-18.55560308586425	188606

Effects of Rayleigh and Hartmann numbers and volume fraction of Fe3O4 (nano-magnetite, an iron oxide) on flow and heat transfer characteristics are analyzed. Results indicate that the temperature gradient is an increasing function of the buoyancy force and the volume fraction of Fe3O4, but it is a decreasing function of the Lorentz force. Also, the rate of heat transfer is augmented with an increase in the Lorentz force. However, the opposite is true on the rate of heat transfer with the buoyancy force. Furthermore, the core vortex moves downward with an increase in the Lorentz force. It is expected that the results presented here will not only provide useful information for cooling of electronic components but also complement the existing literature.		M. Sheikholeslami;K.

The integrity for such welded structures is depended on residual stresses induced by manufacturing process. In this paper, the characteristics of residual stresses on the dissimilar welded pipe between T92 steel and S30432 steel were investigated using finite element method. Moreover, the effects of heat input, groove shape and layer number on the residual stress distribution were studied to find the approach to reduce the residual stress. The numerical results revealed that the hoop and axial stress in heat affected zone (HAZ) of T92 steel side of the dissimilar welded joint had sharp gradients. By decreasing the groove angle, the peak values of the hoop and axial stress on T92 steel side were reduced greatly while the peak values in welded metal and HAZ of S30432 steel side differed little. Furthermore, more layer number and less heat input decreased the peak value of the tensile residual stress on welded metal and S30432 steel side, but had little effect on the residual stress in T92 steel side.	computer simulation	Lei Zhao;Jun Liang;Qunpeng Zhong;Chao Yang;Biao Sun;Jinfeng Du	2014	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2013.12.004	structural engineering;residual stress;finite element method;forensic engineering;metallurgy	SE	86.79791654458998	-12.292849225843863	188777

The tag not only justifies the green electronic concept but also it is examined for sensing functionality. The compact tag structure comprises of seven L-shaped and one I-shaped dipole structure. These conducting tracks/dipole structures are of silver nano-particle based ink having a conductivity of 1.1 × 107 S/m. Each conducting track yields one bit corresponding to one peak. The tag design is optimized and analyzed for three different flexible substrates i.e. paper, Kapton® HN, and PET. The tag has ability to identify 28 = 256 objects, by using different binary combinations. The variation in length of particular conducting strip results in a shift of peak for that specific conducting track. This shift corresponds to logic state-1. The response of the tag for paper, Kapton® HN, and PET substrates is observed in the frequency band of 2.2–6.1GHz, 2.4–6.3GHz, and 2.5–6.5GHz, respectively. The tag has an attractive nature because of its easy printability and usage of low-cost, flexible substrates. The tag can be deployed in various low-cost sensing applications.	8-bit;chipless rfid;frequency band;gnu nano;kapton;polyethylene terephthalate;printing;radio wave;revision control system;software deployment	Ayesha Habib;Rehab Asif;Muhammad Fawwad;Yasar Amin;Jonathan Loo;Hannu Tenhunen	2017	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.14.20170169	radio-frequency identification;optics;backscatter;physics	HCI	92.01014338079172	-18.295771437103024	188811
be1f81fb3ff500560d156cd2729eb646692a946c	study of aluminum thermomigration as a low thermal budget technique for innovative power devices	epitaxial growth	The main feature of the thermomigration of Al/Si liquid droplets in silicon for the realization of isolation walls in bidirectional power devices is its low thermal budget. Therefore, it is compatible with the utilization of epitaxial substrates for innovative power devices, for example, with reduced on-state resistance. This paper describes the design and realization of a medium power SCR on epitaxy. After structure presentation and voltage blocking capability simulation, the specific issue of thermomigration on (1 1 1)-orientated epitaxial substrates is considered. Limitations to migration are found due to the off-axis cut necessary for good epitaxial growth. Electrical characterization exhibits great agreement with simulation, demonstrating the great potential of thermomigration as a low thermal budget technique for isolation walls processing for both standard structures and new devices on epitaxy. 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ff7953936791bcd4a94784bcc4bbdeb6d78f80f3	svm based approach for the assessment of elbow flexion with smart textile sensor		This paper presents a new approach for monitoring the elbow flexion with a smart textile based on the piezo-resistive effect. The sensor is composed of a mix of conductive threads made of stainless steel fibers doped with metal particles and dielectric silk threads. The threads are arranged in a double bridle crochet structure to provide the best compromise between mechanical elasticity and sensor sensitivity. The sensor was integrated to a sweater to measure the joint angle of the elbow. In order to asses the angle in robust and accurate way, we developed a static model for angle recognition based on a machine learning algorithm: a Deep Neural Network. The design process of the static model includes the data collection, the extraction of features and the choice of the best architecture for the Deep Neural Network. This approach allow to reach recognition accuracy between 76.9% and 83.66%. Finally, a comparative study have also been performed in order to compare the performances of our model with different algorithms such as SVM, NB and DT.	algorithm;deep learning;doping (semiconductor);e-textiles;elasticity (data store);elbow method (clustering);hysteresis;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;performance;piezoelectricity;real-time clock;sensor;support vector machine	Maxence Bobin;Hamdi Amroun;Sabine Coquillart;Franck Bimbard;Mehdi Ammi	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2017.8122934	architecture;machine learning;support vector machine;artificial neural network;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;engineering design process;control engineering;computer science;silk;thread (computing);compromise	Robotics	87.82609060041884	-17.247612132347946	189292

The electronic rectification property of the diode is one of basic functions of electronic components and since then, the molecular diode has been investigated as a first single-molecule device that would have a practical application. In this review, we first describe the experimental fabrication and electronic characterization techniques of molecular diodes consisting of a small number of molecules or a single molecule. Then, two main mechanisms of the rectification property of the molecular diode are discussed. Finally, representative results for the molecular diode are reviewed and a brief outlook on crucial issues that need to be addressed in future research is discussed.	acceptor (semiconductors);base excision repair;diode device component;electron transport;electronic component;electronic structure;greater than;internet backbone;lattice boltzmann methods;mathematical morphology;microsoft outlook for mac;molecular orbital;r-type;ratner's theorems;rectifier;self-assembly;terminator (character concept);vertebral column;electrode	Madoka Iwane;Shintaro Fujii;Manabu Kiguchi	2017		10.3390/s17050956	electronic engineering;chemistry;electron transport chain;optoelectronics;nanotechnology	EDA	94.59513036744954	-14.346709717341673	189461

It shows that intermetallic compound crystallization correlates 15 with bonding duration, as a longer duration is applied, alumina fragmentation 16 becomes pervasive, resulting in continuous alloy interfaces and robust bonds. In 17 addition, a substrate temperature (i.e. 175°C) promotes the fracture of alumina, and 18 simultaneously contributes to the interfacial temperature, accelerating interdiffusion 19 and facilitating the formation of intermetallic compounds, therefore increasing 20 bonding strength. The compound formed during bonding is CuAl2, regardless of the 21 bonding parameters applied. 22	ball bonding;electron;fragmentation (computing);gnu nano;gold-aluminium intermetallic;image resolution;pervasive informatics	H.

Two process states have been identified as influential: The deposition parameters and the thermal treatment. Notably, the nucleation behavior and surface energy (viz. “wetting properties”) of the deposited material onto the substrate surface greatly determine the surface morphology and crystallinity of these films, which in turn, affect the electrical and optical properties.	chemical vapor deposition;mathematical morphology;process state;substrate (electronics);thickness (graph theory);thin-film transistor;viz: the computer game	G.

599ca34e2466541a196c816ab17c3a155f2587fb	high performance computing for one of the grand challenges	high performance computer	A mirror mounting is described in which a plane rectangular reflecting strip is deformed along the two longer edges thereof so that it is approximately tangent to the ideal mirror while the strip remains substantially flat in the direction of its shorter edges. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of such reflecting strips are so formed by attachment to a supporting frame using a pair of elastomeric cushion frames to embrace the longer sides of each strip while leaving the shorter sides free. Advantageously, each reflecting strip on the frame is bent in a continuous manner the full distance of its longer side. The frame is preferably a rigid array of parallel channel members each of which is adapted to receive a curved T-section angle bar having the desired curvature of the reflecting strip. The angle bars are deformed into this curvature in a separate operation while they are being attached to the channel members. Specific apparatus for deforming the reflecting strips into conformity with the curved angle bars and for attaching the strips to the cushion frames is also described.

The process cascades the product from a low temperature propane or butane dehydrogenation zone into a first catalytic reactor zone which operates at low pressure and contains zeolite oligomerization catalysts, where the low molecular weight olefins are reacted to primarily gasoline range materials. These gasoline range materials can then be pressurized to the pressure required for reacting to distillate in a second catalytic reactor zone operating at high pressure and containing zeolite oligomerization catalyst. The first catalytic reactor zone also acts to remove the olefins from the dehydrogenation reactor effluent to allow recycle of the unreacted paraffins.	projet volterra	Patrick Mordini	1985			butane;chemical engineering;effluent;gasoline;distillation;catalysis;zeolite;propane;dehydrogenation;materials science	NLP	95.98192035196867	-12.62016993471776	190533

The peak position showed no dependence on the excitation wavelength, indicating that it could not be explained by a whispering gallery mode in a medium with broad optical gain. The peaks can be explained by amplified spontaneous emissions (ASE) because the intensity depended linearly on the excitation intensity with a threshold. When the dye-doped film was formed on the portion of a fiber with the clad etched out and was excited by the polarized laser propagating inside the fiber core, we observed ASE peaks not of the dyes but of the optical fiber itself, suggesting the possibility that the dyes were oriented with their transition moment pointing parallel to the film surface. These fiber ASE peaks shifted to longer wavelength when we varied the excitation wavelength to shorter wavelength, which clearly ruled out the possibility of silicate Raman scattering as the origin.	doping (semiconductor);optical fiber;polymer;spontaneous order	Yasuaki Itakura;Akihiro Tomioka;Shinji Kinoshita;Atsushi Fujimoto	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e89-c.12.1746	raman scattering;fluorescence;gain;optical fiber;amplified spontaneous emission;dispersion-shifted fiber;photoluminescence;whispering-gallery wave;optics;physics;zero-dispersion wavelength	Visualization	93.53855427714697	-10.853556728940205	190617

MNPs can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and can be concentrated at a specific location in the brain using non-invasive electromagnetic forces. The proposed EMA consists of two coil-core system. The cores are added in the center of each coil to concentrate the flux in the region of interest. The EMA can enhance the gradient field 10 times compared to only coil system and generate the maximum magnetic field of 160 mT and 5.6 T/m. A 12-kW direct-current power supply was used to generate sufficient magnetic forces on the MNPs by regulating the input currents of the coils. Effective guidance of MNPs is demonstrated via simulations and experiments using 800-nm-diameter MNPs in a Y-shaped channel. The developed EMA system has high potentials to increase BBB crossing of MNPs for efficient drug targeting to brain regions.	experiment;gradient;power supply;region of interest;simulation	Ton Duc Do;Yeongil Noh;Myeong Ok Kim;Jungwon Yoon	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2015.7358822	drug delivery;flux;electromagnetic coil;targeted drug delivery;magnetic field;magnetic nanoparticles;nanoparticle;nuclear magnetic resonance;materials science	Robotics	97.31136364512932	-21.677365926045617	190630
50bd062d9d23054b1e43529c82fe3996dcac848f	design of 3d printed porous additive manufactured cages using a computer model of t10-s1 multilevel spine		Porous additive manufactured (AM) cages were a new selection for posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) surgery due to their low rigidity. Past studies had investigated porous AM cages; however, their structural designs and performances were evaluated using oversimplified numerical models. Thus, the purpose of this research was to investigate the porous structure of the AM cages using a realistic spine model. Three-dimensional finite element models of T10-S1 multilevel spine were developed using ANSYS Workbench. Eleven types of the AM cages were analyzed and compared to understand their strengths and limitations. The results showed that the sparse density in microstructure geometry would increase the intersegmental rotation but the von Mises stress of cage becomes enlarge simultaneously. Adding a PEEK layer to the microstructure is not a good choice to prevent the cage stress getting higher value. The outcomes of this study can help surgeons to understand the biomechanics of PLIF surgery combined with the use of porous AM cages.	3d printing;am broadcasting;computer simulation;dendritic spine;design rationale;finite element method;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;oracle fusion architecture;peek;performance;sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods;workbench	Ting-Kuo Chang;Ching-Chi Hsu;Shu-Yu Zhou;Pei-I Tsai;Fang-Yi Wang	2017	2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)	10.1109/SII.2017.8279266	control engineering;engineering;microstructure;porosity;composite material		87.60132865520558	-15.069165081735525	190842
