0c23ee65b54beb7fef65a49a6083e457dee12283	on cubic and edge-critical isometric subgraphs of hypercubes		All cubic partial cubes (i.e., cubic isometric subgraphs of hypercubes) up to 30 vertices and all edge-critical partial cubes up to 14 vertices are presented. The lists of graphs were confirmed by computer search to be complete. Non-trivial cubic partial cubes on 36, 42, and 48 vertices are also constructed.	cubic function;isometric projection;olap cube;partial cube;search algorithm;vertex (geometry)	C.

Let φH(n) be the smallest number φ such that any graph G of order n admits an H-decomposition with at most φ parts. Here we study the case when H = C7, that is, the cycle of length 7 and prove that φC7(n) = n/4 for all n ≥ 10.	graph (discrete mathematics)	Teresa Sousa	2015	Ars Comb.		isomorphism;mathematics;combinatorics;partition (number theory);graph	Theory	30.673133489940827	29.79726851896227	47911

An imprecise terrain is given by a triangulated point set where the height component of the vertices is specified by an interval of possible values. We restrict ourselves to 1.5-dimensional terrains: an imprecise terrain is given by an x-monotone polyline, and the y-coordinate of each vertex is not fixed but constrained to a given interval. Motivated by applications in terrain analysis, in this paper we present two linear-time approximation algorithms, for minimizing the largest turning angle and for maximizing the smallest one. In addition, we also provide linear time exact algorithms for minimizing and maximizing the sum of the turning angles.	approximation algorithm;mathematical optimization;polyhedral terrain;polyhedron;smoothing;time complexity;monotone	Chris Gray;Maarten Löffler;Rodrigo I.

This provides a refined and unified framework for the two primary methods of constructing Frechet embeddings for finite metrics, due to J. Bourgain and S. Rao. We prove that any n-point metric space (X, d) embeds in Hilbert space with distortion O(/spl radic//spl alpha//sub X//spl middot/log n), where /spl alpha//sub X/ is a geometric estimate on the decomposability of X. An an immediate corollary, we obtain an O(/spl radic/log /spl lambda//sub X//spl middot/log n) distortion embedding, where /spl lambda//sub X/ is the doubling constant of X. Since /spl lambda//sub X/ /spl les/ n, this result recovers Bourgain 5 theorem, but when the metric X is, in a sense, """"low-dimensional"""", improved bounds are achieved. Our embeddings are volume-respecting for subsets of arbitrary size. One consequence is the existence of (k, O(log n)) volume-respecting embeddings for all 1 /spl les/ k /spl les/ n, which is the best possible, and answers positively a question posed by U. Feige. Our techniques are also used to answer positively a question of Y. Rabinovich, showing that any weighted n-point planar graph embeds in /spl lscr//sub /spl infin///sup O(log n)/ with O(1) distortion. The O(log n) bound on the dimension is optimal, and improves upon the previously known bound of O(log/sup 2/ n)."""	descent	Robert Krauthgamer;James R.

A set D ⊆ V is a paired dominating set if D is dominating, and the induced subgraph 〈D〉 contains a perfect matching. The paired domination number of G, denoted by γp(G), is the minimum cardinality of a paired dominating set of G. The paired bondage number, denoted by bp(G), is the minimum cardinality among all sets of edges E ′ ⊆ E such that δ(G − E ) ≥ 1 and γp(G − E ) > γp(G). We say that G is a γp-strongly stable graph if, for all E ′ ⊆ E , either γp(G − E ) = γp(G) or δ(G − E ) = 0. We discuss the basic properties of paired bondage and give a constructive characterization of γp-strongly stable trees. c © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

(A hypergraph is a graph in which one edge may connect two or more vertices.) The hypergraph is represented by a collection of points in graph space such that the distance between vertices in graph space reflects the weights of the edges between vertices of the original hypergraph. Vertices of the hypergraph that are connected by edges with large weights are mapped to nearby points in graph space. Thus, graph space reveals properties of the connectivity of vertices in the hypergraph. A natural application of graph space is the placement of modules in computer systems since strongly coupled modules are transformed into nearby points in graph space. The graph of the airlines network in the United States is taken as an example of a hypergraph, and the paper illustrates the corresponding graph space.	graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (geometry)	Kunio Fukunaga;Shoichiro Yamada;Harold S.

An analytic coloring of X is an analytic subset of [ X ] N , where N >1 is a natural number. We define an absolute rank function on trees representing analytic colorings, which gives an upper bound for possible cardinalities of homogeneous sets and which decides whether there exists a perfect homogeneous set. We construct universal σ -compact colorings of any prescribed rank γ < ω 1 . These colorings consistently contain homogeneous sets of cardinality ℵ γ but they do not contain perfect homogeneous sets. As an application, we discuss the so-called defectedness coloring of subsets of Polish linear spaces.	analytic signal	Wieslaw Kubis;Saharon Shelah	2003	Ann. Pure Appl.

In a recent paper, Bessy, Sereni and the author proved that a regular tournament   T   of degree   2  r  −  1   contains at least   r   vertex-disjoint directed cycles, which shows that the above conjecture is true for regular tournaments. In this paper, we improve this result by proving that such a tournament contains at least     7    6    r  −    7    3     vertex-disjoint directed cycles.

In brief, we show that the underlying linear graph whose vertices correspond to the modules and whose edges correspond to the cables connecting the modules, is a group-graphs that is, the vertices correspond to the elements of a group G and there is given a finite subset G0 of G such that {g, g1} is an edge of the graph If, and only if, there exists g0 e G0 such that g1 = gg0.

We show that the LLL extends to a much more general geometric setting, where events are replaced with subspaces and probability is replaced with relative dimension, which allows to lower bound the dimension of the intersection of vector spaces under certain independence conditions.  Our result immediately applies to the k-QSAT problem: For instance we show that any collection of rank 1 projectors with the property that each qubit appears in at most 2k/(e*k) of them, has a joint satisfiable state. We then apply our results to the recently studied model of random k-QSAT. Recent works have shown that the satisfiable region extends up to a density of 1 in the large k limit, where the density is the ratio of projectors to qubits. Using a hybrid approach building on work by Laumann et al. we greatly extend the known satisfiable region for random k-QSAT to a density of Ω(2k/k2). Since our tool allows us to show the existence of joint satisfying states without the need to construct them, we are able to penetrate into regions where the satisfying states are conjectured to be entangled, avoiding the need to construct them, which has limited previous approaches to product states."""	lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;movie projector;quantum entanglement;qubit;true quantified boolean formula	Andris Ambainis;Julia Kempe;Or Sattath	2010		10.1145/1806689.1806712	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;lovász local lemma;mathematics;quantum computer;quantum mechanics	Theory	35.50282276957106	26.251231610883934	48698

This improves previous results of Katz and Morgenstern [Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 447-458].

Recently, the adjacency metric dimension and the local metric dimension have been introduced. We combine these variants and introduce the local adjacency metric dimension. We show that the (local) metric dimension of the corona product of a graph of order n and some non-trivial graph H equals n times the (local) adjacency metric dimension of H. This strong relation also enables us to infer computational hardness results for computing the (local) metric dimension, based on according hardness results for (local) adjacency metric dimension that we also provide. We also study combinatorial properties of the strong product of graphs and emphasize the role different types of twins play in determining in particular the adjacency metric dimension of a graph.	computation;graph (discrete mathematics);graph operations;metric dimension (graph theory)	Henning Fernau;Juan A.

68cf2cb72ab51b1106844bd27e17e518499cdff1	r-bbg2: recursive bipartition of bi-connected graphs		Given an undirected graph G(V,E), it is well known that partitioning a graph G into q connected subgraphs of equal or specificed sizes is in general NP-hard problem. On the other hand, it has been shown that the q-partition problem is solvable in polynomial time for q-connected graphs. For example, efficient polynomial time algorithms for finding 2-partition (bipartition) or 3-partition of 2-connected or 3connected have been developed in the literature. In this paper, we are interested in the following problem: given a bi-connected graph G of size n, can we partition it into two (connected) sub-graphs, G[V1] and G[V2] of sizes n1 and n2 such as both G[V1] and G[V2] are also bi-connected (and n1 + n2 = n)? We refer to this problem as the recursive bipartition problem of bi-connected graphs, denoted by R-BBG2. We show that a ploynomial algorithm exists to both decide the recursive bipartion problem R-BBG2 and find the corresponding bi-connected subgraphs when such a recursive bipartition exists.	3-partition problem;algorithm;biconnected graph;connectivity (graph theory);decision problem;fairness measure;graph (discrete mathematics);np-hardness;partition problem;polynomial;recursion (computer science);time complexity	Ngoc-Tu Nguyen;Zhi-Li Zhang	2018	CoRR			Theory	25.009068944581383	24.425376352835595	49787

O(n log n) time upper bounds have been given for this problem and that of computing the link diameter for the polygon. We consider the rectilinear case of this problem and give linear time algorithms to compute the rectilinear link diameter and the rectilinear link center of a simple rectilinear polygon. As a consequence we also obtain a linear time solution for the rectilinear link radius problem. To our knowledge these are the rst optimal algorithms for center and diameter problems of polygons.	algorithm;link distance;regular grid;time complexity	Bengt J. Nilsson;Sven Schuierer	1996	Comput.

d3b96f9987021d991c7dc7afa408f4112e5d8ed8	on coloring problems of snark families	edge coloring;graph coloring;chromatic number;indexation;vertex coloring	Abstract   Snarks are cubic bridgeless graphs of chromatic index 4 which had their origin in the search of counterexamples to the Four Color Theorem. In 2003, Cavicchioli et al. proved that for snarks with less than 30 vertices, the total chromatic number is 4, and proposed the problem of finding (if any) the smallest snark which is not 4-total colorable. Since then, only two families of snarks have had their total chromatic number determined to be 4, namely the Flower Snark family and the Goldberg family.  We prove that the total chromatic number of the Loupekhine family is 4. We study the dot product, a known operation to construct snarks. We consider families of snarks using the dot product, particularly subfamilies of the Blanusa families, and obtain a 4-total coloring for each family. We study edge coloring properties of girth trivial snarks that cannot be extended to total coloring. We classify the snark recognition problem as CoNP-complete and establish that the chromatic number of a snark is 3.	graph coloring;snark (graph theory)	Diana Sasaki;Simone Dantas;Celina M.

212e4bbadfd418f5f6eb6a24ad3ebb0ce26e7ced	scheduling with precedence constraints: mixed graph coloring in series-parallel graphs	graph coloring;series parallel graph;graph coloring problem;optimal scheduling;precedence constraint;scheduling problem	We consider the mixed graph coloring problem. A mixed graph GM = (V, E, A) is a graph with vertex set V and containing edges (set E) and arcs (set A). An edge joining vertices i and j is denoted by {i, j}, while an arc with tail p and head q is denoted by (p, q). A kcoloring of GM is a function φ : V → {1, 2, . . . , k} such that φ(i) 6= φ(j) for {i, j} ∈ E and φ(p) < φ(q) for (p, q) ∈ A. Observe that the mixed graph GM must be acyclic, i.e., must not contain any directed circuit, otherwise no proper k-coloring exists. The mixed graph coloring model can be used for formulating scheduling problems where both incompatibility and precedence constraints are present. Formally, let T be a collection of jobs (with unit processing times). These jobs have to be processed taking into account the following constraints: 1. Precedence constraints. There is a set of ordered jobs (i, j) such that i must be processed before j. 2. Disjunctive constraints. For a family I = {I1, . . . , Il} of subsets of T , no two jobs in Iα can be processed simultaneously, α = 1, . . . , l. Consider now a mixed graph GM = (V, E, A) obtained as follows: 1. With each job j in T we associate a vertex j in V . GM currently has no other vertices, and no arcs and edges. 2. For each ordered pair (i, j) of jobs we introduce an arc (i, j) in GM . 3. For each subset Iα, α = 1, . . . , l, we introduce a clique associated with the jobs in Iα. (If an edge is needed between vertices i and j, we introduce it only if there was no previous arc or edge joining i and j.) It easy to see that there is one-to-one correspondence between feasible schedules in k time units and k-colorings of the mixed graph GM . Herein, we present an O(n log n) time algorithm for finding the optimal scheduling in the case when incompatibility and precedence constraints form a series-parallel mixed graph.	algorithm;clique (graph theory);constraint (mathematics);directed acyclic graph;disjunctive normal form;graph coloring;job stream;mixed graph;one-to-one (data model);ordered pair;scheduling (computing);series-parallel graph;software incompatibility;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Hanna Furmanczyk;Adrian Kosowski;Pawel Zylinski	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-68111-3_106	graph power;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph bandwidth;fractional coloring;null graph;constraint graph;simplex graph;mixed graph;complete coloring;edge coloring;comparability graph;cubic graph;graph coloring;graph factorization;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;butterfly graph;list coloring;greedy coloring;line graph	Theory	25.137019187558888	24.27540597280389	50215

We show how to build, inO(n 2) time and space, a data structure from which inO(n) time we can compute the visibility polygon of a given point with respect to the polygon collection. As an application of this structure, the visibility graph of the given polygons can be constructed inO(n 2) time and space. This implies that the shortest path that connects two points in the plane and avoids the polygons in our collection can be computed inO(n 2) time, improving earlierO(n 2 logn) results.	data structure;shortest path problem;visibility graph;visibility polygon	Takao Asano;Tetsuo Asano;Leonidas J.

Through a large scale experiment on Facebook, we have established that the cohesion is highly correlated to the subjective user perception of the communities. In this article, we show that finding a set of vertices with maximum cohesion is NP-hard. Notations Let G = (V,E) be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E of size n = |V | ≥ 4. For all vertices u ∈ V , we write dG(u) the degree of u, or more simply d(u) . A triangle in G is a triplet of pairwise connected vertices. For all sets of vertices S ⊆ V , let G[S] = (S,ES) be the subgraph induced by S on G. We write m(S) = |ES | the number of edges in G[S], and i(S) = |{(u, v, w) ∈ S : (uv, vw, uw) ∈ E}| the number of triangles in G[S]. We define o(S) = |{(u, v, w), (u, v) ∈ S, w ∈ V \ S : (uv, vw, uw) ∈ E}|, the number of outbound triangles of S, that is: triangles in G which have exactly two vertices in S. Moreover, for all (u, v) in E, let △(uv) = |{w ∈ V : (uw, vw) ∈ E}| be the number of triangles the edge uv belongs to in G. Finally, we recall the definition of the cohesion of a set S in G: C(S) = i(S)	cohesion (computer science);complex network;earthbound;emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);linear algebra;np-completeness;np-hardness;social network;triplet state;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Adrien Friggeri;Eric Fleury	2011	CoRR		computer science;artificial intelligence;computational complexity theory;algorithm	DB	28.55836007790996	28.576280890869295	50427

The distance between any two site s is the length of a shortest path between them that is cons trai ed to lie strictly upon the polyhedral surface. We present t wo algorithms, the first of which, when given m points on an n-fac ed polyhedron, produces an MST in O(n logm+mlogm) time and O(n+m) space. In our second algorithm the running time is O(nlogm+mn(m/n)log(m/n)logm). Along with this improvement in the time bound, space requirements i crease slightly, to O(n+mlogm).	algorithm;approximation algorithm;file spanning;minimum spanning tree;polyhedron;requirement;shortest path problem;time complexity;voronoi diagram	Michael J.

We prove that under the Lp norm, the maximum vertex degree over all MSTs is equal to the Hadwiger number of the corresponding unit ball; we show an even tighter bound for MSTs where the maximum degree is minimized. We give the best-known bounds for the maximum MST degree for arbitrary Lp metrics in all dimensions, with a focus on the rectilinear metric in two and three dimensions. We show that for any finite set of points in the Manhattan plane there exists an MST with maximum degree of at most 4, and for three-dimensional Manhattan space the maximum possible degree of a minimum degree MST is either 13 or 14.	degree (graph theory);file spanning;minimum spanning tree;regular grid;routing	Gabriel Robins;Jeffrey S.

a02bec2e1173cb5d9ac0ceefe34e87898ea661e9	distance constrained labelings of trees	polynomial time algorithm;computational complexity;frequency assignment problem;graph model	An H(p, q)-labeling of a graph G is a vertex mapping f : VG → VH such that the distance (in the graph H) of f(u) and f(v) is at least p (at least q) if the vertices u and v are adjacent in G (are at distance two in G, respectively). This notion generalizes the notions of L(p, q)and C(p, q)-labelings of graphs studied as a graph model of the Frequency Assignment Problem. We study the computational complexity of the problem of deciding the existence of such a labeling when the graphs G and H come from restricted graph classes. In this way we are extending known results for linear and cyclic labelings of trees, with a hope that our results would help to open a new angle of view on the still open open problem of L(p, q)-labeling of trees for fixed p > q > 1 (i.e., when G is a tree and H a path). Our main results are a polynomial time algorithm for H(p, 1)-labeling of trees for arbitrary H, and NP-completeness results for H(p, q)-labeling of trees when H is a q-caterpillar, and L(p, q)-labeling of trees for fixed q > 1 and p part of input.	algorithm;assignment problem;computational complexity theory;lvm;np-completeness;p (complexity);polynomial	Jirí Fiala;Petr A.

41cef04fd699d84cab7eb365222c517fd6bdffd7	radio k-chromatic number of cycles for large k		For a positive integer k, a radio k-labeling of a graph G is a function f from its vertex set to the non-negative integers such that for all pairs of distinct vertices u and w, we have |f(u) − f(w)|≥ k −d(u,w) + 1 where d(u,w) is the distance between the vertices u and w in G. The minimum span over all radio k-labelings of G is called the radio k-chromatic number and denoted by rnk(G). The most extensively studied cases are the classic vertex colorings (k = 1), L(2,1)-labelings (k = 2), radio labelings (k = d, the diameter of G), and radio antipodal labelings (k = d − 1). Determining exact values or tight bounds for rnk(G) is often non-trivial even within simple families of graphs. We provide general lower bounds for rnk(Cn) for all cycles Cn when k ≥ d and show that these bounds are exact values when k = d + 1.	graph coloring	Nathaniel Karst;Joshua Langowitz;Jessica Oehrlein;Denise Sakai Troxell	2017	Discrete Math., Alg. and Appl.	10.1142/S1793830917500318	combinatorics;chromatic scale;mathematics;vertex (geometry);antipodal point;graph;integer	Theory	28.54631046347232	25.942002753651998	51341

Let δ be the minimum degree of a graph. Wang proposed a more general question to find a function f ( δ ) such that every properly edge-colored graph of order f ( δ ) contains a rainbow matching of size δ , which currently has the best bound of f ( δ ) ≤ 3 . 5 δ + 2 by Lo. Babu, Chandran and Vaidyanathan investigated Wang’s question under a stronger color condition. A strongly edge-colored graph is a properly edge-colored graph in which every monochromatic subgraph is an induced matching. Wang, Yan and Yu proved that every strongly edge-colored graph of order at least 2 δ + 2 has a rainbow matching of size δ . In this note, we extend this result to graphs of order at least 2 δ + 1 .	matching (graph theory);rainbow series	Yangyang Cheng;Ta Sheng Tan;Guanghui Wang	2018	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2018.06.019	conjecture;combinatorics;latin square;rainbow;monochromatic color;mathematics;transversal (geometry);graph	Theory	30.684748921664283	28.083340528222234	51712

Allowing two bends per edge, every planar graph with maximum degree d >= 3 can be drawn using segments of at most [d/2] different slopes. There is only one exception: the graph formed by the edges of an octahedron is 4-regular, yet it requires 3 slopes.

The key to an S-bound system is a set of initiaJ approximations to prirm”tive shapes in the CSG system; our original implementations used rectangular boxes in space (and prisms in space-time) to obtain an S-bound system in which the preprocessing time is tiny, compared with the time to execute a ‘classical’ in tersection test. However any form of approximation may be used in an S-bound system, and better approximation classes (such as convex hulls) may provide a better (smaller) region to search after preprocessing, at the expense of a larger preprocessing time. We describe an S-bound scheme that uses a hierarchy of two approximation types, namely aligned boxes and convex polyhedra, and provide examples of its use within our geome tric modelling system. The scheme is shown to provide ‘good’ bounds, although the overall utility of the scheme is doubtful in more than two dimensions without hardware support.	algorithm;approximation;chernoff bound;collision detection;constructive solid geometry;interference (communication);memory bound function;polyhedron;preprocessor;robot	Stephen Cameron	1991		10.1145/112515.112537	convex geometry;convex analysis;subderivative;mathematical optimization;two-dimensional space;convex cone;convex optimization;convex polytope;topology;convex combination;orthogonal convex hull;mixed volume;convex body;linear matrix inequality;convex conjugate;convex hull;space time;integer points in convex polyhedra;mathematics;geometry;convex set;convex curve;collision detection;constructive solid geometry;proper convex function;choquet theory	Graphics	33.7666935353941	18.68050671258068	52148

The problem is difficult not only in finding the optimal solution, but also in approximation. Since it is hard to approximate the minimum number of colors, we consider to approximate the maximum number of unused colors. This approximation is based on saving colors with respect to the most naive coloring method, which colors each vertex with a different color. In this paper we propose a polynomialtime graph coloring algorithm with approximation ratio 3/4 for the maximum number of unused colors, which improves the previous result 2/3. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

The Prime k-tuples Conjecture states that any for any admissible set, there are infinitely many n such that n+b1, n+b2, . . . n+bk are simultaneously prime. In 1974, Hensley and Richards [3] showed that ρ∗(x) > π(x) for x sufficiently large, which shows that the Prime k-tuples Conjecture is inconsistent with a conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood that for all integers x, y ≥ 2, π(x + y) ≤ π(x) + π(y).

The Hadwiger number ηpGq is the maximum cardinality of a clique minor in G. This paper studies clique minors in the Cartesian product G H . Our main result is a rough structural characterisation theorem for Cartesian products with bounded Hadwiger number. It implies that if the product of two sufficiently large graphs has bounded Hadwiger number then it is one of the following graphs: a planar grid with a vortex of bounded width in the outerface, a cylindrical grid with a vortex of bounded width in each of the two ‘big’ faces, or a toroidal grid. Motivation for studying the Hadwiger number of a graph includes Hadwiger’s Conjecture, which states that the chromatic number χpGq ¤ ηpGq. It is open whether Hadwiger’s Conjecture holds for every Cartesian product. We prove that if |V pHq| 1 ¥ χpGq ¥ χpHq then Hadwiger’s Conjecture holds for G H . On the other hand, we prove that Hadwiger’s Conjecture holds for all Cartesian products if and only if it holds for all G K2. We then show that ηpG K2q is tied to the treewidth of G. We also develop connections with pseudoachromatic colourings and connected dominating sets that imply near-tight bounds on the Hadwiger number of grid graphs (Cartesian products of paths) and Hamming graphs (Cartesian products of cliques).	cartesian closed category;graph coloring;hadwiger number;toroidal graph;treewidth;vortex	David R.

The collection of matchable ideals of P gives rise to a distributive supermatroid whose lattice of closed ideals is representable in the lattice of subspaces of a projective geometry. It is shown that with respect to order reversing weightings on P and Q, optimal matchings may be constructed according to the greedy algorithm for posets. The theory of integral vector linkings is discussed within this context.	greedy algorithm;matching (graph theory);reversing: secrets of reverse engineering	Ulrich Faigle	1983	Eur. J.

233e7eb1b9088ec2a82544e5c0d30db756e9cb01	splitarea: an algorithm for weighted splitting of faces in the context of a planar partition	topological data model;triangulated irregular networks;scale;vector data modelling;generalization	Geographic data themes modelled as planar partitions are found in many GIS applications (e.g. topographic data, land cover, zoning plans, etc.). When generalizing this kind of 2D map, this specific nature has to be respected and generalization operations should be carefully designed. This paper presents a design and implementation of an algorithm to perform a split operation of faces (polygonal areas). The result of the split operation has to fit in with the topological data structure supporting variable-scale data. The algorithm, termed SPLITAREA, obtains the skeleton of a face using a constrained Delaunay triangulation. The new split operator is especially relevant in urban areas with many infrastructural objects such as roads. The contribution of this work is twofold: (1) the quality of the split operation is formally assessed by comparing the results on actual test data sets with a goal/metric we defined beforehand for the ‘balanced’ split and (2) the algorithm allows a weighted split, where different neighbours have different weights due to different compatibility. With the weighted split, the special case of unmovable boundaries is also explicitly addressed. The developed split algorithm can also be used outside the generalization context in other settings. For example, to make two cross-border data sets fit, the algorithm could be applied to allow splitting of slivers.

6df022bdfc1b7b8a5e4e93b13237998a415af31b	a bijection for plane graphs and its applications		This paper is concerned with the counting and random sampling of plane graphs (simple planar graphs embedded in the plane). Our main result is a bijection between the class of plane graphs with triangular outer face, and a class of oriented binary trees. The number of edges and vertices of the plane graph can be tracked through the bijection. Consequently, we obtain counting formulas and an efficient random sampling algorithm for rooted plane graphs (with arbitrary outer face) according to the number of edges and vertices. We also obtain a bijective link, via a bijection of Bona, between rooted plane graphs and 1342-avoiding permutations.	algorithm;binary tree;embedded system;monte carlo method;planar graph;sampling (signal processing);vertex (geometry)	Olivier Bernardi;Gwendal Collet;Éric Fusy	2014		10.1137/1.9781611973204.5	1-planar graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;graph isomorphism;chordal graph;indifference graph;planar graph	Theory	31.193467930911083	22.901681234184345	53596

53937b3c990a8b6faad31f97f348b02d2c1e1553	quotients of strongly proper forcings and guessing models		We prove that a wide class of strongly proper forcing posets have quotients with strong properties. Specifically, we prove that quotients of forcing posets which have universal strongly generic conditions on a stationary set of models by certain nice regular suborders satisfy the ω1-approximation property. We prove that the existence of stationarily many ω1-guessing models in Pω2 (H(θ)), for sufficiently large cardinals θ, is consistent with the continuum being arbitrarily large, solving a problem of Viale and Weiss [13]. Many consistency results in set theory involve factoring a forcing poset Q over a regular suborder P in a forcing extension by P, and applying properties of the quotient forcing Q/ĠP. We will be interested in the situation where Q has strongly generic conditions for elementary substructures, and we wish the quotient Q/ĠP to have similar properties. For example, the quotient Q/ĠP having the approximation property is useful for constructing models in which there is a failure of square principles or related properties. We introduce some variations of strongly generic conditions, including simple and universal conditions. Our main theorem regarding quotients is that if Q is a forcing poset with greatest lower bounds for which there are stationarily many countable elementary substructures which have universal strongly generic conditions, and P is a regular suborder of Q which relates in a nice way to Q, then P forces that Q/ĠP has the ω1-approximation property. Several variations of this theorem are given, as well as an example which shows that not all quotients of strongly proper forcings are well behaved. Previously Weiss introduced combinatorial principles which characterize supercompactness yet also make sense for successor cardinals ([13], [14]). Of particular interest to us is the principle ISP(ω2), which asserts the existence of stationarily many ω1-guessing models in Pω1(H(θ)), for sufficiently large regular cardinals θ. This principle follows from PFA and has some of same consequences, such as the failure of the approachability property on ω1. It follows that ISP(ω2) implies that 2 ≥ ω2. Viale and Weiss [13] asked whether this principle settles the value of the continuum. We solve this problem by showing that ISP(ω2) is consistent with 2 ω being arbitrarily large. The solution is an application of the quotient theorem described above and the second author’s method of adequate set forcing ([3]).

They proved the projection median in R provides a better approximation of the 2-dimensional Euclidean median, while maintaining a fixed degree of stability, than other standard estimators, like the center of mass or the rectilinear median. In this paper we study the projection median of a set of points in R for d ≥ 3. We prove new bounds on the approximation factor and stability of the projection median in R, which show that the d-dimensional projection median also maintains a fixed degree of stability and provides a better approximation of the d-dimensional Euclidean median than the d-dimensional rectilinear median. For the special case of d = 3, our results imply that the 3-dimensional projection median is a (3/2)-approximation of the 3dimensional Euclidean median, which settles a conjecture posed by Durocher [4].	approximation;geometric median;random projection;regular grid	Riddhipratim Basu;Bhaswar B.

638dd7d1396f8cc7bdd2c19418ccc08082d91094	on ehrhart polynomials of lattice triangles		The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope counts the number of lattice points on the boundary and the number of lattice points strictly in the interior of dilations of the polytope. In this thesis, we show that there are infinitely many Ehrhart polynomials of lattice polygons which are not the Ehrhart polynomial of any lattice triangle. Let (b, i) be a given pair of non-negative integers. We give conditions on (b, i) for there to be a lattice triangle with b boundary points and i interior points. For b + 2(i − 1) = p, where p is prime, the condition is particularly simple. This gives us a class of (b, i) for which we know there are no lattice triangles. In addition, we conjecture the non-existence of lattice triangles for other large classes of (b, i). In the course of our work, we develop tools to study the patterns of for which (b, i) there is a lattice triangle.		Johannes Hofscheier;Benjamin Nill;Dennis Öberg	2018	Electr. J.

4d6737e410cb83f514c9f8caab42348f82f39f2e	solution of a covering problem related to labelled tournaments		Suppose we have a tournament with edges labelled so that the edges incident with any vertex have at most k distinct labels (and no vertex has outdegree 0). Let m be the minimal size of a subset of labels such that for any vertex there exists an outgoing edge labelled by one of the labels in the subset. It was known that m ? k+1 2 for any tournament. We show that this bound is almost best possible, by a probabilistic construction of tournaments with m = (k 2 = log k). We give explicit tournaments with m = k 2?o(1). If the number of vertices is bounded by N < 2 k , we have a better upper bound of m = O(k log N), which is again almost optimal. We also consider a relaxation of this problem in which instead of the size of a subset of labels we minimize the total weight of a fractional set with analogous properties. In that case the optimal bound is 2k ? 1.	covering problems;degree (graph theory);directed graph;linear programming relaxation	Jirí Sgall	1996	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(199610)23:2%3C111::AID-JGT2%3E3.0.CO;2-W	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	25.395975050225733	23.429279088791628	54105

We ask now whether for a given degree matrix  M , there exists a graph  G  such that  M  is a degree matrix of  G , and in addition, for any two edges  e ,  f  spanning between the same pair of blocks there exists an automorphism of  G  that sends  e  to  f .

A subset X of V is an interval of G provided that for a,b@?X and x@?V@?X, (a,x)@?A if and only if (b,x)@?A, and similarly for (x,a) and (x,b). For instance, 0@?, V and {x}, x@?V, are intervals of G, called trivial intervals. A directed graph is indecomposable if all its intervals are trivial, otherwise it is decomposable. Given an indecomposable directed graph G=(V,A), a vertex x of G is critical if G[V@?{x}] is decomposable. An indecomposable directed graph is critical when all its vertices are critical. With each indecomposable directed graph G=(V,A) is associated its indecomposability directed graph Ind(G) defined on V by: given x y@?V, (x,y) is an arc of Ind(G) if G[V@?{x,y}] is indecomposable. All the results follow from the study of the connected components of the indecomposability directed graph. First, we prove: if G is an indecomposable directed graph, which admits at least two non critical vertices, then there is x@?V such that G[V@?{x}] is indecomposable and non critical. Second, we characterize the indecomposable directed graphs G which have a unique non critical vertex x and such that G[V@?{x}] is critical. Third, we propose a new approach to characterize the critical directed graphs.	vertex (geometry)	Youssef Boudabbous;Pierre Ille	2009	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2008.07.015	transpose graph;graph power;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;topology;mathematics;bound graph;complement graph	ML	25.522680346911468	30.02966325367298	54402
2902a0677ef5f1c98e58c3abdf2ec3f77c641428	a refinement of kuratowski's theorem		It is a well-known result of Dirac [2] that any graph of minimum degree at least 3 contains a subdivision of K,. Thomassen and Toft [7] extended this by showing that a graph of minimum degree at least 3 contains a cycle with two crossing chords. In this paper we prove the conjecture of Kelmans [4] mentioned in the Abstract. The condition that the graph is non-planar is necessary since a cycle with three pairwise crossing chords is a special subdivision of K,,, and thus we have obtained a new planarity criterion for 3-connected graphs. Using this we give a precise description of the non-planar graphs which at the same time includes Kelmans’ conjecture, Kuratowski’s theorem, Tutte’s planarity criterion [9] that a graph is planar if and only if each cycle has a bipartite overlap graph, and also the extension in [5, Theorem 4.21 of this result of Tutte. We also discuss the algorithmic aspects. In particular, we can find, in polynomial time, a cycle with three pairwise crossing chords in a 3connected non-planar graph with at least six vertices.	algorithm;carsten thomassen;graph (discrete mathematics);kuratowski's theorem;left-right planarity test;planar graph;polynomial;refinement (computing);subdivision surface;time complexity	Carsten Thomassen	1984	J.

0d6483fe1c4f5219d21d3daa0e40f90310615af0	guest editors' foreword		The current special issue is the indirect result of the Fifth Workshop on Graph Classes, Optimization, and Width Parameters, GROW 2011, held in Daejeon, South Korea, in October 2011. It is a successor to the following special issues of Discrete Applied Mathematics: 160-6 (2012) dedicated to GROW 2009, held in Bergen, Norway; 158-7 (2010) dedicated to GROW 2007, held in Eugene, Oregon; 157-12 (2009) dedicated to the second workshop in the series, held in 2005 in Prague, Czech Republic; 145-2 (2005) dedicated to the first workshop, held in 2001 in Barcelona, Spain; and 54-2/3 (1994) dedicated to a workshop held in 1989 in Eugene, which in retrospect we view as workshop number zero in what has evolved to become the successful bi-annual GROW workshop series. This issue comprises 12 papers authored mainly, but not exclusively, by participants of the workshop. All submissions have been carefully refereed and we thank all the referees for their hard work. True to the name of the workshop, the papers in the current special issue report on investigations in three areas of research: Graph classes, Optimization, and Width parameters. Due to the close interconnections among these areas, most of the papers fit into more than one of these areas. Based on their main focus, we introduce the papers in this issue in the corresponding three groups. The area of Graph Classes is represented by papers proving new structural properties of various graph classes and exploring algorithmic consequences of these properties. Adler, Farley, and Proskurowski establish the set of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for the class of graphs whose linear rank-width is at most 1. From these they derive both the vertex-minor and the pivot-minor obstructions for the class. Chaplick and Stacho introduce a new graph parameter, which they call vertex leafage, and they study this parameter on chordal graphs. In particular, they prove that every chordal graph admits a tree model that realizes both its leafage and its vertex leafage, and they study the computational complexity of computing the vertex leafage of chordal graphs. Le gives new characterizations for co-bipartite opposition graphs, co-bipartite coalition graphs, and bipartite opposition graphs. Linear time recognition algorithms for these graph classes follow from the new characterizations. Nestoridis and Thilikos show that for every non-trivial and minor closed graph class, all graphs in its square root have carving-width bounded by some constant depending only on the graph class. As a consequence, every square root of such a graph class has a linear time recognition algorithm.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;forbidden graph characterization;retrospect (software);time complexity	Nina Amenta;Otfried Cheong	2009	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-009-9142-x		Theory	26.100488413951968	23.72313753166331	54682

In this problem, we are given an n-vertex graph G and an integer k, and the task is to determine whether we can obtain a bipartite graph from G by a sequence of at most k edge contractions. We show that Bipartite Contraction is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k. Despite a strong resemblance between Bipartite Contraction and the classical Odd Cycle Transversal (OCT) problem, the methods developed to tackle OCT do not seem to be directly applicable to Bipartite Contraction. To obtain our result, we combine several techniques and concepts that are central in parameterized complexity: iterative compression, irrelevant vertices, and important separators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the irrelevant vertex technique and the concept of important separators are applied in unison. Furthermore, our algorithm may serve as a comprehensible example of the usage of the irrelevant vertex technique.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;iterative compression;iterative method;parameterized complexity;relevance;unison	Pinar Heggernes;Pim van 't Hof;Daniel Lokshtanov;Christophe Paul	2013	SIAM J.

In our approach, we ensure that a topology change caused by inserting or deleting a node only affects the solution in a small neighborhood of that node, and show that a small set of range queries and bichromatic closest pair queries is then sufficient to efficiently repair the CDS.	approximation algorithm;closest pair of points problem;connected dominating set;euclidean distance;geometric graph theory;model of computation;polylogarithmic function;range query (data structures);regular grid	Leonidas J.

Every graph on n vertices containing at least cnr copies of H contains a “blow-up” of H with r − 1 vertex classes of size ⌊ c r lnn ⌋ and one vertex class of size greater than n1−c r−1 . A similar result holds for induced copies of H. Main results Suppose that a graph G of order n contains cn copies of a given subgraph H on r vertices. How large “blow-up” of H must G contain? When H is an r-clique, this question was answered in [3]: G contains a complete r-partite graph with r − 1 parts of size ⌊ c ln n ⌋ and one part larger than n r−1 . The aim of this note is to answer this question for any subgraph H. First we define precisely a “blow-up” of a graph: given a graph H of order r and positive integers x1, . . . , xr, we write H(x1, . . . , xr) for the graph obtained by replacing each vertex u ∈ V (H) with a set Vu of size xu and each edge uv ∈ E(H) with a complete bipartite graph with vertex classes Vu and Vv. Theorem 1 Let 2 ≤ r ≤ n, (ln n) 2 ≤ c ≤ 1/4, H be a graph of order r, and G be a graph of order n. If G contains more than cn copies of H, then G contains a copy of H(s, . . . s, t), where s = ⌊ c 2 ln n ⌋ and t > n r−1 . To state a similar theorem for induced subgraphs, we need a proper modification of H(x1, . . . , xr): we say that a graph X is of type H(x1, . . . , xr), if X is obtained from H(x1, . . . , xr) by adding some (possibly zero) edges within the sets Vu, u ∈ V (H). Theorem 2 Let 2 ≤ r ≤ n, (ln n) 2 ≤ c ≤ 1/4, H be a graph of order r, and G be a graph of order n. If G contains more than cn induced copies of H, then G contains an induced subgraph of type H(s, . . . s, t), where s = ⌊ c 2 ln n ⌋ and t > n r−1 . the electronic journal of combinatorics 15 (2008), #N6 1 Remarks The relations between c and n in Theorems 1 and 2 need some explanation. First, for fixed c, they show how large must be n to get valid conclusions. But, in fact, the relations are subtler, for c itself may depend on n, e.g., letting c = 1/ ln ln n, the conclusions are meaningful for sufficiently large n. Note that, in Theorems 1 and 2, if the conclusion holds for some c, it holds also for 0 < c < c, provided n is sufficiently large. The exponent 1 − c in Theorems 1 and 2 is not the best one, but is simple. Using random graphs, it is easy to see that most graphs on n vertices contain substantially many copies of any fixed graph, but contain no complete bipartite subgraphs with both parts larger than C log n, for some C > 0, independent of n. Hence, Theorems 1 and 2 are essentially best possible. General notation Our notation follows [1]; thus, given a graph G, we write: V (G) for the vertex set of G; E(G) for the edge set of G and e(G) for |E(G)| ; K2 for the complete graph of order 2; K2(s, t) for the complete bipartite graph with parts of size s and t; f |X for the restriction of a map f to a set X. Specific notation Suppose that G and H are graphs, and let X be an induced subgraph of H. We write H(G) for the set of injections h : V (H) → V (G), such that {u, v} ∈ E(H) if and only if {h(u), h(v)} ∈ E(G). We say that h ∈ H(G) extends g ∈ X(G), if g = h|V (X). Suppose that M ⊂ H(G). We let X(M) = {g : (g ∈ X(G)) & (there exists h ∈ M extending g)} . For every g ∈ X(M), we let dM(g) = ∣ ∣ {h : (h ∈ M) & (h extends g)} ∣	carrier-to-noise ratio;graph (discrete mathematics);induced subgraph;random graph;vertex (geometry)	Vladimir Nikiforov	2008	Electr.

0802a8ba01e4ac9151c24a2b5f4fb2cdcddb1af7	on the regulation number of a multigraph	maximum degree;upper bound	"""The regulation number of a multigraph G having maximum degree d is the minimum number of additional vertices that are required to construct a d-regular supermultigraph of G. It is shown that the regulation number of any multigraph is at most 3. The regulation number of a multidigraph is defined analogously and is shown never to exceed 2. A multigraph G has strength m if every two distinct vertices of G are joined by at most m parallel edges. For a multigraph G of strength m and maximum degree d, the m-regulation number of G is the minimum number of additional vertices that are required to construct a d-regular supermultigraph of G having strength m. A sharp upper bound on the 2-regulation number of a multigraph is shown to be (d + 5)/2, and a conjecture for general m is presented. In 1936 KSnig [8] proved that for every graph G of maximum degree d there is a dregular graph H containing G as an induced subgraph. Erd6s and Kelly [4] solved the extremal problem of determining the min imum number of vertices (called the induced regulation number) which must be added to a given graph G to obtain such a supergraph H. The latter result was extended by Beineke and Pippert [-3] to digraphs and oriented graphs. The regulation number of a 9raph G having maximum degree d is defined to be the min imum number of addit ional vertices required to construct a d-regular supergraph H of G. For basic graph theory terminology see [5]. Akiyama, Era and Hara ry [1] showed that the regulation number of a graph G having max imum degree d is at most d + 2 and that this b o u n d is sharp. In a further s tudy of the regulation number when d > 3, Akiyama and Hara ry [2] proved that for each n such that 0 _< n <_ d + 2 ifd is odd (0 _< n _< d + 1 ifd is even), there exists a graph G having maximum degree d and regulation number n. Hara ry and Schmidt [ 7 ] proved by construct ion that for all integers s and t such that 0 < s _< t, there exists a graph with regulation number s and induced regulation number t. The regulation number of a digraph was introduced and investigated in Hara ry and Karabed [6]. Our present object here is to study ana logous questions for multigraphs. * Research supported by a Western Michigan University faculty research fellowship. ** Research Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stevens Institute, Hoboken, NJ and Visiting Scholar, Courant Institute, New York University, Spring 1984. *** Research supported in part by a Western Michigan University research assistantship from the Graduate College and the College of Arts and Sciences. 138 G. Chartrand, F. Harary and O.R. Oellermann We define the regulation number o f a multigraph G with maximum degree d in an entirely analogous manner, namely, as the minimum number of additional vertices that are required to construct a d-regular supermultigraph of G (without regard to the number of parallel edges that may join a given pair of vertices). The regulation number of multidigraphs is defined similarly. In the case of multigraphs, one can associate other """"regulation numbers"""", according to their strength. A multigraph G is said to have strength m if every two distinct vertices are joined by at most m parallel edges. Note that a multigraph of strength m has strength n for each n > m. For a multigraph of strength m and maximum degree d we define the mregulation number of G to be the minimum of additional vertices that are required to construct a d-regular supermultigraph of G having strength m. A graph therefore may be regarded as a multigraph of strength 1. The regulation number of the multigraph G of Fig. la is 3. In order to see this, note first that the regulation number must be positive and further it is not 1; for ifa single vertex ul were added, it must be joined to v~ by a single edge and the resulting multigraph is not 3-regular. On the other hand, the regulation number cannot be 2 since no multigraph has an odd number o fodd vertices. The multigraph H o f Fig. lb shows that the regulation number is, in fact, 3. We now show that no multigraph has regulation number exceeding 3."""	ana (programming language);computer science;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;directed graph;frank harary;graph theory;hyperbolic absolute risk aversion;induced subgraph;kelly criterion;l. w. beineke;linear algebra;maxima and minima;multigraph;multiple edges;schmidt decomposition	Gary Chartrand;Frank Harary;Ortrud R.

These (frequently face-to-face) pseudotilings naturally rise in columns above 3-valent plane tilings by convex polygons, such that each column is occupied by stacked congruent barrel tiles or congruent apeirogonal pseudotiles. No physical space is occupied by the apeirogonal pseudotiles. Many interesting pseudotilings arise from plane tilings with high symmetry. As combinatorial structures, these are abstract polytopes of rank 4 with both finite and infinite 2-faces and facets.	barrel shifter;column (database);tiling window manager	Undine Leopold	2012	Symmetry	10.3390/sym4030545		Theory	35.181574723314455	23.629547961907914	55190

This has been proved only for n⩽3. In this paper, we prove it for pointsets having atmost logarithmic number of convex layers.

Since the directed k-cycle has circular chromatic number k/(k − 1), for k ≥ 2, values of χc between 1 and 2 are possible. We show that in fact, χc takes on all rational values greater than 1. Furthermore, there exist digraphs of arbitrarily large digirth and circular chromatic number.

45823175a8d4738ef84892c6d6d33ebc0bb2ecfa	the problem of finding the maximum multiple flow in the divisible network and its special cases		In the article the problem of finding the maximum multiple flow in the network of any natural multiplicity k is studied. There are arcs of three types: ordinary arcs, multiple arcs and multi-arcs. Each multiple and multi-arc is a union of k linked arcs, which are adjusted with each other. The network constructing rules are described. The definitions of a divisible network and some associated subjects are stated. The important property of the divisible network is that every divisible network can be partitioned into k parts, which are adjusted on the linked arcs of each multiple and multi-arc. Each part is the ordinary transportation network. The main results of the article are the following subclasses of the problem of finding the maximum multiple flow in the divisible network. 1. The divisible networks with the multi-arc constraints. Assume that only one vertex is the ending vertex for a multi-arc in s network parts. In this case the problem can be solved in a polynomial time. 2. The divisible networks with the weak multi-arc constraints. Assume that only one vertex is the ending vertex for a multi-arc in k-1 network parts (1 ≤ s < k − 1) and other parts have at least two such vertices. In that case the multiplicity of the maximum multiple flow problem can be decreased to k - s. 3. The divisible network of the parallel structure. Assume that the divisible network component, which consists of all multiple arcs, can be partitioned into subcomponents, each of them containing exactly one vertex-beginning of a multi-arc. Suppose that intersection of each pair of subcomponents is the only vertex-network source x 0. If k=2, the maximum flow problem can be solved in a polynomial time. If k ≥ 3, the problem is NP-complete. The algorithms for each polynomial subclass are suggested. Also, the multiplicity decreasing algorithm for the divisible network with weak multi-arc constraints is formulated.	arcs (computing);algorithm;flow network;maximum flow problem;np-completeness;polynomial;time complexity	A.

We follow [2] for Boolean algebraic notation, and Monk [5] for more specialized notation concerning cardinal functions on Boolean algebras. Fr(κ) is the free Boolean algebra on κ generators. A is the completion of A. If L is a linear order, then Intalg(L) is the interval algebra over L (perhaps after adjoining a first element to L). Any element x of Intalg(L) has the form [a0 , b0) ∪ · · · ∪ [am−1 , bm−1), with a0 < b0 < · · · < bm−1 ≤ ∞. (Here ∞ is not in L.) The intervals [ai, bi) are called the components of x. Now we define some notions entering into the definitions of our cardinal functions: A tower in A is a subset T of A well-ordered by the Boolean ordering in a limit ordinal type and with sum 1. We say that X is weakly dense in A if for all a ∈ A there is an x ∈ X+ such that x ≤ a or x ≤ −a. A weak partition of A is a system 〈bξ : ξ < α〉 of pairwise disjoint elements with sum 1; it is not assumed that all bξ are nonzero. We say that X ⊆ A is independent if for all F,G ∈ [X] we have [ F ∩ G = ∅ → ∏ x∈F x · ∏ x∈G −x = 0 ] ; we say that it is ideal independent if for all x ∈ X and all F ∈ [X\{x}]<ω we have that x ≤ ∑ y∈F y. A set X ⊆ A+ is dense in an ultrafilter D of A if for all a ∈ D there is an x ∈ X such that x ≤ a. It is not assumed that X ⊆ D. A subset X of A+ splits A if for every a ∈ A for which A a is infinite there is an x ∈ X such that a ·x = 0 = a ·−x. A free sequence in a Boolean algebra A is a sequence 〈aξ : ξ < α〉 of elements of A such that	allen's interval algebra;boolean algebra;boolean satisfiability problem;linear algebra;ordinal data;triune continuum paradigm	J.

For d> 2 let I(d) denote the graph of the d-dimensional unit cube. The vertices of I(d) are the 2d d-tuples of binary digits; two vertices are joined by an edge if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let s(d) denote the length of a longest snake in I(d). The problem of determining s(d) has its origins in the theory of error checking codes [lo] and has subsequently been shown to be of interest in connection with a number of applied problems. See [ 111 and [ 121, e.g., for further information on some of these applications. At the present time there is no formula for s(d); not even an asymptotic one. In fact, only live values of s have been determined. These are s(2) = 4, s(3) = 6, s(4) = 8, s(5) = 14, and s(6) = 26. Figure 1 shows a snake of length 6 in I(3).

Polynomial-time solutions are known for degree-bounded outerplanar graphs, a subclass of the partial 2-trees. On the contrary, the problem is known to be NP-hard in vertex-labeled partial 11-trees of bounded degree. We consider series-parallel graphs, i.e., partial 2-trees. We show that the problem remains NP-hard in biconnected series-parallel graphs with all but one vertex of degree bounded by three. A positive complexity result is presented for a related problem of high practical relevance which asks for a maximum common connected subgraph that preserves blocks and bridges of the input graphs. We present a polynomial time algorithm for this problem in series-parallel graphs, which utilizes a combination of BC- and SP-tree data structures to decompose both graphs.

This representation can be exploited to give separation sensitive complexity bounds for kinetic collision detection comparable to those of Erickson et al. [11] who deal with pairs of convex polygons.

We then discuss five operations which, in certain circumstances, can be used to combine two graphs, each having a unique minimum independent dominating set, to produce a new graph also having a unique minimum independent dominating set.

In this paper we study ordered variants of this problem and prove some tight estimates for a certain class of ordered cycles that we call bordered cycles . In particular, we show that the maximum number of edges in an ordered graph avoiding bordered cycles of length at most 2 k is Θ ( n 1 + 1 ∕ k ) . Strengthening the result of Bondy and Simonovits in the case of 6-cycles, we also show that it is enough to forbid these bordered orderings of the 6-cycle to guarantee an upper bound of O ( n 4 ∕ 3 ) on the number of edges.	turán number	Ervin Györi;Dániel Korándi;Abhishek Methuku;István Tomon;Casey Tompkins;Máté Vizer	2018	Eur.

We show that A is computably categorical if and only if A has only finitely many finite equivalence classes, or A has only finitely many infinite classes, bounded character, and at most one finite k such that there are infinitely many classes of size k. We also prove that all computably categorical structures are relatively computably categorical, that is, have computably enumerable Scott families of existential formulas. Since all computable equivalence structures are relatively ∆3 categorical, we further investigate when they are ∆2 categorical.

e9a81b687f2e135501bc888c51bfb0aa27ce3c09	peripheral circuits in infinite binary matroids		Abstract A peripheral circuit in a (possibly infinite) matroid M is a circuit C of M such that M / C is connected. In the case of a 3-connected graph G , this is equivalent to C being chordless and G − V ( C ) being connected. Two classical theorems of Tutte assert that, for a 3-connected graph G : (i) every edge e of G is in two peripheral cycles that intersect just on e and its incident vertices; and (ii) the peripheral cycles generate the cycle space of G [12] . Bixby and Cunningham generalized these to binary matroids, with (i) requiring a small adaptation. Bruhn generalized (i) and (ii) to the Freudenthal compactification of a locally finite graph. We unify these two generalizations to “cofinitary, binary B-matroids”. (Higgs introduced the B-matroid as an infinite matroid; recent works show this should now be accepted as the right notion of infinite matroid. Cofinitary means every cocircuit is finite.)

1343e0867fa53278346b95cb803661f4fb470071	morphing planar graph drawings with bent edges	separated by commas;planar graph	We give an algorithm to morph between two planar drawings of a graph, preserving planarity, but allowing edges to bend during the course of the morph. The morph is polynomial size and discrete: it uses a polynomial number of elementary steps, where each elementary step is a linear morph that moves each vertex along a straight line at uniform speed. Although there are previously-known planarity-preserving morphs that do not require edge bends, it is an open problem to find polynomial-size discrete morphs. We achieve polynomial size at the expense of edge bends.

The space X is δ-hyperbolic (in the Gromov sense) if any side of T is contained in a δneighborhood of the union of the other two sides, for every geodesic triangle T in X. We denote by δ(X) the sharp hyperbolicity constant of X, i.e., δ(X) := inf{δ ≥ 0 : X is δ-hyperbolic }. The study of hyperbolic graphs is an interesting topic since the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of a graph related to it. One of the main aims of this paper is to obtain quantitative information about the distortion of the hyperbolicity constant of the graph G \ e obtained from the graph G by deleting an arbitrary edge e from it. These inequalities allow to obtain the other main result of this paper, which characterizes in a quantitative way the hyperbolicity of any graph in terms of local hyperbolicity.	distortion;graph of a function	Walter Carballosa;Domingo Pestana;José M.

In particular, we prove that for n = 3 and for all r ≥ 15, the optimal density of an r-identifying code is 1 8r2 .

d81c28ee0b23ebad4f01bf4cf39e3fc0e1c76114	akempic triangulations with 4 odd vertices		Abstract   A triangulation of the 2-sphere is said to be akempic if it has a 4-coloring such that any two adjacent triangles have the vertices colored with all four colors and this 4-coloring is not Kempe equivalent to any other 4-coloring. Voltage graphs are used to obtain a simple characterisation of dual graphs of akempic triangulations which are  n -fold coverings over  K  4  and it is shown that  n  must be odd. If  a ( n ) is the number of the akempics with exactly four vertices of odd degree which have 2( n  + 1) vertices then  k ( n )/24 ⩽  a ( n ) ⩽  k ( n ) where  k ( n ) is the number of natural numbers  k  such that gcd( k ,  n ) = gcd(2 k −1,  n ) = 1. Consequently, lim  n  → ∞   a (2 n  + 1) = ∞.	delaunay triangulation;vertex (geometry)	Bojan Mohar	1985	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(85)90059-7	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebra	Theory	32.607814876500754	29.096602479191027	56881

Let G be a graph. We use V (G), E(G), (G) and δ(G) (or simply V , E , and δ) to denote the vertex set, the edge set, the maximum degree and the minimum degree of G , respectively. For a vertex v ∈ V , let N(v) denote the set of vertices adjacent to v , and let d(v) = |N(v)| denote the degree of v . A k-vertex, a k+-vertex or a k−-vertex is a vertex of degree k, at least k or at most k respectively. A k-cycle is a cycle of length k, and a 3-cycle is usually called a triangle. A total-k-coloring of a graph G is a coloring of V ∪ E using k colors such that no two adjacent or incident elements receive the same color. The total chromatic number χ ′′(G) of G is the smallest integer k such that G has a total-k-coloring. Clearly, χ ′′(G) + 1. Behzad [1] and Vizing [12] posed independently the following famous conjecture, which is known as the total coloring conjecture (TCC).	color;degree (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;planar graph;total coloring;vadim g. vizing;vertex (graph theory)	Bing Wang;Jian-Liang Wu	2011	Inf.

A set D of vertices of G is defined to be an (n, k )-dominating set of G if every vertex of V( G) D is within distance n from at least k vertices of D. The minimum cardinality among all (n, k )-dominating sets of G is called the (n, k )-domination number of G and is denoted by 'Yn,k(G). A set I of vertices of G is defined to be an (n, k)independent set in G if every vertex of I is within distance n from at most k-1 other vertices of I in G. We denote by f3n,k( G) the maximum cardinality of an (n, k)-independent set of G. We show that the problem of computing 'Yn,k is in the NP-complete class, even when restricted to bipartite graphs and chordal graphs. We prove that in every graph there exist some subsets of vertices that are both (n, k )-independent and (n, k )-dominating, so In,k :s; f3n,k' We also investigate lower and upper bounds on 'Yn,k' Australasian Journal of Combinatorics .!Q.( 1994) I pp. 29-43	australasian conference on information systems;dominating set;existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);independent set (graph theory);np-completeness;vertex (geometry)	Timothy J.

5a159fa0720d494d74e8bae786a96f91b47c5ced	coloring objects built from bricks	chromatic number;face to face	We address a question posed by Sibley and Wagon. They proved that rhombic Penrose tilings in the plane can be 3colored, but a key lemma of their proof fails in the natural 3D generalization. In that generalization, an object is built from bricks, each of which is a parallelopiped, and they are glued face-to-face. The question is: How many colors are needed to color the bricks of any such object, with no two face-adjacent bricks receiving the same color? For arbitrary parallelopiped bricks, we prove zonohedra are 4-colorable, and 4 colors are sometimes necessary, by establishing two Sibley conjectures for zonohedra. For orthogonal bricks, we narrow the chromatic number to {3, 4}, and have several results. Any genus-0 object (a “ball”) is 2-colorable; any genus-1 object is 3-colorable. For objects of higher genus, we show that if an object’s holes are “nonplanar” in a technical sense, then it is 2-colorable regardless of its genus, and for various special cases of planar holes, we can establish 3-colorability. We conjecture that all objects built from orthogonal bricks are 3-colorable. This would imply that the chromatic number does not increase when passing from 2D to 3D.	3d computer graphics;ball project;brick (electronics);color;genus (mathematics);graph coloring;kazhdan–lusztig polynomial;zonohedron	Suzanne Gallagher;Joseph O'Rourke	2003			combinatorics;mathematics;geometry	Theory	33.61352041438506	23.532869797395495	57208

608a8f8a4f60e8948e070c281631ba9d5ed1399c	improved upper bounds on $a'(g\box h)$		The acyclic edge colouring problem is extensively studied in graph theory. The corner-stone of this field is a conjecture of Alon et. al.[1] that a′(G) ≤ ∆(G) + 2. In that and subsequent work, a′(G) is typically bounded in terms of ∆(G). Motivated by this we introduce a term gap(G) defined as gap(G) = a′(G) − ∆(G). Alon’s conjecture can be rephrased as gap(G) ≤ 2 for all graphs G. In [5] it was shown that a′(G H) ≤ a′(G) + a′(H), under some assumptions. Based on Alon’s conjecture, we conjecture that a′(G H) ≤ a′(G) + ∆(H) under the same assumptions, resulting in a strengthening. The results of [1] validate our conjecture for the class of graphs it considers. We prove our conjecture for a significant subclass of sub-cubic graphs and state some generic conditions under which our conjecture can be proved. We suggest how our technique can be potentially applied by future researchers to expand the class of graphs for which our conjecture holds. Our results improve the understanding of the relationship between Cartesian Product and acyclic chromatic index. keywords: Acyclic edge colouring·Acyclic chromatic index·Cartesian Product ·Gap	berman–hartmanis conjecture;cartesian closed category;color;cubic function;directed acyclic graph;edge coloring;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;graph theory;permutation pattern;random graph;rewriting	Punit Mehta;Rahul Muthu;Gaurav Patel;Om Thakkar;Devanshi Vyas	2015	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;new digraph reconstruction conjecture;algebra	Theory	32.56121599630005	27.23861983065892	57433

e9c3cbba7fe99d0a709e6fba3bc74bd533ab5f41	on path-cycle decompositions of triangle-free graphs		In this work, we study conditions for the existence of length-constrained path-cycle decompositions, that is, partitions of the edge set of a graph into paths and cycles of a given minimum length. Our main contribution is the characterization of the class of all triangle-free graphs with odd distance at least 3 that admit a path-cycle decomposition with elements of length at least 4. As a consequence, it follows that Gallai’s conjecture on path decomposition holds in a broad class of sparse graphs.	cycle decomposition (graph theory);pathwidth;sparse matrix	Andrea Jiménez;Yoshiko Wakabayashi	2017	Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;conjecture;pathwidth;modular decomposition;mathematics;graph	Theory	29.597765286477944	29.18422854254605	57591

By triangulation we mean a finite simplicial complex; its homology type is given by its homology groups (with integer coefficients). The algorithm could be used in computer-aided design to tell whether two finite-element meshes or BCzier-spline surfaces are of the same “topological type,” and whether they can be embedded in P. Homology computation is a purely combinatorial problem of considerable intrinsic interest. While the worst-case bounds we obtain for this algorithm are poor, we argue that many triangulations (in general) and virtually all triangulations in design are very “sparse,” in a sense we make precise. We formalize this sparseness measure, and perform a probabilistic analysis of the sparse case to show that the expected running time of the algorithm is roughly quadratic in the geometric complexity (number of simplices) and linear in the dimension.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;coefficient;computation;computer-aided design;embedded system;finite element method;homology (biology);homology modeling;neural coding;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;simplicial complex;sparse matrix;spline (mathematics);time complexity	Bruce Randall Donald;Davied Renpan Chang	1991		10.1109/SFCS.1991.185432	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;relative homology;computational geometry;computer science;cw complex;point set triangulation;mathematics;geometry;computational complexity theory;simplicial complex;simplicial homology;algorithm;algebra	Theory	35.97953508916422	25.48588175696899	57606

More generally, these problems are shown to be the only ones that admit linear-size solutions with sublinear query time in the arithmetic model. The proof rests on a characterization of spanning trees with a low stabbing number. We use probabilistic arguments to treat the general case, but we are able to use geometric techniques to handle the most common range-searching problems, such as simplex and spherical range search. We prove that any set ofn points inEd admits a spanning tree which cannot be cut by any hyperplane (or hypersphere) through more than roughlyn1?1/d edges. This result yields quasi-optimal solutions to simplex range searching in the arithmetic model of computation. We also look at polygon, disk, and tetrahedron range searching on a random access machine. Givenn points inE2, we derive a data structure of sizeO(n logn) for counting how many points fall inside a query convexk-gon (for arbitrary values ofk). The query time isO(?kn logn). Ifk is fixed once and for all (as in triangular range searching), then the storage requirement drops toO(n). We also describe anO(n logn)-size data structure for counting how many points fall inside a query circle inO(?n log2n) query time. Finally, we present anO(n logn)-size data structure for counting how many points fall inside a query tetrahedron in 3-space inO(n2/3 log2n) query time. All the algorithms are optimal within polylogarithmic factors. In all cases, the preprocessing can be done in polynomial time. Furthermore, the algorithms can also handle reporting within the same complexity (adding the size of the output as a linear term to the query time).	range searching;vc dimension	Bernard Chazelle;Emo Welzl	1989	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/BF02187743	model of computation;time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;data structure;spanning tree;vc dimension;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Theory	30.104955187652727	19.44728441488041	58128

This paper describes a method to simplify Morse decompositions by iteratively merging pairs of Morse sets that are adjacent in the Morse Connection Graph (MCG). When Morse sets A and B are merged, they are replaced by a single Morse set, that can be thought of as the union of A, B and all trajectories connecting A and B. Pairs of Morse sets to be merged can be picked based on a variety of criteria. For example, one can allow only pairs whose merger results in a topologically simple Morse set to be selected, and give preference to mergers leading to small Morse sets.	admissible heuristic;algorithm;text simplification	Levente Sipeki;Andrzej Szymczak	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-04099-8_3	theoretical computer science;database	Graphics	29.71525916326443	24.083872931774668	58149

Golomb rulers, also known as Sidon sets and B2 sets, can be traced back to additive number theory in the 1930s and have attracted recent research activities on existence problems, such as the search for optimal Golomb rulers (those of minimal length given a fixed number of markings). Our goal is to enumerate Golomb rulers in a systematic way: we study gm(t) := # { x ∈ Z : 0 = x0 < x1 < · · · < xm = t, all xj − xk distinct } , the number of Golomb rulers with m + 1 markings and length t. Our main result is that gm(t) is a quasipolynomial in t which satisfies a combinatorial reciprocity theorem: (−1)gm(−t) equals the number of rulers x of length t with m + 1 markings, each counted with its Golomb multiplicity, which measures how many combinatorially different Golomb rulers are in a small neighborhood of x. Our reciprocity theorem can be interpreted in terms of certain mixed graphs associated to Golomb rulers; in this language, it is reminiscent of Stanley’s reciprocity theorem for chromatic polynomials. Thus in the second part of the paper we develop an the electronic journal of combinatorics 19(3) (2012), #P42 1 analogue of Stanley’s theorem to mixed graphs, which connects their chromatic polynomials to acyclic orientations.	directed acyclic graph;enumerated type;golomb ruler;mixed graph;polynomial;quasi-polynomial;stanley (vehicle);the stanley parable;utility functions on indivisible goods	Matthias Beck;Tristram Bogart;Tu Pham	2012	Electr.

15d4f28a36bd87edf734aa06217c6c22e8f40f3b	error amplification for pairwise spanner lower bounds		A pairwise spanner of a graph G = ( V, E ) and a pair P ⊆ V × V is a subgraph H that preserves all pairwise distances in P , up to some additive error term + β . When β = 0 the object is called a pairwise distance preserver. A large and growing body of work has considered upper bounds for these objects, but lower bounds have been elusive. The only known lower bound results are (1) Coppersmith and Elkin (SODAu002705) against preservers, and (2) considerably weaker bounds by Woodruff (FOCSu002706) against spanners. Our main result is an amplification theorem: we prove that lower bounds against pairwise distance preservers imply lower bounds against pairwise spanners. In other words, to prove lower bounds against any constant error spanners, it is enough to consider only subgraphs that are not allowed any error at all! We apply this theorem to obtain drastically improved lower bounds. Some of these include: • Linear size pairwise spanners with up to +(2 k -- 1) error cannot span | P | = ω ( n (1+ k )/(3+ k ) ) pairs. This is a large improvement over Woodruffu0027s | P | = ω ( n 2--2/ k ) (| P | is now linear, rather than quadratic, as k gets large). • | E ( H )| = Ω( n 1+1/ k ) edges are required for a +(2 k -- 1) spanner of | P | = Ω( n 1+1/ k ) pairs - this is another large improvement over Woodruffu0027s | P | = Ω( n 2 ). • The first tight bounds for pairwise spanners: for +2 error and P = Θ( n 3/2 ) we show that Θ( n 3/2 ) edges are necessary and sufficient (this also reflects a new upper bound: we construct +2 pairwise spanners on O ( n | P | 1/3 ) edges, removing a log factor from a prior algorithm). We also show analogous improved lower bounds against subset spanners (where P = S × S for some node subset S ), and the first lower bounds against D threshold spanners (where P is the set of node pairs at distance at least D ).

The goal is to minimize the number and complexity of the cells in the AVD. We show that it is possible to construct an AVD consisting of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>/ε<sup><i>d</i></sup>) cells for <i>t</i> = 1, and <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) cells for <i>t</i> = <i>O</i>(1/ε<sup>(<i>d</i>-1)/2</sup>).

This new bound is sharp for even cycles and for three other graphs. These results relate nicely to some algorithms for finding large independent sets.

The goal is to minimize the span of a feasible assignment. This channel assignment problem can be modeled with distance-dependent graph labelings. A k-L(2,1)-labeling of a graph G is a mapping f from the vertex set of G to the set {0,1,2, . . . , k} such that |f (x) − f (y)| ≥ 2 if d(x, y) = 1 and f (x) = f (y) if d(x, y) = 2, where d(x, y) is the distance between vertices x and y in G. The minimum k for which G admits an k-L(2,1)-labeling, denoted by λ(G), is called the λ-number of G. Very little is known about λ-numbers of 3-regular graphs. In this paper we focus on an important subclass of 3-regular graphs called generalized Petersen graphs. For an integer n ≥ 3, a graph G is called a generalized Petersen graph of order n if and only if G is a 3-regular graph consisting of two disjoint cycles (called inner and outer cycles) of length n, where each vertex of the outer (resp. inner) cycle is adjacent to exactly one vertex of the inner (resp. outer) cycle. In 2002, Georges and Mauro conjectured that λ(G) ≤ 7 for all generalized Petersen graphs G of order n ≥ 7. Later, Adams, Cass and Troxell proved that Georges and Mauro’s conjecture is true for orders 7 and 8. In this paper it is shown that Georges and Mauro’s conjecture is true for generalized Petersen graphs of orders 9, 10, 11 and 12. L.-H.

Nice drawings for sparse nonplanar graphs can be achieved by determining a maximum planar subgraph and augmenting an embedding of this graph. This approach appears to be of limited value in practice, because the maximum planar subgraph problem is NP-hard. We attack the maximum planar subgraph problem with a branch-and-cut technique which gives us quite good, and in many cases provably optimum, solutions for sparse graphs and very dense graphs. In the theoretical part of the paper, the polytope of all planar subgraphs of a graphG is defined and studied. All subgraphs of a graphG, which are subdivisions ofK 5 orK 3,3, turn out to define facets of this polytope. For cliques contained inG, the Euler inequalities turn out to be facet-defining for the planar subgraph polytope. Moreover, we introduce the subdivision inequalities,V 2k inequalities, and the flower inequalities, all of which are facet-defining for the polytope. Furthermore, the composition of inequalities by 2-sums is investigated. We also present computational experience with a branch-and-cut algorithm for the above problem. Our approach is based on an algorithm which searches for forbidden substructures in a graph that contains a subdivision ofK 5 orK 3,3. These structures give us inequalities which are used as cutting planes. Finally, we try to convince the reader that the computation of maximum planar subgraphs is indeed a practical tool for finding nice embeddings by applying this method to graphs taken from the literature.	algorithm;branch and cut;computation;euler;graph drawing;planar graph;planarization;sparse matrix;subdivision surface	Michael Jünger;Petra Mutzel	1996	Algorithmica	10.1007/BF02086607	outerplanar graph;graph power;topological graph theory;mathematical optimization;maximum cut;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;polyhedral graph;universal graph;graph embedding;topology;slope number;forbidden graph characterization;planar straight-line graph;subgraph isomorphism problem;graph factorization;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;graph drawing;butterfly graph;crossing number;graph minor;book embedding;line graph;algorithm;planar graph;branch and cut	Theory	26.274151949859313	23.53845122517969	59687

Using the contact range, one can quickly classify the positions along a line for a polyhedron as ‘‘safe’’ for free of collision with another polyhedron, or ‘‘unsafe’’ otherwise. This kind of contact detection between two objects is important in CAD, computer graphics and robotics applications. In this paper we propose a robust and efficient computation scheme to determine the directional contact range of two polyhedra. We consider the problem in its dual equivalence by studying the Minkowski difference of the two polyhedra under a duality transformation. The algorithm requires the construction of only a subset of the faces of the Minkowski difference, and resolves the directional range efficiently. It also computes the contact configurations when the boundaries of the polyhedra are in contact. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We also extend results from [3] for minimal liftings in maximal lattice-free simplices to more general polytopes. These nontrivial generalizations require the use of deep theorems from discrete geometry and geometry of numbers, such as the Venkov-Alexandrov-McMullen theorem on translative tilings, and McMullen’s characterization of zonotopes.	lambda lifting;lifting scheme;maximal set;zonohedron	Gennadiy Averkov;Amitabh Basu	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07557-0_7	polytope;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	38.53655402652372	26.297825487731178	59778

In order to process queries efficiently, the set of obstacle polyhedra is usually preprocessed into a data structure. In this paper we propose a query-sensitive data structure for ray shooting, which means that the performance of our data structure depends on the local geometry of obstacles near the query segment. We measure the complexity of the local geometry near the segment by a parameter called the simple cover complexity, denoted by scc(s) for a segment s. Our data structure consists of a subdivision that partitions the space into a collection of polyhedral cells, each of O(1) complexity. We answer a segment shooting query by wallking along the segment through the subdivision. Our first result is that, for any fixed dimension d, there exists a simple hierarchical subdivision in which no query segment s intersects more than O(scc(s)) cells. Our second result shows that in two dimensions such a subdivision of size O(n) can be constructed in time O(nlogn), where n is the total number of vertices in all the obstacles.		Joseph S. B.

585b8b3c31652cb31a8d56c7eac4fc9b0b28b91c	point sweep coverage on path		An important application of wireless sensor networks is the deployment of mobile sensors to periodically monitor (cover) a set of points of interest (PoIs). The problem of Point Sweep Coverage is to deploy fewest sensors to periodically cover the set of PoIs. For PoIs in a Eulerian graph, this problem is known NP-Hard even if all sensors are with uniform velocity. In this paper, we study the problem when PoIs are on a line and prove that the decision version of the problem is NP-Complete if the sensors are with different velocities. We first formulate the problem of Max-PoI sweep coverage on path (MPSCP) to find the maximum number of PoIs covered by a given set of sensors, and then show it is NP-Hard. We also extend it to the weighted case, Max-Weight sweep coverage on path (MWSCP) problem to maximum the sum of the weight of PoIs covered. For sensors with uniform velocity, we give a polynomial-time optimal solution to MWSCP. For sensors with constant kinds of velocities, we present a 1 2 -approximation algorithm. For the general case of arbitrary velocities, we propose two algorithms. One is a 1 2α -approximation algorithm family scheme, where integer α ≥ 2 is the tradeoff factor to balance the time complexity and approximation ratio. The other is a 1 2 (1−1/e)-approximation algorithm by randomized analysis.	approximation algorithm;decision problem;eulerian path;intruder detection;np-completeness;np-hardness;point of interest;polynomial;randomized algorithm;sensor;software deployment;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Dieyan Liang;Hong Shen	2017	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;algorithm	ECom	27.110868311941694	18.713802570928614	60369

05f5411fab1dc9bee22120eb616d27dfc195564b	estimating the number of connected components in a graph via subgraph sampling		Learning properties of large graphs from samples has been an important problem in statistical network analysis since the early work of Goodman [27] and Frank [21]. We revisit a problem formulated by Frank [21] of estimating the number of connected components in a large graph based on the subgraph sampling model, in which we randomly sample a subset of the vertices and observe the induced subgraph. The key question is whether accurate estimation is achievable in the sublinear regime where only a vanishing fraction of the vertices are sampled. We show that it is impossible if the parent graph is allowed to contain high-degree vertices or long induced cycles. For the class of chordal graphs, where induced cycles of length four or above are forbidden, we characterize the optimal sample complexity within constant factors and construct linear-time estimators that provably achieve these bounds. This significantly expands the scope of previous results which have focused on unbiased estimators and special classes of graphs such as forests or cliques. Both the construction and the analysis of the proposed methodology rely on combinatorial properties of chordal graphs and identities of induced subgraph counts. They, in turn, also play a key role in proving minimax lower bounds based on construction of random instances of graphs with matching structures of small subgraphs.	clique (graph theory);connected component (graph theory);induced subgraph;minimax;network theory;randomness;sample complexity;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Jason M.

We first prove that every connected component of X is either a singleton or a generalised crown (i.e. an ordered set that is connected, has length 1, and all vertices of which have the same degree). The representation of a generalised crown by a square (0,1)-matrix in which all line sums are equal is used throughout, and a complete description of X, including the number of connected components and the degree of the vertices, is given. We then examine the converse problem of when a generalised crown can be made into a connected component of (X; g). We also determine the number of non-isomorphic finite simple Ockham algebras that belong properly to a given subvariety P2n,0. Finally, we show that the number of fixed points of (L; f) is 0,1, or 2 according to the nature of X.		T. S. Blyth;J. C.

Balls arrive one at a time. When a ball arrives, it first chooses a vertex u in G uniformly at random. Then the ball performs a local search in G starting from u until it reaches a vertex with local minimum load, where the ball is finally placed on. Then the next ball arrives and this procedure is repeated. For the case m = n, we give an upper bound for the maximum load on graphs with bounded degrees. We also propose the study of the cover time of this process, which is defined as the smallest m so that every bin has at least one ball allocated to it. We establish an upper bound for the cover time on graphs with bounded degrees. Our bounds for the maximum load and the cover time are tight when the graph is vertex transitive or sufficiently homogeneous. We also give upper bounds for the maximum load when m > n.	local search (optimization)	Karl Bringmann;Thomas Sauerwald;Alexandre Stauffer;He Sun	2016	Random Struct.

In particular, we are able to apply our approach to solve two long-standing problems of computational geometry: one is to obtain a quadratic algorithm for computing the minimum-area triangle with vertices chosen among n points in the plane; the other is to produce an optimal algorithm for the half-plane range query problem. This problem is to preprocess n points in the plane, so that given a test half-plane, one can efficiently determine all points lying in the half-plane. We describe an optimal O(k + log n) time algorithm for answering such queries, where k is the number of points to be reported. The algorithm requires O(n) space and O(n log n) preprocessing time. Both of these results represent significant improvements over the best methods previously known. In addition, we give a number of new combinatorial results related to the computation of line arrangements.	algorithm;computation;computational geometry;discrepancy function;dual graph;geometric median;planar graph;preprocessor;range query (database);range searching	Bernard Chazelle;Leonidas J.

390ce95ebf4ed59bf7e2ad1dd5969a4d567afe2f	algorithm for b-partitions, parameterized complexity of the matrix determinant and permanent		Every square matrix A = (auv) ∈ C n×n can be represented as a digraph having n vertices. In the digraph, a block (or 2-connected component) is a maximally connected subdigraph that has no cut-vertex. The determinant and the permanent of a matrix can be calculated in terms of the determinant and the permanent of some specific induced subdigraphs of the blocks in the digraph. Interestingly, these induced subdigraphs are vertex-disjoint and they partition the digraph. Such partitions of the digraph are called the B-partitions. In this paper, first, we develop an algorithm to find the B-partitions. Next, we analyze the parameterized complexity of matrix determinant and permanent, where, the parameters are the sizes of blocks and the number of cut-vertices of the digraph. We give a class of combinations of cut-vertices and block sizes for which the parametrized complexities beat the state of art complexities of the determinant and the permanent. keywords: B-partitions, Block (2-connected component), Determinant, Permanent.

For example, if \({\mathcal I} \subset P(\omega)\) is an ideal containing the ideal Fin of finite subsets of ω, then \(P(\omega) \setminus {\mathcal I}\) is a positive family and the set \(\mbox{Dense}({\mathbb Q})\) of dense subsets of the rational line is a positive family which is not the complement of some ideal on \(P({\mathbb Q})\). We prove that, for a positive family \({\mathcal P}\), the order types of maximal chains in the complete lattice \(\langle {\mathcal P} \cup \{\emptyset\}, \subset \rangle\) are exactly the order types of compact nowhere dense subsets of the real line having the minimum non-isolated. Also we compare this result with the corresponding results concerning maximal chains in the Boolean algebras P(ω) and \(\mbox{Intalg}[0,1)_{{\mathbb R}}\) and the poset \(E({\mathbb Q})\), where \(E({\mathbb Q})\) is the set of elementary submodels of the rational line.	maximal set	Milos S.

Each of the hypergraphs is then said to block the other. Given integers n, r,m we determine the maximal size of a sub-hypergraph of [n]r (meaning that it is r-partite, with all sides of size n) for which there exists a blocking sub-hypergraph of [n]r of size m. The answer involves a self-similar sequence, first studied by Knuth. We also study the same question with (n r ) replacing [n]r. These results yield new proofs of some known Erdős-Ko-Rado type theorems. 1. Blockers in r-partite hypergraphs 1.1. Blockers. For a set A and a number r let ( A r ) be the set of all subsets of size r of A, in other words the complete r-uniform hypergraph on A. Given numbers r and n let [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n}, and let [n] be the complete r-partite hypergraph with all sides being equal to [n]. Let U be either ( [n] r ) or [n], and let F be a sub-hypergraph of U . The blocker B(F ) = B(U,F ) of F is the set of those edges of U that meet all edges of F . For a number t we denote by bp(t) (resp. bc(t) reference to the uniformity r is suppressed in both notations) the maximal size of |B([n], F )| (resp. |B( ( [n] r ) , F )| ), where F ranges over all sets of t edges in [n] (resp. ( [n] r ) ). The subscript p alludes at “partite”, and the subscript c alludes at “complete”. The aim of this paper is to calculate bp(t) and bc(t) for all values of n, r and t. As a side benefit, this will enable us to give new proofs of some well-known Erdős-Ko-Rado type results. 1.2. Cross intersecting versions of the Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem. The famous Erdős-Ko-Rado (EKR) theorem [9] states that if r ≤ n2 and a hypergraph H ⊆ ( [n] r ) has more than ( n−1 r−1 ) edges, then H contains two disjoint sets. Many extensions of this theorem have been proved for pairs of hypergraphs. In [17, 20] the following was proved: Theorem 1.1. If r ≤ n2 , and H1,H2 ⊆ ( [n] r ) satisfy |H1||H2| > ( n−1 r−1 )2 (in particular if |Hi| > ( n−1 r−1 ) , i = 1, 2), then there exist disjoint edges, e1 ∈ H1, e2 ∈ H2. In [17] this was also extended to hypergraphs of different uniformities. Versions of this result were proved for cross t-intersecting pairs of hypergraphs, in [13, 21, 23]. The EKR theory has been also extended to sets living in [n], rather than ( [n] r ) . An easy observation is that any subset of [n] of size larger than nr−1 contains two disjoint edges. This can be proved from the fact that [n] is the union of nr−1 perfect matchings. More interesting are cross-intersecting type results: Theorem 1.2. A pair F1, F2 of subsets of [n] r satisfying |F1| > nr−1 and |F2| ≥ nr−1 has a rainbow matching. And the even stronger: Theorem 1.3. If F1, F2 ⊆ [n] and |F1||F2| > n2(r−1) then the pair (F1, F2) has a rainbow matching. Theorem 1.3 was proved in [18]. It was generalized to cross t-intersecting pairs of hypergraphs and to hypregaphs of different uniformities in [1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 22] ([1, 22] use spectral methods). At the end of the next section we shall use the techniques of the present paper to give new proofs for these results.

Criteria for bases existence and finite bases existence for these classes is obtained. The problem of the bases existence for some families of closed classes of the three-valued logic functions is considered in the paper. E. Post [1] (see also, for instance, [2]) described all closed classes of Boolean functions and showed that each such class has a finite basis. This result is not extendable to the case of k-valued logics for k ≥ 3. Ju. I. Janov and A.A.Muchnik [3] (see also, for instance, [2]) showed that for all k ≥ 3 the set Pk (here Pk is the set of all functions of the k-valued logic) contains closed classes having a countable basis, and those having no basis. The generating systems for classes from these examples consist of symmetric functions that take values from the set {0, 1} and equal to zero on tuples containing at least one zero component. Similar classes have been described in [4–6]. Criteria of basis existence and finite basis existence for these classes have been obtained. In [7] some closed classes, generated by symmetric periodic function with bounded period have been investigated. Criterium of finite basis existence has been obtain and it was shown that if such class has no finite basis, it has no any basis. This paper deals with closed classes of three-valued logic, generated by symmetric periodic functions with increasing period. Criteria of basis existence and finite basis existence has been obtained. Let R be the set of all functions that take values from the set {0, 1} and equal zero on tuples containing at least one zero. R = {f(x1, . . . , xn) | ((∀α̃)((α̃ ∈ {0, 1, 2} ) → (f(α̃) ∈ {0, 1})))& ((∀α̃)((α̃ ∈ {0, 1, 2}\{1, 2}) → (f(α̃) = 0)))} In this paper we deal with some subclasses of the class R. Any function that does not change with variable relabeling is called symmetric. Denote by S the set of all symmetric functions from R. The set of all tuples that can be obtained from each other by component permutation is called a layer. With L(e, d) we denote a layer from {1, 2} containing e 1s ∗National Research University Higher School of Economics All necessary definitions can be found in [2, 4–6].	closed-world assumption;extensibility;graph labeling;three-valued logic	Anna V.

These results complete the crossing numbers list of Cartesian products of all 5-vertex graphs with paths. We also give a description of Cartesian products of 5-vertex graphs with cycles and stars, whose crossing numbers are known.	cartesian closed category;crossing number (graph theory)	Marián Klesc	2001	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(00)00251-X	1-planar graph;block graph;lattice graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph product;longest path problem;force-directed graph drawing;hypercube graph;cartesian product;mathematics;geometry;modular decomposition;path;graph;graph drawing;crossing number;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding;drawing	Theory	27.655029189253227	30.032239711184396	61792

First, we develop a simple algorithm to list all nonisomorphic rooted plane trees in lexicographic order using a level sequence representation. Then, by selecting a unique centroid to act as the root of a free plane tree, we apply the rooted plane tree algorithm to develop an algorithm to list all nonisomorphic free plane trees. The latter algorithm also uses a level sequence representation and lists all free plane trees with a unique centroid first followed by all free plane trees with two centroids. Both algorithms are proved to run in constant amortized time using straightforward bounding methods.	algorithm;amortized analysis;lexicographical order;list of algorithms	Joe Sawada	2006	ACM Trans.

45291f16d74c513f15fe4601e83e9a5b410cb8cc	on the complexity of failed zero forcing	graph theory;zero forcing	Let  G  be a simple graph whose vertices are partitioned into two subsets, called ‘filled’ vertices and ‘empty’ vertices. A vertex  v  is said to be forced by a filled vertex  u  if  v  is a unique empty neighbor of  u . If we can fill all the vertices of  G  by repeatedly filling the forced ones, then we call an initial set of filled vertices a forcing set. We discuss the so-called failed forcing number of a graph, which is the largest cardinality of a set which is not forcing. Answering the recent question of Ansill, Jacob, Penzellna, Saavedra, we prove that this quantity is NP-hard to compute. Our proof also works for a related graph invariant which is called the skew failed forcing number.		Yaroslav Shitov	2017	Theor. Comput.

However, this argument does not give us an algorithm to find a proper 2-colouring of such hypergraphs. We call a hypergraph linear if no two hyperedges have more than one vertex in common. In this paper, we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for 2-colouring every k-uniform linear hypergraph with ∆ ≤ 2k−k , where 1/2 < < 1 is any arbitrary constant and k is larger than a certain constant that depends on . The previous best algorithm for 2-colouring linear hypergraphs is due to Beck and Lodha [4]. They showed that for every δ > 0 there exists a c > 0 such that every linear hypergaph with ∆ ≤ 2k−δk and k > c log log(|E(H)|), can be properly 2-coloured deterministically in polynomial time. ∗Research of the first author is supported by a NSERC graduate scholarship and research grants of Prof. D.

In this paper we take a generalized view of gain graphs in which the label of an edge is related to the label of the reverse edge by an involution, i.e., an anti-automorphism of order at most two. Switching classes are equivalence classes of gain graphs under the switching operation. The membership problem is important to the theory of switching classes. The problem is to decide for two given gain graphs, on the same underlying graph and having gains from the same group, whether or not they belong to the same switching class. We give e cient and often optimal algorithms. If a certain gain graph in the switching class has only abelian labels, then we can reduce the membership problem to an elegant problem on involutions. Finally we show that the word problem can be reduced to the general membership problem, thereby establishing undecidability of the latter for some groups.	algorithm;directed graph;gain graph;graph (discrete mathematics);reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;turing completeness;undecidable problem	Jurriaan Hage	1999	Fundam.

It is known that every planar graph G of n vertices has a grid drawing on an (n?2)×(n?2) or (4n/3)×(2n/3) integer grid. In this paper we show that if a planar graph G has a balanced partition then G has a grid drawing with small grid area. More precisely, if a separation pair bipartitions G into two edge-disjoint subgraphs G 1 and G 2, then G has a max?{n 1,n 2}×max?{n 1,n 2} grid drawing, where n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of vertices in G 1 and G 2, respectively. In particular, we show that every series-parallel graph G has a (2n/3)×(2n/3) grid drawing and a grid drawing with area smaller than 0.3941n 2 (<(2/3)2 n 2).	planar graph	Xiao Zhou;Takashi Hikino;Takao Nishizeki	2012	J.

The partial orders under consideration include those related with some Laplacian characteristics of graphs as well as with some probabilistic characteristics of graphs with randomly deleted edges. Section 3 contains some basic facts on the Laplacian polynomial of a graph. Section 4 describes various graph operation and their properties. In Section 5 we introduce some partial orders on G m n related with the graph Laplacian and the graph reliability (Laplacian posets and reliability posets). Section 6 contains some old and recent results on the-monotonicity of some graph operations with respect to Laplacian posets. Section 7 includes some old and recent results on the-monotonicity of some graph operations with respect to reliability posets and some open problems. In Section 8 we consider some other parameters of graphs and establish some results on-monotonicity of our graph operations with respect to the linear orders on G m n related with these parameters. The list of these parameters includes the numbers of Hamiltonian cycles or paths and the numbers of forests of special type.

A VULS is a subgraph defined by a set of edge labels that has a unique vertex labelling associated with it. A minimal VULS is then a VULS which is not a supergraph of any other VULS. The application considered in this paper, for evaluation purposes, is error prediction with respect to sheet metal forming. The minimum BFS Right-most Extension Unique Subgraph Mining (Min-BFS-REUSM) algorithm is introduced for identifying minimal VULS using a Breadth First Search(BFS) strategy.	algorithm;maxima and minima	Wen Yu;Frans Coenen;Michele Zito;Subhieh El-Salhi	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40131-2_28	computer science;vertex;data mining;subgraph isomorphism problem;induced subgraph isomorphism problem	DB	24.845067391101274	27.88551975552569	62819
2d0c79aea0f9a702c20d50b03dd9718066ca61f3	universal slope sets for 1-bend planar drawings		We prove that every set of $$\varDelta -1$$ Δ - 1 slopes is 1-bend universal for the planar graphs with maximum vertex degree $$\varDelta $$ Δ . This means that any planar graph with maximum degree $$\varDelta $$ Δ admits a planar drawing with at most one bend per edge and such that the slopes of the segments forming the edges can be chosen in any given set of $$\varDelta -1$$ Δ - 1 slopes. Our result improves over previous literature in three ways: Firstly, it improves the known upper bound of $$\frac{3}{2} (\varDelta -1)$$ 3 2 ( Δ - 1 ) on the 1-bend planar slope number; secondly, the previously known algorithms compute 1-bend planar drawings by using sets of $$O(\varDelta )$$ O ( Δ ) slopes that may vary depending on the input graph; thirdly, while these algorithms typically minimize the slopes at the expenses of constructing drawings with poor angular resolution, we can compute drawings whose angular resolution is at least $$\frac{\pi }{\varDelta -1}$$ π Δ - 1 , which is worst-case optimal up to a factor of $$\frac{3}{4}$$ 3 4 . Our proofs are constructive and give rise to a linear-time drawing algorithm.	algorithm;angularjs;bend minimization;computation;computational geometry;embedded system;fabian pascal;graph coloring;planar graph;polynomial;slope number;upward planar drawing	Patrizio Angelini;Michael A.

In ZarrabiZadeh and Chan (Proceedings of the 18th Canadian conference on computational geometry (CCCG’06), pp 139–142, 2006) proposed an algorithm to compute an approximate spanning ball in the streaming model of computation, and showed that the radius of the approximate ball is within 3/2 of the minimum. Spurred by this, in this paper we consider the 2-dimensional extension of this result: computation of spanning ellipses. The ball algorithm is simple to the point of being trivial, but the extension of the algorithm to ellipses is non-trivial. Surprisingly, the area of the approximate ellipse computed by this approach is not within a constant factor of the minimum and we provide an elegant proof of this. We have implemented this algorithm, and experiments with a variety of inputs, except for a very pathological one, show that it can nevertheless serve as a good heuristic for computing an approximate ellipse.	approximation algorithm;computational geometry;experiment;file spanning;heuristic;model of computation	Asish Mukhopadhyay;Eugene Greene;Animesh Sarker;Tom Switzer	2013	J.

(So, in particular, there are constants \(s,c>0\) such that any four points are co-circular at most \(s\) times, and any three points are collinear at most \(c\) times.) One of the hardest open problems in combinatorial and computational geometry is to obtain a nearly quadratic upper bound, or at least a sub-cubic bound, on the maximum number of discrete changes that the Delaunay triangulation \({\mathrm{DT}}(P)\) of \(P\) experiences during the motion of the points of \(P\). In this paper, we obtain an upper bound of \(O(n^{2+{\varepsilon }})\), for any \({\varepsilon }>0\), under the assumptions that (i) any four points can be co-circular at most twice and (ii) either no triple of points can be collinear more than twice or no ordered triple of points can be collinear more than once.	delaunay triangulation	Natan Rubin	2013	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-013-9512-2	combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry	Theory	31.609275688220826	20.719121266878457	63452

Call two vertices of G similar if they have the same adjacency to any other vertex and denote the maximum number of pairwise similar vertices in G by (G). We prove that (G) + 1 D(G) max{ (G) + 2, (n + 5)/2}, where n denotes the number of vertices of G. In particular, D(G) (n+5)/2 for every G with no transposition in the automorphism group. If G is connected and has maximum degree d, we prove that D(G) cd n + O(d2) for a constant cd < 1 2 . A linear lower bound for graphs of maximum degree 3 with no transposition in the automorphism group follows from an earlier result by Cai, Fürer, and Immerman [An optimal lower bound on the number of variables for graph identification, Combinatorica 12(4) (1992) 389–410]. Our upper bounds for D(G) hold true even if we allow only definitions with at most one alternation in any sequence of nested quantifiers. In passing we establish an upper bound for a related number D(G, G′), the minimum quantifier depth of a first order sentence which is true on exactly one of graphs G and G′. If G and G′ are non-isomorphic and both have n vertices, then D(G, G′) (n+3)/2. This bound is tight up to an additive constant of 1. If we additionally require that a sentence distinguishing G and G′ is existential, we prove only a slightly weaker bound D(G, G′) (n + 5)/2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Terminology and introduction We denote the vertex set and the arc set of a digraph D by V (D) and E(D), respectively. A subdigraph induced by a subset A⊆V (D) is denoted by D[A]. In addition, D − A= D[V (D)− A]. If xy is an arc of a digraph D, then we say that x dominates y and write x → y. We also say that xy is an out-arc of x or xy is an in-arc of y. More generally, if A and B are two disjoint subdigraphs of D such that every vertex of A dominates every vertex of B, then we say that A dominates B and write A→ B. Let x be a vertex of D. The number of out-arcs of x is called the out-degree of x and denoted by dD(x), or simply d +(x). Note that a tournament Tn is regular if and only if all vertices of Tn have the same out-degree. We consider only the directed paths and cycles. A digraph D is strong if for every pair of vertices x and y; D contains a path from x to y and a path from y to x, and ( This work was supported by NSFC under no. 19471037. ∗ Corresponding author. fax: +49 241 8888 390.

An arc of a digraph on n¿3 vertices is said to be pancyclic if it is contained in a k-cycle for all k satisfying 36k6n. In [4], Thomassen proved that every strong tournament contains a vertex x such that each out-arc of x is contained in a Hamiltonian cycle and this extends the result of Goldberg and Moon [2] that every s-strong tournament has at least s distinct Hamiltonian cycles (a digraph D is s-strong if for any set F ⊂E(D) of at most s− 1 arcs, D − F is strong). In this paper we extend the result of Thomassen and prove that every strong tournament contains a vertex x such that all out-arcs of x are pancyclic, and our proof yields a polynomial algorithm to nd such a vertex. In addition, as another consequence of our main theorem, we get a result of Alspach [1] that states that every arc of a regular tournament is pancyclic.	algorithm;carsten thomassen;directed graph;emoticon;fax;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path;personally identifiable information;polynomial;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory);yao graph	Tianxing Yao;Yubao Guo;Kemin Zhang	2000	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/S0166-218X(99)00136-5	hamiltonian path;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;topology;graph theory;cycle graph;mathematics;tournament	Theory	29.922908430718188	30.843504416852845	63767

A labelling, f : V (G) → {1, 2, . . . , r}, is said to be rdistinguishing if no nontrivial geometric automorphism preserves the labels. The distinguishing number of G is the minimum r such that G has an r-distinguishing labelling. We show that when Kn is not the nonconvex K4, it can be 3-distinguished. Furthermore when n ≥ 6, there is a Kn that can be 1-distinguished. For n ≥ 4, K2,n can realize any distinguishing number between 1 and n inclusive.

00accb0f1cba55b0e4784923f9efae46075fa71e	on combinatorial depth measures		Given a set P = {p1, . . . , pn} of points and a point q in the plane, we define a function ψ(q) that provides a combinatorial characterization of the multiset of values {|P ∩Hi|}, where for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, Hi is the open half-plane determined by q and pi. We introduce two new natural measures of depth, perihedral depth and eutomic depth, and we show how to express these and the well-known simplicial and Tukey depths concisely in terms of ψ(q). The perihedral and eutomic depths of q with respect to P correspond respectively to the number of subsets of P whose convex hull contains q, and the number of combinatorially distinct bisections of P determined by a line through q. We present algorithms to compute the depth of an arbitrary query point in O(n log n) time and medians (deepest points) with respect to these depth measures in O(n) and O(n) time respectively. For comparison, these results match or slightly improve on the corresponding best-known running times for simplicial depth, whose definition involves similar combinatorial complexity.	algorithm;convex hull;whole earth 'lectronic link	Stephane Durocher;Robert Fraser;Alexandre Leblanc;Jason Morrison;Matthew Skala	2014			combinatorics;pi;convex hull;multiset;time complexity;computer science;median	Theory	29.44868970806443	20.69286675387654	64369

Such an embbeding is <i>linkless</i> if every pair of disjoint cycles forms a trivial link (in the sense of knot theory). Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [47] showed that a graph has a linkless embedding in ℜ<sup>3</sup> if, and only if, it does not contain as a minor any of seven graphs in Petersen's family (graphs obtained from <i>K</i><sub>6</sub> by a series of YΔ and ΔY operations). They also showed that a graph is linklessly embeddable in ℜ<sup>3</sup> if, and only if, it admits a flat embedding into ℜ<sup>3</sup>, i.e. an embedding such that for every cycle <i>C</i> of <i>G</i> there exists a closed 2-disk <i>D</i> ⊆ ℜ<sup>3</sup> with <i>D</i> ∩ <i>G</i> = ∂<i>D</i> = <i>C</i>. Clearly, every flat embeddings is linkless, but the converse is not true. We first consider the following algorithmic problem associated with embeddings in ℜ<sup>3</sup>:  <b>Flat Embedding:</b> For a given graph <i>G</i>, either detect one of Petersen's family graphs as a minor in <i>G</i> or return a flat (and hence linkless) embedding in ℜ<sup>3</sup>. The first outcome is a certificate that <i>G</i> has no linkless and no flat embeddings. Our first main result is to give an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) algorithm for this problem. While there is a known polynomial-time algorithm for constructing linkless embeddings [20], this is the first polynomial time algorithm for constructing flat embeddings in 3-space and we thereby settle a problem proposed by Lovasz [29]. We also consider the following classical problem in topology.  <b>The Unknot Problem:</b> Decide if a given knot is trivial or not. This is a fundamental problem in knot theory and low dimensional topology, whose time complexity is unresolved. It has been extensively studied by researchers working in computational geometry. A related problem is:  <b>The Link Problem:</b> Decide if two given knots form a link. Hass, Lagarias and Pippenger [16] observed that a polynomial time algorithm for the link problem yields a polynomial time algorithm for the unknot problem. We relate the link problem to the following problem that was proposed independently by Lovasz and by Robertson et al.  <b>Conjecture.</b> (Lovasz [29]; Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [48]) <i>There is a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether a given embedding of a graph in the 3-space is linkless.</i> Affirming this conjecture would clearly yield a polynomial-time solution for the link problem. We prove that the converse is also true by providing a polynomial-time solution for the above conjecture, if we are given a polynomial time oracle for the link problem.	computation;computational geometry;jeffrey lagarias;julius petersen;linkless embedding;piecewise linear continuation;polynomial;time complexity;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi;Stephan Kreutzer;Bojan Mohar	2010		10.1145/1810959.1810975	time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;computational geometry;linkless embedding;knot;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Theory	27.457112892872008	21.932487098776285	64390

In addition there is a correspondence between the eccentricity (max distance) of a vertex and the highest legal color for that vertex. In this note we investigate eccentric coloring of trees. We give the eccentric chromatic number or a bound on the eccentric chromatic number for several simple classes of trees. In particular we show the eccentric chromatic number for paths (χe = 3), spiders (χe = 3) and caterpillars (χe ≤ 7). Further, we discuss the eccentric chromatic number of complete k-ary trees and show that the complete binary trees have eccentric chromatic number χe ≤ 7. We also show that large binary trees are eccentrically colorable and have χe ≤ 7. We then conclude by showing that no complete k-ary tree, k ≥ 3, is eccentrically colorable.	binary tree;color;distance (graph theory);graph coloring;k-ary tree	Christian Sloper	2004	Australasian J.

7a1ed2b4950c55f083adfea25404bc9b5ecd6206	approximate inference using planar graph decomposition	graphical model;tree decomposition;planar graph;partition function;upper bound;tree structure	A number of exact and approximate methods are available for inference calculations in graphical models. Many recent approximate methods for graphs with cycles are based on tractable algorithms for tree structured graphs. Here we base the approximation on a different tractable model, planar graphs with binary variables and pure interaction potentials (no external field). The partition function for such models can be calculated exactly using an algorithm introduced by Fisher and Kasteleyn in the 1960s. We show how such tractable planar models can be used in a decomposition to derive upper bounds on the partition function of non-planar models. The resulting algorithm also allows for the estimation of marginals. We compare our planar decomposition to the tree decomposition method of Wainwright et. al., showing that it results in a much tighter bound on the partition function, improved pairwise marginals, and comparable singleton marginals. Graphical models are a powerful tool for modeling multivariate distributions, and have been successfully applied in various fields such as coding theory and image processing. Applications of graphical models typically involve calculating two types of quantities, namely marginal distributions, and MAP assignments. The evaluation of the model partition function is closely related to calculating marginals [12]. These three problems can rarely be solved exactly in polynomial time, and are provably computationally hard in the general case [1]. When the model conforms to a tree structure, however, all these problems can be solved in polynomial time. This has prompted extensive research into tree based methods. For example, the junction tree method [6] converts a graphical model into a tree by clustering nodes into cliques, such that the graph over cliques is a tree. The resulting maximal clique size (cf. tree width) may nevertheless be prohibitively large. Wainwright et. al. [9, 11] proposed an approximate method based on trees known as tree reweighting (TRW). The TRW approach decomposes the potential vector of a graphical model into a mixture over spanning trees of the model, and then uses convexity arguments to bound various quantities, such as the partition function. One key advantage of this approach is that it provides bounds on partition function value, a property which is not shared by approximations based on Bethe free energies [13]. In this paper we focus on a different class of tractable models: planar graphs. A graph is called planar if it can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges. Works in the 1960s by physicists Fisher [5] and Kasteleyn [7], among others, have shown that the partition function for planar graphs may be calculated in polynomial time. This, however, is true under two key restrictions. One is that the variables xi are binary. The other is that the interaction potential depends only on xixj (where xi ∈ {±1}), and not on their individual values (i.e., the zero external field case). Here we show how the above method can be used to obtain upper bounds on the partition function for non-planar graphs. As in TRW, we decompose the potential of a non-planar graph into a sum over spanning planar models, and then use a convexity argument to obtain an upper bound on the log partition function. The bound optimization is a convex problem, and can be solved in polynomial time. We compare our method with TRW on a planar graph with an external field, and show that it performs favorably with respect to both pairwise marginals and the bound on the partition function, and the two methods give similar results for singleton marginals. 1 Definitions and Notations Given a graph G with n vertices and a set of edges E, we are interested in pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRF) over the graph G. A pairwise MRF [13] is a multivariate distribution over variables x = {x1, . . . , xn} defined as p(x) = 1 Z e P ij∈E fij(xi,xj) (1) where fij are a set of |E| functions, or interaction potentials, defined over pairs of variables. The partition function is defined as Z = ∑ x e P ij∈E ijij. Here we will focus on the case where xi ∈ {±1}. Furthermore, we will be interested in interaction potentials which only depend on agreement or disagreement between the signs of their variables. We define those by f(xi, xj) = 1 2 θij(1 + xixj) = θijI(xi = xj) (2) so that fij(xi, xj) is zero if xi 6= xj and θij if xi = xj . The model is then defined via the set of parameters θij . We use θ to denote the vector of parameters θij , and denote the partition function by Z(θ) to highlight its dependence on these parameters. A graph G is defined as planar if it can be drawn in the plane without any intersection of edges [4]. With some abuse of notation, we define E as the set of line segments in < corresponding to the edges in the graph. The regions of < \ E are defined as the faces of the graph. The face which corresponds to an unbounded region is called the external face. Given a planar graph G, its dual graph G∗ is defined in the following way: the vertices of G∗ correspond to faces of G, and there is an edge between two vertices in G∗ iff the two corresponding faces in G share an edge. If the graph G is weighted, the weight on an edge in G∗ is the weight on the edge shared by the corresponding faces in G. A plane triangulation of a planar graph G is obtained from G by adding edges such that all the faces of the resulting graph have exactly three vertices. Thus a plane triangulated graph has a dual where all vertices have degree three. It can be shown that every plane graph can be plane triangulated [4]. We shall also need the notion of a perfect matching on a graph. A perfect matching on a graph G is defined as a set of edges H ⊆ E such that every vertex in G has exactly one edge in H incident on it. If the graph is weighted, the weight of the matching is defined as the product of the weights of the edges in the matching. Finally, we recall the definition of a marginal polytope of a graph [12]. Consider an MRF over a graph G where fij are given by Equation 2. Denote the probability of the event I(xi = xj) under p(x) by τij . The marginal polytope of G, denoted by M(G), is defined as the set of values τij that can be obtained under some assignment to the parameters θij . For a general graph G the polytope M(G) cannot be described using a polynomial number of inequalities. However, for planar graphs, it turns out that a set of O(n) constraints, commonly referred to as triangle inequalities, suffice to describe M(G) (see [3] page 434). The triangle inequalities are defined by 1 TRI(n) = {τij : τij + τjk − τik ≤ 1, τij + τjk + τik ≥ 1,∀i, j, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}} (3) Note that the above inequalities actually contain variables τij which do not correspond to edges in the original graph G. Thus the equality M(G) = TRI(n) should be understood as referring only to the values of τij that correspond to edges in the graph. Importantly, the values of τij for edges not in the graph need not be valid marginals for any MRF. In other words M(G) is a projection of TRI(n) on the set of edges of G. It is well known that the marginal polytope for trees is described via pairwise constraints. It is thus interesting that for planar graphs, it is triplets, rather than pairwise The definition here is slightly different from that in [3], since here we refer to agreement probabilities, whereas [3] refers to disagreement probabilities. This polytope is also referred to as the cut polytope. constraints, that characterize the polytope. In this sense, planar graphs and trees may be viewed as a hierarchy of polytope complexity classes. It remains an interesting problem to characterize other structures in this hierarchy and their related inference algorithms. 2 Exact calculation of partition function using perfect matching The seminal works of Kasteleyn [7] and Fisher [5] have shown how one can calculate the partition function for a binary MRF over a planar graph with pure interaction potentials. We briefly review Fisher’s construction, which we will use in what follows. Our interpretation of the method differs somewhat from that of Fisher, but we believe it is more straightforward. The key idea in calculating the partition function is to convert the summation over values of x to the problem of calculating the sum of weights of all perfect matchings in a graph constructed from G, as shown below. In this section, we consider weighted graphs (graphs with numbers assigned to their edges). For the graph G associated with the pairwise MRF, we assign weights wij = eij to the edges. The first step in the construction is to plane triangulate the graph G. Let us call the resulting graph GT. We define an MRF on GT by assigning a parameter θij = 0 to the edges that have been added to G, and the corresponding weight wij = 1. Thus GT essentially describes the same distribution as G, and therefore has the same partition function. We can thus restrict our attention to calculating the partition function for the MRF on GT. As a first step in calculating a partition function over GT, we introduce the following definition: a set of edges Ê in GT is an agreement edge set (or AES) if for every triangle face F in GT one of the following holds: The edges in F are all in Ê, or exactly one of the edges in F is in Ê. The weight of a set Ê is defined as the product of the weights of the edges in Ê. It can be shown that there exists a bijection between pairs of assignments {x,−x} and agreement edge sets. The mapping from x to an edge set is simply the set of edges such that xi = xj . It is easy to see that this is an agreement edge set. The reverse mapping is obtained by finding an assignment x such that xi = xj iff the corresponding edge is in the agreement edge set. The existence of this mapping can be shown by induction on the number of (triangle) faces. The contribution of a given assignment x to the partition function is e P ij∈E θijI(xi=xj).

In this paper, we survey results on this subject. We classify the results into the following categories: vertex-partitions by monochromatic subgraphs, such as cycles, paths, trees; vertex partition by some kinds of heterochromatic subgraphs; the computational complexity of these partition problems; some kinds of large monochromatic and heterochromatic subgraphs. We have to point out that there are a lot of results of Ramsey type problem on monochromatic and heterochromatic subgraphs. However, it is not our purpose to include them in this survey because this is slightly different from our topics and also contains too large amount of results to deal with together. There are also some interesting results on vertex-colored graphs, but we do not contain them, either.	computational complexity theory;graph coloring;induced subgraph;monochrome	Mikio Kano;Xueliang Li	2008	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-008-0789-5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;edge coloring;mathematics;computational complexity theory	Theory	28.98562271290974	26.747536718020328	64631

Fredman has shown that the problem has a lower bound of $\Omega (N^{{2 / 3}} )$ for intermixed updates and retrievals. When the points are not restricted to integral coordinates, Edelsbrunner and Welzl have shown a retrieval time of $O(N^{ \approx 1.39} )$ (update time$ = O(N^2 \log N)$). One of the data structures presented here permits intermixed updates and retrievals in $O(N^{{2 / {\log N}}})$.We store multiple, rotated data structures to match against the query. Rotation appears to be an effective method for trading-off update time against retrieval time for geometric problems. We also present constructions for efficient retrieval of triangles and polygons.

In an attempt to provide theoretical guarantees for a class of greedy routing algorithms, Papadimitriou and Ratajczak [19] came up with the following conjecture:  Any 3-connected planar graph can be drawn in the plane such that for every pair of vertices <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> a <i>distance decreasing</i> path can be found. A path <i>s</i> = <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>,…,<i>v<sub>k</sub></i>=<i>t</i> in a drawing is said to be <i>distance decreasing</i> if ||<i>v<sub>i</sub></i> - <i>t</i>|| < ||<i>v<sub>i</sub></i>-1 -<i>t</i>||, 2 ≤ <i>i</i> ≤ <i>k</i> where || … || denotes the Euclidean distance.  We settle this conjecture in the affirmative for the case of triangulations.  A partitioning of the edges of a triangulation <i>G</i> into 3 trees, called the <i>realizer</i> of G, was first developed by Walter Schnyder who also gave a drawing algorithm based on this. We generalize Schnyder's algorithm to obtain a whole class of drawings of any given triangulation <i>G</i>. We show, using the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz Theorem, that some drawing of <i>G</i> belonging to this class is greedy.	connectivity (graph theory);euclidean distance;greedy algorithm;planar graph;routing;walter pitts	Raghavan Dhandapani	2008	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-009-9235-6	combinatorics;greedy algorithm;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;geometry;planar graph	Theory	27.916839941546762	21.69675932700399	65085

We measure the distance between these points in terms of the weighted shortest path distance, called the network distance. Within this metric space, we study farthest points and farthest distances. We introduce optimal data structures supporting queries for the farthest distance and the farthest points on trees, cycles, uni-cyclic networks, and cactus networks. Using only linear space and construction time, we support farthest-point queries in Θ(k) time for trees, in Θ(logn) time for cycles, and in Θ(k + logn) time for uni-cyclic networks and cactus networks, where n is the size of the network and k is the number of farthest-points.

This differs from the standard model in which a fixed number, m, of edges are added at each step. Let f(t) be the number of edges added at step t. In the standard scale-free model, f(t) = m constant, whereas in this paper we consider f(t) = [tc], c > 0. Such a graph process, in which the number of edges grows non-linearly with the number of vertices is said to have accelerating growth. We analyze both an undirected and a directed process. The power law of the degree sequence of these processes exhibits widely differing behaviour. For the undirected process, the terminal vertex of each edge is chosen by preferential attachment based on vertex degree. When f(t) = m constant, this is the standard scalefree model, and the power law of the degree sequence is 3. When f(t) = [tc], c < 1, the degree sequence of the process exhibits a power law with parameter x = (3− c)/(1− c). As c → 0, x → 3, which gives a value of x = 3, as in standard scale-free model. Thus no more slowly growing monotone function f(t) alters the power law of this model away from x = 3. When c = 1, so that f(t) = t, the expected degree of all vertices is t, the vertex degree is concentrated, and the degree sequence does not have a power law. For the directed process, the terminal vertex is chosen proportional to in-degree plus an additive constant, to allow the selection of vertices of in-degree zero. For this process when f(t) = m is constant, the power law of the degree sequence is x = 2 + 1/m. When f(t) = [tc], c > 0, the power law becomes x = 1 + 1/(1+ c), which naturally extends the power law to (1, 2]. ∗Department of Computer Science, King’s College, University of London, London WC2R 2LS, UK. e-mail: colin.cooper@kcl.ac.uk †Department of Mathematics, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506-6310, USA. e-mail: pralat@math.wvu.edu	attachments;computer science;degree (graph theory);directed graph;email;graph (discrete mathematics);madelung constant;mathematical model;random graph;utility functions on indivisible goods;vertex (geometry);monotone	Colin S Cooper;Pawel Pralat	2011	Random Struct.

Such a fknction is said to be a minus dominating function if the sum of its function values over any closed neighborhood is at least one. That is, for every t’ E V, ,f(N[r~])> 1, where N[a] consists of 1: and every vertex adjacent to u. The weight of a minus dominating function is f(V) = c ,f(tl), over all vertices u E V. The minus domination number of a graph G, denoted v-(G), equals the minimum weight of a minus dominating function of G. For every graph G, y(G) <y(G) where y(G) denotes the domination number of G. We show that if T is a tree of order n > 4, then y(T) y-(T) <(n 4)/S and this bound is sharp. We attempt to classify graphs according to their minus domination numbers. For each integer n we determine the smallest order of a connected graph with minus domination number equal to n. Properties of the minus domination number of a graph are presented and a number of open questions are raised. @ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The constant bound significantly improves upon the &THgr;(<i>n</i><sup><i>d</i>-1</sup>) bound for the balls of arbitrary radii. Intrigued by this large gap between the two bounds, we also investigate how the number of geometric permutations varies as a function of shape, size, and spacing of objects. Our results include a tight bound of 2<sup><i>d</i>-1</sup> on the geometric permutations of <i>n</i> disjoint rectangular boxes in <i>R<sup>d</sup></i>, and a constant bound on the geometric permutations for disks in the plane when the ratio between the largest to smallest disks is bounded. An important consequence of the former theorem is that if the smallest bounding boxes containing a set of geometric objects in <i>R<sup>d</sup></i> are pairwise disjoint, then those objects admit only 2<sup><i>d</i>-1</sup> permutations, which is a significant improvement on the <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2<i>d</i>-2</sup>) bound known for general convex objects.

A string puzzle consists of strings entangled with one or more wooden pieces. We consider the generalized string puzzle problem whose input is the layout of strings and a wooden board with holes embedded in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We present a polynomial-time transformation from an arbitrary instance f of the 3SAT problem to a string puzzle s such that f is satisfiable if and only if s is solvable.

Allan and Laskar [1] and Bollobás and Cockayne [2] proved independently that γ(G) < 2 ir(G) for any graph G. For a tree T , Damaschke [4] obtained the sharper estimation 2γ(T ) < 3 ir(T ). Extending Damaschke’s result, Volkmann [11] proved that 2γ(G) ≤ 3 ir(G) for any block graph G and for any graph G with cyclomatic number μ(G) ≤ 2. Volkmann [11] also conjectured that 5γ(G) < 8 ir(G) for any cactus graph. In this article we show that if G is a blockcactus graph having π(G) induced cycles of length 2 (mod4), then γ(G)(5π(G)+4) ≤ ir(G)(8π(G) + 6). This result implies the inequality 5γ(G) < 8 ir(G) for a blockcactus graph G, thus proving the above conjecture. J.

Our KDS computes the Delaunay triangulation of a size-optimal well-spaced superset of a set of moving points with algebraic trajectories of constant degree. Our KDS is compact, requiring linear space in the size of the output. It is local, using a point in O(log Delta) certificates. It is responsive, repairing itself in O(log Delta) time per event. It is efficient, processing O(n2 log3 Delta) events in the worst case; this is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. Also, our KDS is dynamic, responding to point insertions and deletions in O(log Delta) time. In our bounds Delta stands for the geometric spread, the ratio of the diameter to the closest pair distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first KDS for mesh refinement.	adaptive mesh refinement;best, worst and average case;closest pair of points problem;computation;delaunay triangulation;information;kinetic data structure;mesh networking;point cloud;polylogarithmic function;public key certificate;refinement (computing);subdivision surface	Umut A.

A Steiner triple system that colors every simple cubic graph is said to be universal. It is known that every nontrivial point-transitive Steiner triple system that is neither projective nor affine is universal. In this article, we present the following results. (1) We give a sufficient condition for a Steiner triple system S to be universal.

The structure of brother trees that are optimal with respect to each of these cost measures is already known, as well as how to construct them in linear time. In this paper we investigate sharp bounds for the range that the node visit cost may take for a given size of tree. To this end we determine the structure of those brother trees which, for a given size  N , have maximal (or pessimal) node visit cost. We derive a tight upper bound for the node visit cost of brother search trees which together with the lower bound obtained earlier yields the desired range estimation. Furthermore, we show that at least 11.6% of the internal nodes of a brother tree of maximal height are unary.		Rolf Klein;Derick Wood	1987	Inf.

In many categories of board games repeating path-patterns are commonly used. In this context, we propose the notion of structured tiles as a systematic way to capture and such express recurring path-patterns. They constitute reusable building blocks of a far larger-scale compared to primitive tiles, embodying both geometric (for terrain formation) and path structure (for game play) information. Technically, structured tiles are subgraphs whose vertices are polygonal areas of a respective tile image. Through structured tiles, terrain composition is essentially graph assembling enabling to perform semantic checking like node connectivity and reachability, or other tests concerning graphs. Finally, common mechanics like plausible path computation, path selection by players, and in-path movement control are standardized and incorporated in the game engine. We discuss the notion of repeating path-patterns and introduce structured tiles, then elaborate on terrain composition and game mechanics.	computation;game engine;game mechanics;reachability	Yannis Lilis;Anthony Savidis	2009		10.1145/1690388.1690462	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;simulation;mathematics	AI	36.128949394767105	18.836776760332484	66481

Under the former condition which we call the weak precondition, we investigate the question whether a polynomial time algorithm for reconstruction exists. As a first step, we provide an algorithm which outputs an approximation of the shape with the correct Betti numbers under a slightly stronger condition than the weak precondition. Unfortunately, even though our algorithm terminates, its time complexity is unbounded. We then identify at the heart of our algorithm a test which requires answering the following question: given 2 two-dimensional simplicial complexes \(L \subset K\), does there exist a simplicial complex containing \(L\) and contained in \(K\) which realizes the persistent homology of \(L\) into \(K\)? We call this problem the homological simplification of the pair \((K,L)\) and prove that this problem is NP-complete, using a reduction from 3SAT.

Less sensitive than the multiplicative metric distortion, the average distortion captures well the global picture and, overall, is a quite interesting new measure of metric proximity, related to the concentration of measure phenomenon. The paper mostly deals with embeddings into the real line with a low (as much as it is possible) average distortion. Our main technical contribution is that the shortest-path metrics of special (e.g., planar, bounded treewidth, etc.) undirected weighted graphs can be embedded into the line with constant average distortion. This has implications, e.g., on the value of the MinCut– MaxFlow gap in uniform-demand multicommodity flows on such graphs.	distortion;embedded system;graph (discrete mathematics);max-flow min-cut theorem;maximum flow problem;shortest path problem;treewidth	Yuri Rabinovich	2008	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-007-9047-5	convex metric space;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;injective metric space;topology;metric;multi-commodity flow problem;metric space;intrinsic metric;concentration of measure;mathematics;equivalence of metrics;shortest path problem	Theory	26.888053913380052	21.42817258212586	66793

(Observe that if 4 G ’ ) d IZ 6 then an S.C. permutation of G’ exists.) Lemma 2. If for x, y , z , f E V(G) Property (P) holds. then there is an S.C. permutation of G. Proof of Lemma 2 . We use Lemma 1 to show that for (T‘ = u(G’), (T = u’o(x ,y , t ,z ) is an S.C. permutation of G. Indeed, if d(.v,G’) = d(t,G’) = 0, then (~(xy) = m3(zr) = yt @ E ( G ) , a(zf) = a 3 ( x y ) = .rz @ E(G) , ( ~ ( y z ) = cr3(yz) = x t 6 E(G) , and for every E v(G’), ~ ( y i r ) = ta’(u) 6 E(G), a3(yrr) =X U ’ ~ ( L I ) @ E(G) , ( T ( Z I d ) = xa’ (u> @ E(G), (T3(zu) = ta”(u) 4 E(G). The argument is similar if d(y,G‘) = d(z,G‘) = 0. In particular, the components of G which are cycles will be assumed to have 3 or 4 vertices and we shall assume that there is at most one isolated vertex in G. Suppose first that G is connected. For P ( G ) = n 1, G is a tree, and since G # K , , , , ,, there are two endvertices p and 4 joined by a path ( p , x l , .... xk, 4) k 3 2 . So, either G’ { p , q , x , , . r k } admits an S.C. permutation and hence Property (P) holds for p , x , , x k , q or C’ = K, . , , -5 and Property (P) holds for PJ,, the vertex y of G‘ of maximum degree in G’ and an endneighbor of y. So assume G is not connected, and let TI , ..., T,, (LY 2 1) be the treecomponents of G , and H I , ..., Hfi ( p 2 1) the other components. I 338 JOURNAL OF GRAPH THEORY Case 1. G contains an isolated edge ah. Then every vertex of degree at least 3 [resp. at least 21 is joined to every vertex of degree at least I (except u,h) [resp. at least 21, otherwise G has Property (P) and Lemma 2 applies. Since n 3 8, there is a vertex .Y of degree at least 3 . Then d(.y,G) = n 3 k , where k is the number of isolated vertices ( k s 1 ) . G has Property (P) for the vertices a.b,x and every vertex t # n,b of degree at most 1 . Thus, in the following cases, we can assume that the number of vertices in 7; is different from 2 , for i = 1 , ..., a. Case 2. G contains an isolated vertex a . We consider the following subcases: Suhcase 2.1. d(.u,G) s 2 for every .r E V(G). Then a = 1 and H I = C, or C, for i = 1, ..., p. Subcase 2.I.a. n = 8 or n = 9, then G contains a cycle C = (xl, ..., x4.x,). Let yI, y z . y3 be three consecutive vertices of the second cycle C ‘ . Then u(G) = ~ o ( ~ ~ , x , , y , , y ~ ) o ( x ~ , x , , y , , ~ ~ ) , where % = P, and y , = a if n = 8 and %‘ = (a ) and y4 is the fourth vertex of C‘ if n = 9. Subcase 2.1.b.

This paper reduces SATISFIABILITY to the problem of recognizing unit disk graphs. Equivalently, it shows that determining if a graph has sphericity 2 or less, even if the graph is planar or is known to have sphericity at most 3, is NP-hard. We show how this reduction can be extended to 3 dimensions, thereby showing that unit sphere graph recognition, or determining if a graph has sphericity 3 or less, is also NP-hard. We conjecture that K-sphericity is NP-hard for all xed K greater than 1.	np-hardness;spherical earth;unit disk graph	Heinz Breu;David G. Kirkpatrick	1998	Comput.

In this game the two players, Alice and Bob, alternate in choosing vertices on a directed graph and no player is allowed to select a vertex previously selected. At each round Alice selects a vertex u and Bob has to reply choosing a new vertex in the out-neighborhood of u. The first player who cannot move loses. We prove that deciding whether Bob can endure k rounds when k is part of the input is a PSPACE-complete problem. Moreover we prove that the parameterized version of the problem is AW[*]-complete.

First we show that for a fixed  k , the exponential generating function  M   k  ( x ) of the number of maximal elements in this poset is    M     k   (x)=  e     x   −1  (1+k)−ke     x    , and then from this, it follows immediately, using species, that the number of elements in this poset which have a given dimension  d  is the coefficient of  t   d   x   n  / n ! in  N   k  ( x ,  t ) =  e   tM   k  ( x ) .  After we do this, we use the fact that  M   k +1 ( x ) can be expressed in terms of  M   k  ( x ) for each  k  to show that this implies that there is a bijection between the set of maximal elements of  Π   n ,  k +1  and a certain other set.

The H -colouring problem is a generalization of the standard c-colouring problem, whose restriction to bounded degree graphs remains NP-complete, as long as c is smaller than the degree bound (otherwise we can use the theorem of Brooks to obtain a polynomial time algorithm). For H -colouring of bounded degree graphs, while it is also the case that most problems are NP-complete, we point out that, surprisingly, there exist polynomial algorithms for several of these restricted colouring problems. Our main objective is to propose a conjecture about the complexity of certain cases of the problem. The conjecture states that for graphs of chromatic number three, all situations which are not solvable by the colouring algorithm inherent in the theorem of Brooks are NP-complete. We motivate the conjecture by proving several supporting results. c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this manner, the term “uniquely embeddable planar graph” was introduced. It is a well-known fact that combinatorial and geometrical duals are equivalent concepts. In this paper, the concept of unique embeddability is introduced in terms of special types of isomorphisms between any two smbeddings of a planar graph. From this, +he class U of all graphs which are uniquely embeddable in the plane according to this definition, is determined, and [he planar 3-connected graphs are a proper subset of U. It turns out that the graphs in U have a unique geometrical dual (i.e., for any two embeddings of such a graph, their geometrical duals are isomorphic). Furthermore, the theorems and their proofs do not involve any type of duals.	planar graph	Herbert Fleischner	1973	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(73)90169-6	1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;apollonian network;pathwidth;topological graph theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;polyhedral graph;universal graph;dual graph;topology;forbidden graph characterization;nowhere-zero flow;graph coloring;planar straight-line graph;symmetric graph;mathematics;butterfly graph;graph minor;book embedding;line graph;planar graph	Theory	33.582392567156845	26.664519258635277	67907

We investigate here homomorphisms from orienta-tions of undirected planar graphs to graphs (not necessarily planar) containing as few digons as possible. We relate the existence of such homomorphisms to girth and it appears that these questions remain interesting even under large girth assumption in the range where the chromatic number is an easy invariant. In particular we prove that every orientation of any large girth planar graph is 5-colorable and classify those digraphs on 3, 4 and 5 vertices which color all large girth oriented planar graphs.	girth (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;planar graph	Jaroslav Nesetril;André Raspaud;Éric Sopena	1997	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(96)00198-7	gallai–hasse–roy–vitaver theorem;graph power;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;triangle-free graph;topology;mathematics;odd graph;graph homomorphism;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding;planar graph	Theory	30.610343972487865	26.499225356453227	68025

Even though the closely related problem of finding a minimum cycle cover is polynomially solvable by matching techniques, we prove how the topological structure of a polygon leads to NP-hardness of the MPP. On the positive side, we show how to achieve a constant-factor approximation. When trying to solve MPP instances to provable optimality by means of integer programming, an additional difficulty compared to the TSP is the fact that only a subset of subtour constraints is valid, depending not on combinatorics, but on geometry. We overcome this difficulty by establishing and exploiting additional geometric properties. This allows us to reliably solve a wide range of benchmark instances with up to 600 vertices within reasonable time on a standard machine. We also show that using a natural geometry-based sparsification yields results that are on average within 0.5% of the optimum.	approximation;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;computational geometry;decision problem;delaunay triangulation;goodyear mpp;heuristic (computer science);ibm notes;integer programming;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;linear programming relaxation;matching (graph theory);np-hardness;ptas reduction;perimeter;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme;provable security;time complexity;travelling salesman problem;vertex (geometry);vertex cycle cover	Sándor P.

The graphs on which this Plurality Strategy always finds the set of all medians are precisely those for which the set of medians induces always a connected subgraph.

We shall in particular be interested in finding a smallest subset R for which the required maximum matchings do exist. A subset R will be P − feasible for G if for every pi in P there is a maximum matching Mi in G with |Mi∩R| = pi. Notice that for some P there may be no P-feasible set R (take P = {0, 1, 2} in G = K2,2).	feasible region;graph (discrete mathematics);matching (graph theory)	Marie-Christine Costa;Dominique de Werra;Christophe Picouleau;Bernard Ries	2005	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2005.06.033	strong perfect graph theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;multiple edges;bipartite graph;dense graph;hopcroft–karp algorithm;trivially perfect graph;mathematics;blossom algorithm;tutte theorem;matching	Theory	27.786488659219906	26.309324670781876	68625

A graph G is acyclically L-list colorable if for a given list assignment L={L(v)|v∈V}, there exists a proper acyclic coloring of G such that (v)∈L(v) for all v∈V. If G is acyclically L-list colorable for any list assignment with |L(v)|≥k for all v∈V, then G is acyclically k-choosable.

In this paper, we generalize this notion by considering r(S) = |{(x, y) ∈ S2 : x + y ∈ S}|, and analyze its behaviour as S ranges over the subsets of [1, N ]. We obtain a comprehensive description of the spectrum of attainable r-values, constructive existence results and structural characterizations for sets attaining extremal and near-extremal values.

Goddard et al. [9] found an upper bound for the packing chromatic number of hypercubes Qn. Moreover, they compute χρ(Qn) for n ≤ 5 leaving as an open problem the remaining cases. In this paper, we obtain a better upper bound for χρ(Qn) and we improve the lower bounds for χρ(Qn) for 6 ≤ n ≤ 11. In particular we compute the exact value of χρ(Qn) for 6 ≤ n ≤ 8.	graph coloring;set packing;vertex (geometry)	Pablo Torres;Mario Valencia-Pabon	2015	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2015.04.006	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;upper and lower bounds	Theory	29.929324350222828	26.623387506048395	69012

Computable points have dimension 0, random points have dimension n, and every real number in [0,n] is the dimension of uncountably many points. If X is a reasonably simple subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space (a union of computably closed sets), then the classical Hausdorff dimension of X is just the supremum of the dimensions of the points in X. In this talk I will discuss the meaning of these developments, their implications for both the theory of computing and fractal geometry, and directions for future research.	computability;fractal	Jack H.

In Potential Method, inconsistency is measured by an angle between the preference flow and the column space of the incidence matrix. In this article, a random study is performed to determine the upper bound for admissible inconsistency. The degree distribution is recognized as a Gumbel distribution and the upper bound for admissible inconsistency measure is defined as a p-quantile (p = 0.05) of that distribution.	admissible heuristic;analytical hierarchy;cladogram;degree distribution;incidence matrix;potential method;vertex-transitive graph	Lavoslav Caklovic	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34620-0_11	randomization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	Theory	30.225767463187466	25.719025750634025	69353

These natural computations are essentially determined by the topology and geometry of the brain's architectures. We present a framework to construct a 3D model of a cortical network using probabilistic roadmap methods. Although not the usual motion planning problem, our objective of building a network that encodes the pathways of the cortical network is analogous to the PRM objective of constructing roadmaps that contain a representative sample of feasible paths. We represent the network as a large-scale directed graph, and use L-systems and statistics data to `grow' neurons that are morphologically indistinguishable from real neurons. We detect connections (synapses) between neurons using geometric proximity tests.

A rook at square (i, j) can dominate the squares in row i and in column j . The rook problem of an STC is to determine the minimum number of rooks that can dominate all squares of the STC. In this paper, we model an STC by two particular graphs: a rook graph and a board graph. We show that for an STC, the rook graph is the line graph of the board graph, and the board graph is a bipartite permutation graph. Thus, the rook problem on STCs can be solved by any algorithm for solving the edge domination problem on bipartite permutation graphs. c © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For approximation, each instance of the object is polygonized along the motion, where the object may experience dynamic shape transformation with topological changes such as creating and /or destroying internal holes. The incremental nature of the proposed algorithm makes the boundary construction of a general sweep useful for applications in interactive shape design, collision detection, and mechanical part design. Our algorithm generates a precise approximation of the boundary of a general sweep with real-time performance in computing unsweeps, Minkowski sums and differences, and constant radius offsets. Some experimental results are also given in this paper.	approximation algorithm;boolean algebra;collision detection;computation;polyhedron;real-time clock;real-time locating system;set theory;sweep line algorithm	Joo-Haeng Lee;Sung Je Hong;Myung-Soo Kim	2000	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s003710050209	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;circuit minimization for boolean functions;discrete mathematics;boolean operations on polygons;sweep line algorithm;computer science;mathematics	Robotics	32.39674667732302	18.616457986645898	70481

This result cannot be extended to tree linkages: we show that there are trees with two simple configurations that are not connected by a motion that preserves simplicity throughout the motion. Indeed, we prove that an N-link tree can have 2 equivalence classes of configurations.	convex function;turing completeness	Therese C. Biedl;Erik D. Demaine;Martin L.

This leads to a combinatorially defined parameter for all graphs, called the imbedding index. A generalization of the Heaword inequality is then proved for this parameter.		Jack E. Graver	1979	J.

But this is not necessarily true if one of A or B is bipartite, and until now there has been no characterization of such vertex-transitive direct products. We prove that if A and B are both bipartite, or both non-bipartite, then A ×B is vertex-transitive if and only if both A and B are vertex-transitive. Also, if A has an odd cycle and B is bipartite, then A × B is vertex-transitive if and only if both A ×K2 and B are vertex-transitive.

5f07cb3d9b9e5ebc5bc433625ad2b1a55dabdbaf	string-wrapped rotating disks		Let the centers of a finite number of disjoint, closed disks be pinned to the plane, but with each free to rotate about its center. Given an arrangement of such disks with each labeled + or −, we investigate the question of whether they can be all wrapped by a single loop of string so that, when the string is taut and circulates, it rotates by friction all the (+)-disks counterclockwise and all the (−)disks clockwise, without any string-rubbing conflicts. We show that although this is not always possible, natural disk-separation conditions guarantee a solution. This work suggests many open problems. Introduction Let A be a collection of n disjoint closed disks in the plane, each labeled + or −. We seek to wrap them all in one continuous loop of string so that, were one of the disks rotated by a motor, all the others would spin by friction with the string/belt in a direction consistent with the labeling: counterclockwise (ccw) for + and clockwise (cw) for −. See Figure 1. We call a wrapping proper if it satisfies these conditions:	floppy disk;graph coloring;wrapping (graphics)	Joseph O'Rourke	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-34191-5_6	classical mechanics;geometry;engineering drawing;physics	Theory	33.9729998598183	22.72795136830199	71037

For a graph G, we denote its vertex set by V (G) and its edge set by E(G). A graph labeling, as introduced in [8], is an assignment of integers to the vertices or edges, or both, subject to certain conditions. Over the years, a large variety of different types of graph labelings have been studied, see [2] for an extensive survey. For a graph H, we say that a graph G admits an H-covering if every edge of G belongs to at least one subgraph of G which is isomorphic to H. A graph G = (V,E) which admits an H-covering is called H-magic if there exists a bijection F : V ∪E → {1, 2, . . . , |V |+ |E|} and a constant c = c(F ), which we call the H-magic sum of F , such that	cube;graph (discrete mathematics);graph labeling;vertex (graph theory)	Rachel Wulan Nirmalasari Wijaya;Joseph F.

We study spanners for the set S with respect to the following weighted distance function: $$\mathbf{d}_{\omega}(p,q)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0&\mbox{ if $p=q$,}\\ \operatorname {w}(p)+\mathbf{d}(p,q)+ \operatorname {w}(q)&\mbox{ if $p\neq q$.}\end{array}\right.$$ We present a general method for turning spanners with respect to the d-metric into spanners with respect to the d ω -metric. For any given ε>0, we can apply our method to obtain (5+ε)-spanners with a linear number of edges for three cases: points in Euclidean space ℝ d , points in spaces of bounded doubling dimension, and points on the boundary of a convex body in ℝ d where d is the geodesic distance function. We also describe an alternative method that leads to (2+ε)-spanners for weighted point points in ℝ d and for points on the boundary of a convex body in ℝ d . The number of edges in these spanners is O(nlog n). This bound on the stretch factor is nearly optimal: in any finite metric space and for any ε>0, it is possible to assign weights to the elements such that any non-complete graph has stretch factor larger than 2−ε.	distance (graph theory);period-doubling bifurcation	Mohammad Ali Abam;Mark de Berg;Mohammad Farshi;Joachim Gudmundsson;Michiel H.

Erdős’ problems have helped to shape mathematical research, but there seems to be no comprehensive collection of his problems. Erdős on Graphs is an effort by Fan Chung and Ron Graham to collect some of his problems — those about graphs — which remain unsolved. (Full disclosure: I am a student working with both Chung and Graham, but I believe this review to be fair.) The problems are divided up into chapters by subject: Ramsey theory, extremal graph theory, coloring/packing/covering, random graphs, hypergraphs, and infinite graphs. For each chapter, the authors give relevant definitions, and then dive into the problems. Since the book is focused on open problems, proofs are rare. However, each problem is followed by whatever progress has been made2, by whom, and occasionally hints at the techniques used. Of course references are abundant. Since “Uncle Paul” liked to offer cash for solutions to his favorite problems, those awards are listed as well. The book ends with three personal stories about Erdős from his longtime friend Andy Vázsonyi. By my count, there are over 170 problems of Erdős discussed in the book, underlining his prowess in formulating them. In this review, I will discuss the chapters, and some individual problems, with the hope of conveying the breadth and depth of the problems asked.	cash;erdős number;extremal graph theory;graham scan;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;random graph;set packing	Andy Parrish	2011	SIGACT News	10.1145/2034575.2034578	computer science;combinatorics;graph	Theory	28.49680327623004	23.285719902535455	72218

Further, it is proved that a matrix over a distributive lattice can be decomposed into the sum of matrices over some of its special subchains.This generalizes and extends the decomposition theorems ofmatrices over finite distributive lattices, chain semirings, fuzzy semirings, and so forth. Finally, as some applications, we present a method to calculate the indices and periods of the matrices over a distributive lattice and characterize the structures of idempotent and nilpotent matrices over it. We translate the characterizations of idempotent and nilpotent matrices over a distributive lattice into the corresponding ones of the binary Boolean cases, which also generalize the corresponding structures of idempotent and nilpotent matrices over general Boolean algebras, chain semirings, fuzzy semirings, and so forth.	idempotence;the matrix	Yizhi Chen;Xianzhong Zhao	2014	J.

If α is a proper edge-coloring of a graph G and v ∈ V (G), then the spectrum of a vertex v, denoted by S (v, α), is the set of all colors appearing on edges incident to v. The deficiency of α at vertex v ∈ V (G), denoted by def(v, α), is the minimum number of integers which must be added to S (v, α) to form an interval, and the deficiency def (G,α) of a proper edge-coloring α of G is defined as the sum ∑ v∈V (G) def(v, α). The deficiency of a graph G, denoted by def(G), is defined as follows: def(G) = minα def (G,α), where minimum is taken over all possible proper edge-colorings of G. For a graph G, the smallest and the largest values of t for which it has a proper t-edge-coloring α with deficiency def(G,α) = def(G) are denoted by wdef (G) and Wdef (G), respectively. In this paper, we obtain some bounds on wdef (G) and Wdef (G). In particular, we show that for any l ∈ N, there exists a graph G such that def(G) > 0 and Wdef (G)−wdef (G) ≥ l. It is known that for the complete graph K2n+1, def(K2n+1) = n (n ∈ N). Recently, Borowiecka-Olszewska, Drgas-Burchardt and Ha luszczak posed the following conjecture on the deficiency of nearcomplete graphs: if n ∈ N, then def(K2n+1 − e) = n − 1. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture.	angular defect;color;edge coloring;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring	Petros A.

It computes a cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) of the plane, augmented with adjacency information. The adjacency information describes the curve's topology by a topologically equivalent planar graph. The numerical data in the CAD gives an embedding of the graph.  The algorithm is designed to provide the exact result for all inputs but to perform only few symbolic operations for the sake of efficiency. In particular, the roots of f(∝, y) at a critical x-coordinate .  The algorithm is implemented as C++ library AlciX in the EXACUS project.

The Orientable Strong Embedding Conjecture says that every 2-connected graph has a closed 2-cell embedding in some orientable surface. This implies both the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture and the Strong Embedding Conjecture. In this paper we prove that every 2-connected projective-planar cubic graph has a closed 2-cell embedding in some orientable surface. The three main ingredients of the proof are (1) a surgical method to convert nonorientable embeddings into orientable embeddings; (2) a reduction for 4-cycles for orientable closed 2-cell embeddings, or orientable cycle double covers, of cubic graphs; and (3) a structural result for projective-planar embeddings of cubic graphs. We deduce that every 2-edge-connected projective-planar graph (not necessarily cubic) has an orientable cycle double cover.	cubic function;cycle double cover;graph embedding;planar graph	Mark N.

Given a graph G = (V , E) and a positive integer t ≥ |E|, a function h̃ : V (G) → Zt is called a t-harmonious labeling of G if h̃ is injective for t ≥ |V | or surjective for t < |V |, and h̃(v) + h̃(w) 6= h̃(x) + h̃(y) for all distinct edges vw, xy ∈ E(G). Then the smallest possible t such that G has a t-harmonious labeling is named the harmonious order of G. We determine the harmonious order of some non-harmonious graphs, such as complete graphs Kn (n ≥ 5), complete bipartite graphs Km,n (m, n > 1), even cycles Cn, some powers of paths Pk n , disjoint unions of triangles nK3 (n even). We also present some general results concerning harmonious order of the Cartesian product of two given graphs or harmonious order of the disjoint union of copies of a given graph. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound for harmonious order of trees. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

230de536237d7d3cc85efed48d6673589105a505	on the maximum order of graphs embedded in surfaces	degree diameter problem;vertex separator;surface;graphs on surfaces	The maximum number of vertices in a graph of maximum degree ∆ ≥ 3 and fixed diameter k ≥ 2 is upper bounded by (1 + o(1))(∆ − 1). If we restrict our graphs to certain classes, better upper bounds are known. For instance, for the class of trees there is an upper bound of (2 + o(1))(∆ − 1)bk/2c for a fixed k. The main result of this paper is that graphs embedded in surfaces of bounded Euler genus g behave like trees, in the sense that, for large ∆, such graphs have orders bounded from above by { c(g + 1)(∆− 1)bk/2c if k is even c(g + 1)(∆− 1)bk/2c if k is odd, where c is an absolute constant. This result represents a qualitative improvement over all previous results, even for planar graphs of odd diameter k. With respect to lower bounds, we construct graphs of Euler genus g, odd diameter k, and order c( √ g+ 1)(∆− 1)bk/2c for some absolute constant c > 0. Our results answer in the negative a question of Miller and Širáň (2005).	embedded system;euler;genus (mathematics);planar graph	Eran Nevo;Guillermo Pineda-Villavicencio;David R. Wood	2016	J. Comb.

For a graph parameter @q, determine the minimum or maximum value of p for which there exists a k-regular graph on p points having a given value of @q. The minimization problem is solved here when @q is the achromatic number, denoted by @j. This result follows from the following main theorem. Let M(p, k) be the maximum value of @j(G) over all k-regular graphs G with p points, let {x} be the least integer of size at least x, and let @W(k)@?Z be given by @w(k) = {i(ik+1)+1:1== p}.

The Single-Vertex Origami Problem asks whether it is always possible to reconfigure the creased paper from any configuration compatible with the metric, to a flat position, in such a way that the paper is not torn, stretched and, for rigid origami, not bent anywhere except along the given creases.  Streinu and Whiteley showed how to reduce the single-vertex origami problem to the Carpenter's Rule Problem for spherical polygons. Using spherical expansive motions, they solved the cases of open < π and closed ≤ 2 π spherical polygons. Here, we solve the case of open polygons with total length between [π, 2π), which requires non-expansive motions. Our motion planning algorithm works in a finite number of discrete steps, for which we give precise bounds depending on both the number of links and the angle deficit.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;motion planning	Gaiane Panina;Ileana Streinu	2009		10.1145/1542362.1542416	topology;computational geometry;mathematics of paper folding;folding;mathematics;geometry;spherical geometry	Theory	31.87619631190579	21.34106214673295	73249

Here the records of the file are considered as the nodes of a weighted undirected graph. Each record pair is connected in the graph and the corresponding arc is weighted by the sum of field lengths of those fields which differ in the two records. The actual compression is made by constructing an MST of the graph and by storing it in an economic way to preserve the information of the file. The length of the MST is a useful measure in the estimation of the power of the compression. In the paper we study upper bounds of this length, especially in the case where the field lengths of the different fields may vary. The upper bounds are derived by analyzing the so-called Gray-code sequences of the records. These sequences may be considered as spanning paths of the graph and their lengths give upper bounds of the length of the MST. In the study we show how a short spanning path can be constructed in this way. The results are also experimentally tested.	file spanning	Jarmo Ernvall;Olli Nevalainen	1984	BIT		gray code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;minimum degree spanning tree;spanning tree;theoretical computer science;minimum spanning tree;connected dominating set;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;shortest-path tree	Theory	26.994533318566123	21.14146001173831	73263

The size of a region in a cartogram corresponds to a particular geographic variable [1]. Since the sizes of the regions are not their true sizes they generally cannot keep both their shape and their adjacencies. A good cartogram, however, preserves the recognizability in some way. Globally speaking, there are three types of cartogram. The standard type (the contiguous area cartogram) has deformed regions so that the desired sizes can be obtained and the adjacencies kept. Algorithms for such cartograms are described in [2, 3, 6, 9]. The second type of cartogram is the non-contiguous area cartogram [7]. The regions have the true shape, but are scaled down and generally do not touch anymore. The third type of cartogram is the rectangular cartogram, introduced by Raisz in 1934 [8], where each region is represented by a rectangle. This has the advantage that the sizes (area) of the regions can be estimated much better than with the first two types. Tobler states in a recent survey, “Thirty-five years of computer cartograms” [10], that none of the existing cartogram algorithms are capable of generating rectangular cartograms. However, even more recently the last two authors of this abstract presented the first algorithms for rectangular cartogram construction [11].	algorithm;computer graphics;map	Sander Florisson;Marc J. van Kreveld;Bettina Speckmann	2005		10.1145/1064092.1064152	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;level set;mathematics;critical point	PL	34.4863619392613	18.662352313255546	73317

Initially the edges of E1 are purple and the edges of E2 blue.Maker andbreakermove alternately. In amoveof themaker a blue edge is colored purple. The breaker then has to recolor a different edge blue in such a way that the purple and the blue edges are spanning trees again. The goal of the maker is to exchange all colors, i.e. to make E1 blue and E2 purple. We prove that a sufficient but not necessary condition for the breaker to win is that the graph contains a K4. Furthermore we characterize the structure of a partition of a wheel into two spanning trees and show that the maker wins on wheels Wn with n ≥ 4 and provide an example of a graph where, for some partitions, the maker wins, for some others, the breaker wins.

The annihilating-ideal graph of R is defined as the graph AG ( R ) with the vertex set A ( R ) ⁎ = A ( R )  { 0 } and two distinct vertices I and J are adjacent if and only if I J = 0 . In this paper, we study the domination number of AG ( R ) and some connections between the domination numbers of annihilating-ideal graphs and zero-divisor graphs are given.

This notion was introduced by Bermond et al. (2009) [2] to solve wavelength assignment problems for specific categories of graphs. In this paper, we aim at characterizing the class of graphs that admit a good edge-labelling. First, we exhibit infinite families of graphs for which no such edge-labelling can be found. We then show that deciding whether a graph G admits a good edge-labelling is NP-complete, even if G is bipartite. Finally, we give large classes of graphs admitting a good edge-labelling: C3-free outerplanar graphs, planar graphs of girth at least 6, {C3, K2,3}-free subcubic graphs and {C3, K2,3}-free ABC-graphs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

[2003]. Our result extends, in a significant way, the result of Pach et al. [2003] for the restricted case of <i>nearly congruent cubes</i>. The analysis uses cuttings, combined with the Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchical decomposition of convex polytopes, in order to partition space into subcells, so that, on average, the overwhelming majority of the tetrahedra intersecting a subcell Δ behave as fat <i>dihedral</i> wedges in Δ. As an immediate corollary, we obtain that the combinatorial complexity of the union of <i>n</i> cubes in R<sup>3</sup>, having arbitrary side lengths, is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2+ϵ</sup>), for any ϵ > 0 (again, significantly extending the result of Pach et al.

In this paper we remedy the situation by using the natural concept of reversible time-bounded compression for finite strings.

We exploit this relationship to achieve an O(n2) time circular-arc graph recognition algorithm. The algorithm employs a new 0 (n2) time method for computing neighborhood containment relations in circular-am graphs and reductions to the recognition problem on circular-arc graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into two cliques. The recognition algorithm also yields an 0 (n2) time isomorphism test for circular-arc graphs.	algorithm	Elaine M. Eschen;Jeremy P. Spinrad	1993				Theory	24.995175048992046	27.038394175235197	74211

In the present work an attempt is made to link the above two branches, by considering degree-specified and minimum cardinality augmentation of graphs so that the resulting graph admits an orientation satisfying a prescribed edge-connection requirement, such as (k, l)-edge-connectivity. The results are obtained by combining the supermodular polyhedral methods used in connectivity orientation with the splitting off operation, which is a standard tool in solving augmentation problems.	connectivity (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);mixed graph;polyhedron;supermodular function	András Frank;Tamás Király	2003	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/S0166-218X(02)00460-2	algebraic connectivity;graph power;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;topology;graph bandwidth;null graph;graph property;graph toughness;clique-width;connectivity;simplex graph;comparability graph;graph automorphism;mathematics;voltage graph;graph;windmill graph;butterfly graph;strong orientation;complement graph;line graph;strength of a graph;satisfiability	Theory	25.478813523565822	29.258226129578837	74310

Li has shown that the bound for the minimum degree 6 can be reduced to n/4 under the additional condition that G is not in /7, where /7 is a class of graphs defined in [7]. On the other hand, we say that a graph G is almost claw-free if the centres of induced claws are independent and their neighbourhoods are 2-dominated. Broersma, Ryjfirek and Schiermeyer have proved that if G is 2-connected almost claw-free graph of order n such that 6 >~(n 2 ) / 3 , then G is hamiltonian. We generalize these results by considering the graphs whose claw centres are independent. If G is a 2-connected graph of order n and minimum degree 6 such that n ~< 46 3 and if the set of claw centres of G is independent, then we show that either G is hamiltonian or G C F, where F is a class of graphs defined in the paper.

Colours assigned to adjacent vertices need to have distance at least 1 in S(r). Alice wins the game if all vertices are coloured, and Bob wins the game if some uncoloured vertices have no legal colour. The circular game chromatic number χcg(G) of G is the infimum of those real numbers r for which Alice has a winning strategy in the circular r-colouring game on G. This paper proves that for any graph G, χcg(G) ≤ 2colg(G)− 2, where colg(G) is the game colouring number of G. This upper bound is shown to be sharp for forests. It is also shown that for any graph G, χcg(G) ≤ 2χa(G)(χa(G) + 1), where χa(G) is the acyclic chromatic number of G.

0ca8bcde6195400319085fa853cdc44344f694b5	on the approximability of orthogonal order preserving layout adjustment		Given an initial placement of a set of rectangles in the plane, we consider the problem of finding a disjoint placement of the rectangles that minimizes the area of the bounding box and preserves the orthogonal order i.e. maintains the sorted ordering of the rectangle centers along both x-axis and y-axis with respect to the initial placement. This problem is known as Layout Adjustment for Disjoint Rectangles (LADR). It was known that LADR is NP-hard, but only heuristics were known for it. We show that a certain decision version of LADR is APX-hard, and give a constant factor approximation for LADR.	apx;apache axis;approximation algorithm;decision problem;heuristic (computer science);minimum bounding box;optic axis of a crystal	Sayan Bandyapadhyay;Santanu Bhowmick;Kasturi R.

Meyniel proved that a graph is perfect if each of its odd cycles with at least five vertices contains at least two chords. Nowadays, such a graph is called a Meyniel graph. We prove that, as conjectured by Meyniel, a graph is very strongly perfect if and only if it is a Meyniel graph. We also design a polynomial-time algorithm which, given a Meyniel graph G and a vertex x of G, finds a stable set that contains I and meets all maximal cliques of G. We shall convert this algorithm into another polynomial-time algorithm which, given a Meyniel graph G, finds an optimal coloring of G, and a largest clique of G. Finally, we shall establish another property, related to perfection, of Meyniel graphs.	algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;induced subgraph;maximal set;polynomial;time complexity	Chính T.

The vertex-label query desires the length of the shortest path from the given vertex to the set of vertices with the given label. We show how to construct an oracle if the given graph is planar, such that O( 1 ǫ n log n) storing space is needed, and any vertexlabel query could be answered in O( 1 ǫ log n log ρ) time with stretch 1+ ǫ. ρ is the radius of the given graph, which is half of the diameter. For the case that ρ = O(log n), we construct an oracle that achieves O(log n) query time, without changing the order of storing space.	graph labeling;shortest path problem;time complexity	Mingfei Li;Christoffer Ma;Li Ning	2011	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	30.292841604972683	19.603561452172016	75041

Obstacle representations are a recent generalization of classical polygon–vertex visibility graphs, for which the characterization and recognition problems are long-standing open questions. In this paper, we study plane outside-obstacle representations, where all obstacles lie in the unbounded face of the representation and no two visibility segments cross. We give a combinatorial characterization of the biconnected graphs that admit such a representation. Based on this characterization, we present a simple linear-time recognition algorithm for these graphs. As a side result, we show that the plane vertex–polygon visibility graphs are exactly the maximal outerplanar graphs and that every chordal outerplanar graph has an outside-obstacle representation.	algorithm;biconnected graph;maximal set;outerplanar graph;time complexity;visibility graph	Alexander Koch;Marcus Krug;Ignaz Rutter	2013	CoRR		1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;block graph;pathwidth;visibility graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;independent set;topology;dense graph;pancyclic graph;metric dimension;trapezoid graph;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;treewidth;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph;planar graph	Theory	31.77652481826099	23.795166582284	75104

Let T d be the set of all d-dimensional simplices T in Rd with integer vertices and a single integer point in the interior of T . It follows from a result of Hensley that T d is finite up to affine transformations that preserve Zd. It is known that when d grows, the maximum volume of the simplices T ∈ T d becomes extremely large. We improve and refine bounds on the size of T ∈ T d (where by the size we mean the volume or the number of lattice points). It is shown that each T ∈ T d can be decomposed into an ascending chain of faces G1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Gd = T such that for every i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, Gi is i-dimensional and the size of Gi is bounded from above in terms of i and d. The bound on the size of Gi is double exponential in i. The presented upper bounds are asymptotically tight on the log-log scale.	time complexity	Gennadiy Averkov	2012	SIAM J.

028ab4dfb573fb93c6e55ed501e7bec235c748b4	upper semicomputable sumtests for lower semicomputable semimeasures		A sumtest for a discrete semimeasure P is a function f mapping bitstrings to non-negative rational numbers such that ∑ P (x)f(x) ≤ 1 . Sumtests are the discrete analogue of Martin-Löf tests. The behavior of sumtests for computable P seems well understood, but for some applications lower semicomputable P seem more appropriate. In the case of tests for independence, it is natural to consider upper semicomputable tests (see [B.Bauwens and S.Terwijn, Theory of Computing Systems 48.2 (2011): 247268]). In this paper, we characterize upper semicomputable sumtests relative to any lower semicomputable semimeasures using Kolmogorov complexity. It is studied to what extend such tests are pathological: can upper semicomputable sumtests for m(x) be large? It is shown that the logarithm of such tests does not exceed log |x| + O(log |x|) (where |x| denotes the length of x and log = log log) and that this bound is tight, i.e. there is a test whose logarithm exceeds log |x| −O(log |x|) infinitely often. Finally, it is shown that for each such test e the mutual information of a string with the Halting problem is at least log e(x)−O(1); thus e can only be large for “exotic” strings.	computable function;halting problem;kolmogorov complexity;log-space reduction;mutual information;theory of computing	Bruno Bauwens	2013	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	36.717189723834956	29.19893728407289	75196

The independent domination number, i ( G ) , of G is the minimum cardinality of an independent dominating set. In this paper, we extend the work of Henning, Lowenstein, and Rautenbach (2014) who proved that if G is a bipartite, cubic graph of order  n and of girth at least  6 , then i ( G ) ≤ 4 11 n . We show that the bipartite condition can be relaxed, and prove that if G is a cubic graph of order  n and of girth at least  6 , then i ( G ) ≤ 4 11 n .	dominating set;girth (graph theory)	Gholamreza Abrishami;Michael A.

Moreover this homotopy type can be computed in time O(n log n). For the particular case of the nerve complex of evenly-spaced arcs of the same length, we determine the dihedral group action on homology, and we relate the complex to a cyclic polytope with n vertices. We give three applications of our knowledge of the homotopy types of nerve complexes of circular arcs. First, we use the connection to cyclic polytopes to give a novel topological proof of a known upper bound on the distance between successive roots of a homogeneous trigonometric polynomial. Second, we show that the Lovász bound on the chromatic number of a circular complete graph is either sharp or off by one. Third, we show that the Vietoris–Rips simplicial complex of n points in the circle is homotopy equivalent to either a point, an odd-dimensional sphere, or a wedge sum of spheres of the same even dimension, and furthermore this homotopy type can be computed in time O(n log n).	graph coloring;homology (biology);off-by-one error;simplicial complex;the circle (file system);trigonometric polynomial	Michal Adamaszek;Henry Adams;Florian Frick;Chris Peterson;Corrine Previte-Johnson	2016	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-016-9803-5	combinatorics;topology;homotopy sphere;mathematics;geometry;n-connected;algebraic topology;homotopy lifting property	Theory	35.101790327179735	24.19104875192875	75748

It is bipartiteuniform if within each of the sets of hypervertices of the same colour, hyperedges and hyperfaces, all the elements have the same valency. The flags of a bipartite hypermap are naturally 2-coloured by assigning the colour of its adjacent hypervertices. A hypermap is bipartite-regular if the automorphism group acts transitively on each set of coloured flags. If the automorphism group acts transitively on the set of all flags, the hypermap is regular. In this paper we classify the bipartite-uniform hypermaps on the sphere (up to duality). Two constructions of bipartite-uniform hypermaps are given. All bipartite-uniform spherical hypermaps are shown to be constructed in this way. As a by-product we show that every bipartite-uniform hypermap H on the sphere is bipartite-regular. We also compute their irregularity group and index, and also their closure cover H∆ and covering core H∆.	color;graph automorphism	Antonio Breda d'Azevedo;Rui Duarte	2007	Electr. J.

The strong chromatic index χ s ′ ( G ) of a graph G is the minimum k for which G has a strong k -edge-coloring. Denote σ ( G ) = max x y ∈ E ( G ) { deg ( x ) + deg ( y ) − 1 } . It is easy to see that σ ( G ) ≤ χ s ′ ( G ) for any graph G , and the equality holds when G is a tree. For a planar graph G of maximum degree Δ , it was proved that χ s ′ ( G ) ≤ 4 Δ + 4 by using the Four Color Theorem. The upper bound was then reduced to 4 Δ , 3 Δ + 5 , 3 Δ + 1 , 3 Δ , 2 Δ − 1 under different conditions for Δ and the girth. In this paper, we prove that if the girth of a planar graph G is large enough and σ ( G ) ≥ Δ ( G ) + 2 , then the strong chromatic index of G is precisely σ ( G ) . This result reflects the intuition that a planar graph with a large girth locally looks like a tree.	edge coloring;girth (graph theory);planar graph	Gerard J.

00b1bc84265182a737e70b8c1f837332568c53f7	$χ$-bounded families of oriented graphs		A famous conjecture of Gyárfás and Sumner states for any tree T and integer k, if the chromatic number of a graph is large enough, either the graph contains a clique of size k or it contains T as an induced subgraph. We discuss some results and open problems about extensions of this conjecture to oriented graphs. We conjecture that for every oriented star S and integer k, if the chromatic number of a digraph is large enough, either the digraph contains a clique of size k or it contains S as an induced subgraph. As an evidence, we prove that for any oriented star S, every oriented graph with sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a transitive tournament of order 3 or S as an induced subdigraph. We then study for which sets P of orientations of P4 (the path on four vertices) similar statements hold. We establish some positive and negative results.	clique (graph theory);directed graph;graph coloring;induced subgraph;orientation (graph theory);path (graph theory)	Pierre Aboulker;Jørgen Bang-Jensen;Nicolas Bousquet;Pierre Charbit;Frédéric Havet;Frédéric Maffray;José Zamora	2016	CoRR			Theory	29.847775639077827	28.85492705526335	76166

Then the interval from u  to v  consists of all those vertices that lie on some shortest u  —  v  path. Let S  be a set of vertices in a connected graph G . Then the Steiner distance d  G (S) of S  in G  is the smallest number of edges in a connected subgraph of G  that contains S . Such a subgraph is necessarily a tree called a Steiner tree for S . The Steiner interval I  G (S) of S  consists of all those vertices that lie on some Steiner tree for S . Let S  be an n -set of vertices of G  and suppose that k  ⩽  n . Then the k -intersection interval of S, denoted by I  k (S) is the intersection of all Steiner intervals of all k -subsets of S . It is shown that if S  = {u 1 , u 2 , ..., u n } is a set of n  ⩾ 2 vertices of a graph G  and if the 2-intersection interval of S  is nonempty andxe I 2 (S) , then. d (S) = ∑ n  i = 1  = 1  d(u i , x). It is observed that the only graphs for which the 2-intersection intervals of all n -sets, n  ⩾ 4, are nonempty are stars. Moreover, for every n  ⩾ 4, those graphs with the property that the 3-intersection interval of every n -set is nonempty are completely characterized. In general, if n  = 2k, those graphs G  for which I  k (S) is nonempty for every n -set S  of G  are characterized.	steiner tree problem	Ewa Kubicka;Grzegorz Kubicki;Ortrud R.

The vertex set of this graph consists of all points in the plane. The point (x, y) is adjacent to the points S(x, y), S(x, y), T (x, y), T(x, y) where S(x, y) = (x, x+y) and T (x, y) = (x+y, y). We show that the expansion rate of this 4-regular graph is 2. The main technical result asserts that for any compact planar set A of finite positive measure, |S(A) ∪ S(A) ∪ T (A) ∪ T(A) ∪ A| |A| ≥ 2, where |B| is the Lebesgue measure of B. The proof is completely elementary and is based on symmetrization a classical method in the area of isoperimetric problems. We also use symmetrization to prove a similar result for a directed version of the same graph.	elementary;isoperimetric inequality;vertex (graph theory)	Nathan Linial;Eran London	2006	J. Comb.

We show that any graph G must share one of the following two conditions: (a) for each integer h such that G may be embedded on Sh, the sphere with h handles, there is a spanning tree T in G such that h = 1 2 (β(G)−ω(T )), where β(G) and ω(T ) are, respectively, the Betti number of G and the number of components of G− E(T ) having odd number of edges; (b) for every spanning tree T of G, there is an orientable embedding of G with exact ω(T ) + 1 faces. This extends Xuong and Liu’s theorem[5,6] to some other ( possible ) genera. Infinitely many examples show that there are graphs which satisfy (a) but (b).

All matroids of rank 2 are base-sortable and we give a characterization of base-sortability by excluded minors in the case of graphic matroids and rank 3 matroids. Transversal matroids with certain presentations are also base-sortable. For a base-sortable matroid M, the basis monomial ring RMis shown to be Koszul, by proving that the toric ideal of this ring has a quadratic Grobner basis. Extending the concept of combinatorial pure subrings considered by Herzog, Hibi and Ohsugi we define the matroid operations deletion, contraction and duality for homogeneous semigroup rings with square-free monomial generators, and observe that Koszulness is preserved under these operations.	matroid	Stefan Blum	2001	Eur.

We first describe a general framework, adapted from Cohen [10], for this task, and then specialize it to two important instances of range counting: halfspaces in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> and disks in the plane. The technique reduces the approximate range counting problem to that of finding the minimum rank of a data object in the range, with respect to a <i>random</i> permutation of the input.A major technical step in our analysis, which we believe to be of independent interest, is a bound of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) on the expected complexity of the overlay of all the Voronoi faces that are generated during a randomized incremental construction of the Voronoi diagram of <i>n</i> points in the plane. The same bound holds for the expected complexity of the overlay of all the faces of the minimization diagram of the lower envelope of <i>n</i> planes in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup>, or for the expected complexity of the overlay of all the normal (or Gaussian) diagram faces of the convex hull of <i>n</i> points in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup>, that are generated during a randomized incremental construction of the lower envelope or of the hull, respectively. All these bounds are tight in the worst case.The first bound leads to an algorithm that, for a query point <i>x</i> ∈ <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, efficiently retrieves the sequence of nearest neighbors of <i>x</i> in <i>P</i>, over the random insertion process. A query takes <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) expected time, and the expected storage size is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). Similarly, the other bounds lead to an algorithm that, for a query direction ω ∈ <i>S</i><sup>2</sup>, efficiently retrieves the sequence of the convex hull vertices that are touched by the planes with outward direction ω that support the convex hull during the random insertion process. Again, a query takes <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) expected time, and the expected storage size is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). These algorithms are used as the main component in the approximate range counting technique that we present, for ranges that are halfspaces in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> or disks in the plane.	approximation algorithm;average-case complexity;best, worst and average case;convex hull;counting problem (complexity);data point;randomized algorithm;voronoi diagram	Haim Kaplan;Micha Sharir	2006			three-dimensional space;mathematical optimization;approximation error;combinatorics;random permutation;discrete mathematics;voronoi diagram;convex hull;np-hard;mathematics;geometry;nucleolus;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;algorithm;output-sensitive algorithm	Theory	30.115650890863137	18.717991774631805	77642
8c5e9b8bdaa5095fc1036fb2c5e3e015f786388c	recharacterizing eulerian: intimations of new duality		Eulerian graphs are shown to be characterized by being connected with each edge in an odd number of circuits, as compared with the traditional characterization having each cutset contain an even number of edges. This result is proved in the general context of binary matroids, and the intriguing sort of duality present is analyzed using syntactical duality principles.		Terry A.

This led to the notion of graph-different permutations. We extend this concept to directed graphs, focussing on orientations of the semi-infinite path whose edges connect consecutive natural numbers. Our main result shows that the maximum number of permutations satisfying all the pairwise conditions associated with all of the various orientations of this path is exponentially smaller, for any single orientation, than the maximum number of those permutations which satisfy the corresponding pairwise relationship. This is in sharp contrast with a result of Gargano, Körner, and Vaccaro concerning the analogous notion of Sperner capacity of families of finite graphs. We improve the exponential lower bound for the original problem, and list a number of open questions.	boolean algebra;directed graph;semiconductor industry;sperner's lemma;time complexity	Graham R.

The first part of the thesis deals with the decomposition of multiple coverings of the plane. We say that a planar set is cover-decomposable if there is a constant m such that any m-fold covering of the plane with its translates is decomposable into two disjoint coverings of the whole plane. Pach conjectured that every convex set is cover-decomposable. We verify his conjecture for polygons. Moreover, if m is large enough, depending on k and the polygon, we prove that any m-fold covering can even be decomposed into k coverings. Then we show that the situation is exactly the opposite in three dimensions, for any polyhedron and any m we construct an m-fold covering of the space that is not decomposable. We also give constructions that show that concave polygons are usually not cover-decomposable. We start the first part with a detailed survey of all results on the cover-decomposability of polygons. The second part of the thesis investigates another geometric partition problem, related to planar representation of graphs. Wade and Chu defined the slope number of a graph G as the smallest number s with the property that G has a straight-line drawing with edges of at most s distinct slopes and with no bends. We examine the slope number of bounded degree graphs. Our main results are that if the maximum degree is at least 5, then the slope number tends to infinity as the number of vertices grows but every graph with maximum degree at most 3 can be embedded with only five slopes. We also prove that such an embedding exists for the related notion called slope parameter. Finally, we study the planar slope number, defined only for planar graphs as the smallest number s with the property that the graph has a straight-line drawing in the plane without any crossings such that the edges are segments of only s distinct slopes. We show that the planar slope number of planar graphs with bounded degree is bounded.	concave function;convex set;embedded system;line drawing algorithm;partition problem;planar graph;polyhedron;slope number	Dömötör Pálvölgyi	2010	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;slope number;computational geometry;planar straight-line graph;mathematics;geometry;book embedding;planar graph;algebra	Theory	31.46734612539937	23.98200247230514	77864

Avior et al. have shown that the minimal area of a layout of the n-input Butterfly, without the above restriction, is (1 + o(l))n . The effect of this restriction on the area was left as an open question. This paper reveals that exposing the input and output vertices is essentially free. That is, it presents an exposed layout of the Butterfly having the same area as above. In this layout, the fractions of the input and output vertices assigned to each side of the grid are as follows when scanning the sides in a circular fashion: half of the inputs, half of the outputs, half of the inputs, and half of the outputs. We refer to such a layout as a ( | J , | 0 , | / , |0)-layout. The main technique employed in this layout is the reduction of the layout problem of the Butterfly to a certain layout problem of a complete bipartite graph. We use the same technique to produce a (/, 0, O,0)-layout (inputs on one side and outputs on the opposite side) in area (2 + o(l))n. Finally, we show that the area of a ( | / , | l , | 0 , |0)-layout is greater than (1 + |)ra. Hence, this input-output configuration is more area-demanding than ( | I , | 0 , | J , \0).	input/output;vertex (geometry)	Ami Litman	2001	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265901000348	layout;combinatorics;computer science	Theory	31.090401108210862	23.17712732201258	78000

He showed that by considering an analogue of hyperhypersimplicity, one could characterize the sets which are the Halting problem relative to arbitrary computable numberings. One could also consider half of splittings of maximal or hyperhypersimple sets and get another variant of maximality and hyperhypersimplicity, which are closely related to the study of automorphisms of the c.e. sets. We investigate the Turing degrees of these classes of c.e. sets. In particular, we show that the analogue of a theorem of Martin fails for these classes.	computable function;halting problem;maximal set;turing degree	Keng Meng Ng	2009	Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic	10.1215/00294527-2009-022	turing degree;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;computability theory;mathematics;utm theorem;pa degree;computable number;algorithm	Theory	37.85900955004897	29.843160441764336	78224
15539e976aca47afd71e0dbed427c506c6ea6483	parallel rectilinear shortest paths with rectangular obstacles	shortest path;convex polygon;shortest path problem	Let P be a simple rectilinear convex polygon of size O(n) inside which lie n pairwise disjoint rectangular rectilinear obstacles. We provide parallel techniques for computing rectilinear shortest paths that avoid the set of obstacles in P. Specifically, we compute descriptions of shortest paths in O(log’ n) time, with O(n’/ log’ n) processors in the CREWPRAM model if source and destination are on the boundary of P, with O(n’/ log n) processors if the source is an obstacle vertex and the destination a vertex of P, and with O(n’) processors if both source and destination are obstacle vertices. The descriptions we compute enable one processor to obtain the path length of any query pair of vertices in constant time, or O(n/log n) processors to retrieve the shortest path itself in logarithmic time. If the two query points are arbitrary rather than vertices, then one processor takes O(log TV) time (instead of constant time) for finding the path length. A number of other related shortest paths problems are solved. The techniques we use involve a fast computation of separator staircases and, most importantly, a scheme for partitioning the obstacles’ boundaries into families in a way that ensures that the resulting path length matrices have a monotonicity property that is apparently absent before applying our partitioning scheme.	central processing unit;computation;regular grid;shortest path problem;time complexity;vertex (geometry)	Mikhail J.

The drawing defines a sign for each edge-3-coloring of  G . The  Penrose number  of  G  is the sum of signs of its edge-3-colorings. For plane graphs it coincides with the number of edge-3-colorings.  Given a cubic diagram  G , we define a sign for every Eulerian orientation of its line-graph  L ( G ) and prove that the Penrose number of  G  is equal to the sumof signs of the Eulerian orientations of  L ( G ). This yields a new recursive scheme for the computation of the Penrose number. Another consequence is a simple formula which gives the number of vertex-4- colorings of a loopless plane triangulation in terms of the mappings from the vertex-set to {1,2,3} which take exactly two distinct values on each triangle.	cubic function;voronoi diagram	François Jaeger	1989	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(89)90201-X	chromatic polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;penrose diagram;invariant;mathematics;geometry;algebra;recursion	Theory	32.122960112385606	22.719079142350623	78360

We study a similar problem for oriented hypergraphs. We prove that every oriented hypergraph has an edge weighting satisfying a similar condition, even if the weights are to be chosen from arbitrary lists of size two. The proof is based on the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz and a theorem of Schur for permanents of positive semi-definite matrices. We derive several consequences of the main result for uniform hypergraphs. We also point on possible applications of our results to problems of 1-2-3 type for non-oriented hypergraphs.

A graph is called reduced if it has no isolated vertices and no two vertices with the same set of neighbors. Akbari, Cameron, and Khosrovshahi conjectured that the number of vertices of every reduced graph of rank r is at most m(r) = 2 − 2 if r is even and m(r) = 5 · 2(r−3)/2 − 2 if r is odd. In this article, we prove that if the conjecture is not true, then there would be a counterexample of rank at most 46. We also show that every reduced graph of rank r has at most 8m(r) + 14 vertices.	adjacency matrix;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Ebrahim Ghorbani;Ali Mohammadian;Behruz Tayfeh-Rezaie	2015	Combinatorica	10.1007/s00493-015-2922-4	graph power;circuit rank;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;independent set;graph center;graph toughness;regular graph;distance-regular graph;hypercube graph;cycle graph;path graph;mathematics;wheel graph;graph homomorphism;rank;bound graph;distance;biregular graph;complement graph;algebra	Theory	28.876769914008943	30.254600430146407	78907

This matrix, called the Tutte matrix, has rank exactly twice the size of a maximum cardinality matching of G. Thus, to find the size of a maximum matching it suffices to compute the rank of T . We consider the more general problem of computing the rank of T +K where K is a real V by V skew-symmetric matrix. This modest generalization of the matching problem contains the linear matroid matching problem and, more generally, the linear delta-matroid parity problem. We present a tight upper bound on the rank of T +K by decomposing T+K into a sum of matrices whose ranks are easy to compute.	indeterminacy in concurrent computation;matching (graph theory);matroid representation;tutte matrix	James F.

Recently, Amin and Hakimi [2] have proposed a way of finding an upper bound for r(G); for other bounds the reader is referred to Bezge [3, Chap. 131. The purpot of this note is to show how one can reduce the problem of finding an upper bound for r(G) to the problem in a subgraph G’ of G. Note that 7(G) equal to the independence number ar(@ of the complement c of G. In this paper, a graph will be finite, undirected d connected, and will contain no loops or nultiple lip. If G it a graph, its set sf points will be denoted v(G) arId its set of lines will be denoted by X(G). me that the reader is familiar with the centraf concepts in graph theory.

This permits the definition of a sound notion of geometric content for most of these sequences, more exactly for those which are not primitive. We group the 4096 many linear recurrent double sequences with constant border I over the ring M2(F2) in 90 geometric types. The classification over Klein’s Vierergruppe K is not explicitly displayed and consists of the same geometric types like for M2(F2), but contains more exceptions. There are a lot of cases of unsymmetric double sequences converging to symmetric geometric contents. We display also geometric types occurring both in a monochromatic and in a dichromatic version.	monochrome;the matrix	Mihai Prunescu	2011	Symmetry	10.3390/sym3030402	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Theory	38.50027317649767	32.29853470426452	79390

We show that the arrangement of $\mathcal S$ can be stored implicitly in a data structure of size O(n log2n) so that the following query can be answered in time O(n1/2log2 n): Given two query points, determine whether they lie in the same face of the arrangement of S and, if so, return a path between them that lies within the face. This version of the implicit point location problem is motivated by the following motion planning problem: Given a polygonal robot R with m vertices and a planar region bounded by polygonal obstacles with n vertices in total, preprocess them into a data structure so that, given initial and final positions of R, one can quickly determine whether there exists a continuous collision-free translational motion of R from the initial to the final position. We show that such a query can be answered in time O((mn)1/2log2 mn) using O(mn log2 mn) storage.	motion planning;point location	Pankaj K. Agarwal;Marc J. van Kreveld	1994	Int. J. Comput.

A weighted point set is a set of pairs (p, r) where p is a point in the plane and r is a real number. The distance between two points (pi, ri) and (pj , rj) is defined as |pipj | − ri − rj . We show that in the case where all ri are positive numbers and |pipj | ≥ ri + rj for all i, j (in which case the points can be seen as non-intersecting disks in the plane), a variant of the Yao graph is a (1 + )-spanner that has a linear number of edges. We also show that the Additively Weighted Delaunay graph (the face-dual of the Additively Weighted Voronoi diagram) has constant spanning ratio. The straight line embedding of the Additively Weighted Delaunay graph may not be a plane graph. We show how to compute a plane embedding that also has a constant spanning ratio. ∗Research partially supported by NSERC, MRI, CFI, and MITACS.	common flash memory interface;control-flow integrity;delaunay triangulation;file spanning;geometric spanner;planar graph;weighted voronoi diagram;well-separated pair decomposition;whole earth 'lectronic link;yao graph	Prosenjit Bose;Paz Carmi;Mathieu Couture	2011	J.

9df0b9cca3621234eadff32fb697ae50306ecb61	on zero-one and convergence laws for graphs embeddable on a fixed surface		We show that for no surface except for the plane does monadic second-order logic (MSO) have a zero-one-law – and not even a convergence law – on the class of (connected) graphs embeddable on the surface. In addition we show that every rational in [0,1] is the limiting probability of some MSO formula. This strongly refutes a conjecture by Heinig et al. (2014) who proved a convergence law for planar graphs, and a zero-one law for connected planar graphs, and also identified the so-called gaps of [0,1]: the subintervals that are not limiting probabilities of any MSO formula. The proof relies on a combination of methods from structural graph theory, especially large face-width embeddings of graphs on surfaces, analytic combinatorics, and finite model theory, and several parts of the proof may be of independent interest. In particular, we identify precisely the properties that make the zero-one law work on planar graphs but fail for every other surface. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Mathematics of computing→ Graphs and surfaces, Mathematics of computing → Enumeration, Theory of computation → Finite Model Theory	graph theory;planar graph;theory of computation	Albert Atserias;Stephan Kreutzer;Marc Noy	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2018.116	combinatorics;graph theory;conjecture;zero–one law;discrete mathematics;analytic combinatorics;computer science;random graph;planar graph;topological graph theory;law;finite model theory	Theory	33.44383769873698	26.041245668184654	79687

The original motivation was that, for a large but finite network graph to enjoy some of the typical properties to be expected in negatively curved Riemannian manifolds, the delta measuring the thinness of a triangle scaled by its diameter must be below a certain threshold all across the graph. Here we develop various ways of scaling the 4-point delta, and develop upper bounds for the scaled 4-point delta in various spaces. A significant theoretical advantage of the TTC over the FPC is that the latter allows for a Gromov-like characterization of Ptolemaic spaces. As major network application, it is shown that Scale-Free networks tend to be scaled Gromov hyperbolic, while Small-World networks are rather scaled positively curved.	algebraic equation;ampersand;computation;computer algebra system;elimination theory;emoticon;existential quantification;image scaling;iteration;linear algebra;perimeter;quantifier (logic);reflections of signals on conducting lines;social inequality;system of polynomial equations;unicode;universal quantification	Edmond A.

Our results are inspired by similar results in recursive combinatorics. Theorems included concern colorings of graphs and bounded graphs, Euler paths, and Hamilton paths. Reverse mathematics provides powerful techniques for analyzing the logical content of theorems. By contrast, recursive mathematics analyzes the effective content of theorems. Theorems and techniques of recursive mathematics can often inspire related results in reverse mathematics, as demonstrated by the research presented here. Sections 1 and 2 analyze theorems on graph colorings. Section 3 considers graphs with Euler paths. Stronger axiom systems are introduced and applied to the study of Hamilton paths in Section 4. We assume familiarity with the methods of reverse mathematics, as described in [15].

Formally, a ladder lottery of a permutation π = (p1, p2, . . . , pn) is a network with n vertical lines (lines for short) and many horizontal lines (bars for short) as follows (see Fig. 1). The i-th line from the left is called line i. The top ends of the n lines correspond to π. The bottom ends of the n lines correspond to the identical permutation (1, 2, . . . , n). Each bar connects two consecutive lines. Each number pi in π starts at the top end of line i, and goes down along the line, then whenever pi comes to an end of a bar, pi goes horizontally along the bar to the other end, then goes down again. Finally pi reaches the bottom end of line pi. We can regard a bar as a modification of the “current” permutation. In a ladder lottery a sequence of such modifications always results in the identical permutation (1, 2, . . . , n). The ladder lotteries are strongly related to primitive sorting networks, which are deeply investigated by Knuth [2]. A comparator in a primitive sorting network replaces pi and pj by min (pi, pj) and max (pi, pj), while a bar in a ladder lottery always exchanges them. Given a permutation π = (p1, p2, . . . , pn) the minimum number of bars to construct ladder lotteries of π is equal to the number of “reverse pairs” in π, which are pairs (pi, pj) in π with pi > pj and i < j. A ladder lottery of π with the minimum number of bars is optimal. The ladder lottery in Fig. 2 has eight bars, and its corresponding permutation (2,6,4,1,5,3) has eight reverse pairs: (2,1), (6,4), (6,1), (6,5), (6,3), (4,1), (4,3) and (5,3), so the ladder lottery is optimal. In [5] we gave an algorithm to enumerate all optimal ladder lotteries of a given permutation π. The algorithm generates all optimal ladder lotteries of π in O(1) time for each. The idea of our algorithm in [5] is as follows. We first define a tree structure Tπ, called the family tree, among optimal ladder lotteries, in which each vertex of Tπ corresponds to each optimal ladder lottery and each edge of Tπ corresponds to a relation between two optimal ladder lotteries. Then we design an efficient algorithm to generate all child vertices	algorithm;comparator;enumerated type;family tree;ladder logic;ladder-des;multistage interconnection networks;randomness;resistor ladder;sorting network;tree structure;xfig	Katsuhisa Yamanaka;Shin-Ichi Nakano	2014	IEICE Transactions		arithmetic;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;family tree;mathematics;enumeration;algorithm	Theory	29.52135914853898	23.40103166109464	80738

A technique, regular edge labeling, was successfully used in solving several planar graph drawing problems, including visibility representation, straight-line embedding, and rectangular dual problems. A regular edge labeling of a plane graph G labels the edges of G so that the edge labels around any vertex show certain regular pattern. The drawing of G is obtained by using the combinatorial structures resulting from the edge labeling. In this paper, we survey these drawing algorithms and discuss some open problems.

Given a path of<i>k</i>+2 edges it interchanges the end vertices of the path. Bydefinition this operation preserves regularity and connectivity. Weshow that every regular connected graph can be reached by a seriesof these operations for all <i>k</i> ¡Ý 1. We use arandomized version, called Random <i>k</i>-Flipper, in order tocreate random regular connected undirected graphs that may serve asa backbone for peer-to-peer networks. We prove for degree<i>d</i>¡Ê ¦¸(log <i>n</i>) that a seriesof <i>O</i>(<i>dn</i>) Random <i>k</i>-Flipper operations with<i>k</i> ∈¦¨(<i>d</i><sup>2</sup><i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log1/¦Å) transforms any graph into an expander graph withhigh probability, i.e. 1-<i>n</i><sup>-¦¨(1)</sup>. The Random 1-Flipper is symmetric, i.e. the transformationprobability from any labeled <i>d</i>-regular graph<i>G</i> to <i>G'</i> is equal to thosefrom <i>G'</i> to <i>G</i>. From this andthe reachability property we conclude that in the limit a series ofRandom 1-Flipper operations converges against an uniformprobability distribution over all connected labeled<i>d</i>-regular graphs. For degree<i>d</i> ∈ ω(1) growing with the graph sizethis implies that iteratively applying Random 1-Flipper transformsany given graph into an expander asymptotically almost surely. We use these operations as a maintenance operation for apeer-to-peer network based on random regular connected graphs thatprovides high robustness and recovers from degenerate networkstructures by continuously applying these random graphtransformations. For this, we describe how network operations forjoining and leaving the network can be designed and how theconcurrency of the graph transformations can be handled.	connectivity (graph theory);degree (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph rewriting;internet backbone;peer-to-peer;reachability	Peter Mahlmann;Christian Schindelhauer	2005		10.1145/1073970.1073992	block graph;lattice graph;graph power;random regular graph;random graph;strongly regular graph;distributed algorithm;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;expander graph;regular graph;distance-regular graph;theoretical computer science;pancyclic graph;comparability graph;symmetric graph;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;distributed computing;windmill graph;modular decomposition;butterfly graph;random geometric graph;vertex-transitive graph;graph operations;line graph	Theory	26.57626419435056	29.804760891175487	80803

In the conflict-free coloring of a hypergraph H , every edge e (a subset of vertices) must have a vertex that is uniquely colored among the vertices in e. For instance, consider the geometric hypergraph induced by axis-aligned rectangles: Its vertices correspond to a finite set of axis-aligned rectangles, and each maximal subset of rectangles with a common intersection forms a hyperedge. We erroneously wrote that for these hypergraphs, the conflict-free chromatic number has a tight Θ(logn) bound, but in fact only an upper bound of O(log2 n) (shown by Smorodinsky in [3]), and a lower bound of Ω(logn) (given by Pach and Tardos in [2]) is known.	apache axis;art gallery problem;graph coloring;maximal set;t-coloring;vertex (geometry)	Andreas Bärtschi;Subhash Suri	2013	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-013-9852-6	discrete mathematics;combinatorics;chromatic scale;hypergraph;mistake;vertex (geometry);mathematics;upper and lower bounds;constraint graph;finite set	Theory	29.481927327009906	26.043785855508446	80859
56a486d09f6140bbdc75c560ae4b265a9593ffc0	on local connectivity of graphs with given clique number	connectivity	For a vertex v of a graph G, we denote by d(v) the degree of v. The local connectivity κ(u, v) of two vertices u and v in a graph G is the maximum number of internally disjoint u –v paths in G, and the connectivity of G is defined as κ(G)=min&lcub;κ(u, v)|u, v∈V(G)&rcub;. Clearly, κ(u, v)&les;min&lcub;d(u), d(v)&rcub; for all pairs u and v of vertices in G. Let δ(G) be the minimum degree of G. We call a graph G maximally connected when κ(G)=δ(G) and maximally local connected when $\kappa({{u}},{{v}})={\min}\{{{d}}({{u}}),{{d}}({{v}})\}$ for all pairs u and v of distinct vertices in G.

In the process, we confirm an unpublished result of Steve Linton that there is no distance-regular antipodal double cover of \(\Delta \), and so no distance-regular graph with intersection array \(\{32,27,6,1;1,6,27,32\}\).

A coloring is k-improper if no more than k neighbors of every vertex have the same colour as that assigned to the vertex. The k-improper chromatic number χk(G) is the least number of colors needed in a k-improper coloring of a graph G. The main subject of this work is analyzing the complexity of computing χk for the class of unit disk graphs and some related classes, e.g., hexagonal graphs and interval graphs. We show NP-completeness in many restricted cases and also provide both positive and negative approximability results. Because of the challenging nature of this topic, many seemingly simple questions remain: for example, it remains open to determine the complexity of computing χk for unit interval graphs. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, a (one-to-one) embedding scheme is presented for embedding G into G’ such that the dilation cost is at most 6. Previous results for this problem include a recent dilation 2 result for large compression ratios, and a dilation 3 result (through folding followed by compression) if the intermediate grid is not larger than the final host. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that allows to embed in the smallest square, regardless of the aspect ratio of the rectangle, while keeping the dilation constant. Our result is achieved using the compress and fold method, with a new compression method. @ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.	cuboid;data compression;dilation (morphology);fold (higher-order function);one-to-one (data model);regular grid;square tiling	Shou-Hsuan Stephen Huang;Hongfei Liu;Rakesh M.

1298bfe1a36f59684cd3b97c40f2d8605e0af5fe	an efficient combinatorial algorithm for optimal compression of a polyline with segments and arcs		The task of finding the optimal compression of a polyline with straight-line segments and arcs is performed in many applications, such as polyline compression, noise filtering, and feature recognition. Optimal compression algorithms find the best solution using the dynamic programming approach, which requires a significant amount of arc fitting. This paper describes an improvement to the dynamic programming approach by reducing the amount of arc fitting necessary to find the optimal solution. Instead of processing from the second to the last vertices in the dynamic programming approach, the algorithm proceeds forward and skips as many steps as possible without affecting the inference in any way. Such a modification extends the practical application of the algorithm to polylines having arcs with a large number of vertices.	arcs (computing);algorithm;best, worst and average case;combinatorial optimization;data compression;dynamic programming;feature recognition;resultant;vertex (geometry)	Alexander Gribov	2017	2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)	10.1109/ICDAR.2017.251	filter (signal processing);discrete mathematics;mathematics;feature recognition;algorithm design;data compression;approximation algorithm;arc (geometry);vertex (geometry);dynamic programming;algorithm	Robotics	29.817784700176336	18.311368456268582	81542

In particular, the average degree inside this subset of vertices is larger than outside (but still bounded). Given a realization of such graph, we aim at identifying the hidden subset of vertices. This can be regarded as a model for the problem of finding a tightly knitted community in a social network, or a cluster in a relational dataset. In this paper we present two sets of contributions: (i) We use the cavity method from spin glass theory to derive an exact phase diagram for the reconstruction problem. In particular, as the difference in edge probability increases, the problem undergoes two phase transitions, a static phase transition and a dynamic one. (ii) We establish rigorous bounds on the dynamic phase transition and prove that, above a certain threshold, a local algorithm (belief propagation) correctly identify most of the hidden set. Below the same threshold no local algorithm can achieve this goal. However, in this regime the subset can be identified by exhaustive search. For small hidden sets and large average degree, the phase transition for local algorithms takes an intriguingly simple form. Local algorithms succeed with high probability for degin−degout > √ degout /e and fail for degin−degout < √ degout /e (with degin, degout the average degrees inside and outside the community). We argue that spectral algorithms are also ineffective in the latter regime. It is an open problem whether any polynomial time algorithms might succeed for degin−degout < √ degout /e.	approximation algorithm;belief propagation;brute-force search;local algorithm;phase diagram;reconstruction conjecture;social network;software propagation;sparse graph code;sparse matrix;time complexity;vertex (geometry);with high probability	Andrea Montanari	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	27.027681285429562	22.509263221741296	81810

d6398b65db57eec3f04f872de071ac043e7028ef	chromaticity of series-parallel graphs	series parallel graph	By applying a sequence of edge-gluings on a set of cycles each of length k, we obtain a special series-parallel graph. The well-known k-gon tree theorem (see [l, lo]) states that these graphs form a X-equivalence class. Many of the other known classes of X-unique graphs and X-equivalence classes are also special cases of series-parallel graphs. This paper introduces some new chromatic invariants for this class of graphs. We illustrate the usefulness of these invariants by constructing several new X-equivalence classes which include edge-gluings of graphs in a special class of series-parallel graphs. The latter result parallels that of the k-gon tree theorem.	abstract syntax tree;gon;parallels desktop for mac;series-parallel graph;turing completeness;whole earth 'lectronic link	K. M. Koh;C. P.

We introduce the polar coordinate representation and describe a family of algorithms for constructing it. The main advantage of the polar representation is that it allows independent control over grid size and bend positions. We first describe a standard (Cartesian) representation algorithm, CRA, which we then modify to obtain a polar representation algorithm, PRA. In both algorithms we are concerned with the following drawing criteria: angular resolution, bends per edge, vertex resolution, bend-point resolution, edge separation, and drawing area. The CRA algorithm achieves 1 bend per edge, unit vertex and bend resolution, √ 2/2 edge separation, 5n × 5n 2 drawing area and 1 2d(v) angular resolution, where d(v) is the degree of vertex v. The PRA algorithm has an improved angular resolution of π 4d(v) , 1 bend per edge, and unit vertex resolution. For the PRA algorithm, the bend-point resolution and edge separation are parameters that can be modified to achieve different types of drawings and drawing areas. In particular, for the same parameters as the CRA algorithm (unit bend-point resolution and √ 2/2 edge separation), the PRA algorithm creates a drawing of size 9n × 9n 2 . Communicated by: P.

It turns out that nowhere dense classes of graphs can be characterised in many different ways and have been shown to be equivalent to other concepts studied in areas such as (finite) model theory. Therefore, the concept of nowhere density seems to capture a natural property of graph classes generalising for example classes of graphs which exclude a fixed minor, have bounded degree or bounded local tree-width. In this paper we give a self-contained introduction to the concept of nowhere dense classes of graphs focussing on the various ways in which they can be characterised.

Alspach has proved that a regular tournament is arc-pancyclic. Zhu and Tian proved that if a tournament  T  = ( V ,  A ) with vertex set  V , arc set  A  and order  p  satisfies that for any arc ( v i  ,  v j  ) of  T , if  d  + ( v   j  )+ d  - ( v   i  )⩾ p −2, then  T  is arc-pancyclic, where  p ⩾7. In this paper we study an extreme problem concerning the  k -arc-cyclic property for a class of tournaments.  We say that a tournament  T =( V ,  A ) satisfies the condition  O ( p ,  q ) if  d  + ( v )+ d  - ( u )⩾ p − q  for any arc ( u ,  v ) of  T , where  q  is a positive integer and | V |= p . Zhu, Tian, Chen and Zhang proved that if a tournament  T  satisfies the condition  O ( p ,  q ) and  p ⩾3 q +3, then  T  is arc-pancyclic. Let  S ( p ,  q ) be the set{ T =( V ,  A ):  T  is a tournament with  p  vertices and  T  satisfies the condition  O ( p ,  q )}; let  C   k  ( u ,  v ) be the set {cycles of  T  with length  k  using the arc ( u ,  v )}. The aim of this paper is that for a given integer  q , we can find an integer  m ( q ,  k ) such that if  p ⩾ m ( q ,  k ), then for any  T  ϵ  S ( p ,  q ),  T  is  k -arc-cyclic; if  p ⩽ m ( q ,  k )−1, then there exists  T   ϵ   S ( p ,  q ) such that  T  is not  k -arc-cyclic. We have found that  m ( q , 4)=5 q −7, and   m(q, 5)=⌊p     ∗   (q)⌋+1   or   ⌈p     ∗   (q)⌉+1  , where   p     ∗   (q)=(1+3      1  2    )q−(1+  4  3  ·3       1  2    )  .

86b12646217147258cf04f616e2f69265c1ed396	precipitous towers of normal filters		We prove that every tower of normal filters of height δ (δ supercompact) is precipitous assuming that each normal filter in the tower is the club filter restricted to a stationary set. We give an example to show that this assumption is necessary. We also prove that every normal filter can be generically extended to a well-founded V -ultrafilter (assuming large cardinals). In this paper we investigate towers of normal filters. These towers were first used by Woodin in [W88]. Woodin proved that if δ is a Woodin cardinal and P is the full stationary tower up to δ (P<δ) or the countable version (Q<δ) then the generic ultrapower is closed under < δ sequences (so the generic ultrapower is well-founded). We show that if P is a tower of height δ, δ supercompact, and the filters generating P are the club filter restricted to a stationary set, then P is precipitous. We give an example (assuming large cardinals) of a non-precipitous tower. We also show that every normal filter can be extended to a V -ultrafilter with well-founded ultrapower in some generic extension of V (assuming large cardinals). Similarly for any tower of inaccessible height. This is accomplished by showing that there is a stationary set that projects to the filter or the tower and then forcing with P<δ below this stationary set. An important idea in our proof of precipitousness (Theorem 6.4) has the following form in Woodin’s proof. If A〉 ⊆ P<δ are maximal antichains (i ∈ ω and δ Woodin) then there is a κ < δ such that {a ≺ Vκ+1 | |a| < κ & (∀i ∈ ω) ∃b ≺ Vκ+1 such that 1) a ⊆ b, b end extends a ∩ Vκ 2) ∃x ∈ A〉 ∩ Vκ ∩ ⌊ (⌊ ∩ ∪§ ∈ §) 	maximal set;stationary process	Douglas R.

The special case of the result is the known theorem concerning the Cartesian product of two graphs. I . I n t r o d u c t i o n We use standard terminology in graph theory. In this paper we consider finite, undirected, connected graphs without loops and multiple edges. The vertex set of a graph G is denoted by V(G) and the edge set by E(G). By a path connecting vertices xl and xn in G we mean a sequence of vertices Xl . . . . . xn (pairwise distinct with a unique possible exception ofxa and x,) from V(G) and edges [xi,xi+l] E E ( G ) f o r / = 1 . . . . . n 1 and we denote it by P(x l , x , ) . By ~(Xl,Xn) we mean the set of all shortest paths joining xj and x, in G. The shortest paths whose vertices are known we will denote as sequences of vertices. A cycle is a path with xl x , . By C, we mean a connected 2-regular graph on n vertices. I f P ( x , y ) is the sum (the difference) o f paths P(x , z ) and P(z , y ) , then we will write P ( x , y ) = P(x , z ) 4P(z , y ) . The parity of a path is meant as the parity of its length. A subset S C V(G) is called a stable set o f G if the induced subgraph on the vertex set S has no edge. A stable set S of G is called strong if it meets all maximal (with respect to the set inclusion) cliques of G. If G and all its induced subgraphs have stable strong sets, then we say that G is strongly perfect. The concept of strongly perfect graphs was introduced by Berge and Duchet in [1]. They proved * Corresponding author. 0012-365X/97/$17.00 (~) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved PH S0012-365X(96)00053-2 214 M. Kwa~nik, A. SzeleckalDiscrete Mathematics 164 (1997) 213-220 Proposition 1 (Berge and Duchet [1]). Every bipartite 9raph is stronoly perfect. Proposition 2 (Berge and Duchet [1]). I f G is stronoly perfect, then G does not have C2k+l, for each k >>.2 and C6 as induced subgraphs. From the definition of strong perfectness of a graph we have Proposition 3. I f G is strongly perfect, then all induced suboraphs o f G are strongly perfect. In [2] it was introduced the generalized Cartesian product. We recall its definition. Let GI . . . . . Gn, n>>.2 be graphs of the same order m~>2 with vertex set V(Gi) = V = {Yl, . . . ,Ym}, for i = 1 . . . . . n and let H be a graph such that V(H) = {Xl . . . . . xn}. The generalized Cartesian product of the graph H and the sequence (G1 . . . . . G~) is a graph H × (G1 . . . . . Gn) with the vertex set V(H) × V and with the edge set { [(xj, yp),(xk, yq)]; p = q and [Xj,Xk ] E E( H ) or j = k and [yp, yq] E E(Gk)}. Evidently, if G1 . . . . . G, = G, then the resulting graph is the Cartesian product G × H of two graphs G and H. In [3] the following proposition was proved: Proposition 4 (Mandrescu [3]). Let G and H be connected graphs. Then G x H is strongly perfect i f and only if both G and H are bipartite. In other words strong perfectness of the Cartesian product G x H is equivalent to the fact that G × H is bipartite. It is natural to wonder whether the assumption that H x (G1 . . . . . Gn) is bipartite guarantees strong perfectness of H x (G1 . . . . . Gn). At the beginning we prove some lemmas which will be useful further. Put G = / (2 x (G1,G2), where V(Gi) = V = {Yl . . . . . Ym} for i = 1,2 and V(K2) = {xl,x2} as in the hint. We say that (xl,yp),(x2,yq) E V(G) are vertices of the same floor or for short (xl, yp), (x2, yq) are VSF if p = q. Recall that the distance between two vertices in a graph is the length of the shortest path connecting them. Lemma 1. I f there are two paths P((xl,yp),(xl ,yq)) E ~((x l ,Yp) , (x l ,Yq)) and P((x2, Yp),(x2, Yq)) E ~((x2, Yp),(x2, Yq)) of different parity in G, then there exists a cycle C2k+l, k~>2 in G. Proof. I f there are no VSF which are internal vertices of P((xl,yp),(xl ,yq)) and P((x2, yp),(x2,Yq)), then there exists a chordless cycle C = P((xbyp) , (Xbyq) )+ P((xl, yq ), (x2, yq )) + P((x2, yq ), (x2, yp )) + P((x2, yp ), (xl, yp)) of odd length >~ 5. Assume that (xl,ys) and (x2,ys) are internal vertices of paths P((Xl,yp),(xl,yq)) and P((x2, yp), (x2, yq)), respectively, such that there are no VSF which are internal vertices of paths P( (xl, yp ), (xl, ys ) ) E ~ ( (xl, Yp ), (xl, ys ) ) and P( (x2, ye ), (x2, ys ) ) E ~ ( (x2, yp ), (x2, ys )). I f paths P( (x l, yp ), (x l, y~ )) and P( (x2, yp ), (x2, y~ )) are of different parity, then M. Kwa~nik, A.

The first draws a plane graph “convex” if possible, that is, in a way that every inner face and the complement of the outer face are convex polygons. The second, using the first, produces a pleasing drawing of a given plane graph that satisfies the following property as far as possible: the complements of 3-connected components, together with inner faces and the complement of the outer face, are convex polygons.

478d196347c144a6ed4b74c25306b1b5941604fc	covering projections of graphs preserving links of vertices and edges		Abstract   The link of a vertex υ of a graph  G  is the subgraph induced by the set of vertices of  G  adjacent to υ. If all the links of  G  are isomorphic to a given graph  H , then  G  is called locally  H , or locally homogeneous. We deal with the problem of characterization of all connected locally graphs for  H  fixed. It turns out that the problem is closely related to the theory of covering spaces. This fundamental observation is generalized and developed in Section 1 of the paper. Theoretical results from Section 1 are used for deriving of some new results on locally homogeneous graphs and reproving of some old ones. For instance, Theorem 2.7 establishes that if a graph  H  has a limited number of edges then either there is no locally  H  graph, or there are infinitely many finite connected locally  H  graphs.	vertex (geometry)	Roman Nedela	1994	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(93)E0066-D	graph power;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;triangle-free graph;universal graph;independent set;topology;graph toughness;pseudoforest;pancyclic graph;forbidden graph characterization;hypercube graph;cycle graph;clique-sum;symmetric graph;mathematics;modular decomposition;graph homomorphism;complement graph;chordal graph;line graph;neighbourhood;planar graph	Theory	33.045936591017245	27.134346181213846	82714

The study of rainbow decompositions has a long history, going back to the work of Euler on Latin squares. We discuss three problems about decomposing complete graphs into rainbow trees: the Brualdi-Hollingsworth Conjecture, Constantineu0027s Conjecture, and the Kaneko-Kano-Suzuki Conjecture. The main result which we discuss is that in every proper edge-colouring of K n there are 10 − 6 n edge-disjoint isomorphic spanning rainbow trees. This simultaneously improves the best known bounds on all these conjectures. Using our method it is also possible to show that every properly ( n − 1 )-edge-coloured K n has n / 9 edge-disjoint spanning rainbow trees, giving a further improvement on the Brualdi-Hollingsworth Conjecture.	rainbow table	Alexey Pokrovskiy;Benny Sudakov	2017	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2017.07.064	conjecture;mathematics;discrete mathematics;euler's formula;isomorphism;combinatorics;latin square;rainbow;disjoint sets;graph;complete graph	Theory	30.404529667320478	28.762325038630404	82849

A matching in G is a set of independent edges in G. A perfect matching M in G is a matching such that every vertex of G is incident to an edge of M. A set S⊆ V is a paired-dominating set of G if every vertex not in S is adjacent to a vertex in S and if the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching. The paired-domination problem is to find a paired-dominating set of G with minimum cardinality. This paper introduces a generalization of the paired-domination problem, namely, the matched-domination problem, in which some constrained vertices are in paired-dominating sets as far as they can. Further, possible applications are also presented. We then present a linear-time constructive algorithm to solve the matched-domination problem in cographs.†	algorithm;cograph;dominating set;time complexity	Ruo-Wei Hung;Chih-Chia Yao	2011	Int. J.

The cone HYP n+1 is polyhedral; one way of seeing this is that modulo image by the covariance map HYP n+1 is the union of a finite set of L-domains, i.e., of parameter space of full Delaunay tessellations. In this paper, we study this partition of the hypermetric cone into L-domains. In particular, it is proved that the cone HYP n+1 of hypermetrics on n + 1 points contains exactly 1 2 n! principal L-domains. We give a detailed description of the decomposition of HYP n+1 for n = 2, 3, 4 and a computer result for n = 5 (see Table 2).

A transitive fraternal augmentation of E G is a directed graph E H with the same vertex set, including all the arcs of E G and such that for any vertices x, y, z, 1. if (x, y) ∈ E(E G) and (x, z) ∈ E(E G) then (y, z) ∈ E(E H) or (z, y) ∈ E(E H) (fraternity); 2. if (x, y) ∈ E(E G) and (y, z) ∈ E(E G) then (x, z) ∈ E(E H) (transitivity). In this paper, we explore some generalization of the transitive fraternal augmentations for directed graphs and its applications. In particular, we show that the 2-coloring number col2(G) ≤ O(∇1(G)∇0(G)), where ∇k(G) (k ≥ 0) denotes the greatest reduced average density with depth k of a graph G; we give a constructive proof that ∇k(G) bounds the distance (k+ 1)-coloring number colk+1 (G) with a function f (∇k(G)). On the other hand, ∇k(G) ≤ (col2k+1 (G))2k+1. We also show that an inductive generalization of transitive fraternal augmentations can be used to study nonrepetitive colorings of graphs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

f03c149557e2dffd0d80244d2b9ea08b30550352	cycles through a given arc in certain almost regular multipartite tournaments		If x is a vertex of a digraph D, then we denote by d(x) and d−(x) the outdegree and the indegree of x, respectively. The global irregularity of a digraph D is defined by ig(D) = max{d+(x), d−(x)}−min{d+(y), d−(y)} over all vertices x and y of D (including x = y). If ig(D) = 0, then D is regular and if ig(D) ≤ 1, then D is almost regular. A c-partite tournament is an orientation of a complete c-partite graph. In 1998, Y. Guo showed, if every arc of a regular c-partite tournament is contained in a directed cycle of length three, then every arc belongs to a directed cycle of length n for each n ∈ {4, 5, . . . , c}. In this paper we present the following generalization of Guo’s result for n ≥ 6. Let V1, V2, . . . , Vc be the partite sets of an almost regular c-partite tournament. If c ≥ 6 and |V1| = |V2| = . . . = |Vc| ≥ 2, then every arc of D is contained in a directed cycle of length n for each n ∈ {4, 5, . . . , c}. 1. Terminology and introduction In this paper all digraphs are finite without loops or multiple arcs. The vertex set and arc set of a digraph D is denoted by V (D) and E(D), respectively. If xy is an arc of a digraph D, then we write x → y and say x dominates y, and if X and Y are two disjoint vertex sets or subdigraphs of D such that every vertex of X dominates every vertex of Y , then we say that X dominates Y , denoted by X → Y . Furthermore, X Y denotes the fact that there is no arc leading from Y to X . For the number of arcs from X to Y we write d(X, Y ). If D is a digraph, then the out-neighborhood N D (x) = N (x) of a vertex x is the set of vertices dominated by x, and the in-neighborhood N− D (x) = N −(x) is the set of vertices dominating x. The numbers dD(x) = d (x) = |N+(x)| and dD(x) = d−(x) = |N−(x)| are called the outdegree and indegree of x, respectively. For a vertex set X of D, we define D[X ] as Australasian Journal of Combinatorics 26(2002), pp.121–133 the subdigraph induced by X . If we speak of a cycle, then we mean a directed cycle, and a cycle of length m is called an m-cycle. If we replace in a digraph D every arc xy by yx, then we call the resulting digraph the converse of D, denoted by D−1. There are several measures of how much a digraph differs from being regular. In [7], Yeo defines the global irregularity of a digraph D by ig(D) = max{d+(x), d−(x)} − min{d+(y), d−(y)} over all vertices x and y of D (including x = y). If ig(D) = 0, then D is regular and if ig(D) ≤ 1, then D is called almost regular. A c-partite or multipartite tournament is an orientation of a complete c-partite graph. A tournament is a c-partite tournament with exactly c vertices. If V1, V2, . . . , Vc are the partite sets of a c-partite tournament D and the vertex x of D belongs to the partite set Vi, then we define V (x) = Vi. It is very easy to see that every arc of a regular tournament belongs to a 3-cycle. The next example shows that this is not valid for regular multipartite tournaments in general. Example 1.1 Let C, C ′ and C ′′ be three induced cycles of length 4 such that C → C ′ → C ′′ → C. The resulting 6-partite tournament D1 is 5-regular, but no arc of the three cycles C, C ′, and C ′′ is contained in a 3-cycle. Let H, H1, and H2 be three copies of D1 such that that H → H1 → H2 → H. The resulting 18-partite partite tournament is 17-regular, but no arc of the cycles corresponding to the cycles C, C ′, and C ′′ is contained in a 3-cycle. If we continue this process, we arrive at regular c-partite tournaments with arbitrary large c which contain arcs that do not belong to any 3-cycle. However, recently the author [5] showed that every arc of a regular c-partite tournament belongs to a 4-cycle, when c ≥ 6. We even proved the following more general result. Theorem 1.2 (Volkmann [5]) Let V1, V2, . . . , Vc be the partite sets of an almost regular c-partite tournament D. If |V1| = |V2| = . . . = |Vc| = r and c ≥ 6, then every arc of D is contained in a 4-cycle. The condition c ≥ 6 in Theorem 1.2 is in the following sense best possible. There exist 4and 5-partite regular tournaments with r ≥ 2 which contain arcs that do not belong to any 4-cycle. In 1998, Y. Guo [2] proved the following generalization of Alspach’s classical result [1] that every regular tournament is arc pancyclic. Theorem 1.3 (Guo [2]) Let D be a regular c-partite tournament with c ≥ 3. If every arc of D is contained in a 3-cycle, then every arc of D is contained in an	arcs (computing);australasian conference on information systems;cycle (graph theory);degree (graph theory);directed graph;dominator (graph theory);edge dominating set;emoticon;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Lutz Volkmann	2002	Australasian J.

In this paper we propose a novel way of looking at problems related to clique graphs by using set families and operators. Many known results in the area can be rewritten in this new language. In addition, this approach permits the identification of the relevant properties of the graphs and families that make the theorems work, allowing in some cases immediate generalization. To exemplify, we show how a recent polynomial time recognition result for a class of clique graphs can be rewritten and applied to other related classes.

We examine the maximal cardinality α(d) of a d-dimensional acute set. The exact value of α(d) is known only for d ≤ 3. For each d ≥ 4 we improve on the best known lower bound for α(d). We present different approaches. On one hand, we give a probabilistic proof that α(d) > c · 1.2d. (This improves a random construction given by Erdős and Füredi.) On the other hand, we give an almost exponential constructive example which outdoes the random construction in low dimension (d ≤ 250). Both approaches use the small dimensional examples that we found partly by hand (d = 4, 5), partly by computer (6 ≤ d ≤ 10). We also investigate the following variant of the above problem: what is the maximal size κ(d) of a d-dimensional cubic acute set (that is, an acute set contained in the vertex set of a d-dimensional hypercube). We give an almost exponential constructive lower bound, and we improve on the best known upper bound. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 05D40, 51M16.	cubic function;erdős number;mathematics subject classification;maximal set;time complexity	Viktor Harangi	2011	SIAM J.

By a diagonal point of S we mean a point p off S with the property that at least two lines through p intersect S in two points. The number of diagonal points is called the type of S. For example, a 4-gon has at most three diagonal points. We call an n-gon euclidean if (roughly speaking) it contains the maximal possible number of 4-gons of type 3. In this paper, we characterize all finite linear spaces in which, for a fixed number n ~> 5, any n-gon is euclidean.

a27617c1a184cfa337c215fee0a79f9f3636d36d	probabilistic infinite secret sharing		The study of probabilistic secret sharing schemes using arbitrary probability spaces and possibly infinite number of participants lets us investigate abstract properties of such schemes. It highlights important properties, explains why certain definitions work better than others, connects this topic to other branches of mathematics, and might yield new design paradigms. A probabilistic secret sharing scheme is a joint probability distribution of the shares and the secret together with a collection of secret recovery functions for qualified subsets. The scheme is measurable if the recovery functions are measurable. Depending on how much information an unqualified subset might have, we define four scheme types: perfect, almost perfect, ramp, and almost ramp. Our main results characterize the access structures which can be realized by schemes of these types. We show that every access structure can be realized by a non-measurable perfect probabilistic scheme. The construction is based on a paradoxical pair of independent random variables which determine each other. For measurable schemes we have the following complete characterization. An access structure can be realized by a (measurable) perfect, or almost perfect scheme if and only if the access structure, as a subset of the Sierpiński space {0, 1} , is open, if and only if it can be realized by a span program. The access structure can be realized by a (measurable) ramp or almost ramp scheme if and only if the access structure is a Gδ set (intersection of countably many open sets) in the Sierpiński topology, if and only if it can be realized by a Hilbert-space program.	access structure;hilbert space;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;secret sharing	László Csirmaz	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	37.58926913766616	28.096853647028315	83894

Given a graph H , we determine, asymptotically, the Ore-type degree condition which ensures that a graph G has a perfect H-packing. More precisely, let δOre(H, n) be the smallest number k such that every graph G whose order n is divisible by |H | and with d(x) + d(y) ≥ k for all non-adjacent x 6= y ∈ V (G) contains a perfect H-packing.

As exact solutions for these problems are usually out of reach (unless d = 1), one is forced to deal with approximations. Here we mostly consider online algorithms, as the online setting introduces additional difficulty due to uncertainty about the future.

We define a set Stabex( F , v ) associated with a graph  F  and a vertex  v ∈ V ( F ). Let  F  be a minimal forbidden induced subgraph for an  α -polynomial hereditary class   P  . It is shown that if we change  F  with Stabex( F , v ) in the list of forbidden induced subgraphs for   P  , then we obtain an  α -polynomial extension of   P  .  We obtain a generalization of Sbihi’s theorem [Discrete Math. 28(3) (1980) 53] on the stability number problem in claw-free graphs. Also, a recent result of Lozin [Eur. J. Oper. Res. 125 (2000) 292] on stability in ( P  5 , P )-free graphs is a corollary of our result.	hereditary property;polynomial	Igor E.

A graph is projective planar if it can be drawn on the projective plane with no crossing edges. A linear time algorithm for projective planar embedding has been described by Mohar 20]. We provide a new approach that takes O(n 2) time is but much easier to implement. 1 Description of the problem A graph G consists of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, each of which is associated with an unordered pair of vertices from V. Throughout this paper, n denotes the number of vertices of a graph, and m is the number of edges. A graph is embeddable on a surface M if it can be drawn on M without crossing edges. A graph can be used to model many things. Some examples with applications in computer science include modelling program structure, networks, or how documents on the web are linked together using hyperlinks. A graph visualization tool can help researchers to better understand the structure of such things. Usually, it is best to avoid having many crossing edges as this can complicate the picture of a graph. Algorithms for embedding graphs on surfaces are often used to help get a nice picture of a graph. A graph is planar if it can be embedded on the plane. A planar embedding of a graph is a description of how it can be embedded in the plane. A graph and one planar embedding of it are pictured in Figure 1. A planar embedding is commonly represented by giving the clockwise order of the neighbours of each vertex (the combinatorial embedding). This paper is concerned with combinatorial embeddings. The aesthetic issues of where to place the vertices and edges are discussed in a wide body of literature including the recent book 2]. It is well-known that a planar graph without loops or multiple edges has at most 3n ? 6 edges. Thus in discussing time complexities for algorithms, linear time should be interpreted as time in O(n). Often an algorithm which is the fastest in theory can be very complex. This makes it diicult to program. Further, when a program is developed, it is not that easy to determine whether the code is working correctly. Hence, algorithms which are simpler but possibly slower can be valuable from a programmer's perspective.

Suppose that we are given for each cell z ∈ S the probability pz that a query point lies in z. The entropy H of the resulting discrete probability distribution is a lower bound on the expected-case query time. Further it is known that it is possible to construct a data structure that answers point-location queries in H + 2 √ 2H + o( √ H) expected number of comparisons. A fundamental question is how close to the entropy lower bound H the exact optimal expected query time can reach. In this paper we show that there exists a query distibution Q over S such that even when we are given complete information on Q, the optimal expected query time must be at least H + Ω( √ H), which differs just by a constant factor in the second order term from the best known upper bound.	data structure;planar straight-line graph;point location;preprocessor;subdivision surface	Theocharis Malamatos	2005	Comput.

In the notation of (0,1)-matrices, we consider a (0,1)-matrix F (the forbidden configuration), an m × n (0,1)-matrix A with no repeated columns which has no submatrix which is a row and column permutation of F , and seek bounds on n in terms of m and F . We give new exact bounds for some 2× l forbidden configurations and some asymptotically exact bounds for some other 2× l forbidden configurations. We frequently employ graph theory and in one case develop a new vertex ordering for directed graphs that generalizes Rédei’s Theorem for Tournaments. One can now imagine that exact bounds could be available for all 2 × l forbidden configurations. Some progress is reported for 3 × l forbidden configurations. These bounds are improvements of the general bounds obtained by Sauer, Perles and Shelah, Vapnik and Chervonenkis. ∗Research supported in part by NSERC †Research supported in part by NSERC ‡This research was done while the third author visited the University of British Columbia supported by the first author’s NSERC grant.

It is also proved that every n-element sequential matroid N is representable over all fields with at least n − 1 elements. Moreover, it is shown that there is an attractive family of self-dual sequential 3-connected matroids such that N is a minor of some member of this family.	corank;uniform matroid	Brian Beavers;James G.

We present a k-uniform hypergraph property with sensitivity complexity O(ndk/3e) for any k ≥ 3, where n is the number of vertices. Moreover, we can do better when k ≡ 1 (mod 3) by presenting a kuniform hypergraph property with sensitivity O(ndk/3e−1/2). This result disproves a conjecture of Babai [9], which conjectures that the sensitivity complexity of k-uniform hypergraph properties is at least Ω(nk/2). We also investigate the sensitivity complexity of other weakly symmetric functions and show that for many classes of transitive-invariant Boolean functions the minimum achievable sensitivity complexity can be O(N1/3), where N is the number of variables. Finally, we give a lower bound for sensitivity of k-uniform hypergraph properties, which implies the sensitivity conjecture of k-uniform hypergraph properties for any constant k. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.1.3 Complexity Measures and Classes		Qian Li;Xiaoming Sun	2017		10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2017.51	boolean function;conjecture;hypergraph;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematics;vertex (geometry);upper and lower bounds;symmetric function	Theory	32.119790626966164	28.864448065720662	84959

Bloxorz features switches that open and close trapdoors. The puzzle is to move the block from its initial position to an upright position on the destination square. We show that the problem of deciding whether a given Bloxorz level is solvable is PSPACE-complete and that this remains so even when all trapdoors are initially closed or all trapdoors are initially open. We also answer an open question of Viglietta [5], showing that 2buttons are sufficient for PSPACE-hardness of general puzzle games. We also examine the hardness of some variants of Bloxorz, including variants where the block is a 1 by 1 by 1 cube, and variants with single-use tiles.	complexity;decision problem;edmund m. clarke;np-completeness;np-hardness;nested context language;network switch;pspace;pspace-complete;quantifier (logic);screenshot;universal quantification	Tom C. van der Zanden;Hans L.

We prove that graphic n-tuples π1 and π2 pack if ∆ ≤ √ 2δn− (δ − 1), where ∆ and δ denote the largest and smallest entries in π1 + π2 (strict inequality when δ = 1); also, the bound is sharp. Kundu and Lovász independently proved that a graphic n-tuple π is realized by a graph with a k-factor if the n-tuple obtained by subtracting k from each entry of π is graphic; for even n we conjecture that in fact some realization has k edge-disjoint 1-factors. We prove the conjecture in the case where the largest entry of π is at most n/2 + 1 and also when k ≤ 3.	graph (discrete mathematics);graph factorization;set packing;social inequality;monotone	Arthur H.

With the aid of those basic properties of nowhere-zero 4-flow and the result about 5-cycle double cover, we are able to prove that each 2-edge-connected graph with one edge short of admitting a nowhere-zero 4-flow has a 5-cycle double cover which is a generalization of a theorem due to Huck and Kochol (JCTB, 1995) for cubic graphs.

We adopt the concept of σ-quasi elimination orders, introduced by Akcoglu et al. [?], generalizing the perfect elimination orders for chordal graphs, and develop a simple O(σ)-approximation technique for graphs admitting such a vertex order.

We also present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the DS-k problem on unit disk graphs using the shifting technique.	approximation algorithm;claw-free graph;claw-free permutation;graph (discrete mathematics);line graph;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme	Danny Ziyi Chen;Rudolf Fleischer;Jian Li	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18318-8_8	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;block graph;pathwidth;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;interval graph;graph product;longest path problem;dense graph;clique problem;metric dimension;permutation graph;clique-sum;trapezoid graph;mathematics;geometry;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;treewidth;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	25.936661599044218	25.85089755541988	85319

The conic polygon has two degenerate or special cases: the linear polygon and the circular-arc polygon. The natural problem–Boolean operations on linear polygons–has been extensively studied. Surprisingly, (almost) no article focuses on the problem of Boolean operations on circular-arc polygons, yet this potentially has many applications. This implies that if there is a targeted solution for Boolean operations on circular-arc polygons, it should be favourable for potential users. In this article, we close the gap by devising a concise data structure and then developing a targeted algorithm called Re2l. Our method is simple, easy-to-implement, but without loss of efficiency. Given two circular-arc polygons with mm and nn edges respectively, our method runs in O(m+n+(l+k)logl)O(m+n+(l+k)logl) time, using O(m+n+k)O(m+n+k) space, where kk is the number of intersections, and ll is the number of related edges (defined in Section  5). Our algorithm has the power to approximate to linear complexity when kk and ll are small. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is also validated through empirical study. In particular, our method is of independent interest and we show that it can be easily extended to compute Boolean operations of other types of polygons.	boolean algebra;output-sensitive algorithm	Zhi-Jie Wang;Xiao Lin;Mei-e Fang;Bin Yao;Yong Peng;Haibing Guan;Minyi Guo	2017	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2016.07.004	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;point in polygon;boolean operations on polygons;rectilinear polygon;star-shaped polygon;polygon;boolean operations in computer-aided design;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	EDA	29.87909072262308	20.614950235817034	85553

The algorithm has three aspects: (1) the number of navigation steps does not exceed 15 (independent of the linkage), (2) each step is a disguised flex of a quadrilateral from one triangular configuration to another, which is a well understood type of flexes, and (3) each step can be performed in a mechanical way.	approximation algorithm;line graph;linkage (software);motion planning	Gaiane Panina;Dirk Siersma	2018	J.

This paper reports the first results known that give worst-case performance bounds for an approximation algorithm for this problem. It is proved that partitioning the polygon into rectangles (with no overlapping) produces at most $2\theta + h - 1$ rectangles, where $\theta $ is the minimum number of rectangles in a cover, and h is the number of holes. Examples are also given in which this bound is tight. The proof is based on counting arguments, and on Euler’s formula for a planar graph. This paper shows that extending rectangles vertically and deleting duplicates produces at most $O(\theta \log \theta )$ rectangles. For the proof, geometric constraints are used to construct a large an-tirectangle, a set of points with no two contained in the same rectangle.

Here we deal with the problem of determining the maximum number of planar Euclidean embeddings as a function of the number of the vertices. We obtain polynomial systems which totally capture the structure of a given graph, by exploiting distance geometry theory. Consequently, counting the number of Euclidean embeddings of a given rigid graph, reduces to the problem of counting roots of the corresponding polynomial system.	embedded system;modulo operation;system of polynomial equations	Ioannis Z.

We give a classification of G -symmetric graphs Γ with V ( Γ ) admitting a nontrivial G -invariant partition B such that there is exactly one edge of Γ between any two distinct blocks of B . This is achieved by giving a classification of ( G , 2 ) -point-transitive and G -block-transitive designs D together with G -orbits Ω on the flag set of D such that G σ , L is transitive on L ∖ { σ } and L ∩ N = { σ } for distinct ( σ , L ) , ( σ , N ) ∈ Ω , where G σ , L is the setwise stabilizer of L in the stabilizer G σ of σ in G . Along the way we determine all imprimitive blocks of G σ on V ∖ { σ } for every 2-transitive group G on a set V , where σ ∈ V .		Teng Fang;Xin Gui Fang;Binzhou Xia;Sanming Zhou	2017	J. Comb.

This is nearly tight, as there are plane graphs where all faces are incident  to at least g vertices and that admit no vertex coloring of this type with more than ⌊(3g+1)/4⌋ colors. We further show that the problem of determining whether a plane graph admits a vertex coloring by k colors in which all colors appear in every face is in ℘ for k=2 and is     -complete for k=3,4. We refine this result for polychromatic 3-colorings restricted to 2-connected graphs which have face sizes from a prescribed  (possibly infinite) set of integers. Thereby we find an almost complete characterization of these sets of integers (face sizes)  for which the corresponding decision problem is in ℘, and for the others it is     -complete.

An H-minor is a minor isomorphic to H. The Hadwiger number of G, denoted by h(G), is the maximum integer t such that G contains a Kt-minor, where Kt is the complete graph with t vertices. Hadwiger [8] conjectured that every graph that is not (t−1)-colourable contains a Kt-minor; that is, h(G) ≥ χ(G) for every graph G, where χ(G) is the chromatic number of G. Hadwiger’s conjecture is widely believed to be one of the most difficult and beautiful problems in graph theory. It has been proved [11] for graphs with χ(G) ≤ 6, and is open for graphs with χ(G) ≥ 7. It has also been proved for certain special classes of graphs, including powers of cycles and their complements [9], proper circular arc graphs [2], line graphs [10], quasi-line graphs [6] and 3-arc graphs [7]. See [13] for a survey. A strengthening of Hadwiger’s conjecture due to Hajós asserts that every graph G with χ(G) ≥ t contains a subdivision of Kt. Catlin [4] proved that Hajós’ conjecture fails for every t ≥ 7. Obviously, if Hadwiger’s conjecture is false, then counterexamples must be found among counterexamples to Hajós’ conjecture. In [12] Thomassen presented several new classes of counterexamples to Hajós’ conjecture, including the complements of the Kneser graphs K(3k− 1, k) for sufficiently large k. (The Kneser graph K(n, k) is the graph with vertices the k-subsets of an n-set such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding k-subsets are disjoint.) He wrote [12] that ‘it does not seem obvious’ that these classes all satisfy Hadwiger’s conjecture. Motivated by this comment, we prove in this paper that indeed the complement of every Kneser graph satisfies Hadwiger’s conjecture. We notice that in the special case when k divides n this was established in [9].	carsten thomassen;edge contraction;erdős–faber–lovász conjecture;graph coloring;graph isomorphism;graph minor;graph theory;hadwiger number;line graph;subdivision surface;vertex (geometry)	Guangjun Xu;Sanming Zhou	2017	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.22007	outerplanar graph;kneser graph;graph power;petersen graph;apex graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;universal graph;topology;null graph;edge coloring;cubic graph;graph coloring;symmetric graph;graph factorization;mathematics;voltage graph;butterfly graph;vertex-transitive graph;crossing number;graph minor;line graph;coxeter graph	Theory	30.994123212612177	27.240764580694723	86091

Our result is tight; we prove that for any graph H that is a supergraph of P 1+P 5 with at least 5 edges, already List 5-Coloring is NP-complete for graphs with no induced H.	arboricity;color;graph coloring;list coloring;np-completeness;neighbourhood (graph theory);polynomial;the c programming language;time complexity	Jean-François Couturier;Petr A.

Let   G  =  (  V  ,  E  )   be a vertex transitive graph, let   A  ⊆  V   be finite with   |  A  |  ⩽    |  V  |   2    set   k  =  |  {  v  ∈  V  \  A  :  u  ∼  v   for some   u  ∈  A  }  |  . We show that whenever the diameter of  G  is at least   31    (  k  +  1  )   2   , either   |  A  |  ⩽  2   k  3   , or  G  has a (bounded) ring-like structure and  A  is efficiently contained in an interval. This theorem has applications to the study of product sets and expansion in groups.	isogonal figure;vertex-transitive graph	Matt DeVos;Bojan Mohar	2006	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2006.06.042	transitive reduction;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;vertex;cayley graph;symmetric graph;mathematics;isoperimetric inequality;group theory;vertex-transitive graph;bound graph;neighbourhood	Theory	31.228653113471044	31.74361165357468	86257

The normal subgroups of the symmetric group S, of all permutations of A were determined by Schreier and Ulam ([ 141, for countable A) and by Baer ([ 11, for arbitrary A). They form a chain, consisting of the subgroups S; of permutations moving less than &, elements, the alternating group alt,-a subgroup of index 2 of the group of finitary permutations S&and the trivial group { lA}. (2) One consequence is that if A is countable, no proper normal subgroup of S, contains a permutation moving infinitely many elements. Now S, (as well as its normal subgroups) satisfies the group-theoretical condition:	thomas m. baer	Gadi Moran	1982	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

Bansal, A. Blum, S. Chawla, Correlation Clustering, in: Proc. 43rd Symp. Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS, 2002, pp. 238–247] as a model for clustering data when a binary relationship between data points is known. More precisely, for each pair of points we have two scores measuring the similarity and dissimilarity respectively, of the two points, and we would like to compute an optimal partition where the value of a partition is obtained by summing up the similarity scores of pairs involving points from the same cluster and the dissimilarity scores of pairs involving points from different clusters. A closely related problem is Consensus Clustering, where we are given a set of partitions and we would like to obtain a partition that best summarizes the input partitions. The latter problem is a restricted case of Correlation Clustering. In this paper we prove that Minimum Consensus Clustering is APX-hard even for three input partitions, answering an open question in the literature, while Maximum Consensus Clustering admits a PTAS. We exhibit a combinatorial and practical 5 -approximation algorithm based on a greedy technique for Maximum Consensus Clustering on three partitions. Moreover, we prove that a PTAS exists for Maximum Correlation Clustering when the maximum ratio between two scores is at most a constant. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Let F be a finite set of 2-connected graphs, and let C be the class of graphs with no minor from F . We prove that if C has a maximum, then any maximum of C must be homomorphically equivalent to a complete graph. This is a special case of a conjecture of J. Nešetřil and P.

Such collections arise, for example, in evolutionary studies. Split networks can be viewed as a generalization of phylogenetic trees and may be generated using the SplitsTree package. Recently, the NeighborNet method for generating split networks has become rather popular, in part because it is guaranteed to always generate a circular split system, which can always be displayed by a planar split network. Even so, labels must be placed on the """"outside” of the network, which might be problematic in some applications. To help circumvent this problem, it can be helpful to consider so-called flat split systems, which can be displayed by planar split networks where labels are allowed on the inside of the network too. Here, we present a new algorithm that is guaranteed to compute a minimal planar split network displaying a flat split system in polynomial time, provided the split system is given in a certain format. We will also briefly discuss two heuristics that could be useful for analyzing phylogeographic data and that allow the computation of flat split systems in this format in polynomial time."""	algorithm;collections (publication);computation;generalization (psychology);heuristics;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;polynomial;split networks;splitstree;time complexity;trees (plant)	Andreas Spillner;Binh Thai Nguyen;Vincent Moulton	2012	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics	10.1109/TCBB.2011.115	time complexity;biology;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;phylogenetic tree;computer science;bioinformatics;theoretical computer science;euclidean distance;mathematics;tree;split;genetics;algorithm;polynomial;phylogenetics	Comp.	26.02410096089859	22.757990000071423	86801

The Isolation Lemma states that giving a random weight assignment to the edges of a graph ensures that it has a unique minimum weight perfect matching, with a good probability.

Such a construction was known previously for planar bipartite graphs. Our result implies that the perfect matching problem for K3,3-free and K5-free bipartite graphs is in SPL.

Let H0 be the graph obtained from a 5-cycle by adding a new vertex and joining it to two nonadjacent vertices of the 5-cycle.

6e59fe454c1d188a008365781566132dc213fd4d	a characterization by optimization of the monge point of a tetrahedron		“... nihil omnino in mundo contingint, in quo non maximi minimive ratio quapiam eluceat”, translated into “... nothing in all the world will occur in which no maximum or minimum rule is somehow shining forth”, used to say L.Euler in 1744. This is confirmed by numerous applications of mathematics in physics, mechanics, economy, etc. In this note, we show that it is also the case for the classical “centers” of a tetrahedron, more specifically for the so-called Monge point (the substitute of the notion of orthocenter for a tetrahedron). To the best of our knowledge, the characterization of the Monge point of a tetrahedron by optimization, that we are going to present, is new. 1. To begin with... What kind of tetrahedron? Let T = ABCD be a tetrahedron in the three dimensional space R(equipped with the usual Euclidean and affine structures); the points A,B,C,D are supposed not to lie in a plane, of course. We begin with two particular types of tetrahedra and, then, with increase in generality, we can classify the tetrahedra into several classes. Here they are: The regular tetrahedron. This tetrahedron enjoys so many symmetries that it is not very interesting from the optimization viewpoint: all the “centers” usually associated with a tetrahedron (and that we are going to visit again in the next paragraph) coincide. The trirectangular tetrahedra. They are generalizations to the space of rectangular triangles in the plane. A trirectangular tetrahedron OABC has (two by two) three perpendicular faces OBC,OAB,OAC and a “hypothenuse-face” ABC; such a tetrahedron enjoys a remarkable relationship between areas of its faces (see [1]); its vertex O, opposite the hypothenuse-face, is the orthocenter and Monge point, as we shall see below. The orthocentric tetrahedra. Curiously enough, the four altitudes of a tetrahedron generally do not meet at a point; when this happens, the tetrahedron is called orthocentric. A common characterization of orthocentric tetrahedra is as follows: a tetrahedron is orthocentric if and only if the opposite edges (two by two) are orthogonal. This class of tetrahedra is by far the most studied one in the literature. Regular and trirectangular tetrahedra are indeed orthocentric. General tetrahedra. Like for triangles, three specific “centers” can be defined for any tetrahedron: the centroid or isobarycenter, the incenter and the circumcenter. We shall see their characterization by optimization, as for some other points, in the next section. As said before, the altitudes do not necessarily meet at a point; moreover, the projection of any vertex on the opposite face does not necessarily coincide with the orthocenter of this face. The notion of orthocenter will be held by a new point: the so-called Monge point.	abcd schema;goursat tetrahedron;marching tetrahedra;mathematical optimization;object action complex;orthocentric tetrahedron;trirectangular tetrahedron	Nicolas Hadjisavvas;Jean-Baptiste Hiriart-Urruty;Pierre-Jean Laurent	2016	J.

Cotriangulated graphs form a natural subclass of the class of strongly perfect graphs, and they are also characterized in terms of the shellability of some associated collection of sets. Finally, the notion of stability function of a graph is introduced, and it is proved that a graph is triangulated if and only if the polynomial representing its stability function has all its coefficients equal to 0, +1 or -1.	coefficient;graph (discrete mathematics);like button;polygon triangulation;polynomial;random graph	Claude Benzaken;Yves Crama;Pierre Duchet;Peter L.

Then M is an alignment of V if and only if M is closed under taking intersections and contains both V and the empty set. If M is an alignment of V , then the elements of M are called convex sets and the pair (V,M) is called an alignment or a convexity. If S ⊆ V , then the convex hull of S is the smallest convex set that contains S. Suppose X ∈ M. Then x ∈ X is an extreme point for X if X \ {x} ∈ M. A convex geometry on a finite set is an aligned space with the additional property that every convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points. Let G = (V,E) be a connected graph and U a set of vertices of G. A subgraph T of G containing U is a minimal U -tree if T is a tree and if every vertex of V (T ) \U is a cut-vertex of the subgraph induced by V (T ). The monophonic interval of U is the collection of all vertices of G that belong to some minimal U -tree. Several graph convexities are defined using minimal U -trees and structural characterizations of graph classes for which the corresponding collection of convex sets is a convex geometry are characterized.	biconnected component;connectivity (graph theory);convex function;convex hull;convex set;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	José Cáceres;Ortrud R.

In other words, given lR, we provide the value N(l) of the maximal cardinality of the digital cover of a rectifiable curve of length l. The optimal curves are polygonal curves with integer vertices, 0, 1 or 2 vertical or horizontal steps and an arbitrary number of diagonal steps. We also report the properties of the staircase function N(l), which is affinely periodic in the sense that N(l+2)=N(l)+3 and a bound N(l)4+32l.Our second aim is to look at the restricted class of closed curves and offer some conjectures on the maximum number Nclosed(l) of pixels that a closed curve of length l can cross.This work finds its application in the quadtree complexity theorem. This well-known result bounds the number of quads with a shape of perimeter p by 16q11+16p. However, this linear bound is not tight. From our new upper bound Nclosed(l)N(l)4+32l we derive a new improved multiresolution complexity theorem: Number(quads)16q11+62p. Lastly, we show that this new bound is tight up to a maximal error of 16(q1).		Yan Gérard;Antoine Vacavant;Jean-Marie Favreau	2016	Theor. Comput.

1dcdbcbce4713829f1a0b6e811fb0f6742d40bb6	on co-regular signed graphs		A graph whose edges are labeled either as positive or negative is called a signed graph. A signed graph is said to be net-regular if every vertex has constant net-degree k, namely, the difference between the number of positive and negative edges incident with a vertex. In this paper, we analyze some properties of co-regular signed graphs which are net-regular signed graphs with the underlying graphs being regular. An r-regular graph G is said to be co-regularizable with the co-regularity pair (r, k) if we can find a signed graph Σ of net-degree k with the underlying graph G. Net(G) is the set of all possible values of net-degree k, such that G is co-regularizable with the co-regularity pair (r, k); we find Net(G) for some special classes of graphs. Also we establish a connection between co-regularizability of G and its graph factors. An algorithm for producing a co-regular signed Harary graph, of which the co-regular signed graph on the complete graph Kn is a particular example, is included. We also establish the fact that every signed graph can be embedded as an induced subgraph of a net-regular or co-regular signed graph. S.K. HAMEED ET AL. /AUSTRALAS. J.

Let M(m, s;n, t) be the number of m × n matrices over {0, 1, 2, . . . } with each row summing to s and each column summing to t. Equivalently, M(m, s;n, t) counts 2-way contingency tables of order m× n such that the row marginal sums are all s and the column marginal sums are all t. A third equivalent description is that M(m, s;n, t) is the number of semiregular labelled bipartite multigraphs with m vertices of degree s and n vertices of degree t. When m = n and s = t such matrices are also referred to as n × n magic or semimagic squares with line sums equal to t. We prove a precise asymptotic formula for M(m, s;n, t) which is valid over a range of (m, s;n, t) in which m,n → ∞ while remaining approximately equal and the average entry is not too small. This range includes the case where m/n, n/m, s/n and t/m are bounded from below.	approximation;contingency table;marginal model;multigraph;symmetric multiprocessing;vertex (geometry)	E.

In this paper, we study similar optimization problems and obtain the connection to maximum cliques for {s, r}-hypergraphs and {p, s, r}-hypergraphs, which can be applied to obtain upper bounds on the Turan densities of the complete {s, r}-hypergraphs and {p, s, r}-hypergraphs.

In this note we introduce a graph, called the m-chain graph of a poset, that reduces to the covering graph when m = 1. Since we will show how to construct the m-chain graph for m > 2 as the 2-chain graph of another poset, we are concerned primarily with 2-chain graphs. Utilizing the line diagraph of the oriented covering graph of a poset, we characterize the 2-chain graphs of posets whose covering graphs are trees.	covering graph;graph (discrete mathematics);mixed graph	Jenö Lehel;Fred R.

Some recent work of H3 aggkvist and Scott (see Arithmetic progressions of cycles in graphs, preprint), whilst proving this, also shows that minimum degree 500k guarantees the existence of cycles whose lengths are m;m+2; m+4; : : : ; m+2k for some m—an arithmetic progression of cycles. In like vein, we prove that an outer-planar graph of order n, with bounded internal face size, and outer face a cycle, must contain a sequence of cycles whose lengths form an arithmetic progression of length exp((c log n)1=3− log log n). Using this we give an answer for outer-planar graphs to a question of Erdős concerning the number of di1erent sets which can be achieved as cycle spectra. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The conditional matching preclusion number of an even graph G, denoted by mp1(G), is the minimum number of edges whose deletion leaves the resulting graph with neither perfect matchings nor isolated vertices. The class of (n, k)-star graphs is a popular class of interconnection networks for which the matching preclusion number and the classification of the corresponding optimal solutions were known. However, the conditional version of this problem was open. In this paper, we determine the conditional matching preclusion for (n, k)-star graphs as well as classify the corresponding optimal solutions via several new results. In addition, an alternate proof of the results on the matching preclusion problem will also be given.	hamiltonian path;hoc (programming language);id-wsf;interconnection;matching preclusion;nl (complexity);numerical aperture;pa-risc;stellar classification	Eddie Cheng;László Lipták	2013	Parallel Processing Letters	10.1142/S0129626413500047	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	26.921209390814862	27.65839964604066	88447

One may weaken the condition by requiring that for every set in F , all but at most k of its pairwise intersections have size λ. We call such families k-almost λ-Fisher. Vu was the first to study the maximum size of such families, proving that for k = 1 the largest family has 2n− 2 sets, and characterising when equality is attained. We substantially refine his result, showing how the size of the maximum family depends on λ. In particular we prove that for small λ one essentially recovers Fisher’s bound. We also solve the next open case of k = 2 and obtain the first non-trivial upper bound for general k.	social inequality	Shagnik Das;Benny Sudakov;Pedro Vieira	2015	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2015.06.040	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;designtheory;extremal combinatorics;algebra	Theory	37.805132458911636	26.5616181326573	88534

This problem arises in VLSI placement and chip design. Motivated by these applications, we consider a generalization of d-dimAP, where the positions of some of the vertices (pins) is fixed and specified as part of the input. We are asked to extend this partial map to a map of all the vertices, again minimizing the weighted stretch of edges. This generalization, which we refer to as d-dimAP+, arises naturally in these application domains (since it can capture blocked-off parts of the board, or the requirement of power-carrying pins to be in certain locations, etc.). Perhaps surprisingly, very little is known about this problem from an approximation viewpoint. For dimension d = 2, we obtain an O(k · log n)-approximation algorithm, based on a strengthening of the spreading-metric LP for 2-dimAP. The integrality gap for this LP is shown to be Ω(k). We also show that it is NP-hard to approximate 2-dimAP+ within a factor better than Ω(k1/4−ε). We also consider a (conceptually harder, but practically even more interesting) variant of 2-dimAP+, where the target space is the grid Zn ×Zn, instead of the entire integer lattice Z. For this problem, we obtain a O(k · log n)-approximation using the same LP relaxation. We complement this upper bound by showing an integrality gap of Ω(k), and an Ω(k1/2−ε)-inapproximability result. Our results naturally extend to the case of arbitrary fixed target dimension d ≥ 1. ∗Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, and Microsoft Research SVC, Mountain View, CA 94043.

For a graph G, its strong geodetic number ({{mathrm{sg}}}(G)) is the cardinality of a smallest vertex subset S, such that each vertex of G lies on one fixed shortest path between a pair of vertices from S. In this paper, some general properties of the strong geodetic problem are studied, especially in connection with the diameter of a graph. The problem is also solved for balanced complete bipartite graphs.	geodetic datum	Vesna Irsic	2018	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-018-1885-9	topology;mathematics;pancyclic graph;combinatorics;1-planar graph;strong perfect graph theorem;hopcroft–karp algorithm;robertson–seymour theorem;complete bipartite graph;bipartite graph;indifference graph	Theory	28.185150822485536	28.306964440192093	88788

A central question is to determine, for given g, the minimum possibleb for fixedk, or, alternatively, the maximum k for fixed b. The caseg = 2 was investigated and completely solved by Sperner [16], R ́ enyi [14], Katona [8], and Kleitman and Spencer [10]. For arbitrary g, asymptotic results are known but little is understood for small values ofk. Constructions exist but these only produce upper bounds on b. The present article is concerned with lower bounds onb. We develop three general lower bounds on b for fixed g andk. The first one is proved using one of the principal constructions [17], the second comes from the study of intersecting set-systems, and the third is shown by a set packing argument. In addition, we investigate upper bounds on k for small fixedb.

A coloring c of the vertices of G is proper if c(v)\in L(v)$ for each vertex v and $|c(u)-c(v)|\ge w(uv)$ for each edge uv. A weighted degree $\deg_w(v)$ of a vertex v is the sum of the weights of the edges incident with v. If G is connected, $|L(v)|\deg_w(v)$ for at least one v, and $|L(v)|\ge\deg_w(v)$ for all v, then a proper coloring always exists. A list channel assignment problem is balanced if $|L(v)|=\deg_w(v)$ for all v. We characterize all balanced list channel assignment problems (G,L,w) which admit a proper coloring. An application of this result is that each graph with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 2$ has an L(2,1)-labeling using integers $0,\ldots,\Delta^2+\Delta-1$.	assignment problem	Daniel Král;Riste Skrekovski	2003	SIAM J.

In this paper, we show that both the reverse minus and signed domination problems are polynomial-time solvable for strongly chordal graphs and distance-hereditary graphs, and are linear-time solvable for trees. For chordal graphs and bipartite planar graphs, however, we show that the decision problem corresponding to the reverse minus domination problem is NP-complete. For doubly chordal graphs and bipartite planar graphs, we show that the decision problem corresponding to the reverse signed domination problem is NP-complete. Furthermore, we show that even when restricted to bipartite planar graphs or doubly chordal graphs, the reverse signed domination problem is not fixed parameter tractable.	dominating set	Chuan-Min Lee;Cheng-Chien Lo	2015	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265915500085	pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;domination analysis;computer science;mathematics;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	25.37154121238845	25.64936933645745	89412

A twofold Steiner pentagon system of order v [TSPS(v)] is a twofold pentagon system such that every pair of distinct vertices is joined by a path of length two in exactly two pentagons of the system. A TSPS(v) is said to be super-simple if its underlying (v, 5, 4)-BIBD is super-simple; that is, if any two blocks of the BIBD intersect in at most two points. In this paper, it is shown that the necessary conditions for the existence of a super-simple TSPS(v); namely, v ≥ 15 and v ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 5) are sufficient. For these specified orders, the main result of this paper also guarantees the existence of a very special and interesting class of twofold and fourfold Steiner pentagon systems of order v with the additional property that, for any two vertices, the two or four paths of length two joining them are distinct.	pentagon;steiner tree problem	R.

In this paper, we investigate 1-arc-regular graphs of prime valency, especially of valency 3. First, we prove that if G is a soluble group then a (G, 1)-arc-regular graph must be a Cayley graph of a subgroup of G . Next we consider trivalent Cayley graphs of a finite nonabelian simple group and obtain a sufficient condition under which one can guarantee that Cay(G, S) is 1-arc-regular. Finally, as an application of the result, we construct two infinite families of 1-arc-regular trivalent Cayley graphs with insoluble automorphism groups and, in particular, one of the families is not a Cayley graph.	graph automorphism;magma	Xin Gui Fang;Jie Wang;Ming Yao Xu	2002	Eur.

A major open problem concerns the number of embeddings of such graphs, up to rigid motions, in Euclidean space. We focus on lower bounds and on tight bounds for small cases, in R 2 and R, where Laman graphs and 1-skeleta of convex simplicial polyhedra, respectively, admit inductive constructions. We establish, in R, a lower bound of about 2.37 improving the best existing bound of about 2.29 by Borcea and Streinu, whereas in R we establish the first bound of about 2.52, where n denotes the number of vertices. We capture embeddability by polynomial systems with suitable structure, so that their mixed volume, which bounds the number of common roots, to yield interesting upper bounds on the number of embeddings. Our implementation yields the first tight bounds for n = 7, 8 in R, and for n = 6, 7 in R by enumerating all rigid graphs up to isomorphism.	bioinformatics;polyhedron;polynomial;r language;robotics	Ioannis Z.

A. J. Goldman has asked: When is it possible to color  b  vertices of a graph black and the remaining  w  vertices white so that no vertex is isolated? We prove (1) if  G  is connected and has minimum degree 2, it is always possible unless  b  or  w  is 1; (2) if  G  is 2-connected, then for any pair ( b ,  w ) there is a coloring in which both monochromatic subgraphs are connected; (3) if  G  has vertices of degree 1, a necessary condition for a ( b ,  w ) coloring without isolates to exist is that there be a solution to a certain knapsack inequality. Next, statements generalizing (1) and (2) to  n  colors are presented, and current knowledge about their truth is discussed. Then various refinements of (1) and (3), more complicated to state and prove, are given. For instance, with the hypotheses of (1) at least one of the monochromatic subgraphs may be chosen to be connected. Also, the necessary knapsack inequality of (3) is, in most cases, sufficient. Throughout, some consideration is given to the algorithmic complexity of coloring (if possible) without isolates. For most graphs which might arise in practice there is an efficient algorithm for the 2-color problem. However, for arbitrary graphs the 2-(or more) color problem is NP-complete.		Stephen B.

A graph is called an NCAC graph if it has an intersection representation in which vertices are represented by arc-connected sets in the plane and any two sets of the representation are noncrossing. In particular, disk intersection graphs are NCAC. By a unified reduction we show that recognition of disk intersection and NCAC graphs are NP-hard. A simple observation shows that triangle-free disk intersection and NCAC graphs are planar, and hence recognizable in polynomial time. On the other hand, recognition of triangle-free AC graphs (intersection graphs of arc-connected sets) is still NP-hard.

cdcd3a9c42dbac8e44ca7aaee96cf299694f9983	local dimension is unbounded for planar posets		In 1981, Kelly showed that planar posets can have arbitrarily large dimension. However, the posets in Kelly’s example have bounded Boolean dimension and bounded local dimension, leading naturally to the questions as to whether either Boolean dimension or local dimension is bounded for the class of planar posets. The question for Boolean dimension was first posed by Nešetřil and Pudlák in 1989 and remains unanswered today. The concept of local dimension is quite new, introduced in 2016 by Ueckerdt. In just the last year, researchers have obtained many interesting results concerning Boolean dimension and local dimension, contrasting these parameters with the classic DushnikMiller concept of dimension, and establishing links between both parameters and structural graph theory, path-width and tree-width in particular. Here we show that local dimension is not bounded on the class of planar posets. Our proof also shows that the local dimension of a poset is not bounded in terms of the maximum local dimension of its blocks, and it provides an alternative proof of the fact that the local dimension of a poset cannot be bounded in terms of the tree-width of its cover graph, independent of its height. 1. Notation, Terminology and Background Discussion In this paper, we investigate combinatorial problems for finite posets. As has become standard in the literature, we use the terms elements and points interchangeably in referring to the members of the ground set of a poset. We will write x ‖ y in P when x and y are incomparable in a poset P , and we let Inc(P ) denote the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) with x ‖ y in P . As a binary relation, Inc(P ) is symmetric. Recall that a non-empty family R of linear extensions of P is called a realizer of P when x < y in P if and only if x < y in L for each L ∈ R. Clearly, a non-empty family R of linear extensions of P is a realizer of P if and only if for each (x, y) ∈ Inc(P ), there is some L ∈ R for which x > y in L. The dimension of a poset P , as defined by Dushnik and Miller in their seminal paper [3], is the least positive integer d for which P has a realizer R with |R| = d. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 06A07, 05C35.	boolean algebra;ca-realizer;graph theory;kelly criterion;mathematics subject classification;ordered pair;pathwidth;planar graph;treewidth	Bartlomiej Bosek;Jaroslaw Grytczuk;William T.

Brešar, W. Imrich, S. Klavžar, Tree-like isometric subgraphs of hypercubes, Discuss. Math. Graph Theory, 23 (2003), 227–240] as a generalization of median graphs. We present some incorrectnesses from that article. In particular we point to a gap in the proof of the theorem about the dismantlability of the cube graph of a tree-like partial cube and give a new proof of that result, which holds also for a bigger class of graphs, so called tree-like partial Hamming graphs. We investigate these graphs and show some results which imply previously-known results on tree-like partial cubes. For instance, we characterize tree-like partial Hamming graphs and prove that every tree-like partial Hamming graph G contains a Hamming graph that is invariant under every automorphism of G. The latter result is a direct consequence of the result about the dismantlability of the intersection graph of maximal Hamming graphs of a tree-like partial Hamming graph.	graph theory;isometric projection;maximal set;median graph;olap cube;partial cube;window function	Tanja Gologranc	2014	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1723	outerplanar graph;block graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;geometric graph theory;discrete mathematics;universal graph;topology;graph property;simplex graph;comparability graph;hamming graph;hypercube graph;cubic graph;symmetric graph;graph factorization;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;butterfly graph;partial k-tree;intersection graph;line graph;coxeter graph	Theory	28.64024591648467	30.797342393042392	91113

It turns out that (as observed by several researchers) for the standard notion of a regular partition, one can construct a graph that has very distinct regular partitions. On the other hand, we show that for the stronger notion of a regular partition that has been recently studied, all such regular partitions of the same graph must be very “similar.” En route, we also give a short argument for deriving a recent variant of the regularity lemma obtained independently by Rodl and Schacht and by Lovasz and Szegedy from a previously known variant of the regularity lemma due to Alon et al. in 2000. The proof also provides a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for finding such partitions.		Noga Alon;Asaf Shapira;Uri Stav	2009	SIAM J.

In fact, the fully dependent sets satisfy j d(F) = p(F) in any deltoid representation, and it is with a consideration of this property that we begin the present paper. We study “balanced” sets and from our results draw conclusions about fully dependent sets and circuits in a transversal space. These include upper bounds for the number of circuits, and the result that a nontrivial transversal space can be neither a hereditary circuit space nor the dual of a geometric hereditary circuit space. The paper is reasonably self-contained; all unusual terms are defined as they are encountered.	dependent type	Jeremy E. Dawson	1977	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

63749b1d69cca054cff5464885e2dc45e29b69e4	guessing models and generalized laver diamond	large cardinals;logic;set theory;forcing axioms;structural properties	We analyze the notion of guessing model, a way to assign combinatorial properties to arbitrary regular cardinals. Guessing models can be used, in combination with inaccessibility, to characterize various large cardinals axioms, ranging from supercompactness to rank-to-rank embeddings. The majority of these large cardinals properties can be defined in terms of suitable elementary embeddings j : Vγ → Vλ. One key observation is that such embeddings are uniquely determined by the image structures j[Vγ ] ≺ Vλ. These structures will be the prototypes guessing models. We shall show, using guessing models M , how to prove for the ordinal κM = jM (crit(jM )) (where πM is the transitive collapse of M and jM is its inverse) many of the combinatorial properties that we can prove for the cardinal j(crit(j)) using the structure j[Vγ ] ≺ Vj(γ). κM will always be a regular cardinal, but consistently can be a successor and guessing models M with κM = א2 exist assuming the proper forcing axiom. By means of these models we shall introduce a new structural property of models of PFA: the existence of a “Laver function” f : א2 → Hא2 sharing the same features of the usual Laver functions f : κ → Hκ provided by a supercompact cardinal κ. Further applications of our analysis will be proofs of the singular cardinal hypothesis and of the failure of the square principle assuming the existence of guessing models. In particular the failure of square shows that the existence of guessing models is a very strong assumption in terms of large cardinal strength.	alessandro vespignani;apu nahasapeemapetilon;elementary;graph coloring;iteration;model m keyboard;ordinal data;predictive failure analysis;stationary process;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Matteo Viale	2012	Ann.

d79b357928e86038a7415e029b903030b1939ea8	sperner's colorings, hypergraph labeling problems and fair division		We prove three results about colorings of the simplex reminiscent of Sperner’s Lemma, with applications in hardness of approximation and fair division. First, we prove a coloring lemma conjectured by [5]: Let Vk,q = {v ∈ Z+ : ∑k i=1 vi = q} and Ek,q = {{a + e1,a + e2, . . . ,a + ek} : a ∈ Z+, ∑k i=1 ai = q − 1}. Then for every Sperner-admissible labeling (` : Vk,q → [k] such that v`(v) > 0 for each v ∈ Vk,q), there are at least ( q+k−3 k−2 ) nonmonochromatic hyperedges in Ek,q. This implies an optimal Unique-Games hardness of (k − 1 − )-approximation for the Hypergraph Labeling with Color Lists problem [2]: Given a k-uniform hypergraph H = (V,E) with color lists L(v) ⊆ [k] ∀v ∈ V , find a labeling `(v) ∈ L(v) that minimizes the number of non-monochromatic hyperedges. We also show that a (k − 1)-approximation can be achieved. Second, we show that in contrast to Sperner’s Lemma, there is a Sperner-admissible labeling of Vk,q such that every hyperedge in Ek,q contains at most 4 colors. We present an interpretation of this statement in the context of fair division: There is a preference function on ∆k,q = {x ∈ R+ : ∑k i=1 xi = q} such that for any division of q units of a resource, (x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈ ∆k,q such that ∑k i=1bxic = q − 1, at most 4 players out of k are satisfied. Third, we prove that there are subdivisions of the simplex with a fractional labeling (analogous to a fractional solution for Min-CSP problems) such that every hyperedge in the subdivision uses only labelings with 1 or 2 colors. This means that a natural LP cannot distinguish instances of Hypergraph Labeling with Color Lists that can be labeled so that every hyperedge uses at most 2 colors, and instances that must have a rainbow hyperedge. We prove that this problem is indeed NP-hard for k = 3.	cell (microprocessor);color;discretization;embedded system;emoticon;farkas' lemma;graph coloring;hardness of approximation;interpolation;monochrome;moses charikar;np-hardness;simplicial complex;sperner's lemma;subdivision surface	Maryam Mirzakhani;Jan Vondrák	2015		10.1137/1.9781611973730.60	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	28.68831527459056	25.45810525248384	91632

In particular, for hereditary classes we obtain a new description of the colouring number, which by well-known results describes the rate of growth. We study also random graphs and their entropies. We show, for example, that if a hereditary property has a unique limiting graphon with maximal entropy, then a random graph with this property, selected uniformly at random from all such graphs with a given order, converges to this maximizing graphon as the order tends to infinity.	degeneracy (graph theory);entropy (information theory);graph property;graphon;hereditary property;maximal set;random graph	Hamed Hatami;Svante Janson;Balázs Szegedy	2018	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.22152	outerplanar graph;random regular graph;pathwidth;random graph;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;universal graph;topology;null graph;graph property;clique-width;forbidden graph characterization;comparability graph;cubic graph;symmetric graph;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;vertex-transitive graph;complement graph;line graph;coxeter graph;planar graph	Theory	32.282299631154196	26.742943786028814	91655

The trivial bounds are ∆(G) ≤ χg(G) ≤ 2∆(G)−1, where ∆(G) denote the maximal degree of G. Lam, Shiu, and Xu and, independently, Bartnicki and Grytczuk asked whether there is a constant C such that χg(G) ≤ ∆(G) + C for every graph G. We show that the answer is in the negative by constructing graphs G such that χg(G) ≥ 1.008∆(G) and ∆(G) → ∞.

bb647780fe1abadb2f04fe48dc79e42db7b150f7	a simple proof of menger's theorem		A proof of Menger’s theorem is presented. We use the notation and terminology of Bondy and Murty [ll. Let D be a directed graph. If {u}, {u}, and S are disjoint subsets of V(D) and u and u are nonadjacent, then S separates u and u if every (u, u)-path has a vertex in S. Proofs of Menger’s theorem are given in 12-14]. Menger’s Theorem. If no set of fewer than n vertices separates nonadjacent vertices u and u in a directed graph D, then there are n internally disjoint (u, u)-paths. Proof. The proof uses induction on n. The theorem is trivial for n = 1. Suppose u and u are separated by no set of less than n + 1 vertices (n 5 1). By the induction hypothesis there are n internally disjoint (u, u)-paths P , , . .., P , . Since the set of second vertices of PI, ..., P, does not separate u and u, there is a (u, u)-path P whose initial arc is not on Pi, i = 1, ..., n. Let x be the first vertex on P after u which is also on some P i , 1 S i < n. Let P,,, be the (u , x)-section of P . Assume P I , ..., P , , P , + l have been chosen so that the distance in D {u} from x to u is a minimum. Ifx = u we are done, so assume not. In D {x} there are n internally disjoint (u, u)-paths Q1, ..., Q,, again by the induction hypothesis. Assume Q,, ..., Q, have been chosen so that a minimum number of arcs in B = A(D) U: : ; A(PJ are used.

It has been conjectured by Pilśniak and Woźniak that Δ(G)+3 colors enable the existence of a neighbor sum distinguishing total coloring. The conjecture is confirmed for any graph with maximum degree at most 3 and for planar graph with maximum degree at least 11. We prove that the conjecture holds for any planar graph G with Δ(G)=10. Moreover, for any planar graph G with Δ(G) ≥ 11, Δ(G)+2 colors guarantee such a total coloring, and the upper bound Δ(G)+2 is tight.	degree (graph theory);graph coloring;planar graph;total coloring	Donglei Yang;Lin Sun;Xiaowei Yu;Jian-Liang Wu;Shan Zhou	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.06.002	degree (graph theory);combinatorics;graph power;mathematics;bound graph;complete coloring;fractional coloring;brooks' theorem;topology;total coloring;graph factorization	Theory	28.880415305152663	26.935561074543	92039

Our goal is to find a set of minimum size whose activation will result with the entire graph being activated. Call such a set contagious. We prove that if G = (V,E) is an undirected graph, the size of a contagious set is bounded by ∑ v∈V min{1, k d(v)+1} (where d(v) is the degree of v).

There are several linear time planar embedding algorithms but ah are considered by many to be quite complicated. This paper presents a new method for performing linear time planar graph embedding which avoids some of the complexities of previous approaches (including the need to first st-number the vertices). Our new algorithm easily permits the extraction of a planar obstruction (a subgraph homeomorphic to Ks,s or Ks) in O(n) time if the graph is not planar. Our algorithm is similar to the algorithm of Booth and Lueker which uses a data structure called a PQ-tree. The Pnodes in a P&-tree represent parts of the partially embedded graph that can be permuted, and the Q-nodes represent parts that can be flipped. We avoid the use of P-nodes by not connecting pieces together until they become biconnected. We avoid Q nodes by using a data structure which allows biconnected components to be fiipped in O(1) time.	algorithm;biconnected component;biconnected graph;data structure;embedded system;graph embedding;pq tree;planar graph;robertson–seymour theorem;time complexity	John M.

We prove that the size of a graded mesh of P with bounded vertex degree is within a factor O(H P ) of the size of any Delaunay mesh of P with bounded radius-edge ratio. The term HP depends on the geometry of P and it is likely a small constant when the boundaries of P are fine triangular meshes. There are several consequences. First, among all Delaunay meshes with bounded radius-edge ratio, those returned by Delaunay refinement algorithms have asymptotically optimal sizes. This is another advantage of meshing with Delaunay refinement algorithms. Second, if no input angle is acute, the minimum Delaunay mesh with bounded radius-edge ratio is not much smaller than any minimum mesh with aspect ratio bounded by a particular constant.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;degree (graph theory);delaunay triangulation;horizontal pitch;polygon mesh;polyhedron;refinement (computing);ruppert's algorithm;triangle mesh;triangulated irregular network	Siu-Wing Cheng	2006	Comput.

We also demonstrate single tetrahedra with various combinations of the properties of dihedral acuteness, 2-well-centeredness, and 3-well-centeredness.	computational science;cuboid;mesh networking;prism (surveillance program);robustness (computer science);slab allocation;triangulation (geometry)	Evan VanderZee;Anil N.

The radius r(G) is the minimum eccentricity among the vertices of G and the diameter d(G) is the maximum eccentricity. For graph G − e obtained by deleting edge e in G, we have r(G − e)¿ r(G) and d(G − e)¿d(G). If for all e in G, r(G − e) = r(G), then G is radius-edge-invariant. Similarly, if for all e in G, d(G − e) = d(G), then G is diameter-edge-invariant. In this paper, we study radius-edge-invariant and diameter-edge-invariant graphs and obtain characterizations of radius-edge-invariant graphs and diameter-edge-invariant graphs of diameter two. c © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

0152a2e87864e80ae0da9dbd971259eaa614dfbc	upper bound on the circular chromatic number of the plane		We consider a circular version of the famous Hadwiger-Nelson problem. It is known that 4 colors are necessary and 7 colors suffice to color the Euclidean plane so that points at distance one get different colors. In an r-circular coloring we assign to points arcs of length one of a circle whose circumference is equal to r so that points at distance one get disjoint arcs. No r-circular coloring of the plane with r < 7 was known so far. In this paper we show the existence of an r-circular coloring of the plane for r = 4 + 4 √ 3 3 ≈ 6.30. We also prove existence of a variant of the r-circular coloring of the plane with r < 7 in which we require that the arcs assigned to points at distance belonging to the interval [0.9327, 1.0673] are disjoint.	arcs (computing);circular coloring;color;graph coloring;hadwiger–nelson problem	Konstanty Junosza-Szaniawski	2018	Electr.

We know from Montassier et al. [M. Montassier, P. Ossona de Mendez, A. Raspaud and X. Zhu, Decomposing a graph into forests, J. Graph Theory Ser.

Decomposing a planar graph with girth at least 8 into a forest and a matching, Discrete Maths, 311:844-849, 2011] that planar graphs with girth at least 8 have game chromatic number at most 5. One can ask if this bound of 5 can be improved for a sufficiently large girth. In this paper, we prove that it cannot. More than that, we prove that there are cactuses CT (i.e. graphs whose edges only belong to at most one cycle each) having χg(CT ) = 5 despite having arbitrary large girth, and even arbitrary large distance between its cycles.	color;discrete mathematics;girth (graph theory);graph coloring;graph theory;planar graph;sparse	Clément Charpentier	2017	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2016.08.010	1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;graph power;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;triangle-free graph;topology;dense graph;complete coloring;edge coloring;foster graph;graph coloring;mathematics;odd graph;graph homomorphism;butterfly graph;cage;book embedding;coxeter graph;planar graph	Theory	28.445098523773602	26.966691387212844	92731

An edge orientation of X is a mapping 0: E(X) + V*(X), which assigns to each edge one of its endvertices as its first vertex and the other as its second vertex. Of course each edge orientation of X yields a directed graph and vice versa. We call two edges of X oppositely oriented, if both have the same first vertex or the same second vertex. By e(X, 0) we denote the number of pairs of oppositely oriented edges in X according to the edge orientation 6 of X. We call an edge orientation 0 e-maximal, if e(X, 0) has maximum value among all edge orientations of X. We consider the problem: characterize the e-maximal edge orientations of a graph ..‘.K We give such a characterization for finite cubic graphs. It suffices to consider connected graphs. Therefore in the following we denote by X a finite, connected, cubic graph with 2n vertices. Let d-(u) b? the indegree, d’(u) the outdegree of a vertex tr‘ in a directed graph and 6(G) the minimal degree of an undirected graph G. For further terminology see [l] or [2].

We are especially interested in triangulations with angles not larger than π/2, with as few triangles as possible. The obvious triangulation obtained by taking the centres of all faces consists of 20 acute triangles. We show that there exists a geodesic triangulation with only 10 non-obtuse triangles, and that this is best possible. We also prove the existence of a geodesic triangulation with 14 acute triangles, and the non-existence of such triangulations with less than 12 triangles. c © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For integers 171 > 2, the FntR iterated line graph L”(G) of G is defined to be L(P-l(G)). A graph G of order p > 3 is n-Hamiltonian, 0 < N < p 3, if the removal of any k vertices, 0 < k < n, resu!ts in a Hamiltonian graph. It is shown that if G is a connected graph wirb 6(G) >, 3, where S(G) denotes the minimum degree of 6, then L”(G) is (6(G) 3)-Mamiltonian. Furthermore, if G is 2-connected and 6(G) > 4, then P(G) is (26(G) 4)-Hamiltonian. For a connected graph G which is neither a path, a cycle, nor the graph K&3) and for any positive integer n, the existence of an integer k such that LI”(G) is n-Hamiltonian for every wz > k is exhibited. Then, for the special case PI = 1, bounds on (and, in some cases, the exact vatue of) the smallest such integer k are determined for various classes of graphs.	connectivity (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path;iteration;line graph;one-to-one (data model);vertex (geometry)	Linda M.

For a set S of points in ℝ d , a t-spanner is a sparse graph on the points of S such that there is a path in the spanner between any pair of points whose total length is at most t times the distance between the points. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a spanner whose update time depends solely on the number of points in S. In particular, we show how to maintain a (1+ε)-spanner with O(n/ε d ) edges, where points can be inserted to S in an amortized update time of O(log n) and deleted from S in an amortized update time of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ . As a by-product of our techniques we obtain a simple incremental algorithm for constructing a (1+ε)-spanner with O(n/ε d ) edges in constant doubling dimension metric spaces whose running time is O(nlog n).	algorithm;amortized analysis;dynamic problem (algorithms);period-doubling bifurcation;sparse graph code;sparse matrix;time complexity	Liam Roditty	2007	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-011-9504-7	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	29.683132280521924	19.20805100343172	92907

This is different from the strong chromatic index--the minimum size of a partition of the edges of graph into induced matchings. It is easy to show, as we do in this paper, that, if G is a graph which has a perfect matching, then imp(G) ≤ 2Δ (G) - 1, where Δ(G) is the maximum degree of a vertex of G. We further show in this paper that, when G is connected, imp(G) = 2 Δ(G) - 1 if and only if G is isomorphic to either K2 or C4k+2 or the Petersen graph, where.

The main result of the this paper is that all these questions have an affirmative answer. Even stronger the gaps of size produced by allowing interior vertices or by using dissections may be linear in the number of points.	triangulation (geometry);vertex (geometry)	Alexander Below;U.

The geodesic diameter is the greatest separation between two points on the surface, where distance is determined by the shortest (geodesic) path between two points. We assume a model of computation that permits finding roots of a one-variable polynomial of fixed degree in constant time. The key geometric result underlying the algorithm is that, although it may be that neither endpoint of the diameter is a vertex of the polytope, when this occurs, there must be at least five distinct equal-length paths between the diameter endpoints.	algorithm;communication endpoint;model of computation;polyhedron;polynomial;time complexity	Joseph O'Rourke;Catherine A.

The chromatic number of these graphs is presented for various sets of parameters (q, n, d). For the 4-colorings of the graphs H2(n, n−1) a notion of robustness is introduced.

The weight of a graph G is the minimum of weights of edges of G. Jendrol' and Schiermeyer (Combinatorica 21:351---359, 2001) determined the maximum weight of a graph having n vertices and m edges, thus solving a problem posed in 1990 by Erd?s. The present paper is concerned with a modification of the mentioned problem, in which involved graphs are connected and of size $$m\le \left( {\begin{array}{c}n\\ 2\end{array}}\right) -\left( {\begin{array}{c}\lceil n/2\rceil \\ 2\end{array}}\right) $$m≤n2-?n/2?2.	connectivity (graph theory)	Mirko Hornák;Stanislav Jendrol;Ingo Schiermeyer	2016	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-015-1634-2	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;connectivity;path graph;mathematics	Theory	28.56164911642655	27.7958817874077	94300
700e8db3793fe2b67f5b2be02de166ef4c2f329d	a note on covering edge colored hypergraphs by monochromatic components	graph theory;edge coloring;monochromatic component	For r ≥ 2, α ≥ r − 1 and k ≥ 1, let c(r, α, k) be the smallest integer c such that the vertex set of any non-trivial r-uniform k-edge-colored hypergraph H with α(H) = α can be covered by c monochromatic connected components. Here α(H) is the maximum cardinality of a subset A of vertices in H such that A does not contain any edges. An old conjecture of Ryser is equivalent to c(2, α, k) = α(r − 1) and a recent result of Z. Király states that c(r, r − 1, k) = dkr e for any r ≥ 3. Here we make the first step to treat non-complete hypergraphs, showing that c(r, r, r) = 2 for r ≥ 2 and c(r, r, r + 1) = 3 for r ≥ 3.	connected component (graph theory);monochrome	Shinya Fujita;Michitaka Furuya;András Gyárfás;Ágnes Tóth	2014	Electr.

983e7bf3f311507d69b6bb397a6264ae089a3a19	a fast algorithm for the boolean masking problem		An algorithm is presented for the calculation of Boolean combinations between layers of a VLSI circuit layout. Each layer is assumed to contain only polygons, which are specified by their edges; the output is also polygonal. The algorithm runs in O (( n + k )( r + log n )) time and O ( nr ) space, where n is the total number of edges on all layers, k is the number of edge intersections, and r is the number of layers. Also a number of restrictions on the general problem are discussed which lead to substantial improvements in the time bounds. It is proved that when the polygons are presented using a hierarchical description language the problem becomes NP -hard. Finally how this approach can be used to solve the i -contour problem of computational geometry and the hidden-line-elimination problem of computer graphics is discussed.	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem	Thomas Ottmann;Peter Widmayer;Derick Wood	1985	Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing	10.1016/0734-189X(85)90159-8	combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;polygon;masking;mathematics;boolean function;algorithm	Vision	29.11623705998163	20.606483913360805	95037
e28039b2ad61a16c09c3781b86afe02540277383	on the broadcast independence number of caterpillars		Let G be a simple undirected graph. A broadcast on G is a function f : V (G) → N such that f(v) ≤ eG(v) holds for every vertex v of G, where eG(v) denotes the eccentricity of v in G, that is, the maximum distance from v to any other vertex of G. The cost of f is the value cost(f) = ∑ v∈V (G) f(v). A broadcast f on G is independent if for every two distinct vertices u and v in G, dG(u, v) > max{f(u), f(v)}, where dG(u, v) denotes the distance between u and v in G. The broadcast independence number of G is then defined as the maximum cost of an independent broadcast on G. In this paper, we study independent broadcasts of caterpillars and give an explicit formula for the broadcast independence number of caterpillars having no pair of adjacent trunks, a trunk being an internal spine vertex with degree 2.	distance (graph theory);emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);independent set (graph theory);neighbourhood (graph theory)	Messaouda Ahmane;Isma Bouchemakh;Éric Sopena	2018	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2018.03.017	combinatorics;discrete mathematics	Theory	28.162416238544527	29.203272323208065	95059

As a corollary, we prove that the maximum stable set problem is polynomially solvable in a class that strictly contains claw-free graphs, improving several existing results. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We analyze the following problem. Consider a train station consisting of a set of parallel tracks. Each track can be approached from one side only or from both sides and the number of trains per track may be limited or not. The departure times of the trains are fixed according to a given time table. The problem is to assign a track to each train as soon as it arrives and such that it can leave the station on time without being blocked by any other train. We show that this problem can be modeled with online coloring of graphs. Depending on the constraints, the graphs can be overlap graphs (also known as circle graphs) or permutation graphs, and the coloring can be bounded or classical. This paper covers several combinations of these cases.	assignment problem	Marc Demange;Gabriele Di Stefano;Benjamin Leroy-Beaulieu	2012	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2012.01.002	combinatorics;longest path problem;performance;theoretical computer science;mathematics;graph;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Crypto	28.192040126724777	22.673735747075646	95296

Moreover, we approach the main question in a more general way: We analyze the scope of the complexity of unions of m-equivalent disjoint sets. Under the hypothesis that NE 6= coNE, we construct degrees in NP where our main question has a positive answer, i.e., these degrees are closed under unions of disjoint sets.

e1565bfc6fbbf5e49155aef1763f2d49c1c3886d	on the number of independent sets in a tree		We show in a simple way that for any k,m ∈ N, there exists a tree T such that the number of independent sets of T is congruent to k modulo m. This resolves a conjecture of Wagner (Almost all trees have an even number of independent sets, Electron. J. Combin. 16 (2009), # R93). 1 The number of independent sets in a tree A set of vertices in a graph G is called independent if the set induces no edges. We write i(G) for the number of independent sets in G; i(G) is often known as the Fibonacci number, or in mathematical chemistry as the Merrifield-Simmons index or the σ-index. The study was initiated by Prodinger and Tichy in [4]. In particular, they showed that among trees of the same order, the maximum and minimum Fibonacci numbers are attained by the star and the path respectively. The name stems from the fact that the Fibonacci numbers of paths are the usual Fibonacci numbers. Indeed, as the empty set is independent, i(P0) = 1, i(P1) = 2 and i(Pn) = i(Pn−1) + i(Pn−2) for n > 2. The inverse question asks for a positive integer k, whether there exists a graph G such that i(G) = k. Clearly there does as i(Kk−1) = k (note that the empty set is independent). The question becomes more interesting if we restrict ourselves to certain classes of graphs. For the class of bipartite graphs, Linek [3] answered the question affirmatively. Here we are interested in the class of trees. For k ∈ N, we say that k is constructible if there exists a tree T such that i(T ) = k. For example, 1, 2, 3 are constructible (from the paths P0, P1, P2 respectively) but 4 is not. In [3], Linek raised the following conjecture (see also [2]). Conjecture 1 ([3]). There are only finitely many positive integers that are not constructible. the electronic journal of combinatorics 17 (2010), #N18 1 An interesting paper of Wagner [5] looks at the number of independent sets modulo m. Wagner showed that the proportion of trees on n vertices with the number of independent sets divisible by m tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. In the same paper, Wagner [5] proposed a weaker version of Conjecture 1. Let C(m) = {i(T ) (mod m) : T a tree }. Conjecture 2 ([5]). For m ∈ N, C(m) = Zm. The aim of this paper is to prove Conjecture 2. In fact, we prove a stronger result. For a rooted tree (T, r), let i0(T, r) denote the number of independent sets not covering the root. Let D(m) = {(i0(T, r), i(T )) (mod m) : (T, r) a rooted tree}. Theorem 3. For m ∈ N, D(m) = Zm. First we note a recursion between the Fibonacci number of a rooted tree and its subtrees. Suppose r1, r2, · · · , rj are the neighbours of r, let (Tk, rk) be the subtree of T rooted at rk. Then we have [2, 5]	electron;graph (discrete mathematics);independent set (graph theory);mathematical chemistry;maxima and minima;modulo operation;recursion;tree (data structure)	Hiu-Fai Law	2010	Electr.

We show that the answer is positive in a special case, when minimal is replaced by minimum cutsets. We will also answer another related question suggested by J. Nešetřil by proving the existence of highly chromatically connected graphs in which every vertex neighborhood induces a subgraph with a given girth.	connectivity (graph theory);cut (graph theory);girth (graph theory);graph coloring	Andrzej Dudek;Esmeralda Nastase;Vojtech Rödl	2009	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2008.03.023	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;connectivity;subgraph isomorphism problem;mathematics;induced subgraph isomorphism problem	Theory	26.38919511627575	30.82991158475197	95846

da9642193f51a41033d79025b71b0d4df7f15c59	note on the integer geometry of bitwise xor	convex set;voronoi diagram	We consider the set Z0 of non-negative integers endowed with a distance d defined as follows: given x, y ∈ Z0 , d(x, y) is, in binary notation, the result of performing, digit by digit, the “exlusive or” (in short, “XOR”) operation on (the binary notations of) x and y. Dawson, in [?], considers this geometry and suggests the following construction: given k different integers x1, . . . , xk ∈ Z0 , let Vi be the set of integers closer to xi than to any xj with j 6= i, for i, j = 1, . . . , k. Let V = (V1, . . . , Vk) and X = (x1, . . . , xk). V is a partition of {0, 2, . . . , 2n − 1} which, in general, does not determine X. Note that, by definition, V is the Voronoy diagram determined by X. In this paper, we characterize the convex sets of this geometry: they coincide with the line segments and correspond to set intervals through the set of non-zero digits. In particular, the sets of form Vi are convex. Given X and the partition V determined by X, we also characterize in the following terms the ordered sets Y = (y1, . . . , yk) that determine the same partition V: ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . , k, ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k, j 6= i =⇒ d(yi, xj) , d(xi, yj) > d(yi, xi). This, in particular, extends one of the main results of [?].	binary number;bitwise operation;convex function;convex set;exclusive or;final fantasy xi;state diagram	António Guedes de Oliveira;Diogo Oliveira e Silva	2005	Eur.

3afa4c61bd175b5a1470b84701f18c6b22d087bf	local ordinal embedding		We study the problem of ordinal embedding: given a set of ordinal constraints of the form distance(i, j) < distance(k, l) for some quadruples (i, j, k, l) of indices, the goal is to construct a point configuration x̂1, ..., x̂n in R that preserves these constraints as well as possible. Our first contribution is to suggest a simple new algorithm for this problem, Soft Ordinal Embedding. The key feature of the algorithm is that it recovers not only the ordinal constraints, but even the density structure of the underlying data set. As our second contribution we prove that in the large sample limit it is enough to know “local ordinal information” in order to perfectly reconstruct a given point configuration. This leads to our Local Ordinal Embedding algorithm, which can also be used for graph drawing.	algorithm;data point;graph (discrete mathematics);graph drawing;graph embedding;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;loss function;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;ordinal data;simulation	Yoshikazu Terada;Ulrike von Luxburg	2014			aleph number;ordinal data type;mathematical optimization;additively indecomposable ordinal;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;nimber;mathematics;cofinality;critical point;limit ordinal;ordinal arithmetic	ML	26.78500281530412	20.40719461456302	96106

An interesting family of graph classes arises from intersection graphs of geometric objects. In this work we show that the Graph Isomorphism Problem for unit square graphs, intersection graphs of axis-parallel unit squares in the plane, can be solved in polynomial time. Since the recognition problem for this class of graphs is NP-hard we can not rely on standard techniques for geometric graphs based on constructing a canonical realization. Instead, we develop new techniques which combine structural insights into the class of unit square graphs with understanding of the automorphism group of such graphs. For the latter we introduce a generalization of bounded degree graphs which is used to capture the main structure of unit square graphs. Using group theoretic algorithms we obtain sufficient information to solve the isomorphism problem for unit square graphs. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.2.2 Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems, G.2.2 Graph Theory	algorithm;decision problem;graph automorphism;graph isomorphism problem;graph theory;np-hardness;optic axis of a crystal;polynomial;time complexity	Daniel Neuen	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2016.70	1-planar graph;block graph;pathwidth;mathematical optimization;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;public records;cograph;universal graph;interval graph;topology;graph product;pancyclic graph;graph automorphism;graph coloring;symmetric graph;mathematics;graph isomorphism;modular decomposition;graph homomorphism;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding;line graph	Theory	26.67811721201416	24.627124224381166	96126
1c1bb9eed74c6901a1fd0d34353ca52bf3dfb3ef	new ore-type conditions for h-linked graphs	k linked graph;k ordered graph;h linked graph	For a fixed (multi)graph H, a graph G is H-linked if any injection f : V (H) → V (G) can be extended to an H-subdivision in G. The notion of an H-linked graph encompasses several familiar graph classes, including k-linked, kordered and k-connected graphs. In this paper, we give two sharp Ore-type degree sum conditions that assure a graph G is H-linked for arbitrary H. These results extend and refine several previous results on H-linked, k-linked and k-ordered graphs. All graphs in this paper are finite. For notation not defined here we refer the reader to [1]. If X ⊆ V (G) is a vertex set, we will often just write X for the induced subgraph G[X] if the context is clear. Given an integer-valued graph parameter p and a graph property P , the p-threshold for P is the minimum k = k(n) such that any graph G of order n with p(G) ≥ k has property P . We will frequently consider p-thresholds restricted to specific graph classes, such as sufficiently large graphs, or graphs with a prescribed number of edges. Let δ(G) and ∆(G) denote the minimum and maximum degree of G, respectively, and let σ2(G) denote the minimum degree sum of nonadjacent vertices in G. Throughout the paper, we will often refer to σ2 conditions as Ore-type conditions in light of Ore’s classical theorem on hamiltonian graphs. We will also let ni(G) be the number of vertices of degree i in G. A graph G is k-linked if for any ordered subset of 2k vertices S = {s1, t1, . . . , sk, tk} there exist disjoint paths P1, . . . , Pk such that for each i, Pi is an si− ti path. We will refer to this collection of paths as an S-linkage in G. We also say that G is k-ordered if for any list of k vertices v1, . . . , vk in G, there exists a cycle that visits these vertices in the given order. For a fixed graph H, a graph G is H-linked if any injection f : V (H)→ V (G) can be extended to an H-subdivision in G. We refer to the injection f as an H-linkage 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05C38, 05C83.	degree (graph theory);existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);graph property;graph theory;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);induced subgraph;linkage (software);mathematics subject classification;subdivision surface;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Michael Ferrara;Ronald J.

47ffd142e57158bddd7a62dfeb051cd6d93617d9	network model for the problem of integer balancing of a four-dimensional matrix		The problem of integer balancing of a four-dimensional matrix is studied. The elements of the inner part (all four indices are greater than zero) of the given real matrix are summed in each direction and each two- and three-dimensional section of the matrix; the total sum is also found. These sums are placed into the elements where one or more indices are equal to zero (according to the summing directions). The problem is to find an integer matrix of the same structure, which can be produced from the initial one by replacing the elements with the largest previous or the smallest following integer. At the same time, the element with four zero indices should be produced with standard rules of rounding-off. In the article the problem of finding the maximum multiple flow in the network of any natural multiplicity k is also studied. There are arcs of three types: ordinary arcs, multiple arcs and multi-arcs. Each multiple and multi-arc is a union of k linked arcs, which are adjusted with each other. The network constructing rules are described. The definitions of a divisible network and some associated subjects are stated. There are defined the basic principles for reducing the integer balancing problem of an l-dimensional matrix (l ≥ 3) to the problem of finding the maximum flow in a divisible multiple network of multiplicity k. There are stated the rules for reducing the four-dimensional balancing problem to the maximum flow problem in the network of multiplicity 5. The algorithm of finding the maximum flow, which meets the solvability conditions for the integer balancing problem, is formulated for such a network.	arcs (computing);algorithm;flow network;integer factorization;maximum flow problem;network model;rounding;the matrix	A.

We deal with 5-partite graphs such that each part contains n vertices, and any two parts form an -regular pair with m edges. Here, two sets of vertices U and W of size n form an -regular pair with m edges if all subsets U U and W W with U , W n satisfy E(U , W ) U W m/n U W m/n. We show that for each 0, there exists at most (m n2)10 such graphs that do not contain a K5 as a subgraph if m Cn 5/3 for a constant C C( ), is sufficiently small, and n is sufficiently large. This proves the special case of the conjecture when H equals the complete graph on five vertices. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.

This is motivated by the following two conjectures which are in fact equivalent by a recent result of the third author. Conjecture 1 (Thomassen): Every 4-connected line graph is hamiltonian, i.e. has a connected 2-factor. Conjecture 2 (Matthews and Sumner): Every 4-connected claw-free graph is hamiltonian. We first show that Conjecture 2 is true within the class of hourglass-free graphs, i.e. graphs that do not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to two triangles meeting in exactly one vertex. Next we show that a weaker form of Conjecture 2 is true, in which the conclusion is replaced by the conclusion that there exists a connected spanning subgraph in which each vertex has degree two or four. Finally we show that Conjecture 1 and 2 are equivalent to seemingly weaker conjectures in which the conclusion is replaced by the conclusion that there exists a spanning subgraph consisting of a bounded number of paths.	carsten thomassen;claw-free graph;claw-free permutation;connectivity (graph theory);file spanning;graph factorization;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);induced subgraph;line graph	Haitze J.

In this work, we present an algorithm to generate all unlabeled cographs with n vertices, based on the generation of cotrees. The delay of our algorithm (time spent between two consecutive outputs) is O(n). The time needed to generate the first output is also O(n), which gives an overall O(nMn) time complexity, where Mn is the number of unlabeled cographs with n vertices. The algorithm avoids the generation of duplicates (isomorphic outputs) and produces, as a by-product, a linear ordering of unlabeled cographs wih n vertices.	algorithm;carrier-to-noise ratio;cograph;graph coloring;list of amd fx microprocessors;microsoft windows;operating system;random-access memory;spectral graph theory;time complexity;vertex (geometry)	Átila A.

26432be368276e725084e6f6cceb8e00c0b87765	on the structure of classes of random graphs		Many different random graph constructions are used to model large real life graphs, i.e., graphs that describe the structure of real systems. Often it is not clear, however, how the strength of the different models compare to each other, e.g., when does it hold that a certain model class contains another. We are particularly interested in random graph models that arise via abstract geometric constructions, motivated by the fact that these graphs can model wireless communication networks. We set up a general framework to compare the strength of random graph models, and present some results about the equality, inequality and proper containment of certain model classes, as well as some open problems.	geometric modeling;random graph;real life;social inequality;telecommunications network;theoretical computer science	András Faragó	2010	Chicago J.

b192b248b89aebf3b135805b0cb3492963f7119a	weak unit disk and interval representation of planar graphs		We study a variant of intersection representations with unit balls, that is, unit disks in the plane and unit intervals on the line. Given a planar graph and a bipartition of the edges of the graph into near and far sets, the goal is to represent the vertices of the graph by unit balls so that the balls representing two adjacent vertices intersect if and only if the corresponding edge is near. We consider the problem in the plane and prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether such a representation exists for a given edge-partition. On the other hand, every series-parallel graph admits such a representation with unit disks for any near/far labeling of the edges. We also show that the representation problem on the line is equivalent to a variant of a graph coloring. We give examples of girth-4 planar and girth-3 outerplanar graphs that have no such representation with unit intervals. On the other hand, all trianglefree outerplanar graphs and all graphs with maximum average degree less than 26/11 can always be represented. In particular, this gives a simple proof of representability of all planar graphs with large girth.	experiment;girth (graph theory);graph coloring;interval arithmetic;np-completeness;np-hardness;neighbourhood (graph theory);outerplanar graph;planar graph;series-parallel graph	Muhammad Jawaherul Alam;Stephen G.

We give a short proof for the existence of such fair divisions. In this note we study a fair division problem. Fair divisions problems are sometimes called cake cutting problems. These kinds of problems appear when we study division of land, time or computer memory between different agents with different point of view. This problem is old: the “cut and choose” algorithm already appears in the Bible. In a more scientific way it has been formulated by Steinhaus in 1948, see [Ste48]. Nowadays, there exists several articles, see e.g. [DS61, BT95, RW97, BJK13], and books, see e.g. [RW98, BT96, Pro16, Bar05], about this topic. These results appears in the mathematics, economics, political science, artificial intelligence and computer science literature. In this note, our heterogeneous good, e.g. a cake, will be represented by the interval [0; 1]. We consider n players and we associate to each player a non-atomic probability measure μi on the interval X = [0; 1] with density fi. These measures represent the utility functions of the player. The set X represents the cake and we want to get a partition of X = X1 ⊔ . . . ⊔Xn, where the i-th player get Xi. In this situation several notions of fair division exists: • Proportional division: ∀i, μi(Xi) ≥ 1/n. • Exact division: ∀i, ∀j, μi(Xj) = 1/n. • Envy-free division: ∀i, ∀j, μi(Xi) ≥ μi(Xj). • Equitable division: ∀i, ∀j, μi(Xi) = μj(Xj). All these fair divisions are possible, see e.g [Ste48, DS61, BT96, RW98, CDP13]. The minimal number of cuts in order to get a fair division has also been studied. For a proportional fair division n − 1 cuts are sufficient. This means that for all i there exists an index j such that Xi = [xj , xj+1], where x0 = 0, xn = 1. A fair division where each Xi is an interval is called a simple fair division. The BanachKnaster algorithm given in [Ste48] shows how to get a simple proportional fair division.

One wishes to partition G into connected components by deleting edges from G so that the total weight of each component is at least l and at most u. Such a partition is called an (l,u)-partition. We deal with three problems to find an (l,u)-partition of a given graph: the minimum partition problem is to find an (l,u)-partition with the minimum number of components; the maximum partition problem is defined analogously; and the p-partition problem is to find an (l,u)-partition with a given number p of components. All these problems are NP-hard even for series-parallel graphs, but are solvable in linear time for paths. In this paper, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm to solve the three problems for arbitrary trees.	algorithm;connected component (graph theory);decision problem;np-hardness;partition problem;series-parallel graph;time complexity;tree (data structure)	Takehiro Ito;Takao Nishizeki;Michael Schröder;Takeaki Uno;Xiao Zhou	2010	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-010-9485-y	rank of a partition;mathematical optimization;partition problem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;partition refinement;cut;level structure;computer science;graph partition;frequency partition of a graph;mathematics;tree;strongly connected component;algorithm	Theory	24.992384744835288	24.411531044425132	97560

This problem arises in controlling statistical disclosure, in data analysis, and elsewhere. There are algorithms in the literature which produce roundings that are """"tight"""" in the sense of distorting the totals very little. We concentrate on the case of symmetric matrices. The existing algorithms do not preserve symmetry. In fact, the best symmetric rounding of a symmetric matrix may not be as tight as its best unsymmetric rounding. We suggest three different relaxations of the tightness contraints, which admit symmetric solutions. In each case we find the strongest possible result concerning the existence of a rounding of prescribed tightness. We also give efficient algorithms to determine if roundings with specified distortion bounds exist and, if so, construct such a rounding. These results and algorithms are based on a graph-theoretic model of the situation in which we are given an edge-weighted undirected graph and we wish to round the edge weights so that the weight sums at any vertex, and the total weight sum over all edges, are changed as little as possible. We use graph factors as our main tool. As a consequence of our work on symmetric matrices we also provide more efficient algorithms for roundings in general matrices."""	algorithm;distortion;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;rounding	Pavol Hell;David G.

The best known lower bound, due to Borodin, is that every planar graph has an induced forest on two fifths of its vertices. In a related result, Chartran and Kronk, proved that the vertices of every planar graph can be partitioned into three sets, each of which induce a forest. We show tighter results for 2-outerplanar graphs. We show that every 2-outerplanar graph has an induced forest on at least half the vertices by showing that its vertices can be partitioned into two sets, each of which induces a forest. We also show that every 2-outerplanar graph has an induced outerplanar graph on at least two-thirds of its vertices.	directed acyclic graph;outerplanar graph	Glencora Borradaile;Hung Le;Melissa Sherman-Bennett	2017	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-017-1859-3	factor-critical graph;mathematics;topology;graph power;combinatorics;cycle graph;path graph;butterfly graph;graph center;level structure;hypercube graph	Theory	27.552168630059366	28.593946482713164	97607
ef9b0bc2d4465a5602b9b40203551dfc4032a94f	on the enumerability of the determinant and the rank		We investigate the complexity of enumerative approximation of two elementary problems in linear algebra, computing the rank and the determinant of a matrix. In particular, we show that if there exists an enumerator that, given a matrix, outputs a list of constantly many numbers, one of which is guaranteed to be the rank of the matrix, then it can be determined in AC^0 (with oracle access to the enumerator) which of these numbers is the rank. Thus, for example, if the enumerator is an FL function, then the problem of computing the rank is in FL. The result holds for matrices over any commutative ring whose size grows at most polynomially with the size of the matrix. The existence of such an enumerator also implies a slightly stronger collapse of the exact counting logspace hierarchy. .pp For the determinant function Det we establish the following two results: 1. If Det is poly-enumerable in logspace, then Det is in FL. 2. For any prime p, if Det-mod-p is (p-1)-enumerable in Mod_pL, then Det-mod-p is in FL. These results give a perspective on the approximability of many elementary linear algebra problems equivalent to computing the rank or the determinant. Due to the close connection between the determinant function and #L, as well as between the rank function and AC^0(C_=L), our results might yield a better understanding of the exact power of counting in logspace and the relationships among the complexity classes sandwiched between NL and uniform TC^1.	recursively enumerable set	Alina Beygelzimer;Mitsunori Ogihara	2002	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)	10.1007/978-0-387-35608-2_6	combinatorics;mathematics	Theory	37.08569709452856	30.148366210387234	97705

In this paper, we investigate the bandwidth problem for the composition of two graphs and obtain the bandwidth for several classes of graphs of the forms  K   n  [ G ]  and   K  1, n  [ G ]. We also provide optimal numberings which solve the graph edgesum problem for  K   n  [ P   m  ] and  K   n  [ C   m  ].	bandwidth (signal processing)	Jiuqiang Liu;Kenneth Williams	1995	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(94)00013-9	theoretical computer science;bound graph;algorithm;algebra	Theory	30.824233367401508	31.983944849848665	98000
497e142a333fd603970d115881f9ecb43f839ac9	team diagonalization		Ten years ago, Glaßer, Pavan, Selman, and Zhang [GPSZ08] proved that if P 6= NP, then all NP-complete sets can be simply split into two NP-complete sets. That advance might naturally make one wonder about a quite different potential consequence of NP-completeness: Can the union of easy NP sets ever be hard? In particular, can the union of two non-NP-complete NP sets ever be NP-complete? Amazingly, Ladner [Lad75] resolved this more than forty years ago: If P 6= NP, then all NP-complete sets can be simply split into two non-NP-complete NP sets. Indeed, this holds even when one requires the two non-NP-complete NP sets to be disjoint. We present this result as a mini-tutorial. We give a relatively detailed proof of this result, using the same technique and idea Ladner [Lad75] invented and used in proving a rich collection of results that include many that are more general than this result: delayed diagonalization. In particular, the proof presented is based on what one can call team diagonalization (or if one is being playful, perhaps even tag-team diagonalization): Multiple sets are formed separately by delayed diagonalization, yet those diagonalizations are mutually aware and delay some of their actions until their partner(s) have also succeeded in some coordinated action. We relatedly note that, as a consequence of Ladner’s result, if P 6= NP, there exist OptP functions f and g whose composition is NP-hard yet neither f nor g is NP-hard.	existential quantification;np (complexity);np-completeness;np-hardness;p versus np problem	Lane A.

We study the uniform distribution on the space of simple bipartite graphs with degree sequence s in one part and t in the other; equivalently, binary matrices with row sums s and column sums t. In particular, we find precise formulae for the probabilities that a given bipartite graph is edge-disjoint from, a subgraph of, or an induced subgraph of a random graph in the class. We also give similar formulae for the uniform distribution on the set of simple directed graphs with out-degrees s and indegrees t. In each case, the graphs or digraphs are required to be sufficiently dense, with the degrees varying within certain limits, and the subgraphs are required to be sufficiently sparse. Previous results were restricted to spaces of sparse graphs. Our theorems are based on an enumeration of bipartite graphs avoiding a given set of edges, proved by multidimensional complex integration. As a sample application, we determine the expected permanent of a random binary matrix with row sums s and column sums t. ∗ This is a revised expanded version of “Asymptotic enumeration of dense 0-1 matrices with specified line sums and forbidden positions”, submitted to arXiv on 22 Jan 2007.

Well known particular cases of derivable graphs are (among others) trees, complete, and triangular graphs; in the paper a broader class of locally derivable graphs, called closed graphs, is defined. Nodes and edges of closed graphs can be partitioned into external and internal ones; the main property of such graphs their local reducibility: successive removing its external nodes leads eventually to a singleton, and removing its external edges leads to an a spanning tree of the graph. The class of closed graphs is then a class enabling structural reducing. This property can be applied in processor networks to design some local procedures leading to global results.	academy	Antoni W. Mazurkiewicz	2007	Fundam.

Our motivation for considering such graphs is to model ‘random compatibility’ between vertices in a large network. For both of the models considered in this paper, we determine the thresholds for covering the underlying hypercube Qd and for the appearance of s-cliques. In addition we pose a number of open problems.	clique (graph theory);graph coloring;random graph;vertex (geometry)	Victor Falgas-Ravry;Klas Markström	2016	Electr. J. Comb.

2c46374219aa4a912c618a3cbaf5a7fc18e7ce41	improper colourings of unit disk graphs	satellite communication;interval graph;chromatic number;unit disk graph	We investigate the following problem proposed by Alcatel. A satellite sends information to receivers on earth, each of which is listening on a chosen frequency. Technically, it is impossible for the satellite to precisely focus its signal onto a receiver. Part of the signal will be spread in an area around its destination and this creates noise for nearby receivers on the same frequency. However, a receiver is able to distinguish its signal if the sum of the noise does not become too large, i.e. does not exceed a certain threshold T . The problem is to assign frequencies to the receivers so that each receiver can distinguish its signal. We investigate this problem in the fundamental case where the noise area at a receiver does not depend on the frequency and where the “noise relation” is symmetric; that is, if a receiver u is in the noise area of a receiver v, then v is in the noise area of u. Moreover, the intensity I of the noise created by a signal is independent of the frequency and the receiver; hence, to distinguish its signal from the noise, a receiver must be in the noise area of at most k = ⌊ T I ⌋ receivers getting signals on the same frequency. We model this problem as a graph colouring problem. Define a noise graph as follows: the vertices are the receivers and we put an edge between u and v if u is in the noise area of v. The frequencies are represented by colours; thus, an assignment of frequencies to receivers is equivalent to a k-improper colouring of the noise graph. The impropriety of a vertex v of a graph G under the colouring c, denoted by imG(v), is the number of neighbours of v coloured c(v). A colouring c is k-improper if all the vertices have impropriety at most k under c. Note that 0-improper colouring is the usual notion of proper colouring. Improper colouring has been widely studied, particularly in the case of planar graphs. It is known that every planar graph is 0-improper 4-colourable (due to the 4-colour theorem [1]) and 2-improper 3-colourable [3, 5, 9]. In [4], the authors considered complexity issues of improper colourings and showed that the (general) k-improper l-colourability problem is NP-complete except for when k = 0 and l = 2 (or l = 1).

We present two new drawing conventions which reduce the layout width to be less than some maximum width while still maintaining the essential layered drawing convention. These conventions relax the requirement that a parent must be exactly placed midway between its children, and instead make this a preference which can be violated if this is required for the layout to fit into the required width. Both drawing conventions give rise to a simple kind of quadratic programming problem. We give an iterative gradient projection algorithm for solving this kind of problem, and also a linear time heuristic algorithm. Our algorithms are practical: a tree with three thousand nodes can be laid out in less than a hundred milliseconds with either algorithm.	algorithm;amiga walker;battle of midway;gradient;heuristic (computer science);iterative method;quadratic programming;time complexity	Kim Marriott;Peter Sbarski	2007			mathematical optimization;mathematics;engineering drawing;algorithm	ML	27.877920433406757	20.108012882054823	98526

By combining methods from algebraic number theory and convexity, we prove that there are four prescribed lattice directions such that convex subsets of En (i.e., finite subsets F with F = En n conv F) are determined, among all such sets, by their X-rays in these directions. We also show that three X-rays do not suffice for this purpose. This answers a question of Larry Shepp, and yields a stability result related to Hammer's X-ray problem. We further show that any set of seven prescribed mutually nonparallel lattice directions in 22 have the property that convex subsets of 22 are determined, among all such sets, by their X-rays in these directions. We also consider the use of orthogonal projections in the interactive technique of successive determination, in which the information from previous projections can be used in deciding the direction for the next projection. We obtain results for finite subsets of the integer lattice and also for arbitrary finite subsets of Euclidean space which are the best possible with respect to the numbers of projections used.	convex set;discrete tomography;linear algebra;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Richard J.

In this paper, we reveal the relationship of neighbor systems with jump systems and with bisubmodular polyhedra. We firstly prove that for every neighbor system, there exists a jump system which has the same neighborhood structure as the original neighbor system. This statement shows that the concept of neighbor system is essentially equivalent to that of jump system. We then show that the convex closure of a neighbor system is an integral bisubmodular polyhedron. In addition, we give a characterization of neighbor systems using bisubmodular polyhedra. Finally, we consider the problem of minimizing a separable convex function on a neighbor system. By using the relationship between neighbor systems and jump systems shown in this paper, we prove that the problem can be solved in weakly-polynomial time for a class of neighbor systems.	convex function;convex hull;polyhedron;time complexity	Akiyoshi Shioura	2012	SIAM J.

5e6d23921da517605ed277e88755bbe867e125f8	many large eigenvalues in sparse graphs		It is shown that, in every family G of graphs that is closed under taking induced subgraphs and whose members have bounded average degree, the following properties are roughly equivalent for every G ∈ G: (a) G has many large eigenvalues; (b) G has many large negative eigenvalues; (c) G has many vertices of large degree. By a rough equivalence we mean that, in the quantitative version of the result, specifying the values of ‘‘how many’’ eigenvalues we want and ‘‘how large’’ they are, each implicationmay change these values by a constant factor. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Many large eigenvalues Let G = (V , E) be a graph of order n. The adjacency matrix of G is the matrix A(G) ∈ RV×V whose (v, u)-entry is equal to 1 if v is adjacent to u and 0 otherwise. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of G refer to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix. For i = 1, . . . , n, we let λi(G) be the ith largest and λ−i (G) the ith smallest eigenvalue of G (counting multiplicities). The largest eigenvalue ρ(G) = λ1(G) is also called the spectral radius of G. We refer to [2–4,7,9] for further notation, definitions, and basic results. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a graph would have many large eigenvalues. Intuitivelywe expect to get large eigenvalueswith vertices of large degree. This is true for the spectral radius of a graph but not necessarily for the other eigenvalues; an example is the complete graph Kn, whose largest eigenvalue is n − 1 (with multiplicity one), while all other eigenvalues are equal to −1. Therefore, even though having vertices of large degree is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient for having many large eigenvalues. In general, the way these vertices are located in the graph plays an essential role in determining if we have many large eigenvalues. The following results are known and easy to establish (see, e.g., [10]). E-mail addresses: mohar@sfu.ca, bojan.mohar@fmf.uni-lj.si. 0195-6698/$ – see front matter© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

If G is a graph and λt(G) ≥ s, then G contains at least t vertices of degree at least s. Proposition 1.2. If G is a graph with t vertices of degree at least s, such that any pair of these vertices are at distance at least 4 from each other, then λt(G) ≥ √ s. Proposition 1.2 shows that having many vertices of large degree that are at least four apart from each other guarantees having many large eigenvalues. The complete bipartite graph Kn,n shows that havingmany vertices of large degree at distance 2 from each other does not yield the same conclusion. The casewhen vertices of large degree aremutually at distance 3 from each other has been considered in [10], where it was shown that the following anomaly can occur. Proposition 1.3. For every positive integers s and t, there exists a graph that has t vertices of degree s that are mutually at distance 3 from each other and has at most two eigenvalues greater than 1. In this paper, we treat sparse graphs with a particular motivation to understand large eigenvalues of planar graphs. Our main result is the following rough characterization. Theorem 1.4. Let G be a graph such that the average degree of every subgraph of G is bounded. Then the following properties are roughly equivalent. (a) G has many large eigenvalues. (b) G has many large negative eigenvalues. (c) G has many vertices of large degree. Rough equivalence means that the quantitative version, which is given later as Theorem 3.1, specifies the values of ‘‘how many’’ eigenvalues we want, and ‘‘how large’’ they are, and then each implication among (a)–(c) is allowed to change these values by a constant factor, where the constants depend only on the bound on the maximum average degree.	adjacency matrix;anomaly detection;degree (graph theory);distance (graph theory);emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);induced subgraph;planar graph;rough set;sparse matrix;the matrix;turing completeness	Bojan Mohar	2013	Eur.

The problem of bounding Wn(p, q), and its natural hypergraph generalization, was introduced by Balogh, Bollobás, Morris and Riordan. Their main result, specialized to graphs, used algebraic methods to determine Wn(1, q). Our main results in this paper give exact bounds for Wn(p, q), its hypergraph analogue, as well as for a new variant of Bollobás’s Two Families Theorem. In particular, we completely determine Wn(p, q), showing that if 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ n then Wn(p, q) = n 2 − (n− p+ 1) + (q − p) . Our proof applies a reduction to a multi-partite version of the Two Families Theorem obtained by Alon. While the reduction is combinatorial, the main idea behind it is algebraic.	bollobás–riordan polynomial;graph (discrete mathematics);linear algebra	Guy Moshkovitz;Asaf Shapira	2015	J. Comb.

We investigate a conjecture of Chartrand, Geller, and Hedetniemi, that every planar graph can be edge-partitioned into two outerplanar subgraphs. We refute the stronger statement that every planarly embedded graph can be edge-partitioned into two outerplanar subgraphs, one of which is outerplanarly embedded. We give a method that yields outerplanar partitions of certain graphs not covered by previous results. We formulate a conjecture about 4-connected maximal planar graphs that implies the original conjecture. Finally, we verify a weaker form of the conjecture in which outerplanar subgraphs are replaced by subgraphs with no homeomorphs ofK4.	outerplanar graph	Kiran S. Kedlaya	1996	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

Sheehan/Discrete Mathematics 177 (1997) 123-144 The transform idea has proved very useful in examining the hamiltonian path/path structure of a graph. As far as we know it really originated with P6sa [9] in his paper on hamiltonian circuits. It is used in the proof of Beck's theorem [1] on the size Ramsey number of a path and again by Thomason [2, p. 146] in his parity path theorem generalizing Smith's theorem [10]. It features prominently in the work of Hendry [6-8] which is the starting point for this paper. Let U (= k) denote the set of graphs G such that there exists some fixed vertex v with In(v;u)l = k for all uE V(G) (u ~ v). U (<~k) and U (~>k) are defined in the obvious way. Hendry proved in [6,7] that if G E U (= 1) then T(G;v) was acyclic; furthermore in [8] it is proved that if G E U (= 1 ) then qG = (3nG 3)/2 where nc and qG are, respectively, the number of vertices and edges of G. In this paper we examine the structure of T(G;P). The main results are: Theorem 3. Let G be a graph. Let T = T(G;P). Suppose that nT>>.k>~l and G E U ( <~ k ). Then qT ~< (nr(4 + log k))/2 k (logarithms are to the base 2 unless stated otherwise). Corollary 4. Let G E U ( <<.k) (k~>l). Then, for some vE V(G), 2qG ~<(5 + logk)nG -(logk + 7 deg G v). Theorem 9. Let GE U (~<2). Then either T(G;P)E {P1,P2,P3, C6} or qr <~ 5nr 2 (P3 is the path o f length 2 and C6 the cycle o f length 6). Corollary 10. Let G E U (= 2). Then, for some vE V(G), qG ~< ~(7n6 + 2 deg c v 11 ).

This parameter is in the range $0 leq Deltaleq {n}/{2}-2.$ The algorithm is a refinement of the face-counting algorithm; thus, in particular, the size of the grid is at most $(f-2)times(f-2).$ The above bound on the grid size simultaneously matches or improves all previously known bounds for convex drawings, in particular Schnyderu0027s and the recent Zhang and He bound for triangulations and the Chrobak and Kant bound for 3-connected planar graphs. The algorithm takes linear time. The drawing algorithm has been implemented and tested. The expected grid size for the drawing of a random triangulation is close to $frac{7}{8}ntimesfrac{7}{8}n.$ For a random 3-connected plane graph, tests show that the expected size of the drawing is $frac{3}{4}ntimesfrac{3}{4}n.$	convex function;convex optimization;planar graph;vertex (graph theory)	Günter Rote	2005	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-006-0177-6	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computational geometry;graph theory;mathematics;geometry;data visualization;algorithm;planar graph	Theory	30.338028416171017	20.877108928532177	99561

1d9a65b9170a7a4dadc653ccae782ea58e7cc955	metric learning for graph-based label propgation		The efficiency of graph-based semi-supervised algorithms depends on the graph of instances on which they are applied. The instances are often in a vectorial form before a graph linking them is built. The construction of the graph relies on a metric over the vectorial space that help define the weight of the connection between entities. The classic choice for this metric is usually a distance measure or a similarity measure based on the euclidean norm. We claim that in some cases the euclidean norm on the initial vectorial space might not be the more appropriate to solve the task efficiently. We propose an algorithm that aims at learning the most appropriate vectorial representation for building a graph on which the task at hand is solved efficiently.	algorithm;entity;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;similarity measure;vector graphics	Pauline Wauquier;Mikaela Keller	2015	CoRR		lattice graph;graph power;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;topology;graph bandwidth;null graph;graph property;metric k-center;machine learning;mathematics;voltage graph;graph;critical graph;random geometric graph;quartic graph;complement graph;strength of a graph	ML	30.153522668620216	23.535763122672076	100311
ef5c3225eca2d33159b30e354e69827f76ee69d8	drawing partially embedded and simultaneously planar graphs		We investigate the problem of constructing planar drawings with few bends for two related problems, the partially embedded graph PEG problem--to extend a straight-line planar drawing of a subgraph to a planar drawing of the whole graph--and the simultaneous planarity SEFE problem--to find planar drawings of two graphs that coincide on shared vertices and edges. In both cases we show that if the required planar drawings exist, then there are planar drawings with a linear number of bends per edge and, in the case of simultaneous planarity, a constant number of crossings between every pair of edges. Our proofs provide efficient algorithms if the combinatorial embedding information about the drawing is given. Our result on partially embedded graph drawing generalizes a classic result of Pach and Wenger showing that any planar graph can be drawn with fixed locations for its vertices and with a linear number of bends per edge.	embedded system;planar graph	Timothy M.

0684e0ef96b119db4ae514d7026dc36732f0312d	hyperbanana graphs		A bar-and-joint framework is a finite set of points together with specified distances between selected pairs. In rigidity theory we seek to understand when the remaining pairwise distances are also fixed. If there exists a pair of points which move relative to one another while maintaining the given distance constraints, the framework is flexible; otherwise, it is rigid. Counting conditions due to Maxwell give a necessary combinatorial criterion for generic minimal barand-joint rigidity in all dimensions. Laman showed that these conditions are also sufficient for frameworks in R. However, the flexible “double banana” shows that Maxwell’s conditions are not sufficient to guarantee rigidity in R. We present a generalization of the double banana to a family of hyperbananas. In dimensions 3 and higher, these are (infinitesimally) flexible, providing counterexamples to the natural generalization	circuit rank;embedded system;maxwell (microarchitecture);random graph;randomized algorithm;wolfram mathematica	Christopher Clement;Audrey Lee-St. John;Jessica Sidman	2013				Theory	39.10471850923524	23.049910607029457	100610

Several polynomial-time approximation algorithms have been designed previously in the literature. Their best known performance ratio is O(r ln n) where r is the link radius of the sensor network and n is the number of sensors. In this paper, we will present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms. The first one is a random algorithm, with probability 1 - ε, producing an approximation solution with performance ratio O(log3 n log log n), independent from r. The second one is a deterministic approximation with performance ratio O(r), independent from n.	approximation algorithm;computation;connectivity (graph theory);deterministic algorithm;hybrid algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;polynomial;quality of service;randomized algorithm;randomness;sensor;steiner tree problem;stemming;time complexity	Lidong Wu;Hongwei Du;Weili Wu;Deying Li;Jing Lv;Wonjun Lee	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566910	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;wireless sensor network;vertex cover;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;connected dominating set;mathematics;hardness of approximation;computational complexity theory;minimax approximation algorithm;approximation algorithm;minimum k-cut;approximation theory	Theory	24.669041116119544	20.30487006840477	100688

It is a 3D variant of Nonogram, which is a popular pencil-and-paper puzzle. While Nonogram provides a rectangular grid of squares that must be filled in to create a picture, Picross 3D presents a rectangular parallelepiped (i.e., rectangular box) made of unit cubes, some of which must be removed to construct an image in three dimensions. Each row or column has at most one integer on it, and the integer indicates how many cubes in the corresponding 1D slice remain when the image is complete. It is shown by Kusano et al. that Picross 3D is NP-complete. We in this paper show that the fewest clues problem of Picross 3D is Σ2 -complete and that the counting version and the another solution problem of Picross 3D are #P-complete and NP-complete, respectively. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation → Theory and algorithms for application domains	algorithm;cuboid;fibre channel protocol;karp's 21 np-complete problems;np-completeness;nonogram;olap cube;occam's razor;p-complete;picross 3d;regular grid;sharp-p-complete;theory of computation	Kei Kimura;Takuya Kamehashi;Toshihiro Fujito	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2018.25	combinatorics;computer science	AI	30.396854561343496	23.164636053910897	100767

Obviously the power graph of any group is always connected, because the identity element of the group is adjacent to all other vertices. In the present paper, among other results, we will find the number of spanning trees of the power graph associated with specific finite groups. We also determine, up to isomorphism, the structure of a finite group $G$ whose power graph has exactly $n$ spanning trees, for $nu003c5^3$. Finally, we show that the alternating group $mathbb{A}_5$ is uniquely determined by tree-number of its power graph among all finite simple groups.	file spanning;spanning tree	A. R. Moghaddamfar;S.

The algorithm is baaed on constructing a relatively sparse graph, a “pathnet”, that links selected pairs of subdivision vertices (and “critical points of entry”) with locally optimal paths. The pathnet can be searched for pat hs that are provably close to optimal and approach optimal, as one varies the parameter that controls the sparsity of the pathnet. We analyze our algorithm both analytically and experimentally. We report on the results of a set of experiments comparing the new algorithm with other standard methods.	algorithm;experiment;local optimum;planar straight-line graph;polyhedron;sparse matrix;subdivision surface	Cristian S.

Two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if its respective boxes contain the opposite representative element. We focus our study on the case where boxes (and therefore representative elements) associated to vertices are spread in R. We give both, a combinatorial and an intersection characterization of the model. Based on these characterizations, we determine graph families that contain the model (e. g., boxicity 2 graphs) and others that the new model contains (e. g., rooted directed path). We also study the particular case where each representative element is the center of its respective box. In this particular case, we provide constructive representations for interval, block and outerplanar graphs. Finally, we show that the general and the particular model are not equivalent by constructing a graph family that separates the two cases.

Some special cases of the Problem 540 are discussed. These are: all T1 spaces, the lower Vietoris topology of any hyperspace, the Scott topology for reverse inclusion on any hyperspace, and upper Vietoris topologies on certain bitopological spaces. We find in all these cases that Tdd = Tdddd, and therefore at most four distinct topologies, T, Td, Tdd, Tddd, can be created by iterating the dual operator starting with one of these special cases. 1571-0661/$ – see front matter c © Elsevier Ltd 10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80033-7	iterated function;network topology;scott continuity;spaces	Bruce S.

The families with matching number $1$ are called intersecting. The famous Erd\H os-Ko-Rado theorem determines the size of the largest intersecting family of $k$-sets. Its generalization to the families with larger matching numbers, known under the name of the Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, is still open for a wide range of parameters. In this paper, we address the degree versions of both theorems. More precisely, we give degree and $t$-degree versions of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado and the Hilton-Milner theorems, extending the results of Huang and Zhao, and Frankl, Han, Huang and Zhao. We also extend the range in which the degree version of the Erd\H{o}s Matching conjecture holds.	han unification;matching (graph theory)	Andrey Kupavskii	2018	CoRR		conjecture;combinatorics;mathematics;disjoint sets;family of sets	Theory	29.878148564267846	25.336475832652955	101211

Moreover, the structure \({\mathcal {D}}'(B')\) induced on \(B'\) is the q-fold multiple of an affine plane \({\mathcal {A}}'\) which is determined by an extension set for the affine plane \(B \cong AG(2,q)\). In particular, this new approach will result in a purely theoretical construction of the two known counterexamples to Hamada’s conjecture for the case \(\mathrm {AG}_2(3,4)\), which were discovered by Harada et al. [7] as the result of a computer search; a recent alternative construction, again via a computer search, is in [23]. On the other hand, we also prove that extension sets cannot possibly give any further counterexamples to Hamada’s conjecture for the case of affine designs with the parameters of some \(\mathrm {AG}_2(3,q)\); thus the two counterexamples for \(q=4\) might be truly sporadic. This seems to be the first result which establishes the validity of Hamada’s conjecture for some infinite class of affine designs of a special type. Nevertheless, affine designs which are that close to the classical geometric examples are of interest in themselves, and we provide both theoretical and computational results for some particular types of extension sets. Specifically, we obtain a theoretical construction for one of the two affine designs with the parameters of \(\mathrm {AG}_2(3,3)\) and 3-rank 11 and for an affine design with the parameters of \(\mathrm {AG}_2(3,4)\) and 2-rank 17 (in both cases, just one more than the rank of the classical example).

In particular, we prove that for any positive integer k, every finite set of points in R3 can be colored with k colors so that every translate of the negative octant containing at least k6 points contains at least one of each color. The best previously known bound was doubly exponential in k. This yields, among other corollaries, the first polynomial bound for the decomposability of multiple coverings by homothetic triangles. We also investigate related decomposition problems involving intervals appearing on a line. We prove that no algorithm can dynamically maintain a decomposition of a multiple covering by intervals under insertion of new intervals, even in a semi-online model, in which some coloring decisions can be delayed. This implies that a wide range of sweeping plane algorithms cannot guarantee any bound even for special cases of the octant problem.		Jean Cardinal;Kolja B.

And because paths between two terminals are so basic, it is natural to pattern this generalization around the traditional pa th / cu t duality as in max-cut min-flow analysis or matroid theory. So that our generalization can preserve the most characteristic features of this tradit ional duality, we shall formulate it as a syntactical duali ty principle, as in [7] (based upon [3]). This logical formulat ion corresponds to Minty 's 'colored arc lemma' [9] and so to a variety of applications in circuit theory beginning with [8] and surveyed in [13]. As an example of this approach, Section 2 below will generalize a self-dual characterization of series-parallel to the three-terminal context, much as studied in [10] and [11].	data-flow analysis;fenchel's duality theorem;graph theory;matroid;maxima and minima;maximum cut;multiseat configuration;network analysis (electrical circuits);series-parallel graph	Terry A.

The weights and constraints we consider are embodied in the definition of a """"system,"""" which includes weighted multiset systems as a simple special case. Three topics are discussed. First, we derive a composition formula valid for all systems, which specializes to composition formulas for familiar combinatorial structures in many cases. Second, we extend the Heilmann-Lieb theorem on matching polynomials to a similar statement valid for more general factors of multigraphs. Finally, we introduce a multi-analogue of the order polynomial of a labelled poset, and by applying our general composition theorem give a formula for the effect of composition of labelled posers on their E-polynomials. Key words, matching polynomials, set systems, order polynomials AMS subject classifications. 05A15, 30C15, 26C10 Introduction. Rook polynomials and matching polynomials have attracted much interest since their introduction in the 1940s and 1970s, respectively [12, 11]. In part this is due to the fact that their coefficients are analogues of Stirling numbers of the second kind and retain many properties of these numbers in a more general setting. Another source of interest in these and related polynomials is their connection with certain models in statistical mechanics (e.g., the Ising model and Potts models [1], models of adhesion of dimers [11], and models of r-electron bonding in aromatic molecules [8]). The location of zeros of these polynomials translates into information about phase transitions or energy spectra of the physical systems being modelled. Harper [10] showed that the """"Stirling polynomials"""" k S(n,k)tk have only real zeros. Heilmann and Lieb [11] proved an analogous result for the matching polynomial of any finite graph. As a special case of one of our main results (Theorem 3.1) we obtain an appealing generalization of the Heilmann-Lieb theorem to more general factors of multigraphs (Theorem 3.3). As is well known (Theorem (51) of [9]), the d ti fact that a polynomial -]i=0 ai has only real zeros implies that the sequence {a{}0 2 >a_ for alli 1,.. d 1. When is logarithmically concave; that is, that a{ a+1 all the a are nonnnegative, it also implies that {a}0 is unimodal; that is, there is an index k such that ao <_ <_ ak _ _ ad. Theorem 3.3 therefore implies many combinatorially interesting inequalities. In fact, the research reported here began with Theorem 3.3 and grew out of an effort to extend it in the same way that 4 of [21] extends the Heilmann-Lieb theorem. In order to develop a definition of the composition of objects which was general enough to cover the case of weighted multigraphs, we found it convenient to introduce the concept of a """"system."""" This abstraction is the focus of 1 and loosely can be thought of as a weighted collection of multisets with specified """"interference"""" among its members. The related """"multipartition series"""" is a generating series which encodes the information about a system which is relevant to the questions we have in Received by the editors October 3, 1994; accepted for publication (in revised form) October 10, 1995.

A complete bipartite subgraph of a graph G is called a biclique of G. In this paper, we study the problem of finding the maximum edge-cardinality biclique in convex bipartite graphs. Given a bipartite graph G = (A,B,E) which is convex on B, we present a new algorithm that computes the maximum edge-cardinality biclique of G in O(n log3 n log log n) time and O(n) space, where n = |A|.

Our methods actually find B,C in polynomial time if they exist. The behaviour of the problem as well as our solution depend on the cycle transversal number τ (D) of D, i.e. the smallest cardinality of a set T of vertices in D such that D-T is acyclic: If τ (D)≥3 then we employ McCuaig’s framework on intercyclic digraphs to (always) find these cycles. If τ (D) = 2 then we can characterize the digraphs for which the answer is “yes” by using topological methods relying on Thomassen’s theorem on 2-linkages in acyclic digraphs. For the case τ (D)≤1 we provide an algorithm independent from any earlier work.	directed graph	Jørgen Bang-Jensen;Matthias Kriesell	2011	Combinatorica	10.1007/s00493-011-2670-z	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	25.67163747705066	23.558152713104658	102332

A related object, the solenoid, is also explored . Computer programs are given for Cantor cheese and solenoid construction . 1 . CANTOR CHEESE The term Cantor cheese was used by Stewart ( I )to describe an artistically interesting analog of the Cantor set described by Mandelbrot[2] . As background, a Cantor set can be constructed by taking an interval of length I and removing its middle third (but leaving the end points of this middle third) . This leaves two smaller intervals, one-third as long . The middle thirds of these smaller segments are removed and the process is repeated : The fractal dimension of this particular Cantor dust after many iterations is less than I since D = log 2/ log 3 = 0.63 . Cantor dusts with other fractal dimensions can easily be created by removing different sizes (or numbers) of intervals from the starting interval of length 1 . A topologically similar set starts with a circular disc . Everything except for two smaller discs is removed . Here we use pairs of circles rather than pairs of lines, and the subdivisions are repeated as with the Cantor set described above. We retain only those points inside the circles . Fig . 1 is a picture of this Cantor cheese with each circle's radius slightly less than half of the previous generation's radius. (The term """"generation"""" refers to the nesting level of the circles ; see pseudocode in Program l .) If we consider just the line along the diameter, the fractal dimension for the set of points is close to 1 . Smaller fractal dimensions are obtained by using circles which are further shrunken and separated, e.g. : 337 Chaos and Graphics Fig. I is a cross section taken at the front of the object in Fig . 2 . In Fig. 2, the nested circles are represented as nested cylinders for artistic purposes . (Some generations are represented by cones to show the interior nested structures.) A graphics supercomputer . such as a Stellar GS 1000, allows models of the Cantor cheese to be rotated, shaded, and magnified in real time . For readers who wish to display cross-sections of the Cantor Cheese, a computer program pseudocode is given in Program 1 . Note that if recursive computer program languages are used, the pseudocode for generating the cheese cross sections can be simplified (Program 2) . 2. DESCRIPTION OF A VARIABLE DIMENSION CHEESE It is possible to create a 3-D representation of the Cantor cheese such that the fractal dimension corresponding to the cross-section continuously decreases 3 3 8 CLIFFORD A .

Fig. 3 . Solenoid, first stage. The initial toms is shown as a mesh cage . from front to back of the figure. Instead of cylinders, nested spire-like objects can be used which taper along the z-direction. If one were to slice into such a figure, each cross-section has a different fractal dimension . The front face, corresponding to D 1, looks like Fig. I . The back cross-section resembles the second in-line figure in this paper. Nested circles still form the crosssections of nested spires, but the nested circles separate as the dimension decreases. The first enclosing circle does not change size, and so it generates a cylinder. The two smaller circles inside change their sizes in direct proportion to the shrinkage factor, and so form cones . At the next level, the shrinkage factor is applied twice, so the diameters vary as the square of the shrinkage factor. This form, instead of a cone, resembles a conical-shaped spire similar to a surface of revolution generated by a parabola-like a tall tent . As the nesting level of cirlces increases, the shapes formed along the third dimension are narrower spires with profiles generated by cubics, quartics, and so on . The spires are not, strictly speaking, surfaces of revolution . The centers of circles of cross-section, as wouldbe centers of rotation, are not in general straight line segments . We call these centers of the spires spines. As mentioned above, the enclosing circle does not change size, so its center does follow a straight line Visualizing Cantor cheese construction Fig. 4. Solenoid, second stage. The mapping is iterated to the second level of nesting. along the z-axis. The centers of the two circles at the next level, also lie along straight lines parallel to the taxis. At each succeeding stage, the two centers of the next stage are located along a diameter, halfway between the center and the edge. Thus the centers are located according to the following scheme : 339 Each choice of sign in one of these formulas locates a particular spire's center, and describes the spinal curve as a function of z . Clearly the location of the spine of a spire at level k is given by a polynomial of degree (k I) in the shrinkage factor z. The radius of the corresponding cross-section circle is ?. We have created a 3-D representation of variabledimension cheese, but the rendering of these spires is not particularly striking or informative, and so is omitted. A simple two-dimensional plot of the polynomial curves above is sufficient to give a correct impression of the shape . Indeed, a similar figure appears in Mandelbrot [ 2 ] (p. 81) . 3. THE SOLENOID, A COUSIN OF THE CANTOR SET The solenoid is a topological construction which arises from, and is related to, the Cantor set. It is one of the principal examples of a strange attractor in dynamical systems theory . In this paper, we do not dwell on its intersting topological properties, for that would run to too many pages (see [ t, S, 6 ] for further reading) . Instead, we develop some formulas which help to elucidate its self-similar structure, and allow computer graphical generation of images which are pleasing in their simplicity and grace, yet sufficiently complex to intrigue the eye .

Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are connected by an edge. A clique of a graph is a set of vertices, all of which are pairwise adjacent. The maximum clique problem asks for cliques of maximum cardinality in a graph; this problem is well-known to be NP-complete [2].

This problem arises in Volumetric Intensity-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for radiation cancer treatment, where the circular structure represents a delivery arc path of 360? around the patient and the matrices represent the radiation fluence maps at selected delivery angles on that path. By computing the minimum k matrices, the CMM algorithm produces a most efficient delivery plan that meets clinical requirements. Based on dynamic programming and computing a set of k-link shortest paths, we present a polynomial time algorithm for the CMM problem, improving the quality and efficiency of VMAT delivery.	algorithm;capability maturity model;computational complexity theory;dynamic programming;ibm notes;mathematical optimization;modulation;shortest path problem	Danny Ziyi Chen;David Craft;Lin Yang	2015	Theor.

For example, we prove that adjacency matrices are identification matrices for all bipartite graphs. We also study the application of the theory of identification matrices to solving the graph isomorphism problem, a famous open problem. We show that, given two graphs represented by two identification matrices with respect to a certain relation, isomorphism can be decided efficiently if at least one matrix satisfies the consecutive 1's property or a relaxed property thereof. Graphs which have identification matrices satisfying the consecutive 1's property include, among others, proper interval graphs and doubly convex bipartite graphs. This work leads to the first efficient isomorphism testing algorithms for certain classes of graphs and more efficient algorithms for some other classes of graphs. The algorithms for some classes of graphs including convex bipartite graphs run in linear time and are optimal. 1999 Academic	adjacency matrix;algorithm;graph isomorphism problem;system identification;time complexity	Lin H Chen	1999	J.

The classical Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem determines the cardinality and structure of a maximum induced K 2 -free subgraph in KG n , k . As a generalization of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, Erdős proposed a conjecture about the maximum cardinality of an induced K s + 1 -free subgraph of KG n , k . As the best known result concerning this conjecture, Frankl (2013) [15] , when n ≥ ( 2 s + 1 ) k − s , gave an affirmative answer to this conjecture and also determined the structure of such a subgraph. In this paper, generalizing the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem and the Erdős matching conjecture, we consider the problem of determining the structure of a maximum family A for which KG n , k [ A ] has no subgraph isomorphic to a given graph G . In this regard, we determine the size and structure of such a family provided that n is sufficiently large with respect to G and k . Furthermore, for the case G = K 1 , t , we present a Hilton–Milner type theorem regarding above-mentioned problem, which specializes to an improvement of a result by Gerbner et al.

f3d98a3435c7fbce022f7337662582b96dc7b770	a note on multipivot quicksort		We analyse a generalisation of the Quicksort algorithm, where k uniformly at random chosen pivots are used for partitioning an array of n distinct keys. Specifically, the expected cost of this scheme is obtained, under the assumption of linearity of the cost needed for the partition process. The integration constants of the expected cost are computed using Vandermonde matrices.	algorithm;quicksort;vandermonde matrix	Vasileios Iliopoulos	2014	CoRR	10.1080/02522667.2017.1303947	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	37.32592549061915	19.42352541174743	103135

This operation is well-known in graph theory. Let G = (V + s; E + F ) be a graph which isk-edge-connected in V and suppose that jF j is even. HereF denotes the set of edges incident with s. Lovász [12] proved that if k 2 then the edges inF can be split off in pairs preserving the k-edge-connectivity inV . This result was recently extended to the case where a bipartition R [ Q = V is given and every split edge must connectR andQ [4]. In this paper we investigate an even more general problem, where two disjo int subsetsR;Q V are given and the goal is to split off (a largest possible subset of) th e edges ofF preserving k-edge-connectivity inV in such a way that every split edge incident with a vertex from R has the other end-vertex inQ. Motivated by connectivity augmentation problems, we introduce another extension, the so-called split completionversion of our problem. Here a smallest set F of edges incident tos has to be found for which all the edges of F + F can be split off in the augmented graphG = (V + s; E + F + F ) preservingk-edge-connectivity and in such a way that every split edge incident with a vertex fromR has the other end-vertex in Q. We solve each of the above extensions when k is even: we give min-max formulae and polynomial algorithms to find the optima. For the case when k is odd we show how to find a solution to the split completion problem using at most two edges more than the o ptimum.	algorithm;edge dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;k-edge-connected graph;maxima and minima;polynomial	Jørgen Bang-Jensen;Tibor Jordán	2004	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(03)00291-7	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;multiple edges;graph theory;mixed graph;multigraph;edge cover;cycle graph;mathematics	Theory	24.913189196915265	24.458367408297516	103342

For a fixed element x, the neighbourhood of X, N(x), is the multiset of unordered pairs which appear in triples with x. We usually interpret N(x) as the edges of a multigraph. Then it is natural to ask which multigraphs are neighbourhoods in triple systems. First, it is evident that the neighbourhood is always a I-regular multigraph. There are other necessary conditions, however. For a l-regular, n-vertex multigraph to be a neighbourhood, elementary counting gives the necessary congruence conditions, An = 0 (mod 2) and An(n 1) E An (mod 6) (these are just the conditions for a B[3, A; n + I] to exist). There is also a structural necessary condition.	congruence of squares;multigraph;neighbourhood (graph theory)	Charles J. Colbourn	1989	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

How to find the convex hull is an important and challenging problem. Although many algorithms had been proposed for that, most of them can only tackle the problem in two or three dimensions and the biggest issue is that those algorithms rely on the samples' coordinates to find the convex hull. In this paper, we propose an approximation algorithm named FVDM, which only utilizes the information of the samples' distance matrix to find the convex hull. Experiments demonstrate that FVDM can effectively identify the vertices of the convex hull.	approximation algorithm;computation;computational geometry;convex hull;distance matrix;vertex (geometry)	Jinhong Zhong;Ke Tang;A.

Given a planar graph with a certain partition of the vertices into blocks of size r, for a given integer r, the problem consists of deciding if s colors are sufficient to color the vertices of the graph such that vertices of the same block have the same color and vertices of two adjacent blocks have different colors. In this paper, we prove that given a 5-regular graph, deciding if there exists a 4-coloration is NP-complete. Also, we propose conditional NP-completeness results for the Empire Problem when the graph is a collection of stars. A star is a graph isomorphic to K1,q for some q ≥ 1. More exactly, we prove that for r ≥ 2, if the (2r− 1)-coloring problem in 2r-regular connected graphs is NP-complete, then the Empire Problem for blocks of size r+1 and s = 2r− 1 is NP-complete for forests of K1,r . Moreover, we prove that this result holds for r = 2. Also for r ≥ 3, if the r-coloring problem in (r + 1)-regular graphs is NP-complete, then the Empire Problem for blocks of size r+1 and s = r is NP-complete for forests of K1,1 = K2, i.e., forest of edges. Additionally, we prove that this result is valid for r = 2 and r = 3. Finally, we prove that these results are the best possible, that is for smallest value of s or r, the Empire Problem in these classes of graphs becomes polynomial.	a* search algorithm;color;genus (mathematics);graph coloring;map;np-completeness;planar graph;polynomial;vertex (geometry)	Basile Couëtoux;Jérôme Monnot;Sonia Toubaline	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31770-5_7	combinatorics;np-complete;computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	27.866033913808433	26.516872364336084	103786

Let κ be an uncountable cardinal and let μ ≤ κ be regular. A set A ⊆ κ∩cof(μ) is said to carry a partial square if there exists a sequence ⟨cα : α ∈ A⟩ such that each cα is club in α with order type μ, and for all γ which is a common limit point of cα and cβ , cα ∩ γ = cβ ∩ γ. Such a sequence is called a partial square sequence. It was shown by Shelah [6] that if μ < κ are regular cardinals, then there exists a stationary subset of κ ∩ cof(μ) which carries a partial square. In a model of Magidor [4] which satisfies a strong form of stationary set reflection, there is no stationary subset of א2 ∩ cof(א1) which carries a partial square (this was pointed out by several authors; see [7] and [5]). The exact consistency result was obtained in [3], where we showed that the existence of a greatly Mahlo cardinal is equiconsistent with the statement that for some regular uncountable cardinal κ, there is no stationary subset of κ ∩ cof(κ) which carries a partial square. In this paper we demonstrate how to obtain models in which there are successive cardinals with no partial square. Specifically, starting with an increasing sequence ⟨κn : 1 ≤ n < ω⟩ of supercompact cardinals, we collapse each κn to become אn+1 in such a way that in the final model, for all 1 ≤ n < ω there is no stationary subset of אn+1 ∩ cof(אn) which carries a partial square.	stationary process	John Krueger	2014	Arch.

An edge ranking of a graph is optimal if the number of labels used is minimum among all edge rankings. As the problem of finding optimal edge rankings for general graphs is NP-hard [12], it is interesting to concentrate on special classes of graphs and find optimal edge rankings for them efficiently. Apart from trees and complete graphs, little has been known about special classes of graphs for which the problem can be solved in polynomial time. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal edge ranking for a complete-bipartite graph by using the dynamic programming strategy.	algorithm;dynamic programming;np-hardness;p (complexity);polynomial;time complexity	Ruo-Wei Hung	2006	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1309	1-planar graph;pathwidth;complete bipartite graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;robertson–seymour theorem;cograph;independent set;topology;bipartite graph;dense graph;edge cover;graph coloring;mathematics;tree-depth;blossom algorithm;maximal independent set;chordal graph;matching	Theory	25.115961259522894	23.593193307571152	104400

C , being denoted by N(C). The density of the edge neighborhood N(C) can be set as the ratio ( | N ( C ) | / ( | C | ? | V ? C | ) ).This paper addresses maximum/minimum edge neighborhood and neighborhood density cliques in G. Two versions will be undertaken, by fixing, or not, the size of the cliques.From an optimization point of view these problems do not bring much novelty, as they can be seen as particular or special versions of weighted clique problems. However, from a practical point of view, they concentrate on certain kinds of properties of cliques, rather than their size, revealing clique's engagement in the graph. In fact, a maximum edge neighborhood clique should be strongly embraced in the graph, while a minimum edge neighborhood clique should reveal an almost isolated strong component. In particular, special versions of the new problems allow to distinguish among cliques of the same size, namely among possible tied maximum cliques in the graph.We propose node based formulations for these edge based clique related problems. Using these models, we present computational results and suggest applications where the new problems can bring additional insights.

An m-DCS(v, λ) is α-resolvable if its directed cycles can be partitioned into classes such that each point of the design occurs in precisely α cycles in each class. The necessary conditions for the existence of such a design are m | αv and α | λ(v−1).

N is structurally m-live if there exists an initial marking M0 such that (N, M0) is m-live. Three new siphon-based characterizations for these properties are obtained: (1) For a weighted net N, the ST-property (i.e., every siphon contains a trap) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for N to be structurally m-live. (2) For a weighted net N, a necessary but not sufficient condition for (N, M0) to be m-live is that every siphon of N contains an M0-controlled trap (i.e., for every reachable marking M, the trap contains a place whose token value is not smaller than the least weight of its outgoing arcs). (3) A homogeneous asymmetric choice net (N, M0) is m-live if and only if every minimal siphon of N contains an M0-controlled trap. Characterization (3) is a generalization of Commoner's Theorem from ordinary liveness for ordinary free choice nets to m-liveness for homogeneous asymmetric choice nets.	liveness;petri net	Li Jiao;To-Yat Cheung	2003	Int.

In 2011 the author proved the same assertion for polyhedra in R 4. In this paper, we prove that the same result is true in arbitrary dimension n ≥ 3. Moreover, we show that this is true not only for simplicial polyhedra, but for all polyhedra with triangular 2-faces. As a corollary, we obtain the proof in arbitrary dimension of the well-known Bellows Conjecture posed by Connelly in 1978. This conjecture claims that the volume of any flexible polyhedron is constant. Moreover, we obtain the following stronger result. If Pt, t ∈ [0, 1], is a continuous deformation of a polyhedron such that the combinatorial type of Pt does not change and every 2-face of Pt remains congruent to the corresponding face of P 0 , then the volume of Pt is constant.

a12f9ee47b8a29c5f5aa6110ab2cc7b94dd88c8c	lower bounds for heuristic algorithms		The constraint satisfaction problem, the Boolean satisfiability problem and the graph isomorphism problem do not have efficient algorithms. In order to solve these problems, one utilizes heuristic algorithms of polynomial running time. The present thesis studies three classical heuristics for the above-mentioned decision problems and answers the question whether they can be implemented more efficient than with the fastest known algorithms. The k-consistency heuristic for the constraint satisfaction problem tries to establish local consistency by iteratively propagating new constraints and can be implemented time O(n2k). We show that the degree of the polynomial that bounds the running time has to increase linear in k. To achieve this, we prove for a fixed constant c > 0 that there is no algorithm of running time O(nck) that decides whether k-consistency can be established. Furthermore, we analyze the propagation process of k-consistency algorithms and prove optimal lower bounds on the number of nested propagation steps. One heuristic for the Boolean satisfiability problem is to find resolution refutations in which every clause contains at most k literals. Such refutations of width k can be found in time O(nk+1) by a simple search procedure. We show for a fixed constant c > 0, that it cannot be decided in time O(nck) whether a given formula has a resolution refutation of width k. The lower bounds on the time complexity for k-consistency and bounded width resolution do not rely on complexity theoretic assumptions and demonstrate one of the rare examples where the deterministic time hierarchy theorem can be applied to natural decision problems. The color refinement heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem computes a stable coloring of the vertices of a graph by iteratively refining the color classes. By refining the color classes in a clever order, the color refinement procedure can be implemented in time O(m log n) on connected graphs with n vertices and m edges. We show that this refining strategy is optimal. To prove this, we construct graphs where every possible order of refining operations needs at least Ω(m log n) computation steps.	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem;color;computation;computational complexity theory;constraint satisfaction problem;dtime;decision problem;fastest;graph coloring;graph isomorphism problem;heuristic (computer science);local consistency;planar graph;polynomial;refinement (computing);resolution (logic);software propagation;time complexity;time hierarchy theorem;vertex (geometry)	Christoph Berkholz	2014			mathematical optimization;mathematics;heuristic	Theory	27.10797626646371	19.586381819400653	105149

Such a partition Π = {D1, D2, . . . , Dd} is called a minimal dominating d-partition if Π contains the maximum number of minimal dominating sets, where the maximum is taken over all d-partitions of G. The minimal dominating d-partition number Λ(G) is the number of minimal dominating sets in a minimal dominating d-partition of G.

879170a95783c41edbb054140b8e96740e103ae3	on a ramsey-type problem		Suppose G is a graph* satisfying the property that if one colors the edges of G in r colors there always is a monochromatic triangle. Is it true that if one colors the edges of G in r + 1 colors so that every vertex is incident to at most r colors then there must be a monochromatic triangle? In this paper, we solve the above problem, which was raised by Erdbs, by showing that there is a graph G so that any 2-coloring of G contains a monochromatic triangle but there is a 3-coloring of G without a mone chromatic triangle so that every vertex is incident to at most two colors. A similar solution was independently obtained by H. Enomoto [ 31. This problem came up in connection with some work of Erdos, Hajnal, Szemeredi, and Sos [see 41. In particular, the following interesting problem still remains unsolved Let n, be the smallest integer for which if one colors the edges of K(n,) by r colors, there always is a monochromatic triangle, Is it true that if one colors the edges of K(n,) by r + 1 colors so that every vertex is incident to at most r colors then there must be a monochromatic triangle? Note that this is true for r = 2 since it is easy to check that any 3-coloring of K6 without a monochromatic triangle must contain a vertex incident to 3 colors.	andrás hajnal;color;monochromatic triangle;monochrome	Fan Chung Graham	1983	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.3190070110	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Theory	30.492038521118243	26.690944087240673	105560

However, CORRESP and CORMU output is different from that of mca function. The aim of this short note is showing how to obtain from mca function results compatible with those achieved with SAS or SPAD. A modified code is proposed in order to obtain the same coordinate system computed by SAS and SPAD. Moreover, the computation of the contributions of the levels of the factors to the inertia explained by each axis, the squared cosine of each factor level and the re-evaluation of the inertia explained by each axis have been added in order to improve the interpretations of the results of the decomposition.

The MWDS seeks a subset of the vertices of the graph with minimum total weight such that each vertex of the graph is either in the subset or adjacent to some nodes in the subset. A weight function is called smooth, if the ratio of the weights of any two adjacent nodes is upper bounded by a constant. MWDS is known to be NP-hard.

In the first section, an association between a vector space of matrices and two-edge-connected graphs is developed. The transfer of various properties of graphs to matrices and of matrices to graphs is then considered. In the second section the utility of the association developed in Section 1 is indicated by showing how the algebraic representation may be used, as a tool, to deduce rather interesting results concerning the structure of the associated graphs.

An optimal floor plan among these slicing structures is one that minimizes an object function, while satisfying the shape constraints of all blocks represented by the points. The object function must be a non-decreasing function of the height and the width of the floor plan. Area is just one such function.

A (deterministic) graph G is (t, S)-proportional if for every H E S, the number of induced subgraphs of G isomorphic to H equals the expected number of induced copies of H in the random graph G,,,, where n = IV(G)I. Let S, = {all graphs on k vertices}, in particular S, = { K 3 , P,, K , K , , 0,). The notion of proportional graphs stems from the study of random graphs (Barbour, Karonski, and Rucinski, J. Combinat. Th. Ser. B, 47, 125-145, 1989; Janson and Nowicki, Prob. Th. Rel. Fields, to appear, Janson, Random Struct. Alg., 1, 15-37, 1990) where it is shown that (t, S,)-proportional graphs play a very special role; we thus call them simply t-proportional. However, only a few $-proportional graphs on 8 vertices were known and it was an open problem whether there are any t-proportional graphs with t # $ at all. In this paper, we show that there are infinitely many $-proportional graphs and that there are fproportional graphs with t # $ . Both results are proved constructively. [We are not able to provide the latter construction for all t E Q n (0, l), but the set of ts for which our construction works is dense in (0, l).] To support a conviction that the existence of (t, S,)-proportional graphs was not quite obvious, we show that there are no (t, S4)proportional graphs.	induced subgraph;rado graph;random graph;rel;struct (c programming language);vertex (geometry)	Svante Janson;Jan Kratochvíl	1991	Random Struct.

It is defined in any dimension, for open and closed manyfolds. Top-down decomposition of the shape can be used to speed up the computation, with some partitions being better suited than others. We study basic convex shapes and their decomposition in the context of the continuous eccentricity transform. We show that these shapes can be decomposed for a more efficient computation. In particular, we provide a study regarding possible decompositions and their properties for the ellipse, the rectangle, and a class of elongated shapes.	computation;distance (graph theory)	Adrian Ion;Samuel Peltier;Yll Haxhimusa;Walter G.

This structure has recently arisen in the study of threedimensional graph drawings. This paper presents the beginnings of a theory of track layouts. First we determine the maximum number of edges in a (k, t)-track layout, and show how to colour the edges given fixed linear orderings of the vertex colour classes. We then describe methods for the manipulation of track layouts. For example, we show how to decrease the number of edge colours in a track layout at the expense of increasing the number of tracks, and vice versa. We then study the relationship between track layouts and other models of graph layout, namely stack and queue layouts, and geometric thickness. One of our principle results is that the queue-number and track-number of a graph are tied, in the sense that one is bounded by a function of the other. As corollaries we prove that acyclic chromatic number is bounded by both queue-number and stack-number. Finally we consider track layouts of planar graphs. While it is an open problem whether planar graphs have bounded track-number, we prove bounds on the track-number of outerplanar graphs, and give the best known lower bound on the track-number of planar graphs.	acyclic coloring;color;directed acyclic graph;graph coloring;graph drawing;monochrome;planar graph;theory;thickness (graph theory);tropical cyclone track forecasting	Vida Dujmovic;Attila Pór;David R.

The best known search strategy is given by a spiral and achieves a competitive ratio of 17.289 ... It was shown by Gal [14] that this strategy is the best strategy among all monotone and periodic strategies. Since then it was unknown whether the given strategy is optimal in general. This paper settles this old open fundamental search problem and shows that spiral search is indeed optimal. The given problem can be considered as the continuous version of the well-known m-ray search problem and also appears in several non-geometric applications and modifications. Therefore the optimality of spiral search is an important question considered by many researchers in the last decades. We answer the logarithmic spiral conjecture for the given problem. The lower bound construction might be helpful for similar settings, it also simplifies existing proofs on classical m-ray search.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);search game;search problem;whole earth 'lectronic link;monotone	Elmar Langetepe	2010		10.1137/1.9781611973075.1	linear search;interpolation search;beam search;competitive analysis;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;simulation;linear search problem;computational geometry;beam stack search;computer science;backtracking line search;jump search;mathematics;geometry;incremental heuristic search;iterative deepening depth-first search;best-first search;exponential search;guided local search;binary search algorithm;search algorithm	Theory	28.96300852253444	18.8690695160306	107096

We consider generalizations of Fáry’s theorem to surfaces equipped with Riemannian metrics. In this setting, we require that every edge is drawn as a shortest path between its two endpoints and we call an embedding with this property a shortest path embedding. The main question addressed in this paper is whether given a closed surface S, there exists a Riemannian metric for which every topologically embeddable graph admits a shortest path embedding. This question is also motivated by various problems regarding crossing numbers on surfaces. We observe that the round metrics on the sphere and the projective plane have this property. We provide flat metrics on the torus and the Klein bottle which also have this property. Then we show that for the unit square flat metric on the Klein bottle there exists a graph without shortest path embeddings. We show, moreover, that for large g, there exist graphs G embeddable into the orientable surface of genus g, such that with large probability a random hyperbolic metric does not admit a shortest path embedding of G, where the probability measure is proportional to the Weil–Petersson volume on moduli space. Finally, we construct a hyperbolic metric on every orientable surface S of genus g, such that every graph embeddable into S can be embedded so that every edge is a concatenation of at most O(g) shortest paths.	concatenation;crossing number (graph theory);embedded system;existential quantification;planar graph;shortest path problem	Alfredo Hubard;Vojtech Kaluza;Arnaud de Mesmay;Martin Tancer	2017	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-017-9898-3	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph embedding;topology;longest path problem;euclidean shortest path;planar straight-line graph;mathematics;geometry;shortest path problem;distance;shortest path faster algorithm;planar graph	Theory	31.77465622615194	23.93509165747919	107111

A real polynomial f(x<inf>1</inf>, ..., x<inf>r</inf>) is said to be order-invariant in a subset c of <b>R</b><sup>r</sup> if the order (of vanishing) of f at the point p is constant as p varies throughout c. The application of the improved projection which is perhaps simplest conceptually is in the construction of a CAD for a set of polynomials which is <i>well-oriented</i> in a certain sense. Given a well-oriented set A of r-variate integral polynomials algorithm CADW [10] uses the improved projection to construct a CAD of <b>R</b><sup>r</sup> which is order-invariant for each polynomial in A. A drawback of CADW is that it halts in failure, reporting that A is not well-oriented, when presented with a non-well-oriented set A as input. Such failure of CADW is potentially serious, because it forces the user to fall back on less efficient projection operators (such as the Collins-Hong projection) for CAD. The present paper describes an efficient method for avoiding the failure of CADW in certain special non-well-oriented cases. The method is based upon a sufficient criterion for the order of a polynomial h(x<inf>1</inf>, ..., x<inf>r</inf>) of the special form h = a(x<inf>1</inf>, ..., x<inf>r-1</inf>)x<inf>r<sup>k</sup></inf> + b(x<inf>1</inf>, ldots, x<inf>r-1</inf>) (which we shall call a <i>binomial</i> in x<inf>r</inf>) to be 1 throughout the entire cylinder over a nullifying point p in R<sup>r-1</sup> for h (that is, a point p for which h(p, x<inf>r</inf>) = 0 identically). Following a review of CADW, the sufficient criterion referred to is motivated and proved. The algorithmic application of the criterion is carefully described and validated, and an example discussed.	algorithm;cell signaling;computer-aided design;cylinder seal;eisenstein's criterion;failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action system;polynomial	Scott McCallum	2003		10.1145/860854.860896	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;projection;mathematics;algebra	Theory	38.01542825168032	27.082059507478284	107228

A tree <i>T</i> is <i>small</i> if it has at most <i>n</i> vertices and has maximum degree at most <i>d</i>. Friedman and Pippenger (1987) proved that any (<i>n, d</i>)-expander contains every small tree. The elegant proof discovered by those authors does not yield an efficient algorithm for obtaining the tree. In this extended abstract, we give an alternative, polynomial formulation for a key concept in their proof, and thus obtain an efficient algorithm for the Friedman---Pippenger theorem.As an application, we offer a polynomial time algorithm for routing connection requests in wide-sense non-blocking networks of constant depth, following an approach put forward in a seminal paper of Feldman, Friedman, and Pippenger (1988).

The problem of bounding the Folkman numbers has been studied by several authors. However, in the most restrictive case, when m = n + 1, no polynomial bound has been known for such numbers. In this paper we show that the vertex Folkman numbers F (r, n, n + 1) are bounded from above by O ( n2 log n ) . Furthermore, for any fixed r and any small ε > 0 we derive the linear upper bound when the cliques bigger than (2 + ε)n are forbidden.	graph coloring;monochrome;polynomial;shapley–folkman lemma	Andrzej Dudek;Vojtech Rödl	2010	J.

The shortest-path metric of these graphs is known to approximate the Euclidean complete graph up to a factor depending on the cone number k and the dimension of the space. TD-Delaunay graphs, a.k.a. triangular-distance Delaunay triangulations introduced by Chew, have been shown to be plane 2-spanners of the 2D Euclidean complete graph, i.e., the distance in the TD-Delaunay graph between any two points is no more than twice the distance in the plane. Orthogonal surfaces are geometric objects defined from independent sets of points of the Euclidean space. Orthogonal surfaces are well studied in combinatorics (orders, integer programming) and in algebra. From orthogonal surfaces, geometric graphs, called geodesic embeddings can be built. In this paper, we introduce a specific subgraph of the Θ6-graph defined in the 2D Euclidean space, namely the half-Θ6-graph, composed of the even-cone edges of the Θ6-graph. Our main contribution is to show that these graphs are exactly the TD-Delaunay graphs, and are strongly connected to the geodesic embeddings of orthogonal surfaces of coplanar points in the 3D Euclidean space. Using these new bridges between these three fields, we establish: • Every Θ6-graph is the union of two spanning TD-Delaunay graphs. In particular, Θ6graphs are 2-spanners of the Euclidean graph, and the bound of 2 on the stretch factor is best possible. It was not known that Θ6-graphs are t-spanners for some constant t, and Θ7-graphs were only known to be t-spanners for t ≈ 7.562. • Every plane triangulation is TD-Delaunay realizable, i.e., every combinatorial plane graph for which all its interior faces are triangles is the TD-Delaunay graph of some point set in the plane. Such realizability property does not hold for classical Delaunay triangulations.	approximation algorithm;delaunay triangulation;file spanning;geodesic grid;geometric graph theory;integer programming;planar graph;shortest path problem;strongly connected component	Nicolas Bonichon;Cyril Gavoille;Nicolas Hanusse;David Ilcinkas	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16926-7_25	1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;block graph;theta graph;lattice graph;topological graph theory;visibility graph;combinatorics;geometric graph theory;polyhedral graph;universal graph;dual graph;independent set;topology;delaunay triangulation;euclidean space;forbidden graph characterization;planar straight-line graph;symmetric graph;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;geometry;shortest path problem;beta skeleton;complete graph;complement graph;line graph;coxeter graph;planar graph	Theory	30.653758811743707	23.877228324022045	107602

We also survey the different notions of sampling, used in computational geometry, learning, and other areas, and show how they relate to each other. We then give constructions of smaller-size relative (p, ε)-approximations for range spaces that involve points and halfspaces in two and higher dimensions. The planar construction is based on a new structure—spanning trees with small relative crossing number, which we believe to be of independent interest. Relative (p, ε)approximations arise in several geometric problems, such as approximate range counting, and we apply our new structures to obtain efficient solutions for approximate range counting in three dimensions. We also present a simple solution for the planar case.	approximation algorithm;computational geometry;counting problem (complexity);crossing number (graph theory);discrepancy function;file spanning;graph coloring;mathematical induction;sampling (signal processing);social inequality;spanning tree;vc dimension	Sariel Har-Peled;Micha Sharir	2011	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-010-9248-1	range searching;sampling;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;calculus;mathematics;geometry	Theory	33.89697186450213	20.092920850515217	107744

Whether this property remains true with the use of two shortest paths only is an open problem. We show that two shortest paths are enough for a large family of planar graphs, called face-separable, composed of graphs for which every induced subgraph can be halved by removing the border of a face in some suitable embedding of the subgraph. We also show that this non-trivial family of graphs includes unbounded treewidth graphs.	connected component (graph theory);induced subgraph;linear separability;planar graph;shortest path problem;treewidth;vertex (geometry)	Emilie Diot;Cyril Gavoille	2009	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2009.07.091	1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;block graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;universal graph;connected component;independent set;topology;longest path problem;pancyclic graph;forbidden graph characterization;clique-sum;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;modular decomposition;shortest path problem;partial k-tree;induced path;distance;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding;planar graph	Theory	26.60841733827762	28.681884257733923	107759

1e7a27d87cd2809d19cd0510a60dbf4991559e3c	domination in intersecting hypergraphs		A matching in a hypergraph $H$ is a set of pairwise disjoint hyperedges. The matching number $\alpha'(H)$ of $H$ is the size of a maximum matching in $H$. A subset $D$ of vertices of $H$ is a dominating set of $H$ if for every $v\in V\setminus D$ there exists $u\in D$ such that $u$ and $v$ lie in an hyperedge of $H$. The cardinality of a minimum dominating set of $H$ is called the domination number of $H$, denoted by $\gamma(H)$. It is known that for a intersecting hypergraph $H$ with rank $r$, $\gamma(H)\leq r-1$. In this paper we present structural properties on intersecting hypergraphs with rank $r$ satisfying the equality $\gamma(H)=r-1$. By applying the properties we show that all linear intersecting hypergraphs $H$ with rank $4$ satisfying $\gamma(H)=r-1$ can be constructed by the well-known Fano plane.

In such process, each vertex in the graph has one of two possible states at each discrete time. Each vertex changes its state between the present time and the next if and only if it currently has at least k neighbors in a state different than its own. Given a k-reversible process and a configuration of states assigned to the vertices, the Predecessor Existence problem consists of determining whether this configuration can be generated by the process from another configuration within exactly one time step. We can also extend the problem by asking for the number of configurations from which a given configuration is reachable within one time step. Predecessor Existence can be solved in polynomial time for k = 1, but for k > 1 we show that it is NP-complete. When the graph in question is a tree we show how to solve it in O(n) time and how to count the number of predecessor configurations in O(n) time. We also solve Predecessor Existence efficiently for the specific case of 2-reversible processes when the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph is no greater than 3. For this case we present an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.	algorithm;decision problem;graph dynamical system;karp's 21 np-complete problems;np-completeness;polynomial;regular expression;time complexity	Leonardo I.

A triangulation of S is a maximal set of nonintersecting straight-line segments between these points. Any triangulation of partitions the convex hu/l of S ( see [L177,Sha75] ) into triangles. For a set of straight-line segments in the plane, T, let [TI denote the total length of the segments in T. A minimum weight triangulation is any triangulation which minimizes IT[ among all triangulations of T. Minimum weight triangulations have an application in interpolating values of two-argument functions [L177]. There are two well known triangulation algorithms: the Greedy triangulation and the Delauney triangulation ( see [DGT0,LI77, MZ79] ). The former inserts a segment into the plane if it is smallest among all segments between points in S not intersecting those already in the place. The latter simply constructs the dual of the Voronoi diagram for S. Manacher and Zorbist [MZ79] show that neither approximates the optimum. Let GT(S) and DT(S) denote the outcome of the Greedy triangulation and the Delauney triangulation of and let M(S) stand for the total length of a minimum weight triangulation of S.

Combin. 32 (2011) 954–974] introduced the subgraph component polynomial Q(G;x, y) of a graph G, which counts the number of connected components in vertex induced subgraphs. This polynomial encodes a large amount of combinatorial information about the underlying graph, such as the order, the size, and the independence number. We show that several other graph invariants, such as the connectivity and the number of cycles of length four in a regular bipartite graph are also determined by the subgraph component polynomial. Then, we prove that several well-known families of graphs are determined by the polynomial Q(G;x, y). Moreover, we study the distinguishing power and find simple graphs which are not distinguished by the subgraph component polynomial but distinguished by the characteristic polynomial, the matching polynomial and the Tutte polynomial. These are partial answers to three open problems proposed by Tittmann et al.	characteristic polynomial;connected component (graph theory);directed graph;graph property;independent set (graph theory);induced subgraph;matching polynomial;tutte polynomial	Yunhua Liao;Yaoping Hou	2014	Electr.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for two matroids on the same set to be of this form and an analogous result is obtained when ( X  1 ,…,  X   t  ) is a partition of  S . The corresponding results when all the matroids are binary are also obtained.	contraction mapping;matroid	P. J. Wilde	1977	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

Such points form a collinearity curve. Generally, this curve is reducible: it has several components. Components of the curve, especially algebraic ones, are investigated. The curve's behavior near a fixed point of the function is explored. We also look into the asymptotic structure of the curve at infinity. The components of the curve are interpretable as vertices and edges of a graph resembling a Voronoi diagram. The collinearity curve, needing a mere two iterates, may help us understanding the long-term dynamics of the original function on C, visualizing important features of the generated fractal for g and its associated Voronoi graph.	fixed point (mathematics);fractal;iteration;locus;linear algebra;voronoi diagram	Fedor Andreev;Iraj Kalantari	2012	2012 Ninth International Symposium on Voronoi Diagrams in Science and Engineering	10.1109/ISVD.2012.23	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;weighted voronoi diagram;power diagram;voronoi diagram;mathematics;geometry;bowyer–watson algorithm;stable curve	Theory	38.39258336623747	20.557604950819766	109144

That is, a video file can be stored in multiple places so that the request of each user is served from a location that is near by to the user. This minimizes the delivery costs, but is associated with a storage cost. This problem is NP-hard even in grid networks. In this paper, we present a constant factor approximation algorithm for grid networks. We also present an O(log δ)-competitive algorithm, where δ is the normalized diameter of the network, for general networks with general metrics. We show a matching lower bound by using a reduction from online undirected Steiner tree. Our algorithms use a rather intuitive approach that has an elegant representation in geometric terms.	apx;approximation algorithm;digital video;graph (discrete mathematics);grid network;reduction (complexity);steiner tree problem	Reuven Bar-Yehuda;Erez Kantor;Shay Kutten;Dror Rawitz	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31585-5_38	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Theory	26.7618629382398	20.07759301788843	109318

The maximum cardinality of an asteroidal set of G, denoted by an (G), is said to be the asteroidal number of G. We investigate structural properties of graphs of bounded asteroidal number. For every k≥1, an (G)≤k if and only if an (H)≤k for every minimal triangulation H of G. A dominating target is a set D of vertices such that D∪S is a dominating set of G for every set S such that G[D∪S] is connected. We show that every graph G has a dominating target with at most an (G) vertices. Finally, a connected graph G has a spanning tree T such that d    T  (x,y)−d    G  (x,y)≤3·|D|−1 for every pair x,y of vertices and every dominating target D of G.

Informally, the theorem states that if X has sufficiently strong higher-dimensional expansion properties (which generalize edge expansion of graphs and are terms of cellular cochains of X) then X has the following topological overlap property: for every continuous map X → R there exists a point p ∈ R whose preimage meets a positive fraction μ > 0 of the d-cells of X . More generally, the conclusion holds if R is replaced by any d-dimensional piecewise-linear (PL) manifold M , with a constant μ that depends only on d and on the expansion properties of X , but not on M .	overlap (term rewriting);overlap–add method;polyhedron;simplicial complex	Dominic Dotterrer;Tali Kaufman;Uli Wagner	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2016.35	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;geometry	Theory	38.36657160781879	26.352587623656348	109383
0743a75c24eb2b6fc8f45d1f992f913ccf2a2a40	edge covering of complex triangles in rectangular dual floorplanning		Rectangular dual graph approach to floorplanning is based on the adjacency graph of the modules in a floorplan. If the input adjacency graph contains a cycle of length three which is not a face (complex triangle), a rectangular floorplan does not exist. Thus, complex triangles have to be eliminated before applying any floorplanning algorithm. This paper shows that the weighted complex triangle elimination problem is NP-complete, even when the input graphs are restricted to 1-level containment. For adjacency graph with 0-level containment, the unweighted problem is optimally solvable in O(c1.5 + n) time where c is the number of complex triangles and n is the number of vertices of the input graph.	edge cover;floorplan (microelectronics)	Yachyang Sun;Kok-Hoo Yeap	1993	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126693000435	graph power;graph energy;adjacency list;mathematical optimization;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;geometric graph theory;discrete mathematics;directed graph;graph bandwidth;null graph;nested triangles graph;regular graph;distance-regular graph;simplex graph;cycle graph;mathematics;voltage graph;butterfly graph;complement graph;line graph;strength of a graph;coxeter graph;adjacency matrix	EDA	24.763446811065165	27.361847983554547	109413

3183be7e07e96d79c17bddf3a2cb9198a9d765d7	dichotomy results for classified rank-maximal matchings and popular matchings		In this paper, we consider the problem of computing an optimal matching in a bipartite graph where elements of one side of the bipartition specify preferences over the other side, and one or both sides can have capacities and classifications. The input instance is a bipartite graph G = (A∪P,E), where A is a set of applicants, P is a set of posts, and each applicant ranks its neighbors in an order of preference, possibly involving ties. Moreover, each vertex v ∈ A ∪ P has a quota q(v) denoting the maximum number of partners it can have in any allocation of applicants to posts referred to as a matching in this paper. A classification Cu for a vertex u is a collection of subsets of neighbors of u. Each subset (class) C ∈ Cu has an upper quota denoting the maximum number of vertices from C that can be matched to u. The goal is to find a matching that is optimal amongst all the feasible matchings, which are matchings that respect quotas of all the vertices and classes. We consider two well-studied notions of optimality namely popularity and rank-maximality. The notion of rank-maximality involves finding a matching in G with maximum number of rank-1 edges, subject to that, maximum number of rank-2 edges and so on. We present an O(|E|)-time algorithm for finding a feasible rank-maximal matching, when each classification is a laminar family. We complement this with an NP-hardness result when classes are non-laminar even under strict preference lists, and even when only posts have classifications, and each applicant has a quota of one. We show an analogous dichotomy result for computing a popular matching amongst feasible matchings (if one exists) in a bipartite graph with posts having capacities and classifications and applicants having a quota of one. To solve the classified rank-maximal and popular matchings problems, we present a framework that involves computing max-flows in multiple flow networks. We use the fact that, in any flow network, w.r.t. any max-flow the vertices can be decomposed into three disjoint sets and this decomposition is invariant of the flow. This simple fact turns out to be surprisingly useful in the design of our combinatorial algorithms. We believe that our technique of flow networks will find applications in other capacitated matching problems with preferences.

A geometric homomorphism from G to H is a vertex map that preserves adjacencies and crossings. This work proves some basic properties of geometric homomorphisms and defines the geochromatic number as the minimum n so that there is a geometric homomorphism from G to a geometric n-clique. The geochromatic number is related to both the chromatic number and to the minimum number of plane layers of G. By providing an infinite family of bipartite geometric graphs, each of which is constructed of two plane layers, which take on all possible values of geochromatic number, we show that these relationships do not determine the geochromatic number. This paper also gives necessary (but not sufficient) and sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for a geometric graph to have geochromatic number at most four. As a corollary we get precise criteria for a bipartite geometric graph to have geochromatic number at most four. This paper also gives criteria for a geometric graph to be homomorphic to certain geometric realizations of K2,2 and K3,3.	geometric graph theory;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;homomorphic encryption;spatial network	Debra L.

The cost of each cluster is the sum o f a fixed opening cost and its radius, and the objective is to minimize the total cost of the clusters opene d by the algorithm. We show that the deterministic competitive ratio of Online Sum-Radii Clustering for metri c spaces other than the line is Θ(log n), where the upper bound follows from a primal-dual algorithm and holds f or general metric spaces, and the lower bound is valid for ternary Hierarchically Well-Separated Trees ( HSTs) and for the Euclidean plane. Combined with the results of (Csirik et al., MFCS 2010), this result demons trates that the deterministic competitive ratio of Online Sum-Radii Clustering changes abruptly, from consta nt to logarithmic, when we move from the line to the plane. We also show that Online Sum-Radii Clustering i n metric spaces induced by HSTs is closely related to the Parking Permit problem introduced by (Meyers on, FOCS 2005). Exploiting the relation to Parking Permit, we obtain a lower bound of Ω(log log n) on the randomized competitive ratio of Online Sum-Radii Clustering in tree metrics, and a randomized O(2 √ d log log n)-competitive algorithm for the d-dimensional Euclidean space. Moreover, we present a simpl e and memoryless randomized O(log n)competitive algorithm and a deterministic O(log log n)-competitive fractional algorithm, which both work for general metric spaces.	cluster analysis;competitive analysis (online algorithm);computer cluster;diffusing update algorithm;digital-to-analog converter;randomized algorithm;scott meyers;symposium on foundations of computer science;well-separated pair decomposition	Dimitris Fotakis;Paraschos Koutris	2014	Theor.

b50e128a7580d5085a876d1027311c733715f4cd	efficient signed clique search in signed networks		Mining cohesive subgraphs from a network is a fundamental problem in network analysis. Most existing cohesive subgraph models are mainly tailored to unsigned networks. In this paper, we study the problem of seeking cohesive subgraphs in a signed network, in which each edge can be positive or negative, denoting friendship or conflict respectively. We propose a novel model, called maximal (α, k)-clique, that represents a cohesive subgraph in signed networks. Specifically, a maximal (α, k)-clique is a clique in which every node has at most. negative neighbors and at least [αk] positive neighbors (α ≥ 1). We show that the problem of enumerating all maximal (α, k)- cliques in a signed network is NP-hard. To enumerate all maximal (α,k)-cliques efficiently, we first develop an elegant signed network reduction technique to significantly prune the signed network. Then, we present an efficient branch and bound enumeration algorithm with several carefully-designed pruning rules to enumerate all maximal (α,k)-cliques in the reduced signed network. The results of extensive experiments on five large real-life datasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our algorithms.	algorithm;arboricity;branch and bound;clique (graph theory);enumerated type;experiment;lu decomposition;moe;maximal set;network theory;real life;scalability;time complexity;wang tile	Rong-Hua Li;Qiangqiang Dai;Lu Qin;Guoren Wang;Xiaokui Xiao;Jeffrey Xu Yu;Shaojie Qiao	2018	2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	10.1109/ICDE.2018.00031	discrete mathematics;data mining;clique;network analysis;enumeration;scalability;branch and bound;computer science	DB	24.902417934747536	25.01712722869025	110357

We consider the problem of determining the maximum value of d(f, f ′) as f and f ′ range over all triangular embeddings of a complete graph. The following theorem is proved: for every integer s 9, if 4s +1 is prime and 2 is a primitive root modulo (4s +1), then there are nonorientable triangular embeddings f and f ′ of K12s+4 such that d(f, f ′) (1/2)(4s + 1)(12s + 4) − O(s), where (4s + 1)(12s + 4) is the number of faces in a triangular embedding of K12s+4. Some number-theoretical arguments are advanced that there may be an infinite number of odd integers s satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We present a parameterized algorithm for Consensus Clustering with running time O(4.24^k@?k^3+|C|@?|S|^2), where k:=t/|C| is the average Mirkin distance of the solution partition to the partitions of C. Furthermore, we strengthen previous hardness results for Consensus Clustering, showing that Consensus Clustering remains NP-hard even when all input partitions contain at most two subsets. Finally, we study a local search variant of Consensus Clustering, showing W[1]-hardness for the parameter ''radius of the Mirkin-distance neighborhood''. In the process, we also consider a local search variant of the related Cluster Editing problem, showing W[1]-hardness for the parameter ''radius of the edge modification neighborhood''.	cluster analysis;consensus clustering;parameterized complexity	Martin Dörnfelder;Jiong Guo;Christian Komusiewicz;Mathias Weller	2014	Theor.

In [ 11 A. Ehrenfeucht and J, Mycielski showed that a s&graph G of Q,, having 6(G) = 11 1 has at most two connected components and asked how many components a subgraph G of Q,, 4th given value 8(G) can have. We answer two more general questions here. We define the skew ~P-CUI~CS, a class of connec*cd graphs each having 2” vertices, by recursion. The only skew l-cube is the one point graph. A skew (n 3. U-cube is a graph G with B perfect matching M such that no proper subset of M is a cutset for G, and G \ M (obtained by removing the edges of M from G) is the disjoint union of two skew n-cubes (a matching is a pairwise non-adjacent set of edges; it is perfect if it covers every vertex). Q,, is, naturally, an example of a skew n-cube. A subgraph of a skew n-cube is called a partial skew n-cube. An easy induction argument shows that a graph is a partial skew cube iff each of its subgraphs H has a matching whose removal disconnects H. Thus for example every (finite) subgraph of the l-skeleton of the regular lattice of cubes in ” IS a partial skew cube.	connected component (graph theory);cut (graph theory);degree (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);matching (graph theory);mycielskian;olap cube;pure type system;recursion;vertex (geometry)	James Wildon Fickett	1979	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(79)90112-2	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;neighbourhood	Theory	30.894615834536843	28.073641754543793	110677

A spherical video is projected onto an octahedron, where the upper and lower hemispheres correspond to the upper and lower half of the octahedron, respectively. Four regular triangles in the half of the octahedron, are transformed into isosceles right-angled triangles and packed into a square by remaining adjacent edges. Two equal squares resulted respectively from the upper and lower half of the octahedron, are placed side by side and adjoined by a common edge. This generates a 2:1 aspect ratio rectangle. We demonstrate that our new projection format and layout have advantages in uniformity of pixel density, internal continuity and rectangle aspect ratio while encoding 360 VR videos.	360-degree video;british undergraduate degree classification;c object processor;circuit complexity;pixel density;scott continuity;set packing	Qikai Pei;Juan Guo;LU Haiwen;Guilona Ma;Wensong Li;Xinyu Zhang	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	10.1109/VR.2018.8446523	geometry;artificial intelligence;computer vision;computer science;isosceles triangle;rectangle;octahedron;pixel density	Visualization	33.409261292393154	22.450108228351155	110861

The equitable chromatic number of a graph G , denoted by ? = ( G ) , is the minimum k such that G is equitably k -colorable. Lin and Chang conjectured that for any (nontrivial) connected graphs G and H , ? = ( G ? H ) ? ? ( G ) ? ( H ) , where ? denotes the Cartesian product. In this paper, we prove the conjecture when G or H is a balanced complete multipartite graph. More precisely, we show a stronger result that for any graph H with ? ( H ) ? 2 , ? = ( K r ( n ) ?

In this paper, we investigate the effect that edge lifting has on the total domination number of a graph.

The minimum cardinality of a full dominating set of G is its full domination number γFH(G). A full dominating set of G of cardinality γFH(G) is called a γFH -set of G. We study three types of full domination in graphs: full star domination, where Hv is the maximum star centered at v, full closed domination, where Hv is the subgraph induced by the closed neighborhood of v, and full open domination, where Hv is the subgraph induced by the open neighborhood of v.	dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (graph theory)	Robert C.

What is the maximum number of edges exN(n, k, r) in a (k, r)-dense multigraph on n vertices? We determine the maximum possible weight of such graphs for almost all k and r (e.g., for all r > k) by determining a constant m = m(k, r) and showing that exN(n, k, r) = m ( n 2 ) + O(n), thus giving a generalization of Turán’s theorem. We find exact answers in many cases, even when negative integer weights are also allowed. In fact, our main result is to determine the maximum weight of (k, r)-dense n-vertex multigraphs with arbitrary integer weights with an O(n) error term. c © 2/11/1999 rev 2/27/01, 8/25/01 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The latter are called f-graphs. At each step the edge to be added is selected from among those edges whose addition would not violate the f-degr e restriction and with probability proportional to the product of the respective numbers of available sites at the vertices of the potential edge. We call this procedure the Random f-Graph Process with nonuniform edge probabilities (R*f-GP) of order n. This is in contrast to theRandom f-Graph Process (Rf-GP) of order n in which the edges that are added are selected with uniform probability. Using the Law of Mass Action , chemists have derived the degree distribution of the vertices in a graph generated by the R* f-GP. Here we apply a differential equation technique to obtain this degree distribution.	degree distribution;edge dominating set;mass action law (electronics);vertex (geometry)	Krystyna T.

Let G be a graph and let n, k and d be non-negative integers such that n + 2k + d ≤ |V (G)| − 2 and |V (G)| − n − d is even. If when deleting any n vertices from G, the remaining subgraph H of G contains a k-matching and each such k-matching can be extended to a defect-d matching in H, then G is called an (n, k, d)-graph. In [4], the recursive relations for distinct parameters n, k and d were presented and the impact of adding or deleting an edge also was discussed for the case d = 0. In this paper, we continue the study begun in [4] and obtain new recursive results for (n, k, d)-graphs in the general case d ≥ 0.	angular defect;discrete mathematics;extensibility;graph (discrete mathematics);matching (graph theory);recursion;self-organized criticality;software bug	Zemin Jin;Huifang Yan;Qinglin Yu	2007	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2006.10.015	critical graph;matching (graph theory);discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematics;integer;graph	Theory	30.246562393798747	29.874849749483403	111799

While a simple counting bound shows that m > k log2 n/k rows are required for a separable matrix to exist, in fact it is necessary for m to be about a factor of k more than this. In this paper, we consider a weaker definition of ‘almost k-separability’, which requires that the disjunctions are ‘mostly distinct’. We show using a random construction that these matrices exist with m = O(k logn) rows, which is optimal for k = O(n1−β). Further, by calculating explicit constants, we show how almost separable matrices give new bounds on the rate of nonadaptive group testing.	binary logarithm	Matthew Aldridge;Leonardo Baldassini;Karen Gunderson	2017	J.

b8ce838c91c423f19f1cc0ad50cc44ae7b376628	when the cartesian product of two directed cycles is hyperhamiltonian		We say a digraph G is hyperhamiltonian if there is a spanning closed walk in G which passes through one vertex exactly twice and all others exactly once. We show the cartesian product Zg x Zb of two directed cycles is hyperhamiltonian if and only if there are positive integers m and n with ma + nb = ab + 1 and gcd(m, n) = 1 or 2, We obtain a similar result for the vertex-deleted subdigraphs of Za x Zb. S. Curran [4, Theorem 4.31 observed that by using the theory of torus knots it is easy to prove that the cartesian product Za X Zb of two directed cycles is hamiltonian if and only if there are posi t ive integers m and n with ma + nb = ab and gcd(m, n) = 1 . Using Curran's ideas, Penn and Witte [2] proved that Za X Zb is hypohamiltonian if and only if there are positive integers m and n with ma + nb = ab 1 and gcd(m, n) = 1 . ( A digraph is said to be hypohamiltonian if it is not hamiltonian but every vertex-deleted subdigraph is hamiltonian.) Motivated by these results we define a digraph to be hyperhamiltonian if there is a spanning closed walk which passes through one vertex exactly twice and all others exactly once and determine when Za x Zb is I hyperhamiltonian and when a vertex-deleted subdigraph of Za X Zb is hyperhamiltonian. We assume the reader is familiar with [2] and with the background on torus knots given in [I , Section 41. Journal of Graph Theory, Vol. 11, No. 1, 21-24 (1987) @ 1987 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. CCC 0364-9024/87/010021-04$04.00 22 JOURNAL OF GRAPH THEORY Theorem 1. The cartesian product Za X Zb of two directed cycles is hyperhamiltonian if and only if there are posit ive integers m and n with ma + nb = ab + 1 andgcd(m,n) = 1 or 2. Proof. Let C be a hyperhamiltonian closed walk in Zg X Zb. Then C decomposes uniquely into a pair of edge-disjoint circuits C1 and Ca with a common vertex. Let (m, , n l ) and (m2, n2) be the knot classes of C1 and C2, respectively. Then (ml + mJa + (nl + n Jb = ab + 1 . If C l crosses Cz, then the algebraic intersection number is k1 , so Â 1 = m\n^ n,ma = (ml + m& (n, + n&nz and it follows that gcd(ml + ma,n l + n2) = 1. If Cl does not cross C2, then the intersection number is nzln2 n\m^ = 0. From this and the fact that m , , n , , m2, n2 are non-negative and gcd(ml , n I ) = 1 = gcd(m2, n2), we obtain mi = m2 and n l = n2. Thus 2mla + 2 n l b = ab + 1 and gcd(2ml,2nl) = 2. Now assume there are positive integers m and n such that ma + nb = ab + 1 and gcd(m, n) = 1 or 2. Clearly a and b are relatively prime, so the group Za x Zb is generated by (1, 1). Let H be the spanning subdigraph of Za x Zb in which a vertex d(1 , l ) travels by ( 0 , l ) if 0 5 d < nb and it travels by (1,O) if nb 5 d -^ ab. Since the in-degree and the out-degree of each vertex are equal, H is the union of edge disjoint circuits C l , Ca, . . . , CN. All vertices of H have out-degree 1, except (0,O) which has out-degree 2, so, by renumbering if necessary, we may assume that C l and Ca are the only circuits in the decomposition of H which intersect. We wish to show that Cl and Ca are, in fact, the only circuits in the decomposition of H , so that H is the union of two circuits with a single point of intersection, for then H can obviously be realized as a closed walk with one repeated vertex. To this end, suppose N ? 3. Then, for i 2 3, C, is disjoint from Cl and Ca, so knot(Cl) = knot(C,) = knot(C2). Set (r, s) = N knot(Cl) = xZl knot(C,), Then ra + sb = ab + 1. Since a and b are relatively prime, only one pair of positive integers u and v may satisfy ua + vb = a b + 1 . Thus ( r , s ) = ( m , n ) . Hence gcd(m, n) = gcd(r, s) = N > 2, a contradiction. I We next consider vertex-deleted subdigraphs Za X Zh {v}. Since Zu X Zh is vertex-transitive, the particular vertex which is deleted is unimportant. Theorem 2. Let v â Zo X Z b . Then Za X Zb {v} is hyperhamiltonian if and only if there are positive integers m and n with ma + nb = a b and gcd(m, n) = 1 or 2. Proof. The proof of necessity is similar to that in Theorem 1 . To prove sufficiency, let Ho be a spanning subdigraph of Zn X Zb with knot(//,,) = (m, n ) . (Namely: Put mo = ma/lcm(a, b) and no = nb/lcm(a, b). Let mo cosets of (1, 1) travel by (1,O) in Ho; and let the other no cosets travel by (0, I).) Since mo and fly are positive, there must be some vertex w, such that w travels by (0, I), and w (1,O) travels by (1,O). Replacing Ho by a translate if necessary, we assume w = v. Set v= v (1, O), v, = v + (0, l ) , and vy = v + (1, 1). In Ho, there is an arc from vto v, and from v to v+. Create a new digraph H by removing the vertex v from Ho (and removing the two arcs inciA CARTESIAN PRODUCT IS HYPERHAMILTONIAN 23	cycle (graph theory);directed graph;emoticon;file spanning;graph theory;isogonal figure;john d. wiley;linear algebra;line–line intersection;vertex (graph theory);vertex-transitive graph	Joseph A.

They are less succesful and convincing for incidence theorems of projective geometry, which has received less attention up to now. This is due to the fact that basic notions, like angles and distances, which are relevant for Euclidean geometry, are no more relevant for projective geometry. This article suggests that search methods can also provide short and human readable proofs of incidence theorems of projective geometry with well chosen notions, rules or lemmas. This article proposes such lemmas, and show that they indeed permit to find by hand short proofs of some theorems of projective geometry.	heuristic;human-readable medium;incidence matrix;linear algebra;list of interactive geometry software;numerical analysis;pixel;web page;world wide web	Dominique Michelucci	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-25070-5_7	discrete mathematics;pure mathematics;mathematics;incidence geometry	Vision	37.08377557055634	26.39985347918341	112229

A simple polygon  P  is said to be  weakly convex visible  from a line segment inside  P , if every point in the polygon is convex visible from some point of the line segment. In this paper we propose an algorithm for recognizing weakly convex visible polygons. Our algorithm computes a line segment inside the given polygon from which the polygon is weakly convex visible.

Any notation or terminology used here but not defined can be found in Ref. [2]. A k-factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph of G in which every vertex has degree k (k > 1). Let p and k be integers with 1 < k <p 1 and with p . k even. Delinef(p, k) to be the maximum number of edges in a graph of order p which has a unique k-factor. In Section 2, a result of G. Hetyei (see [4]) determining f(p, 1) is stated. In Sections 3 and 4, we determine the values of f(p, 2), f(p, p 3), and f(p, p 2) and in each case determine all the extremal graphs. In Section 5, we give lower bounds for the values off(p, k) for some other values of p and k. We use the following terminology: denote by V(G) and E(G), respectively, the vertex set and edge set of the graph G; the order of G is 1 V(G)]; a (p, q) graph has p vertices and q edges; if Xc V(G), then (X& denotes the subgraph of G induced by the vertices of X, and G X is the graph obtained from G by deleting the vertices of X (and their incident edges); if D G E(G), then G -D is the graph obtained from G by deleting the edges of D; for rational number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer not greater than x.	file spanning;floor and ceiling functions;graph (discrete mathematics);graph factorization;multiple edges;vertex (geometry)	G.

bf55daedb134cdce1b60cd4049c263200c2f2d22	a note on a problem of erdos on right angles	plane;combinatorics;mathematiques discretes;matematicas discretas;combinatoria;combinatoire;discrete mathematics;points;erdos problem;probleme erdos;angle	In [1] Paul Erdős asked the following question: is it true that a set of n2 points in the plane always contain 2n− 2 points which do not determine a right angle? An n × n square lattice shows that this bound, if true, is best possible. Erdős could prove the existence of a subset of cn2/3 such points. We show that, apart from a log-factor, the answer is in the affirmative — even for any other given angle β in place of 90. Theorem 1. Let β ∈ (0, π) be an arbitrary angle and P a set of N points in the Euclidean plane. Then it is possible to select a subset P0 ⊂ P of size at least |P0| ≥ c · √ N √ logN such that no three points of P0 determine an angle β . Here c is an absolute constant, independent of N. The proof uses two tools. The first one is a bound of Pach and Sharir [4]. Theorem 2 ([4]). In any set of N points in the Euclidean plane and for any β ∈ (0, π), at most c1N logN triples determine the angle β , where c1 is an absolute constant. The other tool we need is a lower bound on the number of elements of a triple system T that does not contain any triples — it is called the independence number of a triple system and denoted by α(T ). Such a bound is provided by Spencer’s result [5] on the independence number of uniform hypergraphs (see also in [3], p. 150). Theorem 3 ([5]). If a triple system T (a 3-uniform hypergraph) has m triples on N elements then α(T ) ≥ c2 √ N3 m with a constant c2.

Elekes / Discrete Mathematics 309 (2009) 5253–5254 Theorem 1 follows by substituting the bound of Theorem 2 to Theorem 3. The proof method can be applied to other properties of triples of points. For example, in [4] it was shown that N points determine at most O(N 7 3 ) triangles with any of the following properties: isosceles; having the same area; having the same perimeter. By the argument above it follows that from N points one can always select at least O(N 1 3 ) such that among the selected points no triangle has the property (being isosceles, having given area or perimeter). Addendum Due to the untimely death of the author, the acknowledged added some sentences to the manuscript. Pach pointed out reference [5] to Theorem 3 (it was reproved by Elekes in an earlier version of this manuscript). Mubayi noted that – if the following version of his recent conjecture with Frieze [2] is true – √ logN could be removed from the denominator of Theorem 1 and thus the right order of magnitude could be reached in the Erdős conjecture. Conjecture. If a triple system T (a 3-uniform hypergraph) has a fixed forbidden subhypergraph and has average degree d on N elements then α(T ) ≥ c3N √ log d d with a constant c3. The following lemma shows that the hypergraph K 3 9 (all triples in nine elements) is forbidden from the triples that determine angle β . Lemma. Assume that 0 < β < π and all triangles determined by m points of the plane have an angle β . Then m ≤ 8. Proof. Let S be a set of m ≥ 9 points, from the condition, no three points of S can be collinear. This implies that around any point p ∈ S the other m − 1 points can be ordered clockwise, thus each x has at most one clockwise neighbor y with 6 xpy = β . Therefore 6 xpy = β holds for at mostm− 1 pairs x, y ∈ S. However, some p ∈ S is in least ( m 3 ) m > m− 1 angles 6 xpy-a contradiction ifm ≥ 9. By Theorem 2 the average degree of the hypergraph of triples with an angle β is at most O(N logN). Therefore, from the Conjecture, α(T ) ≥ c4 √ N would follow, implying the claimed improvement of Theorem 1.

In this note we extend this study to a directed network $vec{G}$ and its associated directed network $vec{L}(vec{G})$. The Bonacich centralities of these two networks are shown to be related in a surprisingly simpler manner than in the non directed case. Efficiency is also considered and the corresponding relations established. In addition, an estimation of the clustering coefficient of $vec{L}(vec{G})$ is given in terms of the clustering coefficient of $vec{G}$, and by means of an example we show that a reverse estimation cannot be expected.rn rnGiven a non directed graph $G$, there is a natural way to obtain from it a directed line graph, namely $vec{L}(D(G))$, where the directed graph $D(G)$ is obtained from $G$ in the usual way. With this approach the authors estimate some parameters of $vec{L}(D(G))$ in terms of the corresponding ones in $L(G)$. Particularly, we give an estimation of the norm difference between the centrality vectors of $vec{L}(D(G))$ and $L(G)$ in terms of the Collatz-Sinogowitz index (which is a measure of the irregularity of $G$). Analogous estimations are given for the efficiency measures. The results obtained strongly suggest that for a given non directed network $G$, the directed line graph $vec{L}(D(G))$ captures more adequately the properties of $G$ than the non directed line graph $L(G)$.

Since a graph G has perfect state transfer if and only if its quotient G/π, under any equitable partition π, has perfect state transfer, we exhibit graphs with perfect state transfer between two vertices but which lack automorphism swapping them. This answers a question of Godsil (Discrete Mathematics 312(1):129-147, 2011). We also show that the Cartesian product of quotient graphs kGk/πk is isomorphic to the quotient graph kGk/π, for some equitable partition π. This provides an algebraic description of a construction due to Feder (Physical Review Letters 97, 180502, 2006) which is based on many-boson quantum walk.	cartesian closed category;discrete mathematics;olami–feder–christensen model;paging;quantum walk;quotient graph	Rachel Bachman;Eric Fredette;Jessica Fuller;Michael Landry;Michael Opperman;Christino Tamon;Andrew Tollefson	2012	Quantum Information & Computation		equivalence class;strong perfect graph theorem;perfect graph theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;trivially perfect graph;mathematics;quantum walk;chordal graph;physics;quantum mechanics;algebra	Theory	32.095481358584635	30.92710310002513	113544

Given any source vertex set S⊆VS⊆V in a directed graph G(V,E)G(V,E), such a spanner (with stretch k  ) has the property that the round-trip shortest path distance from any vertex s∈Ss∈S to any vertex v∈Vv∈V is at most k times of their round-trip distance in G  . We present an algorithm to construct the source-wise round-trip spanners with stretch (2k+ϵ)(2k+ϵ) and size O((k2/ϵ)ns1/klog⁡(nw))O((k2/ϵ)ns1/klog⁡(nw)) where n=|V|,s=|S|n=|V|,s=|S| and w is the maximum edge weight. The result out-performs the state-of-the-art traditional round-trip spanners when the source vertex set S has small cardinality, and at the same time, it matches the traditional spanners when S is the whole vertex set V.	round-trip engineering	Chun Jiang Zhu;Kam-yiu Lam	2017	Inf.

12a63063cef9a4ba81fb681cbfbfe120bdb0ee59	hamiltonian circuits in certain prisms		Ever since Tait’s abortive attempt to solve the 4-color conjecture [ 71, geometers have been szarching for Hamiltonian circuits in various types of graphs. Special attention has been given to the polyhedral graphs, that is, graphs that are isomorphic to the l-skeletons of convex poly iopes. l AIthough there are polytopes of every dimension greater than 3 that do not have Hamiltonian circuit-s, only in 3-dimensional space simple r,olytopes with this property have been found (see [3,8]). Barnette I 1 ] has conjectured that every simple 4-polytope has a Hamiltonian circ&. This conjecture is still open even for prisms over simple 3-polytopes. In this paper we show that certain families of prisms have Hamiltonian circuits. In particular, we show that the k-fold prisms over 3polytopes (not necessarily simple) have Hamiltonian circuits for all k 2 :Y. We also show that for every polytope P, there exists a number k(P) such that the n-fold prism over 9 has a I familtonisn circuit for n 2 k(P). Finally we show that the prisms ovw simple 4-colorable 3polyltopes have Hamiltonian circuits.	barnette's conjecture;boolean circuit;four color theorem;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path;polyhedral graph;polyhedron	Moshe Rosenfeld;David W.

This generalizes the notions of k-linked, k-connected, and k-ordered graphs. Given a connected multigraph H with k edges and minimum degree at least two and n 7.5k, we determine the least integer d such that every n-vertex simple graph with minimum degree at least d is H-linked. This value D(H, n) appears to equal the least integer d ′ such that every n-vertex graph with minimum degree at least d ′ is b(H)-connected, where b(H) is the maximum number of edges in a bipartite subgraph of H. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

There are, however, many components in which a hole or pocket is present, and yet defines no inner loop on any face; in other words, it has a nonunique entrance face. The paper describes an algorithm, based on the manipulation of a face-edge graph, for identifying sets of faces in a 2 1/2D object that bound holes or pockets with unique or nonunique entrance faces. The algorithm also determines the perimeter of the projected area enclosed by each hole or pocket in a specific direction.

b410ca0d670adff428bfc4ec98d79c27286c9eef	improved approximation algorithm for convex recoloring of trees	maximum degree;parameterized complexity;approximate algorithm;approximation algorithms;phylogenetic reconstruction;np hard problem;phylogenetic tree;convex recoloring;phylogenetic trees;local ratio;weight function	A pair (T,C) of a tree T and a coloring C is called a colored tree. Given a colored tree (T,C) any coloring C′ of T is called a recoloring of T. Given a weight function on the vertices of the tree the recoloring distance of a recoloring is the total weight of recolored vertices. A coloring of a tree is convex if for any two vertices u and v that are colored by the same color c, every vertex on the path from u to v is also colored by c. In the minimum convex recoloring problem we are given a colored tree and a weight function and our goal is to find a convex recoloring of minimum recoloring distance. The minimum convex recoloring problem naturally arises in the context of phylogenetic trees. Given a set of related species the goal of phylogenetic reconstruction is to construct a tree that would best describe the evolution of this set of species. In this context a convex coloring corresponds to perfect phylogeny. Since perfect phylogeny is not always possible the next best thing is to find a tree which is as close to convex as possible, or, in other words, a tree with minimum recoloring distance. We present a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for the minimum convex recoloring problem, whose running time is O(n 2+n(1/ε)241/ε ). This result improves the previously known 3-approximation algorithm for this NP-hard problem. We also present an algorithm for computing an optimal convex recoloring whose running time is $O(n^{2}+n\cdot n^{*}\cdot \Delta^{n^{*}+1})$ , where n * is the number of colors that violate convexity in the input tree, and Δ is the maximum degree of vertices in the tree. The parameterized complexity of this algorithm is O(n 2+n⋅k⋅2 k ).	approximation algorithm;color;convex set;graph coloring;np-hardness;parameterized complexity;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;time complexity;vertex (geometry);weight function	Reuven Bar-Yehuda;Ido Feldman;Dror Rawitz	2005	Theory of Computing Systems	10.1007/s00224-007-9069-7	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;phylogenetic tree;computer science;mathematics;approximation algorithm;algorithm	Theory	24.956953246725938	20.554234300311798	114220

For a connected graph G and an integer k ≥ 1, a linear radio k-labeling of G is an assignment f of nonnegative integers to the vertices of G such that |f(x)− f(y)| ≥ k + 1− dG(x, y), for any two distinct vertices x and y, where dG(x, y) is the distance between x and y in G. A cyclic k-labeling of G is defined analogously by using the cyclic metric on the labels. In both cases, we are interested in minimizing the span of the labeling. The linear (cyclic, respectively) radio k-labeling number of G is the minimum span of a linear (cyclic, respectively) radio k-labeling of G. In this paper, linear and cyclic radio k-labeling numbers of paths, stars and trees are studied. For the path Pn of order n ≤ k + 1, we completely determine the cyclic and linear radio k-labeling numbers. For 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 2, a new improved lower bound for the linear radio k-labeling number is presented. Moreover, we give the exact value of the linear radio k-labeling number of stars and we present an upper bound for the linear radio k-labeling number of trees.	connectivity (graph theory);vertex (geometry)	Mustapha Kchikech;Riadh Khennoufa;Olivier Togni	2007	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1348	electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science	Theory	28.39564523650669	25.81804815798513	114266

Precisely: if X is a totally ordered set about which we are given some partial information, and if e(X) is the number of total orderings of X compatible with this partial information, then it is possible to sort X using no more than c log2e(X) comparisons (c@@@@2.17).	information theory;ordered pair;sorting	Jeff Kahn;Michael E.

Critically 2-connected graphs on n points that have the maximum number of lines are characterized and shown to be unique for n 23, n f l l . INTRODUCTION We will use the terminology and notation of Harary [2] except that by a cutset S of a connected graph G we will mean a set of points S that separates G, i.e., G-S is disconnected. A graph G is critically kconnected if and only if (iff) G is k-connected but G p has connectivity k -1 for each point p of G and G is a maximal critically k-connected graph if and only if G is critically k-connected but G+pq is not critically k-connected for any pair of nonadjacent points p and q of G. We will describe all maximum critically 2-connected graphs on n points and show they are unique for n 2 3, n f 11. We use 1x1 and rx1 to denote the greatest integer equal to or less than x and the smallest integer equal to or greater than x, respectively. MAXIMAL CRITICALLY 2-CONNECTED GRAPHS Our object is the proof that maximum critically 2-connected graphs are unique with one exception. To achieve this we first develop some properties of maximal critically 2-connected graphs.

Giancarlo proposed a two-dimensional index data structure, the Lsu x tree, that generalizes su x trees to square matrices. However, the construction algorithm for Lsu x trees maintains complicated data structures and uses a large amount of space. We present simple and practical construction algorithms for multi-dimensional su x arrays by applying a new partitioning technique to lexicographic sorting. Our contributions are the following: (1) We present the rst algorithm for constructing two-dimensional su x arrays directly. Our algorithm is ten times faster and ve times space-e cient than Giancarlo's algorithm for Lsu x trees. (2) We present an e cient algorithm for three-dimensional su x arrays, which is the rst algorithm for constructing three-dimensional index data structures. Contact Author: Kunsoo Park.

With appropriate sign conventions, the  irregular  points of the offset at distance  d  from a regular generator curve arise where the generator has curvature   κ=−  1  d  . Usually, this induces a  cusp  on the offset, but if κ is also a local extremum, we observe instead a tangent-continuous  extraordinary point  of infinite curvature. Such irregular points are intimately related to the  evolute , or locus of centers of curvature, of the generator. Certain special  regular  points are then identified: those of horizontal or vertical tangent, and those where the curvature or its derivative vanish. A one-to-one correspondence (with due allowance for irregularities) is established between such  characteristic points  on the generator and its offsets at each distance  d . In the absence of irregular points, simple relations between certain  global  properties of the generator and offset curves, such as their arc length, the area they bound, and their mean square curvature or “smoothness” may be derived. The self-intersections of offset curves, and the  trimming  of certain extraneous loops they delineate, are also addressed.		Rida T. Farouki;C.

We observe that the most common methods of generating graphs with known maximal independent sets are subject to attack using quite simple techniques that are successful signiicantly often for graphs of practical size. We present an improved random graph generation system, DELTA, which increases the range of maximal independent sets that can be hidden from these techniques.	independent set (graph theory);low-discrepancy sequence;maximal set;random graph	Mark Brockington;Joseph C.

They provided a lower bound of Ω(log <i>N</i>/log log <i>N</i>) on the tile complexity of assembling an <i>N</i> × <i>N</i> square for almost all <i>N</i>. Adleman et al. [1] gave a construction which achieves this bound. We consider whether the tile complexity for self-assembly can be reduced through several natural generalizations of the model. One of our results is a tile set of size <i>O</i>(√log <i>N</i>) which assembles an <i>N</i> × <i>N</i> square in a model which allows flexible glue strength between non-equal glues (This was independently discovered in [3]). This result is matched by a lower bound dictated by Kolmogorov complexity. For three other generalizations, we show that the Ω(log <i>N</i>/log log <i>N</i>) lower bound applies to <i>N</i> × <i>N</i> squares. At the same time, we demonstrate that there are some other shapes for which these generalizations allow reduced tile sets. Specifically, for thin rectangles with length <i>N</i> and width <i>k</i>, we provide a tighter lower bound of Ω(<i>N</i>(1/<i>k</i>)/<i>k</i>) for the standard model, yet we also give a construction which achieves <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>/log log <i>N</i>) complexity in a model in which the temperature of the tile system is adjusted during assembly. We also investigate the problem of verifying whether a given tile system uniquely assembles into a given shape, and show that this problem is NP-hard.	kolmogorov complexity;np-hardness;password strength;self-assembly;tile-based video game;verification and validation	Gagan Aggarwal;Michael H.

0aa839043310b68c1e5568b761667fef23cfe0e9	on the structure of the spectrum of small sets	doubling constant;sum set;fourier spectrum	Let G be a finite abelian group and A a subset of G. The spectrum of A is the set of its large Fourier coefficients. Known combinatorial results on the structure of spectrum, such as Chang’s theorem, become trivial in the regime |A| = |G|α whenever α ≤ c, where c ≥ 1/2 is some absolute constant. On the other hand, there are statistical results, which apply only to a noticeable fraction of the elements, which give nontrivial bounds even to much smaller sets. One such theorem (due to Bourgain) goes as follows. For a noticeable fraction of pairs γ1, γ2 in the spectrum, γ1 + γ2 belongs to the spectrum of the same set with a smaller threshold. Here we show that this result can be made combinatorial by restricting to a large subset. That is, we show that for any set A there exists a large subset A, such that the sumset of the spectrum of A has bounded size. Our results apply to sets of size |A| = |G|α for any constant α > 0, and even in some sub-constant regime.	apply;coefficient	Kaave Hosseini;Shachar Lovett	2017	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

d50d92233d7de5cf024afdcea601bc20465afa97	preface special issue on robotics		Robotics is a multifaceted area requiring tools and principles drawn from many disciplines. Much of this background is classical (e.g., mechanics) or at least well established (e.g., control theory). Computational geometry, or more generally, algorithmics, is a relative newcomer. We believe that the importance of algorithms will continue to increase because the trend in robotics toward general-purpose robots with immense computation powers imply a corresponding sophistication expected of algorithms which accomplish robotic tasks. Brute force or simple heuristic algorithms may no longer suffice--we need to bring to bear all the understanding of data-structures and efficient asymptotic techniques developed over the last two decades. (There is a slight paradox here but the argument is familiar: increased computing power means the size of solvable problems increases correspondingly and asymptotic behavior begins to be felt.) Computational geometry offers new tools and perspective on old problems. Consider the problem of motion planning. This had been well studied even before computational geometry itself became a subject. In artificial intelligence, the find-path problem was posed and many heuristic solutions were proposed. Ideas such as the visibility graph (Nilsson) were suggested. Today, we see that the natural home for such concepts is computational geometry where the power and limitations of these tools are properly understood and fully exploited. Or again, when control theorists approach motion planning, it is almost second nature to attempt to define algorithms in terms of feedback laws. Thus, such papers have proposed the use of potential functions to model obstacles in the terrain, and to model the algorithm by moving in directions which minimize the potential energy. Such local criteria for motion must in general fail. The real issue in motion planning is global searching and involve combinatorial structures. Both these are specialties of computational geometry. (Admittedly control theorists are interested in the nice dynamical properties that comes from potential functions.) In this special issue we attempt to give some representative algorithmic studies in robotics. The repertoire of robotics problems presently treated by computational geometry is admittedly narrow in view of the total scope of robotics: the reader will note that all but one paper here can be construed as treating motion	algorithm;algorithmics;artificial intelligence;brute force;computation;computational geometry;control theory;decision problem;dynamical system;general-purpose modeling;heuristic;mechatronics;motion planning;robot;robotics;visibility graph	Chee-Keng Yap	1987	Algorithmica	10.1007/BF01840367	applied mathematics;combinatorics;mathematics;artificial intelligence;robotics	Robotics	39.10202448210715	19.110198033029555	115944

1c2b6d35823476ebecc5d35bba7e9b214d39b5db	local algorithms for sparse spanning graphs	004;local spanning graph sparse;article	We initiate the study of the problem of designing sublinear-time (local) algorithms that, given an edge (u, v) in a connected graph G = (V,E), decide whether (u, v) belongs to a sparse spanning graph G′ = (V,E′) of G. Namely, G′ should be connected and |E′| should be upper bounded by (1 + )|V | for a given parameter > 0. To this end the algorithms may query the incidence relation of the graph G, and we seek algorithms whose query complexity and running time (per given edge (u, v)) is as small as possible. Such an algorithm may be randomized but (for a fixed choice of its random coins) its decision on different edges in the graph should be consistent with the same spanning graph G′ and independent of the order of queries. We first show that for general (bounded-degree) graphs, the query complexity of any such algorithm must be Ω( √ |V |). This lower bound holds for graphs that have high expansion. We then turn to design and analyze algorithms both for graphs with high expansion (obtaining a result that roughly matches the lower bound) and for graphs that are (strongly) non-expanding (obtaining results in which the complexity does not depend on |V |). The complexity of the problem for graphs that do not fall into these two categories is left as an open question. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.2.2 Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems	connectivity (graph theory);decision tree model;emoticon;file spanning;incidence matrix;randomized algorithm;sparse matrix;time complexity	Reut Levi;Dana Ron;Ronitt Rubinfeld	2014		10.4230/LIPIcs.APPROX-RANDOM.2014.826	1-planar graph;random regular graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;triangle-free graph;independent set;dense graph;hopcroft–karp algorithm;pancyclic graph;forbidden graph characterization;machine learning;comparability graph;graph coloring;symmetric graph;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;bound graph;complement graph;chordal graph;indifference graph;line graph;planar graph	Theory	25.91935917551995	25.504275792389326	116098

If λ = 0 and μ = 1 then we say that it is a mixed Moore graph. It is known that there are unique mixed Moore graphs with parameters (k2 + k, k, 1, 0, 1), k ≥ 2, and (18, 4, 3, 0, 1). We construct a new mixed Moore graph with parameters (108, 10, 3, 0, 1) and also new directed strongly regular graphs with parameters (36, 10, 5, 2, 3) and (96, 13, 5, 0, 2). This new graph on 108 vertices can also be seen as an example of a so called multipartite Moore digraph.

Zheng, Generalized hexagonal systems with each hexagon being resonant, Discrete Applied Mathematics 36 (1992) 67-73. An edge of a generalized hexagonal system H is said to be not fixed if it belongs to some but not all perfect matchings of I-I. In this paper we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a generalized hexagonal system in which every edge is not fixed. Applying the above result to complete generalized hexagonal systems, we obtain a simple criterion to determine whether or not each hexagon of a complete generalized hexagonal system is resonant, and give a new and simpler proof of the main theorem of [4]. Since the hexagonal system with at least one perfect matching can be regarded as the skeleton of a benzenoid hydrocarbon molecule, the hexagonal system has been studied by mathematicians and chemists. The reader interested in thz subject may consult [1,3]. From resonance theory and Clar’s theory of the aromatic sextet, in general not every hexagon of a hexagonal system is resonant. in j4], tk hexagonal systems for which each hexagon is resonant are characterized. This paper considers the case of generalized hexagonal systems, i.e., the hexagonal systems having “holes”. A hexagonal system (HS) is a finite 2-connected plane graph in which each interior face is a regular hexagon of side length 1. All hexagons which appear in this paper are regular and have side length 1. Undefined terminology can be found in [4]. A matching M of a graph G is a set of indepeedent edges of G. If each vertex of G is incident with an edge of M, then M is called a perfect matching. A generalized hexagonal system (GHS) is a graph obtained by deleting some interier vertices and interior edges from a hexagonal system. All generalized hexagonal systems considered in this paper have perfect matchings. * Present address: RUTCOR, Rutgers University, P.O.

Given a set of n (possibly intersecting) convex pseudodisks of O(1) complexity each and two points s and t in the plane, we present an efficient algorithm for computing a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the pseudodisks. After the union of the pseudodisks is computed, which can be done in O(n logn) randomized time or O(n log n) deterministic time, our algorithm runs in O(n logn + k) deterministic time, where k is the size of the extended visibility graph of the union of the pseudodisks. Note that k = O(n2) in the worst case. In over two decades, the previously best algorithms for this problem have not improved on the bound of O(n2 logn) time, even when all the pseudodisks are pairwise disjoint disks. Our technique is also applicable to a motion planning problem of finding a shortest path to translate a convex object in the plane from one location to another avoiding a given set of polygonal obstacles, improving the previously best known solution and settling an open problem posed in 1988. Our algorithm actually solves a more general version of the open problem. Further, as a byproduct of our approach, we present an O(n logn+ k)time algorithm for computing the extended visibility graph of a set of n (possibly intersecting) convex pseudodisks in the plane. The previously best known time bound for this visibility problem is O(n2 logn).	best, worst and average case;convex set;dtime;motion planning;randomized algorithm;shortest path problem;visibility (geometry);visibility graph;voronoi diagram	Danny Ziyi Chen;John Hershberger;Haitao Wang	2013	SIAM J.

In particular, if every edge of a connected graph G lies in a 3-cycle, then G is supereulerian. The purpose of this research is to investigate how Catlin's theorem can be extended to digraphs. A strong digraph D is supereulerian if D contains a spanning eulerian subdigraph. We show that there exists an infinite family of non-supereulerian strong digraphs each arc of which lies in a directed 3-cycle. We also show that there exist digraph families H such that a strong digraph D is supereulerian if every arc a of D lies in a subdigraph Ha isomorphic to a member of H. A digraph D is symmetric if (x, y) ∈ A(D) implies ( y, x) ∈ A(D); and is symmetrically connected if every pair of vertices of D are joined by a symmetric dipath. A digraph D is partially symmetric if the digraph obtained from D by contracting all symmetrically connected components is symmetrically connected. It is known that a partially symmetric digraph may not be symmetrically connected. We show that symmetrically connected digraphs and partially symmetric digraphs are such families. Sharpness of these results is discussed.		Mansour J. Algefari;Khalid A. Alsatami;Hong-Jian Lai;Juan Liu	2016	Inf. Process.

Firstly, we introduce a novel parametric method based on concentric circles for generating stars and rosettes. Using proposed method, completely different stars and rosettes and a set of new and complex star patterns convert to each other only by changing nine parameters. Secondly, we demonstrate how three equal tangent circles can be used as a base for generating tile elements. For this reason a surrounded circle is created among tangent circles, which represents the gaps in hexagonal packing. Afterwards, we use our first idea for filling the tangent circles and surrounded circle. This parametric approach can be used for generating infinite new star patterns, which some of them will be presented in result section.Two Android apps of proposed method called Starking and Tilerking are available in Google app store.	algorithm;app store;new star games;set packing;star trek:;star height;time complexity	Hadi Mansourifar;Weidong Shi	2018	CoRR		computer science;mathematical optimization;geometry;concentric;tile;app store;android (operating system);tangent circles;stars;parametric statistics;hexagonal crystal system	Graphics	31.866958821601717	23.271762849140718	116949

The query algorithm, after locating the triangle containing the origin of the ray, walks along the ray, advancing from one triangle to a neighboring one until the polygon boundary is reached. The key result of the paper is a Steiner triangulation of a simple polygon with the property that a ray can intersect at most O(log n) triangles before reaching the polygon boundary. We are able to compute such a triangulation in linear sequential time, or in O(log n) parallel time using O(n/ log n) processors. This gives a simple, yet optimal, ray shooting algorithm for a simple polygon. Using a well-known technique, we can extend our triangulation procedure to a multi-connected polygon with L components and n vertices, so that a ray intersects at most O(filogn) triangles.	algorithm;central processing unit;data structure;finite element method;leo (computer);mesh generation;ray casting;steiner tree problem	John Hershberger;Subhash Suri	1993		10.1006/jagm.1995.1017	internal and external angle;mathematical optimization;minimum-weight triangulation;combinatorics;data structure;visibility polygon;shoelace formula;simple polygon;rectilinear polygon;computer science;pitteway triangulation;star-shaped polygon;polygon;mathematics;equiangular polygon;geometry;affine-regular polygon;monotone polygon;midpoint polygon;polygon covering;polygon triangulation;pick's theorem;biggest little polygon;algorithm	Theory	31.005334073899615	18.51913050738623	117113
2aaeaed854d8f7168459f19c6ab876419b3d72ee	contractibility and the hadwiger conjecture	connected graph	Consider the following relaxation of the Hadwiger Conjecture: For each t there exists Nt such that every graph with no Kt-minor admits a vertex partition into ⌈αt+β⌉ parts, such that each component of the subgraph induced by each part has at most Nt vertices. The Hadwiger Conjecture corresponds to the case α = 1, β = −1 and Nt = 1. Kawarabayashi and Mohar [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2007] proved this relaxation with α = 31 2 and β = 0 (and Nt a huge function of t). This paper proves this relaxation with α = 7 2 and β = − 3 2 . The main ingredients in the proof are: (1) a list colouring argument due to Kawarabayashi and Mohar, (2) a recent result of Norine and Thomas that says that every sufficiently large (t + 1)-connected graph contains a Kt-minor, and (3) a new sufficient condition for a graph to have a set of edges whose contraction increases the connectivity.

We improve a lower bound on the linkedness of polytopes slightly, which results in exact values for the minimal linkedness of 7-, 10and 13-dimensional polytopes. We analyze in detail linkedness of polytopes on at most (6d + 7)/5 vertices. In that case, a sharp lower bound on minimal linkedness is derived, and examples meeting this lower bound are constructed.

A set S C V is a dominating set for G if each node in V is dominated by some node in S and is a double dominating set for G if each node in V is dominated by at least two nodes in S. First we give a brief survey of Nordhaus-Gaddum results for several domination-related parameters. Then we present new inequalities of this type involving double domination. A direct result of our bounds for double domination in complementary graphs is a new Nordhaus~3addum inequality for open domination improving known bounds for the case when both G and its complement have domination number greater than 4.	dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);social inequality	Frank Harary;Teresa W.

The purpose of this note is to give a local criterion for a graph to be a k-tree. We show that a connected graph with the right number of edges is a k-tree if and only if the neighbourhood of each vertex is a (k l)-tree. We denote the complete graph on r vertices by K,. For a graph G and a vertex TV in G we denote, in analogy to the similar situation for simplicial complexes, by lk,(v) the subgraph induced by the neighbourhood of v. In further analogy to simplicial complexes, we define the f-vector (f, , . . . , fk) associated to a graph to be the vector whose ith coordinate f; is the number of sub-Ki’s in G. The following inductive definition of a k-tree is customary: (i) Kk is a k-tree. (ii) If G is a k-tree and u a new vertex, and u is adjoined to G via a sub-Kk of G (so {v} U Kk is complete) then {v} U G is a k-tree. Thus a O-tree is a set of isolated vertices and a l-tree is a usual tree. The f-vector of a k-tree with k + n vertices, it 2 0, is For a general reference to k-trees, see [l, 21. If G is a k-tree, k 2 1, then (obviously) G is connected and it is not hard to see that lk&v) is a (k 1)-tree for each 21 E G. We will show that if a connected graph has the right number of edges for a k-tree, then we have the converse. If lk,(v) is a (k l)-tree for each u E G we cannot conclude that G is a k-tree as the following example shows. Let k>l and n>3k+l.

We then apply it to exactly compute the arithmetic matrix product of two $$n \times n$$ n × n matrices A and B with nonnegative integer entries, yielding a method for computing $$A \times B$$ A × B in $$\tilde{O}(n^2 + \min \{ r_A r_B,\, n \min \{r_A,\ r_B\}\})$$ O ~ ( n 2 + min { r A r B , n min { r A , r B } } ) time, where $$\tilde{O}$$ O ~ suppresses polylogarithmic (in n) factors and where $$r_A$$ r A and $$r_B$$ r B denote the minimum number of 3D rectangles into which the 3D histograms induced by A and B can be partitioned, respectively.	3d computer graphics;algorithm;matrix multiplication;maxima and minima;polyhedron;polylogarithmic function	Peter Floderus;Jesper Jansson;Christos Levcopoulos;Andrzej Lingas;Dzmitry Sledneu	2016	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-016-0247-3	time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;matrix multiplication;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	28.957341955960892	21.04260579583782	117504
319a4b18c6b10b181e169151309c9e7e58538ff3	recognizing the largest empty circle and axis-parallel rectangle in a desired location		In this paper, we study the query version of the largest empty space recognition problem. Here, a set of n points P is given in a bounded 2D region. The objective is to preprocess P such that given any arbitrary query point q, the largest empty region of some desired shape that contains q but does not contain any point in P can be reported efficiently. We consider only circle and axis-parallel rectangle as the desired shapes, and will refer to these problems as the largest query point enclosing empty circle (QMEC) problem and the largest query point enclosing empty rectangle (QMER) problem, respectively. For the QMEC problem, the preprocessing time and space complexities are O(n log n) and O(n logn) respectively, and the query time is O(log n). For the QMER problem, the preprocessing time and space complexities of our proposed algorithm are both O(n logn), and the query time is O(logn). We also show evidence that improving the above complexities for the QMER problem is unlikely. The techniques employed to solve both problems are quite different from each other.	largest empty sphere;optic axis of a crystal	John Augustine;Sandip Das;Anil Maheshwari;Subhas C.

335a81d07acd79fa3d9bbe79622d5ecb4b4d3105	properties of farey sequence and their applications to digital image processing		Farey sequence has been a topic of interest to the mathematicians since the very beginning of last century. With the emergence of various algorithms involving the digital plane in recent times, several interesting works related with the Farey sequence have come up. Our work is related with the problem of searching an arbitrary fraction in a Farey sequence and its relevance to image processing. Given an arbitrary fraction ) 0 ( q p q p < < and a Farey sequence Fn of order n, we propose a novel algorithm using the Regula Falsi method and the concept of Farey table to efficiently find the fraction of Fn closest to q p . All computations are in the integer domain only, which is its added benefit. Some contemporary applications of image processing have also been shown where such concepts can be incorporated. Experimental results have been furnished to demonstrate its efficiency and elegance.	algorithm;column (database);computation;digital image processing;emergence;false position method;maximal set;relevance;shape analysis (digital geometry)	Soham Das;Kishaloy Halder;Sanjoy Pratihar;Partha Bhowmick	2010	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	DB	35.03043709852282	21.028214348358112	117604

Our spanner has size O(n/ε d−1) and maximum degree O(log d n). The main advantage of our spanner is that it can be maintained efficiently as the points move: Assuming that the trajectories of the points can be described by bounded-degree polynomials, the number of topological changes to the spanner is O(n 2/ε d−1), and using a supporting data structure of size O(nlog d n), we can handle events in time O(log d+1 n). Moreover, the spanner can be updated in time O(log n) if the flight plan of a point changes. This is the first kinetic spanner for points in ℝd whose performance does not depend on the spread of the point set.	kinetic priority queue	Mohammad Ali Abam;Mark de Berg	2011	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-011-9343-y		Theory	30.58897793370106	20.38226560183147	117934

So far the conjecture remains open although partial results are known; some of them with additional conditions on the set F . We explore Hamiltonian properties of Qn − F if the set of faulty vertices F forms either an isometric cycle of Qn or an isometric tree of Qn . We study a more general problem. A bipartite graph G is Hamiltonian laceable if either (a) its bipartition sets are of equal size and for each pair of vertices x , y from different bipartition sets there exists a Hamiltonian path between x and y, or (b) its bipartition sets differ in sizes by one and for each pair of vertices x , y from the larger bipartition set there exists a Hamiltonian path between x and y. In particular, we show that if C is an isometric cycle in Qn for n ≥ 5, then Qn − V (C) is Hamiltonian laceable. This allows us to remove up to 2n faulty vertices. Furthermore, if T is balanced isometric tree in Qn , then for n ≥ 4 the graph Qn − V (T ) is Hamiltonian laceable. Finally, if T is an almost-balanced isometric tree in Qn , then for n ≥ 5 the graph Qn − V (T ) is Hamiltonian laceable. Thus our results support Locke hypothesis.	emoticon;hamiltonian path;isometric projection;vertex (geometry)	David Pegrímek;Petr Gregor	2016	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-016-1728-5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	30.50319856109058	27.53965175742739	118289

He defines a graph G of vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G) to be k-cordial if there is a vertex labelling f from V (G) to Zk, the group of integers modulo k, so that when each edge xy is assigned the label (f(x) + f(y)) (mod k), the number of vertices (respectively, edges) labelled with i and the number of vertices (respectively, edges) labelled with j differ by at most one for all i and j in Zk.

Petersen’s theorem asserts that any cubic graph with at most 2 cut edges has a perfect matching. We generalize this classical result by showing that any cubic graph G = (V, E) with at most 1 cut edge has a T-join of cardinality less than or equal to ( VI/2 for every even subset T of vertices. Our result is based on the Edmonds-Johnson min-max relation for T-joins. In his 1891 landmark paper on the factorization of regular graphs, Petersen [6] (see Biggs et al. [l]) proved the following famous result. Theorem 1 (Petersen [6]). If G is a cubic graph with at most 2 cut edges then G has a perfect matching. A graph is cubic if every vertex has degree 3. The vertex set of any cubic graph is of even cardinality. Let T be an even subset of vertices of a graph G = (V, E). A T-join is a set A of edges such that T is exactly the set of vertices of odd degree in the graph (V, A). When T= {u, v}, the minimal T-joins are the paths from u to u. When T= V (assuming 1 VI is even), every perfect matching of G is a T-join and these are the only T-joins of cardinality n/2, where n denotes the number of vertices of G.

13a614c05a31db2c72c4b597d6e606f1c37d3539	strong analogues of martin's axiom imply axiom r		We show that either PFAu0027 or Martinu0027s maximum implies Fleissneru0027s Axiom R, a reflection principle for stationary subsets of PJ1G.). In fact, the plus version (for one term denoting a stationary set) of Martinu0027s axiom for countably closed partial orders implies Axiom R. In [F] Fleissner introduces a stationary set reflection principle which he calls Axiom R. For any A ? w-)2 he calls a family T c PM2(A) tight if the union of any increasing chain from T of uncountable cofinality is also in T. Axiom R states that for any A ? W2 of uncountable cofinality, if S is stationary in P,1(A) and T is tight and unbounded in P,2(4), then there is an X E T such that stationarity of S reflects to X: S ri P. 1(X) is stationary in P. 1(X). Fleissner derived the consistency of this axiom by forcing over a model containing a supercompact cardinal. We shall show that Axiom R follows from either of PFAu0027 or Martinu0027s maximum. (Similar results on reflection principles following from Martinu0027s maximum have been announced by Jech.) Actually, considerably less is needed to prove Axiom R. Let MA+(countably closed, K) be the following statement: If P is a countably closed partial order, D is a family of at most N, dense subsets of P, and {S,: a u003c K} is a family of cardinality K of P-terms, each forced by every condition in P to denote a stationary subset of w1, then there is a D-generic filter G on P so that for every a u003c K, S,(G) is stationary. Here S,(G) = {f3 u003c w1: 3p E G p c-fl E Sa}, the natural interpretation of the term Sa by the filter G. THEOREM 1. MA+(countably closed, 1) implies Axiom R. PROOF. Let A ? W2 have uncountable cofinality, let S c Pm 1(A) be stationary, and let T c PM22(A) be tight and unbounded. We must find X e Tsuch that S ri P.,1(X) is stationary in PJ1(X). We shall find X by applying MA+(countably closed, 1) to a notion of forcing that collapses the cardinality of A to N, but preserves stationarity of S. To insure that X will belong to T we force as follows. Let P be the set of all functions p such that dom(p) is a countable ordinal, ran(p) c T, and for any a u003c,B in dom(p), p(a) is a proper subset of p(,B).

f3c3b1b64d42850a083d25325e7401535b84f121	on the sphericity and cubicity of graphs		Abstract   The  sphericity  of a graph  G  is the smallest  n  such that the vertices in  G  can be mapped into unit-diameter spheres in  n -space in such a way that two vertices are adjacent in  G  if and only if their assigned spheres intersect. The  cubicity  of  G  is defined similarly with unit cubes (edges parallel to the axes) used instead of unitdiameter spheres. In his study of molecular conformation,  Havel (Ph.D. dissertation, Univ. of Calif., Berkeley, 1982)  showed that there are finite graphs of sphericity 2 that have arbitrarily large cubicity, but he left open the question of whether there are graphs with sphericity greater than cubicity. It is shown here that such graphs exist for cubicity 2 or 3. The construction used to prove this generalizes to larger values for cubicity, but the proof technique does not. Hence it remains open whether there are graphs with large cubicities whose sphericities exceed their cubicities.		Peter C. Fishburn	1983	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

In 1992, Brown and Colbourn conjectured that for any connected multigraph G, if q ∈ C is such that RG(q) = 0 then |q| ≤ 1. We verify that this conjectured property of RG(q) holds if G is a series-parallel network. The proof is by an application of the Hermite-Biehler Theorem and development of a theory of higher-order interlacing for polynomials with only real nonpositive zeros. We conclude by establishing some new inequalities which are satisfied by the f -vector of any matroid without coloops, and by discussing some stronger inequalities which would follow (in the cographic case) from the Brown-Colbourn Conjecture, and are hence true for cographic matroids of series-parallel networks.	charles colbourn;file spanning;interlacing (bitmaps);matroid;multigraph;polynomial;series-parallel graph;theory	David G.

Seriesparallel graphs and perfect graphs are h-perfect. The purpose of this paper is to extend the class of graphs known to be A-perfect. Thus, given a graph which is the union of a bipartite graph G, and a graph G2 having exactly two common nodes a and b, and no edge in common, we prove that G is h-perfect if so is the graph obtained from G by replacing G, by an a-b chain (the lengiir of which depends on G,). This result enables us to prove that the graph obtained by substituting bipartite graphs for edges of a series-parallel graph is h-perfect, and also that the identification of two nodes of a bipartite graph yields .an h-perfect graph (modulo a reduction which preserves h-perfection).	convex hull;modulo operation;reduction (complexity);series-parallel graph	Najiba Sbihi;J.

fb18791f77186cad40a9a8453c101b07a7377043	parameterized algorithms for partitioning graphs into highly connected clusters		Clustering is a well-known and important problem with numerous applications. The graph-based model is one of the typical cluster models. In the graph model, clusters are generally defined as cliques. However, such an approach might be too restrictive as in some applications, not all objects from the same cluster must be connected. That is why different types of cliques relaxations often considered as clusters. In our work, we consider a problem of partitioning graph into clusters and a problem of isolating cluster of a special type where by cluster we mean highly connected subgraph. Initially, such clusterization was proposed by Hartuv and Shamir. And their HCS clustering algorithm was extensively applied in practice. It was used to cluster cDNA fingerprints, to find complexes in protein-protein interaction data, to group protein sequences hierarchically into superfamily and family clusters, to find families of regulatory RNA structures. The HCS algorithm partitions graph in highly connected subgraphs. However, it is achieved by deletion of not necessarily the minimum number of edges. In our work, we try to minimize the number of edge deletions. We consider problems from the parameterized point of view where the main parameter is a number of allowed edge deletions. The presented algorithms significantly improve previous known running times for the Highly Connected Deletion (improved from O∗ ( 81 ) to O∗ ( 3 ) ), Isolated Highly Connected Subgraph (from O∗(4k) to O∗ ( kO(k 2) ) ), Seeded Highly Connected Edge Deletion (from O∗ ( 16 3/4 ) to O∗ ( k √ k ) ) problems. Furthermore, we present a subexponential algorithm for Highly Connected Deletion problem if the number of clusters is bounded. Overall our work contains three subexponential algorithms which is unusual as very recently there were known very few problems admitting subexponential algorithms. 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.2.2 Graph Theory, F.2.2 Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems, I.5.3 Clustering, H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval	2.5d;clique (graph theory);cluster analysis;computer cluster;fingerprint;graph theory;hcs clustering algorithm;peptide sequence;superfamily	Ivan Bliznets;Nikolay Karpov	2017		10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2017.6	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;superfamily;cluster (physics);cluster analysis;algorithm;hcs clustering algorithm;bounded function;parameterized complexity;graph;connected component	Theory	25.50958310173424	20.77579863737327	119047

Bhatt and Leighton [1] showed that the crossing number of a network (graph) is closely related to the minimum layout area required for the implementation of a VLSI circuit for that network. In general, determining the crossing number of a graph is hard. Garey and Johnson [3] showed that it is NP-complete. In fact, Hliněný [6] has proved that the problem remains NP-complete even when restricted to cubic graphs. Moreover, the exact crossing number is not known even for specific graph families, such as complete graphs [16], complete bipartite graphs [11, 22], and circulant graph [8, 12, 13, 14, 20, 23]. For more about crossing number, see [2, 21] and references therein. Attention has been paid to the crossing number of graphs on surfaces [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19]. However, exact values are known only for very restricted classes of graphs. In this paper, we compute the projective plane crossing number of the circulant graph C(3k; {1, k}).	circulant matrix;crossing number (graph theory);cubic function;graph (discrete mathematics);michael garey;np-completeness;planar graph;very-large-scale integration	Pak Tung Ho	2012	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1588	projective plane;line at infinity;fano plane;plane curve;projective space;duality;combinatorics;geometric graph theory;discrete mathematics;topology;wagner graph;regular graph;blocking set;real projective plane;mathematics;crossing number;correlation;pencil;circulant graph;coxeter graph;planar graph	Theory	25.836138895151066	28.42899724126858	119105

We show for the first time how to extend this technique to nontree-like graphs such as the integer lattice. Using this method, we obtain the following general result. Suppose that G is a triangle-free graph and that for some /spl Delta/ /spl ges/ 3, the maximum degree of G is at most /spl Delta/. We show that the spin system consisting of q-colourings of G has strong spatial mixing, provided q > /spl alpha//spl Delta/, where /spl alpha/ /spl ap/ 1.76322 is the solution to /spl alpha//sup /spl alpha// = e. Note that we have no additional lower bound on q or /spl Delta/. This is important for us because our main objective is to have results which are applicable to the lattices studied in statistical physics such as the integer lattice /spl Zopf//sup d/ and the triangular lattice. For these graphs (in fact, for any graph in which the distance-k neighbourhood of a vertex grows sub-exponentially in k), strong spatial mixing implies that there is a unique infinite-volume Gibbs measure. That is, there is one macroscopic equilibrium rather than many. We extend our general result, obtaining, for example, the first """"hand proof"""" of strong spatial mixing for 7-colourings of triangle-free 4-regular graphs. (Computer-assisted proofs of this result were provided by Salas and Sokal (1997) for the rectangular lattice and by Bubley et al. (1999)). The extension also gives the first hand proof of strong spatial mixing for 5-colourings of triangle-free 3-regular graphs. (A computer-assisted proof for the special case of the hexagonal lattice was provided by Salas and Sokal). Towards the end of the paper we show how to improve our general technique by considering the geometry of the lattice. The idea is to construct the recursive coupling from a system of recurrences rather than from a single recurrence. We use the geometry of the lattice to derive the system of recurrences. This gives us an analysis with a horizon of more than one level of induction, which leads to improved results. We illustrate this idea by proving strong spatial mixing for q = 10 on the lattice /spl Zopf//sup 3/. Finally, we apply the idea to the triangular lattice, adding computational assistance. This gives us the first (machine-assisted) proof of strong spatial mixing for 10-colourings of the triangular lattice. (Such a proof for 11 colours was given by Salas and Sokal.)."""	color;computation;computer-assisted proof;existential quantification;graph coloring;mathematical induction;neighbourhood (graph theory);recurrence relation;recursion (computer science)	Leslie Ann Goldberg;Russell Martin;Mike Paterson	2004	45th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	10.1109/FOCS.2004.63	hexagonal lattice;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer-assisted proof;gibbs measure;computational geometry;statistical mechanics;regular graph;pure mathematics;mathematics;automated theorem proving;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;algebra	Theory	34.66009323671669	27.54282134816715	119603

They have stated several quite disparate properties of random-like graphs and established their equivalence. Simonovits and Sós introduced a new hereditary property that is equivalent to the other quasi-random properties. For a small fixed graph F , a graph G on n vertices is said to have the Simonovits-Sós Property SSP if for every set X ⊆ V (G), the number of labeled copies of F in G[X] is given by 2−e(F )|X|v(F ) + o(nv(F )). A graph that satisfies SSP for some non-empty graph F is quasi-random. Our contribution in this paper is a natural extension of the result of Simonovits and Sós to 3-uniform hypergraphs.	graham scan;hereditary property;low-discrepancy sequence;random graph;thomason collection of civil war tracts;turing completeness	Domingos Dellamonica;Vojtech Rödl	2009	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2009.07.082	graph power;random regular graph;random graph;strongly regular graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;triangle-free graph;universal graph;graph property;graph toughness;distance-regular graph;forbidden graph characterization;cubic graph;symmetric graph;graph factorization;mathematics;voltage graph;graph isomorphism;vertex-transitive graph;bound graph;complement graph;line graph;algorithm;coxeter graph;satisfiability	Theory	27.30996468687992	29.73809914539369	119873
69149242220b99185ec30c1ef671d8877684a59f	rasterized planar face complex		We consider a Planar Face Complex (PFC). It is defined by the immersion of a planar and connected graph G, which comprises a set of vertices joined by curved edges. G decomposes the plane into faces that need not be manifold or open-regularized and may be bounded by a single loop edge. The PFC may, for example, be used to represent the complex street network of a city, the decomposition of a continent into countries, or the inhomogeneous structure made of a large set of regions of different materials possibly with internal cracks. The rasterized Planar Face Complex (rPFC) proposed here provides a compact representation of an approximation of a PFC, where the precise location of each vertex is quantized to the pixel that contains it and where the precise geometry of each curved edge is approximated by the ordered list (with possible repetitions) of the pixels traversed by (a chosen polygonal approximation of) the edge. We claim three key contributions: (1) The geometric error between a PFC and its rPFC is bounded by the pixel half-diagonal. (2) In spite of such a drastic discretization of the geometry, the rPFC captures the exact topology of the original PFC (provided that no street lies entirely inside a single pixel) and supports standard graph traversal operators that permit to walk the loop of sidewalks along the streets that bound a face, to cross a street to the opposite sidewalk, or to cross streets in order while walking around their common junction. (3) The local connectivity and order information needed to provide the above functionality is stored at each pixel using only about 4 bits per crossing. We discuss the details of this representation, our implementation of its exact construction, four possible embodiments that offer different space/time efficiency compromises, experimental results, relations between rPFC and prior solutions.

We are given a set of communications $$\mathcal {X}$$ X , which are distinct pairs $$(s,t)\subseteq S\times T$$ ( s , t ) ⊆ S × T , (typically S is the set of sources and T the set of destinations), and a port function $$\pi :\mathcal {X} \rightarrow P$$ π : X → P where P is the set of ports. A routing list $$\mathcal {R}$$ R is an ordered list of triples which are of the form (s, t, p), $$(*,t,p)$$ ( ∗ , t , p ) , $$(s,*,p)$$ ( s , ∗ , p ) or $$(*,*,p)$$ ( ∗ , ∗ , p ) with $$s\in S$$ s ∈ S , $$t\in T$$ t ∈ T and $$p\in P$$ p ∈ P . It routes the communication (s, t) to the port $$r(s,t) =p$$ r ( s , t ) = p which appears on the first triple in the list $$\mathcal {R}$$ R that is of the form (s, t, p), $$(*,t,p)$$ ( ∗ , t , p ) , $$(s,*,p)$$ ( s , ∗ , p ) or $$(*,*,p)$$ ( ∗ , ∗ , p ) . If $$r(s,t)=\pi (s,t)$$ r ( s , t ) = π ( s , t ) , then we say that (s, t) is properly routed by $$\mathcal {R}$$ R and if all communications of $$\mathcal {X}$$ X are properly routed, we say that $$\mathcal {R}$$ R emulates $$(\mathcal {X}, \pi )$$ ( X , π ) . The aim is to find a shortest routing list emulating $$(\mathcal {X}, \pi )$$ ( X , π ) . In this paper, we carry out a study of the complexity of the two dual decision problems associated to it. Given a set of communication $$\mathcal {X}$$ X , a port function $$\pi $$ π and an integer k, the first one called Routing List (resp. the second one, called List Reduction) consists in deciding whether there is a routing list emulating $$(\mathcal {X}, \pi )$$ ( X , π ) of size at most k (resp. $$|\mathcal {X}| -k$$ | X | - k ). We prove that both problems are NP-complete. We then give a 3-approximation for List Reduction, which can be generalized to higher dimensions. We also give a 4-approximation for Routing List in the fundamental case when there are only two ports (i.e. $$|P|=2$$ | P | = 2 ), $$\mathcal {X}=S\times T$$ X = S × T and $$|S|=|T|$$ | S | = | T | .	apx;approximation algorithm;data center;decision problem;directed acyclic graph;directed graph;emulator;feedback arc set;heuristic (computer science);np-completeness;routing table;software-defined networking;telecommunications network	Frédéric Giroire;Frédéric Havet;Joanna Moulierac	2016	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-016-0243-7	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	24.94697338406492	22.658326023537754	120100

The first problem is a question posed by Kupavskii: is it true that given two disjoint cross-intersecting families A,B ⊂ ( [n] k ) , they must satisfy min{|A|, |B|} ≤ 12 ( n−1 k−1 ) ? We give an affirmative answer for n ≥ 2k, and construct families showing that this range is essentially the best one could hope for, up to a constant factor. The second problem is a conjecture of Frankl. It states that for n ≥ 3k, the maximum diversity of an intersecting family F ⊂ ( [n] k )		Hao Huang	2019	Eur. J.

Equivalently, either there is a hyperplane separating one of these d+1 sets of points from the origin, or there exists a rainbow simplex containing the origin. One of our results is the following extension of the colorful Carathéodory theorem: given D2+1 sets of points in Rd, and a convex object C, then either one set can be separated from C by a constant (depending only on d) number of hyperplanes, or there is a D2-dimensional rainbow simplex intersecting C.	convex hull;convex set;like button;objective-c;rainbow 100	Nabil H.

We show a super-exponentially decreasing upper bound $$c_d\le e^{-(1/2-o(1))(d \ln d)}$$cd≤e-(1/2-o(1))(dlnd). The ideas used in the proof of the upper bound also help us to prove Pach's theorem with $$c_d \ge 2^{-2^{d^2 + O(d)}}$$cd?2-2d2+O(d), which is a lower bound doubly exponentially decreasing in d (up to some polynomial in the exponent). For comparison, Pach's original approach yields a triply exponentially decreasing lower bound. On the other hand, Fox, Pach, and Suk recently obtained a hypergraph density result implying a proof of Pach's theorem with $$c_d \ge 2^{-O(d^2\log d)}$$cd?2-O(d2logd). In our construction for the upper bound, we use the fact that the minimum solid angle of every d-simplex is super-exponentially small. This fact was previously unknown and might be of independent interest. For the lower bound, we improve the `separation' part of the argument by showing that in one of the key steps only $$d+1$$d+1 separations are necessary, compared to $$2^d$$2d separations in the original proof. We also provide a measure version of Pach's theorem.		Roman N.

We further study minimality, the property of every configuration reaching every partial configuration.	computational complexity theory;dynamical system;mixing (mathematics);turing machine;vertex-transitive graph	Anahí Gajardo;Nicolas Ollinger;Rodrigo Torres-Avilés	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-48057-1_18	turing degree;hyperarithmetical theory;turing reduction;time hierarchy theorem;pspace;alternating turing machine;turing machine examples;nspace;turing machine;universal turing machine;turing completeness;description number;multitape turing machine;probabilistic turing machine;computational complexity theory;non-deterministic turing machine;register machine;super-recursive algorithm	Theory	34.83472024957297	19.925761906175097	120718
