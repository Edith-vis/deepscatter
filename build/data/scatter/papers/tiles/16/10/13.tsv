In HetNets different mobile stations (macro, pico, femto) have different transmission powers resulting in complicated interference scenarios raising the need for application of more efficient power and interference control. In this paper we propose an uplink power and interference control mechanism for HetNets based on a generalized risk management procedure. Based on this we propose a proactive algorithm for uplink power and interference control and illustrate it with a simulation in a simplified HetNet macro - pico cell scenario. Results from simulation experiments show that such an approach could be a solution for dynamic uplink power control in HetNets ensuring reduction of the ICI and increasing the average cell throughput.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;control system;experiment;ici (programming language);interference (communication);rain fade;risk assessment;risk management;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Pavlina Koleva;Plamen T.

Our model is that of a Poisson point process of transmitters, each with a receiver at a given distance. A packet is divided in blocks which are transmitted over different subbands determined by random frequency hopping. At the receiver, a maximum-likelihood decoder is employed to estimate the transmitted packet/codeword. We show that, if L is the Hamming distance of the error correction code and ε is a constraint on the packet error probability, the transmission capacity of the network is proportional to ε1/L, when ε → 0. The proportionality constant depends on the code selection, the packet length, the geometry of the symbol constellation and the number of receive antennas. This result implies that, at the cost of a moderate decoding complexity, large gains can be achieved by a simple interference randomization scheme during packet transmission. We also address practical issues such as channel estimation and power control. We find that reliable channel information can be obtained at the receiver without significant rate loss and demonstrate that channel-inversion power control can increase the transmission capacity.	bit error rate;channel state information;code word;decoding methods;error detection and correction;forward error correction;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hamming distance;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);network packet;point process;transmitter	Kostas Stamatiou;John G.

Many of the limitations using AMC are due to the long round-trip delay of a satellite system. This paper proposes an efficient AMC scheme with power control and symbol interleaving that can be effectively applied to satellite systems. In particular, we focus on mobile satellite systems that have maximum compatibility in a Long Term Evolution system. Simulations reveal that the proposed scheme can provide a maximum 10.2% increase of average beam spectral efficiency and a maximum of 8-dB power gain compared with a conventional AMC scheme.

The tight sum-rate capacity expression of the MIMO broadcast scheduling system employing vector feedback information is then derived for arbitrary numbers of transmitting and receiving antennas, especially those with channel estimation error. We also present the capacity floor induced by the channel estimation error and then verify the analytical results through simulation results.	channel state information;mimo;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Donghun Lee;Kiseon Kim	2010	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2010.03.091955	zero forcing equalizer;3g mimo;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;precoding;channel capacity;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.03011941229292	84.07831390749874	51127

The proposed coordination model is such that each base-station simultaneously transmits to two users and each user is served by two base-stations. First, we show in a K-user system operating at the information theoretic upper bound of degrees of freedom (DOF), the generic IA is proper when K ≤ 3, whereas the proposed partially coordinated IA is proper when K ≤ 5. Then, we derive a non-iterative, i.e., one shot, IA algorithm for the proposed scheme when K ≤ 5. We show that for a given latency, the backhaul data rate requirement of the proposed method grows linearly with K. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that the proposed one-shot algorithm offers higher system throughput than the iterative IA at practical SNR levels.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);channel (communications);dos;data rate units;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo;monte carlo method;multiplexing;reciprocity (electromagnetism);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;theory;throughput;uncontrolled format string	Aimal Khan Yousafzai;Mohammad Reza Nakhai	2011	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;information theory;base station;mathematics;degrees of freedom;upper and lower bounds;statistics;monte carlo method	Mobile	37.88591822163503	84.45096616066883	51364

A space-time dynamic signature-assignment (DSA) algorithm was briefly described by the authors in a previous paper. In this paper, we further elaborate on the space-time DSA approach and its receiver structure for the reverse link of direct-sequence (DS)-CDMA systems using multiple antennas at the receiver. The space-time DSA dynamically assigns the users' spreading codes and transmission delays, i.e., to assign the user signatures, in order to minimize mutual crosscorrelations. In assigning the signatures, the DSA adopts a low-complexity iterative algorithm which utilizes channel information and aims to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the poorest performing user at the base station. Analytic results as well as further simulation results are provided to support our arguments.	code;gradient;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;random search;search algorithm;set packing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;synergy;telecommunications link;type signature	Jiunn-Tsair Chen;Constantinos B.

In this paper, we exploit cooperative diversity in multiple relay networks to improve the performance of Gaussian source transmission with layered broadcast coding. Specifically, we study the distortion performance of two amplify-and-forward (AF) schemes, namely, distributed beamforming and selection AF. First, we analyze their asymptotic performance in terms of the distortion exponent and the expected distortion. We then show that, under stringent delay constraint, there exist SNR thresholds below which the AF systems achieve lower distortion than the direct transmission system.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;beamforming;broadcast domain;channel use;distortion;existential quantification;numerical analysis;quality of service;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Ubolthip Sethakaset;Tony Q.

Devices in a network transmit on behalf of their neighbors to act as “virtual MIMO” antennas. Since small devices are typically battery constrained, PHY cooperation immediately leads to the following question related to the energy efficiency (bits per joule) of devices: Is the performance improvement worth the extra energy costs of transmitting for others? Through an in-depth hardware test-bed study, we find that PHY cooperation can improve energy efficiency by as much as 320%, or it can reduce energy efficiency by as much as 25%, depending upon topology. With this performance gap in mind, we propose the distributed energy-conserving cooperation (DECC) protocol. DECC tunes the amount of effort that each device dedicates to providing cooperative assistance for others so that the energy that each device spends on cooperation is commensurate with the personal benefits that are received by that device. With DECC, users can tune their level of cooperation with completely node-localized decision-making. Thus, DECC allows nodes to tap into a large energy-efficiency benefit, suffering only a bounded preset loss when this benefit is not available.	joule;mimo;phy (chip);testbed;transmitter	Christopher Hunter;Lin Zhong;Ashutosh Sabharwal	2014	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2013.2271121	communications protocol;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	31.73173863448374	87.09535666655795	51825

The cooperative network with the proposed scheme chooses the transmission rate and decides to involve the relay in transmission, adapting to the channel state estimated from limited feedback information (e.g. positive/negative acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) feedback). Considering that the limited feedback information provides only partial knowledge about the actual channel states, the authors design a decision-making algorithm on cooperative transmission by using a partially observable Markov decision process framework. The simulation results show that, when the feedback overhead is taken into account, the proposed scheme outperforms even the scheme with which the states of all relevant channels are estimated and fed back.	rayleigh fading	Dong Heon Lee;Wha Sook Jeon;Kae Won Choi;Dong Geun Jeong	2013	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.0010	simulation;telecommunications;control theory	HCI	34.30384433680671	79.70141368957773	51839
22c28194cc11943b057774db80eb5b56fa8aa410	improving the performance of cell-edge users in miso-noma systems using tas and swipt-based cooperative transmissions		In this paper, we study the performance of a cell-edge user in a two-user multiple-input single-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MISO-NOMA) system. Since the outage performance and fairness data rate of cell-edge users are essential issues in NOMA systems, we focus on how to resolve such problems. To this end, we propose three cooperative downlink transmission schemes utilizing hybrid simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and transmit antenna selection (TAS) protocols. Particularly, in each scheme, a cell-center user acts as a relay to assist the cell-edge user and its relaying operation is powered by a hybrid time-switching/power-splitting SWIPT protocol. Additionally, each scheme employs a different TAS criterion to exploit the spatial diversity gain of a multiple antennas base station. In particular, we derive tight closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probabilities (OPs) and the corresponding asymptotic OPs to provide significant insights into the impact of our proposed schemes on the system performance. Our numerical results demonstrate the achievable performance improvements of the proposed schemes in comparison to that of the orthogonal multiple access and non-cooperative NOMA systems. In addition, the proposed schemes achieve various level of diversity gains accompanying with different complexity requirements.	approximation algorithm;data rate units;downtime;fairness measure;numerical analysis;relay;requirement;system analysis;telecommunications link;thermal-assisted switching	Tri Nhu Do;Daniel Benevides da Costa;Trung Quang Duong;Beongku An	2018	IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking	10.1109/TGCN.2017.2777510	noma;computer network;telecommunications link;wireless;antenna diversity;expression (mathematics);computer science;relay;base station;maximum power transfer theorem	Mobile	36.06321848285471	82.19509584737092	51926

The location equations are formed from Doppler shifts of remote antennas (RAUs). Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, the solution must be found by the grid searching. However, when the error of the Doppler measurement is a Gauss random variable, the solution can be achieved easily by a two- dimension searching in orthogonal complement space, i.e. the search is only performed in a two-dimension space (the position space) instead of the normal four-dimension space (both the position and the velocity spaces). Simulation results show that the proposed method can approach to a high precise of the UE location.	nonlinear system;position and momentum space;simulation;velocity (software development)	Wen Pan;Jiang Wu;Zhanjun Jiang;Yan Wang;Xiaohu You	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.412	random variable;electronic engineering;two-dimensional space;doppler effect;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	EDA	24.806169364688802	75.02328838735676	52100

27ea90b29f1c4224326cab44e473515cbb957a03	on-body toa-based ranging error model for motion capture applications within wearable uwb networks		We present herein an error model that characterizes on-body range measurements based on time of arrival (TOA) estimation in Impulse radio-ultra wideband, wireless body area networks. Considering real channel measurements over two representative on-body links for repeated walk cycles, the model is drawn as a conditional mixture, accounting for signal to noise ratio (SNR) variations and non line of sight (NLOS) channel obstructions caused by the body. Key model parameters are then investigated as a function of the previous obstruction and SNR configurations, illustrating missed/false path detection effects at low SNR. On this occasion, two TOA estimators are compared, namely a strongest path detection scheme through matched filtering and a first path detection scheme relying on high-resolution channel estimation. Finally, we discuss the possibility to generalize the previous model to any kind of on-body link, based on empirical observations regarding the dynamic range of the channel power transfer function under mobility. Accordingly, the resulting final model could integrate basic elements of classification, such as the instantaneous LOS/NLOS and static/dynamic link status.	algorithm;bandplan;channel state information;dynamic range;frequency band;image resolution;motion capture;robertson–seymour theorem;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;time of arrival;transfer function;ultra-wideband;wearable computer	Jihad Hamie;Benoît Denis;Raffaele D'Errico;Cédric Richard	2015	J.

To this end, this paper proposes to estimate a particular representation of channel state information (CSI) at the BS through channel norm feedback and a newly developed channel phase codebook, where the long-term channel correlation is efficiently exploited to improve performance. In particular, the channel representation is decomposed into a gain-related part and a phase-related part, with each of them estimated separately. More specifically, the gain-related part is estimated from the channel norm and channel correlation matrix, while the phase-related part is determined using a channel phase codebook, constructed with the generalized Lloyd algorithm.

In this paper, the Power Emission Density (PED)-based interference modeling method is applied to explore proper network settings for enabling multiple concurrent D2D pairs in a sector-partitioned cell. With the constraint of the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) requirements for both the macro-cell and D2D communications, an exclusive region-based analytical model is proposed to obtain the guard distances from a D2D user to the base station, to the transmitting cellular user, and to other communicating D2D pairs, respectively, when the uplink resource is reused. With these guard distances, the bounds of the maximum throughput improvement provided by D2D communications are then derived for different sector-based resource allocation schemes. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify our analytical results. The new results obtained in this work can provide useful guidelines for the deployment of future cellular networks with underlaying D2D communications.	interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;randomness;requirement;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter	Minming Ni;Jianping Pan;Lin Cai	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2382639	throughput;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	28.050665201047977	85.68272732171712	52533
4dbfa3ec1222931e850f9a5584680c6b123718d7	hybrid spatial modulation aided distributed relays: threshold detection and constellation rotation		In this paper, the hybrid spatial modulation (SM) aided virtual multiple-input multiple-output one-way and two-way relaying architectures with multiple distributed single-antenna relay nodes are studied. For the one-way relaying with multiple-antenna source and destination nodes, a two-stage relay detector is proposed. In the proposed detector, first, the relay node determines its state, active or silent, through the energy-based threshold detection; second, the signal is estimated and forwarded only when the relay node is active. Furthermore, the threshold is designed based on a simplified error probability criterion. For the two-way relaying with two multiple-antenna source nodes, a two-phase relaying based on signal constellation rotation and simple XOR network coding (NC) is presented. First, both source nodes transmit pre-coding-aided SM symbols simultaneously to relay nodes. Second, the relay nodes estimate the source signals, perform XOR NC, and broadcast the relay signal to both source nodes through the distributed SM. To improve the detection performance of relay nodes, the signal constellation used at one source node is a rotated version of that at the other source node, and the optimization of the rotation angle is presented. Finally, the validity of both the proposed detector for one-way relaying and the proposed relay protocol for two-way relaying is justified by simulation results.	exclusive or;linear network coding;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;one-way function;relay;simulation;two-phase commit protocol	Jianping Zheng	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2757512	mimo;relay channel;computer network;linear network coding;computer science;modulation;constellation diagram;broadcasting;detector;relay	Mobile	34.40756264907414	77.08500589687739	52557

In the previous works, the effect of call admission control (CAC) on signal to interference ratio (SIR) is considered to evaluate the performance of the outage probability for CDMA systems, however, the effect of CAC on system states is not accurately considered. In this letter, we first analyze the system states more exactly by taking the effect of CAC on CDMA system states into account. Then, the exact probability of the outage is derived according to the exact system states. The probability of the system states and the outage of the proposed approximation scheme are compared with the results of the traditional analysis schemes and the computer simulation. Compared with traditional analysis schemes, the numerical results of the proposed analysis scheme is more close to the computer simulation results.	downtime	Shiquan Piao;Jaewon Park;Yongwan Park	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.8.2226	computer simulation;code division multiple access;simulation;signal-to-interference ratio;telecommunications link;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;access control	Visualization	31.31373129168552	83.1452452472094	52581

In Malaysia, 8 companies have been allocated spectrum in 2.6GHz Band (LTE band class 7). This paper aims to provide some high level insights on the throughput performance of these spectrums. Although a lot of studies have been undertaken with regards to LTE network performances, various degrees of discrepancy still exist in particularly concerning network layer (IP) throughput. A wide array of factors may contribute to these differences, which include differences in methodology adopted, levels of abstraction (or details) used in the simulation model, environment and/or usage scenarios and so on. Using OPNET's latest LTE library, we study the effects of duplexing scheme (FDD vs. TDD), MCS, channel bandwidth, bearer's type (GBR or non-GBR) for the allocated spectrums. The impact of multiple users' access on the throughput performance is also analyzed. This work enables us to compare and contrast our findings with the existing studies while providing more accurate views on how the main system level configurations may impact the network layer throughput performance of the emerging LTE networks in Malaysia.	compaq lte;discrepancy function;duplex (telecommunications);emoticon;high-level programming language;mimo;multi-user;performance;principle of abstraction;rel;scheduling (computing);simulation;subpixel rendering;test-driven development;throughput	Abdulaziz M.

In this case, the conventional parity approach distributed source coding is no longer applicable. Hence, a new distributed joint source-channel superposition coding (DJSC-SC) is proposed. The proposed DJSC-SC matches the asymmetric channels, and makes full use of the good channel to obtain a better performance. Simulation results show that, compared with the conventional PA, the performance of the DJSC-SC scheme has a significant improvement and is within 1.4 dB from the capacity limit.	data compression;decibel;distributed source coding;forward error correction;iteration;polynomial-time approximation scheme;profiling (computer programming);relay channel;simulation;x.690	Lei Liu;Ying Li;Chau Yuen;Yong Liang Guan;Yue Sun	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2726530	variable-length code;mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;decoding methods;relay channel;control theory;shannon–fano coding;channel capacity;distributed source coding;communication channel;coding tree unit;computer science	Mobile	34.478061228994505	75.39374120188293	52826

In our analysis, we consider both average transmit and interference power constraints for the two schemes, so that to effectively protect the primary users from harmful interference, propose an algorithm that acquires the optimal sensing time and power allocation strategy under imperfect spectrum sensing and discuss the effect of the average transmit and interference power constraints on the optimal sensing time. Finally, simulation results are provided, in order to compare the two schemes and validate our theoretical analysis.	algorithm;cognitive radio;ergodicity;interference (communication);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Stergios Stotas;Arumugam Nallanathan	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683916	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	34.3616174642384	84.67407802874678	52887

Different microcellular layouts with varying cell densities per sq. km are investigated, while considering the outdoor and as well as indoor propagation environments. Three main capacity enhancing techniques, network densification, site placement and antenna downtilt are utilized and their effect on cell spectral efficiency and area spectral efficiency is assessed. As a result of densification, the network capacity for outdoor environment can be improved since the area spectral efficiency increases. However, due to significant reduction of cell spectral efficiency, the area spectral efficiency starts to saturate for indoor environments. The results also indicate that careful site placement can enhance the capacity performance in both outdoor and indoor environments. Moreover, antenna downtilt configuration is shown to improve the area capacity in the outdoor environment with minor improvement for indoor environments. The results hence indicate that microcellular network densification suffers from capacity inefficiency even when performance techniques like antenna downtilt is utilized. This calls for alternative methods to deploy networks, e.g., indoor networks.	interference (communication);point of view (computer hardware company);provisioning;radio wave;semantic network;software deployment;software propagation;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Syed Fahad Yunas;Tero Isotalo;Jarno Niemelä	2013	6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)	10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549014	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	HPC	26.23325040115525	84.64656265068446	52999

Stochastic geometry is used to model network deployment scenarios, while the cumulants concept is utilized to characterize the probability distribution of the aggregate interference at a tagged user. The rationale for using coordination mechanisms is to opportunistically reuse resources without compromising ongoing transmissions on overlay macrocells, while still guaranteeing Quality of Service in both tiers. Results have shown that the analytical framework matches fairly well with numerical results obtained with Monte Carlo simulations. Yet coordination mechanisms improve performance of overlay macrocell network by substantially diminishing co-channel interference.	aggregate data;approximation algorithm;coexist (image);design rationale;interference (communication);monte carlo method;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;organizing (structure);overlay network;quality of service;self-organization;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;ws-coordination	Carlos H.

The medium access control (MAC) provides a HARQ protocol where the source node, upon a decoding failure at the destination node, transmits additional coded bits for the same data packet. If a neighbor node is able to decode the first transmission, it cooperates with the source by sending additional coded bits. In order to keep nodes simple, we assume half-duplex, single band asynchronous transmissions, and receivers with single user detection techniques. Various configurations of cooperation are considered and the analysis includes key characteristics of wireless communications and interference.	access control;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);network packet	Stefano Tomasin;Marco Levorato;Michele Zorzi	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557629	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;interference;automatic repeat request;fading;wireless;statistics;computer network	Arch	33.99992728287235	76.33720192353357	53433

A single threshold is employed to select retransmitting relays as follows: a relay retransmits to the destination if its decision variable is larger than the threshold; otherwise, it remains silent. The destination then performs selection combining for the detection of transmitted information. The average end-to-end bit-error-rate (BER) is analytically determined in a closed-form expression. Based on the derived BER, the problem of choosing an optimal threshold or jointly optimal threshold and power allocation to minimize the end-to-end BER is also investigated. Both analytical and simulation results reveal that the obtained optimal threshold scheme or jointly optimal threshold and power-allocation scheme can significantly improve the BER performance compared to a previously proposed scheme.	bit error rate;delta modulation;end-to-end principle;key (cryptography);relay;secret sharing;simulation;x.690	Ha X.

This paper performs a detailed system-level analysis of the interference effects from shipborne radar systems into LTE macro cells and outdoor small cells.

a5c8489e69cf8596c2365c05fdd3da4cf9b802a5	performance analysis and scaling law of mrc/mrt relaying with csi error in multi-pair massive mimo systems		This paper provides a comprehensive scaling law and performance analysis for multi-user massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks, where the relay is equipped with a massive antenna array and uses maximal-ratio combining/maximal-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) for low-complexity processing. Imperfect channel state information (CSI) is considered for both source-relay and relay-destination channels. First, a sum-rate lower bound is derived, which manifests the effect of system parameters, including the numbers of relay antennas and users, the CSI quality, and the transmit powers of the sources and the relay. Via a general scaling model on the parameters with respect to the relay antenna number, the asymptotic scaling law of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is obtained, which shows quantitatively the tradeoff of the network parameters. In addition, a sufficient condition on the parameter scalings for the SINR to be asymptotically deterministic is given, which covers existing results on such analysis as special cases. Then, the scenario where the SINR increases linearly with the relay antenna number is studied. The sufficient and necessary condition on the parameter scaling for this scenario is proved. It is shown that in this case, the interference power is not asymptotically deterministic, and then, the average bit error rate is analyzed.	bit error rate;channel state information;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;maximal set;multi-user;profiling (computer programming);relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Qian Wang;Yindi Jing	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2017.2717399	bit error rate;channel state information;mimo;relay channel;mathematics;antenna array;relay;law;signal-to-noise ratio;upper and lower bounds	Networks	37.97917571475047	81.02698910729536	53984

In the new paradigm, the adjacent nodes no longer interfere with each other but rather cooperate. Our analysis is for MANETs when all the nodes in the network are endowed with M antennas. We derive two upper bounds on the ergodic capacity per node in the network. These upper bounds are compared with Monte-Carlo simulation of point-to-point and many-to-many communications. We show that one of our upper bounds is a tight bound. Also, we demonstrate that the capacity of MANETs with multiple antennas is improved significantly using cooperation as compared to non-cooperative schemes, i.e., point-to-point communication.	branch and bound;ergodicity;hoc (programming language);mimo;many-to-many;mobile phone;monte carlo method;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);programming paradigm;simulation	Renato M. de Moraes;Hamid R.

The asymptotic computation of the indoor radio channel using ray tracing models is widely used, and usually considers rays reflected on and transmitted through walls and obstacles, as well as antenna characteristics. However, inclusion of edge diffraction and diffuse scattering on rough surfaces is a time consuming computational task and therefore usually neglected. Though it is unrealistic to describe indoor geometry in all details, in a surrounding of the receiver it is useful to consider essential scattering sources, e.g. wall edges. We describe a fast search algorithm for the ray splitting model that performs a simplified inclusion of edge diffraction and diffuse scattering at rough walls. Scattering sources of non-specular reflection are approximated by new radiation sources. A comparison of the predicted and measured values of the path loss in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight situations within an office building demonstrates the capability of the algorithm. >		Peter Kreuzgruber;Thomas Bründl;Wolfgang Kuran;Rainer Gahleitner	1994		10.1109/VETEC.1994.345216	ray tracing;specular reflection;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;non-line-of-sight propagation;path loss;radio propagation;communications system;search algorithm	Networks	25.06302305519258	78.85592619598773	54058

In view of this distinctive property, a diversity scheme is expected to provide an effective improvement on this wireless link performance. Based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerically-derived in-body to on-body characteristics, we derive probability density function (PDF) for combined communication channels with two different approximation methods and compare their accuracy at first. Then we calculate average bit error rate (BER) with pulse position modulation (PPM) and on-off keying (OOK) modulation scheme to clarify the possible diversity effect.	approximation;bit error rate;finite-difference time-domain method;key (cryptography);modulation;numerical analysis;on-body wireless;on-off keying;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock;ultra-wideband;x.690	Jingjing Shi;Daisuke Anzai;Jianqing Wang	2011		10.1145/2093698.2093782	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Mobile	30.903981590202704	77.12499433262731	54113

Higher spectrum sensing efficiency is needed to implement Cognitive Radio Networks. Thus cluster based topology is used to increase sensing efficiency. The secondary users are divided into groups or clusters which have a cluster head and the decision of the spectrum sensing taken by all the secondary users is controlled by these cluster heads in their respective region. This paper proposes a new optimized cluster head rotation and selection scheme. Practical environmental scenarios for mobile communication like fading and shadowing are taken into consideration. The comparative analysis with previous known techniques confirms that the proposed approach performs better for cooperative cognitive radio networks.	cognitive radio;computer cluster;qualitative comparative analysis	Pulkit Sharma;Vinayak Abrol	2013	2013 Tenth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)	10.1109/WOCN.2013.6616260	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;remote radio head;detection theory;computer network	Mobile	27.45556200371477	88.27930296124164	54158

However, most current literature are focused on the large spacing antenna setup, which is impractical for user equipment (UE) because of the size limitation. Therefore, dual polarization antenna scheme is introduced in the system to provide multiplexing gain and/or diversity gain. In this paper, we derive the dual polarization channel model for performance evaluation. Furthermore, the performance of dual polarization scheme under different MIMO architectures is presented and analyzed. It is shown that polarization scheme can achieve similar average throughput and successful transmission ratio compared with spatial separation scheme in various scenarios.	channel (communications);mimo;multiplexing;network packet;performance evaluation;polarization (waves);profiling (computer programming);spectral efficiency;throughput	Xiang Zhang;Wenbo Wang;Yong Li;Mugen Peng;Shuping Chen	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671578	spectrum;throughput;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;time division multiple access;statistics;spectral efficiency;computer network;diversity gain;mimo	Mobile	27.255205965732053	82.96495614583299	54167

In this work we analyze the performance of a multiple-antenna user that transmits maximally improper signals and whose transmit covariance matrix satisfies a set of constraints that limit the harmfulness of the interference caused by this user. As opposed to the single-antenna case, there are different possible improper spatial signatures, which provide different performance. We first obtain new results for maximally improper random vectors based on majorization theory. We then apply these results to derive the improper spatial signatures that either maximize or minimize the performance. Numerical examples show that the performance difference between these two extreme cases can be surprisingly large.	antivirus software;gaussian blur;interference (communication);numerical analysis;numerical method;profiling (computer programming)	Christian Lameiro;Ignacio Santamaría;Peter J.

However, a transceiver station can only estimate the channel transfer functions (CTFs) of the channels over which the received signals propagate which are different from the channels over which the transmitted signals will propagate in FDD systems. This paper shows a technique to obtain the CSI of the channels over which the transmitted signal will propagate based on the CSI of the channels over which the received signals propagate. By means of estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) and times of arrival (TOAs), the shift of the previously estimated CSI to the CSI which cannot be estimated based on training signals can be calculated. The quality of the proposed algorithm depends on the quality of the parameter estimation. In scenarios with many scatterers the estimation of the DOAs and TOAs may not be precise enough or there may be paths with similar parameters which cannot be resolved. Thus, the proposed algorithm performs better in non-rich scattering environments.	algorithm;autoregressive model;channel state information;estimation theory;frequency band;mimo;side-channel attack;transceiver;transmitter	Nico Palleit;Tobias Weber	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450322	real-time computing;telecommunications;time of arrival;frequency-division multiplexing;transfer function;channel state information;estimation theory;direction of arrival;statistics;transceiver	Mobile	26.45540123243609	79.2731494047194	54395

The benefits are mainly due to spectral re-use over small distances, giving significant capacity and coverage benefits. This paper investigates the coverage and capacity gain achievable from two types of LTE indoor small cell product namely: 2 × 21 dBm and 2 × 24 dBm. Simulation results show that significant coverage gains up to 25% can be achieved on the high power product compared to the 2 × 21 dBm. The gain results are sensitive to propagation assumptions such as models and path loss exponents. Furthermore, the results also indicate that capacity gains up to 26% can be achieved on the 2 × 24 dBm, due to higher order modulation and coding (MCS) obtained in medium and cell edge conditions compared to the other unit. In addition, simulation results show the sensitivity of the throughput and capacity gain to macro layer reference signal received power (RSRP), as well as inter-cell interference from small cell cluster. The outcomes from this paper will be useful to guide operators/ vendors in the choice of an appropriate unit based on trade-offs between hardware complexities, cost, deployment scenarios.	compaq lte;dbm;ecosystem;interference (communication);loss function;modulation;monomial;notability in the english wikipedia;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;throughput	Gbenga Salami;Simon Burley;Olasunkanmi Durowoju;Colin Kellett	2013	2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)	10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707838	adjacent-channel interference;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;channel capacity;computer network	Mobile	26.400776727342873	83.75637161727565	54538

In order to gain a better quantitative insight of such systems, having a precise and comprehensive mathematical model of system throughput is vital. In this paper, we consider a set of PUs that are distributed in space based on Poisson point process (PPP) and demand for available spectrum. We determine the effect of these demands on the throughput of a single sensing secondary user (SU) under various channel requesting distributions and fading environment. In this context, we analytically derived the SU throughput in the presence of mutual interference due to imperfect detection of the SU in an OFDMA-based cognitive radio system. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of the primary network is analytically studied under the asymptotic conditions such as higher traffic load and increasing transmit power. The results are critically investigated, formulated as theorems and compared with simulations. It is observed that analytical and simulation results are in perfect agreement. Furthermore, it is shown that with the increase in primary network transmit power, the average throughput of the SU increases and converges to a limit point. It is also proved that with the increase in primary network traffic load, the SU throughput decreases and converges to a limit point. Numerical results verify the validity of our model in capturing the effects of system specifications such as the channel requesting distributions and the traffic load on the SU throughput.	cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical model;network packet;network traffic control;p (complexity);point process;project zomboid;simulation;statistical model;subcarrier;superuser;throughput	Nariman Rahimian;Costas N.

43af33d4871b7da043adc166e8254f29ce264886	copolar and cochannel satellite interference during rain at 11·6 ghz estimated from radar measurements		This study reports estimated results on copolar and cochannel interference during rain at 11.6GHz, derived from radar measurements, in two convergent slant paths to fixed receivers at Spino du0027Adda (45.4°N), for values of the angular separation (given by the aperture angle θ of the corresponding orbital diversity configuration) between the interfered and the interfering satellites ranging from 16.1° to 118.7°, with path elevation angles from 31.6° to to 15-6°, respectively. The results, applicable not only to geostationary satellite systems but also to systems using satellites in lower orbits, have shown that the interference level I C,n = A C - A n (dB), i.e. the difference between the simultaneous rain attenuations (dB) in the interfered path (A C ) and in the interfering path (A n ), can be significant for any θ and that, for a given maximum rain attenuation tolerated in the interfered satellite system (i.e. its power margin), I C,n increases as θ increases. The results are applicable to direct TV/audio broadcasting systems, as shown in the paper, or to fixed systems working in the 12 GHz band, and can be extrapolated to other carrier frequencies.	interference (communication);radar	Emilio Matricciani	1997	Int.

Our focus is on the maximization of the system effective multiplexing gain (EMG), by optimizing the individual antenna positions in the transmit/receive NULAs. Here, the EMG is defined as the number of signal streams that are practically supported by the channel at a finite signal-to-noise ratio. We first derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic channel eigenvalues with arbitrarily deployed NULAs when, asymptotically, the end-to-end distance is sufficiently large compared with the aperture sizes of the transmit/receive NULAs. Based on the derived expressions, we prove that the asymptotically optimal NULA deployment that maximizes the achievable EMG should follow the groupwise Fekete-point distribution. Specifically, the antennas should be physically grouped into K separate ULAs with the minimum feasible antenna spacing within each ULA, where K is the target EMG to be achieved; in addition, the centers of these K ULAs follow the Fekete-point distribution. We numerically verify the asymptotic optimality of such an NULA deployment and extend it to a groupwise projected arch-type NULA deployment, which provides a more practical option for mmWave LoS MIMO systems with realistic nonasymptotic configurations. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate a significant capacity gain of the optimized NULAs over traditional ULAs.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;electromyography;end-to-end principle;expectation–maximization algorithm;fekete polynomial;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;software deployment	Peng Wang;Yonghui Li;Yuexing Peng;Soung Chang Liew;Branka Vucetic	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2601088	aperture;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;wireless;statistics;mimo	Networks	37.06000020813485	85.9048927343382	54934

Then we apply entropy weight method to find the reasonable weights for the five indicators, and thus achieve quantitative radio channel fingerprint model. Finally, the proposed fingerprint model is used to correctly realize scene recognition with the practical measured data provided by Huawei Corporation.

In this work, we quantify the communication performance by the outage probability and the system throughput. We establish a remarkably simple, yet accurate analytical framework based on joint decoding to describe the outage probability and the system throughput depending on the number of links, the modulation scheme, the code rate, the bandwidth, and the received signal-to-noise ratio. To investigate the tradeoff between the outage probability and the system throughput we define two modes to either achieve low outage probabilities or high system throughput which we refer to as the diversity and the multiplexing mode, respectively. We then establish a rate-reliability tradeoff analysis based on time sharing between both modes.	code rate;data compression;distributed source coding;downtime;modulation;multiplexing;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;time-sharing;user requirements document	Albrecht Wolf;Philipp Schulz;David Ohmann;Meik Dörpinghaus;Gerhard P.

As a training method a combination of a pilot-assisted scheme and a biased signaling scheme is considered. The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based on the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed in the large-system limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of replica symmetry. It is shown that negligible pilot information is best in terms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system limit. The obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the existing lower bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state information (CSI), derived by Hassibi and Hochwald, for all SNRs. The comparison between the obtained bound and a high-SNR approximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that the high-SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered. Energy efficiency in the low-SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the power per information bit required for reliable communication. The required minimum power is shown to be achieved at a positive rate for the SD receiver with no CSI, whereas it is achieved in the zero-rate limit for the case of perfect CSI available at the receiver. Moreover, numerical simulations imply that the presented large-system analysis can provide a good approximation for not so large systems. The results in this paper imply that SD schemes can provide a significant performance gain in the low-to-moderate SNR regimes, compared to conventional receivers based on one-shot channel estimation.	approximation;channel capacity;channel state information;computer simulation;mimo;mean squared error;numerical analysis;rate limiting;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;system analysis;teaching method	Keigo Takeuchi;Ralf R.

The primary system comprises a transmitter-receiver pair (PT-PR) and a decode-and-forward relay (Relay), while the secondary system comprises a transmitter-receiver pair (ST-SR). In the proposed protocol, the Relay assists the transmissions of the primary users as well as the secondary users where there is no direct link between the ST and the SR. Outage probabilities of the primary system and the secondary system are derived and verified through simulations. Compared with the protocol without cooperation, better outage performance of the primary system is achieved. Meanwhile, though the ST causes interference to the PR, the interference is compensated by the cooperation of the Relay. Moreover, the proposed protocol realizes the communications of the secondary users on the condition that the secondary transmission link is not ideal.	downtime;inline linking;interference (communication);internet relay chat;simulation;transmitter;two-phase commit protocol	Xiangqi Sun;Hongbin Chen;Rongfang Bie	2014	EURASIP J.

Focusing on the secondary communication process, a relay selection procedure is performed prior to the communication process, where the selected relay is the one maximising the instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, at the same time, satisfying the power restrictions imposed by the primary receivers. The secondary destination employs a selection combining strategy, selecting the best path (direct link or relaying link) with the highest instantaneous SNR. Two kinds of relaying protocols are considered: decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward. For the former, an exact closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) is derived, whereas for the latter an accurate approximation for the OP is obtained. Then, an asymptotic analysis is carried out and reveals that the system diversity order is N + 1 for both relaying protocols, with N denoting the number of relays. Monte Carlo simulations assess the accuracy of the authors’ results.	approximation;downtime;end-to-end principle;inline linking;monte carlo method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage	Francisco Rafael Vasconcelos Guimarães;Daniel Benevides da Costa;Mustapha Benjillali;Theodoros A.

Cooperative diversity networks use the neighbor nodes to assist the source by sending the source information to the destination for achieving spatial diversity. Regular cooperative diversity networks make an inefficient use of the channel resources because relays forward the source signal to the destination every time regardless of the channel conditions. Incremental relaying cooperative diversity has been proposed to save the channel resources by restricting the relaying process to the bad channel conditions only [1]. Incremental relaying cooperative relaying networks exploit limited feedback from the destination terminal, e.g., a single bit indicating the success or failure of the direct transmission. If the destination provides a negative acknowledgment via feedback; in this case only, the relay retransmits in an attempt to exploit spatial diversity by combining the signals that the destination receives from the source and the relay. In this paper, we study the end-to-end performance of incremental relaying cooperative diversity networks using amplify-and-forward relays over independent non-identical Rayleigh fading channels. Closed-form expressions for the bit error rate and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage probability are determined. Results show that the incremental relaying cooperative diversity can achieve the maximum possible diversity, compared with the regular cooperative diversity networks, with higher channel utilization.

4ad2b132235e0c1014bcefb313c7e6cc73523740	outage probability analysis of cooperative transmission protocols without and with network coding: inter-user channels based comparison	cooperative transmission;wireless network;adaptive protocol;performance comparison;network coding;amplify and forward;decode and forward;relay channel;outage probability;static and adaptive protocols	In wireless networks, cooperative transmission is used as a means to combat channel fading. In this system, a source and a relay transmit each others' messages to a common destination using either amplify-and-forward or decode-and-forward strategies; the protocols in cooperative transmission can also broadly be categorized as static and adaptive. The idea in a network-coding-based cooperative transmission protocol is to allow the source and relay to combine messages by a network coding operation; a modulo-2 sum operation implements this network coding. In this work, the performance of various decode-and-forward-based cooperative transmission protocols without and with additional network coding is investigated. Outage probability is used as a measure of performance, and results for symmetrical source-relay and source/relay-destination channels are presented; also a source-relay-channels-based comparison is made. Based on these outage results, network-coding-based protocols are found to be suitable when the source-relay channels are unreliable; when the source-relay channels are good, protocols without network coding perform better. Moreover, to improve the performance of static protocols, we have introduced a sequence of decoding at the destination, and the corresponding outage results show that these protocols can achieve full diversity.	categorization;cooperative mimo;downtime;linear network coding;relay	Dereje H.

In this investigation, the channel capacity is improved by using a novel spatial diversity technique, which originally requires more space to achieve higher data rate. A new configuration (double stage technique) of spatial diversity and polarization diversity is introduced in this investigation, and measured for an indoor environment. Comparative analyses on the linear and X-polarized configurations of the antenna has been conducted for spacings between 0.5 and 2? at 2.4 GHz. The results show that the channel capacity for the double stage diversity configuration could achieve more than 5.6 b/s/Hz. Furthermore, the space between antennas could be reduced up to 150 %, compared to a linear polarized configuration. Thus, the double stage diversity technique has high potential for use in designing a compact system of wireless MIMO communication infrastructure, especially for LTE systems.	channel capacity;mimo	Mohamad Zoinol Abidin Abdul Aziz;Mohamad Kamal A.

In a (J, Ja, Ra, M) MARN, J sources, each equipped with Ja antennas, communicate to one M-antenna destination through one Ra-antenna relay. A new protocol called IC-Relay-TDMA is proposed which takes two phases. During the first phase, symbols of different sources are transmitted concurrently to the relay. At the relay, interference cancellation (IC) techniques, previously proposed for systems with direct transmission, are applied to decouple the information of different sources without decoding. During the second phase, symbols of different sources are forwarded to the destination in a time division multi-access (TDMA) fashion. At the destination, the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding is performed source-by-source. The protocol of IC-Relay-TDMA requires the number of relay antennas no less than the number of sources, i.e., Ra ≥ J. Through outage analysis, the achievable diversity gain of the proposed scheme is shown to be min {Ja (Ra - J + 1), RaM}. When M ≤ Ja(1- J-1/Ra), the proposed scheme achieves the maximum interference-free (int-free) diversity gain RaM. Since concurrent transmission is allowed during the first phase, compared to full TDMA transmission, the proposed scheme achieves the same diversity, but with a higher symbol rate.	catastrophic interference;chernoff bound;concurrency (computer science);converge;decoding methods;downtime;expanded memory;interference (communication);internet relay chat;maxima and minima;multi-user;pairwise error probability;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subscriber identity module	Liangbin Li;Yindi Jing;Hamid Jafarkhani	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.011111.100640	telecommunications;information theory;computer science;integrated circuit;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.3417495511293	76.70606272413214	55809

At the moment, the main question about interference-resilient receivers is: Do they really bring forth the capacity increase they promise on theoretical grounds? The aim of this study is to give a preliminary answer to such a question, through the capacity analysis of the forward link of a multisatellite, multibeam, radio communication network. Specifically, starting from simplified yet realistic assumptions on the beam layout, the antenna footprint shape, and the coding/multiplexing/modulation and power control strategies, it is shown that the blind, adaptive, interference-mitigation receiver, selected as an appealing representative of the lot, can indeed boost the system quality of service in terms of outage probability. The results are derived after a mix of theoretical analysis (as far as the detector performance evaluation is concerned) and simulation (to examine a number of different random system configurations) to circumvent the inherent complexity of the issue.	algorithm;downtime;footprint (satellite);interference (communication);modulation;multiplexing;performance evaluation;quality of service;simulation;stochastic process;telecommunications link;telecommunications network	Riccardo De Gaudenzi;Filippo Giannetti;Marco Luise	1999	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.748784	code division multiple access;index term;quality of service;telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio receiver;spread spectrum;communications satellite;computer network	Metrics	26.488078832216726	85.00450255595366	55873

Here, we take into account (i) residual self- interference (SI) over Rician fading channels, and (ii) mutual-interference (MI) under successive interference cancellation (SIC) mechanism. Considering linear zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming, the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) average secrecy rates under both scenarios of passive and colluding eavesdropping are derived. Our findings indicate that the FD functionality can provide substantial improvements in the PHYlayer security performance, especially with the aid of MIMO communications and interference cancellation solutions.

In this setup, two users exchange data via a relay and via direct user-to-user links. Due to the half-duplex constraint, the channel can be in one of eight different states at any time (two of which are useless: no node transmitting and no node listening). Restricting to only four states, we propose a scheme that utilizes lattice codes to improve upon existing four-state schemes. Using all six states, we propose another scheme that utilizes lattice codes and coherent combining, and show that it can outperform existing schemes.	code;coherence (physics);duplex (telecommunications);relay channel;transmitter	Lawrence Ong	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2015.7282784	telecommunications;bismuth;lattice;mathematics;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;encoding;computer network	Arch	34.70404454217375	75.01609670698784	56015

The evaluations show that in these situations the radio channel is highly influenced by the rich scattering environment. Most important scatterers are traffic signs, trucks, and bridges, whereas other cars do not significantly contribute to the multipath propagation.	collision detection;for the win;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;network congestion;rx microcontroller family;radiation pattern;robertson–seymour theorem;software propagation;spectral density;transmitter;vehicle-to-vehicle	Alexander Paier;Laura Bernadó;Johan Karedal;Oliver Klemp;Andreas Kwoczek	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493975	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;statistics;computer network	Mobile	25.27190005872817	78.71040217933385	56170
84f0f871853b2741dde4af745455f9ce7657117a	signal detection for ambient backscatter communications using unsupervised learning		Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has attracted much attention recently due to its low-cost and low power consumption in connecting billions of devices for future Internet-of-Things (IoT). Signal detection in AmBC can be a challenging issue because of the difficulty in estimating relevant channels, and the spectrum sharing nature of the AmBC system. In this paper, a novel machine learning inspired signal detection method is proposed for AmBC systems. This method exploits the features of the received signals directly and groups them into clusters through unsupervised learning. Furthermore, labeled bits from tag are transmitted for cluster-bit mapping to assist signal detection without estimating the channel coefficients and the noise power. Two detection approaches are proposed for the cases that the spreading gain N ≫ 1 and N = 1, where the features follow different mixture distributions. The detection thresholds are derived to optimize the detection performance using the learned parameters. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed schemes.	algorithm;ambient backscatter;coefficient;detection theory;future internet;machine learning;noise power;simulation;unsupervised learning	Qianqian Zhang;Ying-Chang Liang	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269048	real-time computing;backscatter;unsupervised learning;detection theory;machine learning;internet of things;computer science;noise power;communication channel;artificial intelligence	ML	32.540266381717444	83.61947207051038	56226

A cluster-based feedback scheme is proposed such that the range of possible signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the users are divided into several clusters according to the order statistics of the users' SNRs. Each cluster has a corresponding threshold, and the users compare their measured instantaneous SNRs with the thresholds to determine whether and how many bits they should use to feed back their instantaneous SNRs. If a user's instantaneous SNR is lower than a certain threshold, the user does not feed back. Feedback load reduction is thus achieved. For a given number of clusters, the sum rate loss using the cluster-based feedback scheme is investigated. Then the minimum number of clusters given a maximum tolerable sum rate loss is derived. Through simulations, it is shown that, when the number of users is large, full multiuser diversity can be achieved by the proposed feedback scheme, which is more efficient than the conventional schemes.	computer cluster;feedback;mimo;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Jin-Hao Li;Hsuan-Jung Su	2011	2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983899	random variable;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	38.98613510790644	84.20385411874628	56232

But for the real environment, the channel should be assumed frequency-selective due to the high date rates. So in this paper we evaluate the performance of an ED over a frequency-selective fading channel. We show that the performance of the ED might improve because of the multipath environment. The average detection probability for the ED over a frequency-selective channel is evaluated analytically and validated through simulation. Further, the outage probability is derived theoretically and supported by computer simulations. The results confirm that there is a significant improvement in the performance of the ED over the frequency-selective fading channel compared with the flat-fading channel. Finally, we show that the detection probability rapidly improves with initial increases in the number of multipaths but later flattens out.	channel (communications);cognitive radio;computer simulation;downtime;multipath propagation;probability amplitude;profiling (computer programming)	Youssif Fawzi Sharkasi;Desmond C.

However, in rural and suburban areas, it is often too expensive for network providers to serve every user with traditional wired broadband access such as DSL or cable modem. In such areas, WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) networks based on the IEEE 802.16 standard are the most promising solution. In this paper, we focus on the performance of the IEEE 802.16 time division duplex (TDD) mode in rural areas with only one cell. When using TDD, the duration of the downlink and uplink subframe can be set individually, which is called adaptive time division duplex (ATDD). However, the ratio between downlink and uplink is normally set to a fixed value. We will show the performance of different fixed downlink/uplink ratios for several traffic models. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for an adaptive downlink/uplink boundary in dependence on the current traffic load in the cell. The results show an enormous performance gain compared to the fixed settings.	acceptance test–driven development;algorithm;cable modem;digital subscriber line;duplex (telecommunications);framing (world wide web);internet access;interoperability;microwave;network congestion;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Rastin Pries;Dirk Staehle;Daniel Marsico	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.359	wimax;electronic engineering;digital subscriber line;telecommunications link;adaptive control;telecommunications;network switch;cable modem;computer science;engineering;base station;scheduling;rural area;time division multiple access;bandwidth;computer network;broadband networks;access network	Visualization	24.927307997898446	86.6786186601891	56523

In fixed DF protocols, the error propagation effect that limits the diversity gain can be overcome by using joint maximum-likelihood (JML) detection, but its complexity increases exponentially with the number of streams and modulation orders. To develop a low-complexity detection scheme, we first extend the cooperative maximum-ratio combining (C-MRC) scheme to MIMO relay networks, and then investigate the diversity order of the system. We show that C-MRC achieves full diversity gain for orthogonal space-time code, but its diversity gain is limited when the deployed space-time code is non-orthogonal. To address this problem, we propose an effective detection scheme that is applicable to arbitrary space-time codes. On the basis of pairwise error probability approximation, max-log approximation, and the Chernoff bound, we construct an equivalent point-to-point MIMO signal model, and then apply tree-search detection techniques. Compared to JML, the proposed detection scheme significantly reduces the detection complexity while preserving diversity gain.

A lemma about inversion of subchannel power gains is proved and examples that exhibit its utility are presented. As a result, a non-iterative adaptive power allocation technique is derived. The algorithm combines the recently proposed ordered subcarrier selection method with ‘subchannel inversion’. Compared with the original technique, such a combination provides a power gain that depends on the channel statistics.	algorithm;bit error rate;digital subchannel;iterative method;multiplexing;performance per watt;power gain;subcarrier;x.690	Natalia Y.

Using game theoretic tools, a useful framework is provided in order to determine the optimal power allocation when users know only their own channel (while perfect channel state information is assumed at the base station). We consider the realistic case of frequency selective channels. This scenario illustrates the case of decentralized schemes and aims at reducing the downlink signaling overhead. Various receivers are considered, namely the Matched filter, the MMSE filter and the optimum filter. The goal of this paper is to derive simple expressions for the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium as the number of mobiles becomes large. To that end we combine two asymptotic methodologies. The first is asymptotic random matrix theory which allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the impact of all other mobiles on any given tagged mobile. The second is the theory of non-atomic games along with the Wardrop equilibrium concept which allows us to compute good approximations of the Nash equilibrium as the number of mobiles grow.	approximation;channel state information;matched filter;nash equilibrium;overhead (computing);telecommunications link;theory	Nicolas Bonneau;Mérouane Debbah;Eitan Altman;Are Hjørungnes	2007	2007 5th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks and Workshops	10.1109/WIOPT.2007.4480091	game theory;telecommunications;computer science;base station;control theory;mathematics;matched filter	Embedded	37.08947027694387	80.01059551534303	56704

An exact closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability is derived, and simplified for two special cases (i.e., distinct power distributed and equal power distributed jamming signals). Based on the attained results, an asymptotic secrecy analysis is carried out, which shows that the diversity order of the considered system equals to NA, with NA being the number of antennas at the Tx. Although previous works have shown that the diversity gain is impacted by both NA and M when an interference-limited eavesdropper scenario is considered, our results reveal that assuming multiple interferers and noise at the eavesdropper, the diversity gain equals to NA so that the number of jamming signals does not affect anymore the diversity gain.

a1e8d2ab25ab55449b4ee0735c8e9e0aae7b7023	performance analysis of distributed auxiliary radio telescopes under shared spectrum access paradigm and cooling power constraint		A conflict of the spectrum rights and needs between active wireless communication systems and passive radio astronomy systems (RASs) has become substantially greater due to the phenomenal expansion of wireless communications and increased interest in RAS observation. For sustainable growth and coexistence of cellular wireless communications (CWC) and RAS, a coordinated shared spectrum access paradigm was recently introduced. Embracing such paradigm, this paper proposes a distributed auxiliary radio telescope (DART) system which can geographically and spectrally coexist with CWC while offering additional capability or performance enhancement to RAS. Theoretical performance analysis of the DART system with different quantization resolutions is presented, and approximate closed-form expressions are obtained. Adaptation of cooling power of DART receivers according to the time-varying ambient temperature is also proposed. Furthermore, an analytical expression for the DART system parameters under the shared spectrum access paradigm and cooling power constraint to achieve the same performance as the existing single-dish RAS with a radio quiet zone is developed to provide guidance in the DART system design. The numerical and simulation results illustrate feasibility and potentials of the proposed DART system.	approximation algorithm;cwc mode;coexist (image);computer cooling;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);programming paradigm;simulation;systems design	Dong Han;Hlaing Minn	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762240	radio astronomy;radio telescope;quantization (signal processing);wireless;distributed computing;computer science;systems design;dart	Mobile	37.219882647184114	84.75724094505101	56778

However, the fading nature of wireless channels usually causes great asymmetry between two downlink channels, which can degrade the performance of NC. Therefore, it is very necessary to perform an opportunistic scheme that selects between broadcast and unicast at the relay node based on channel side information. This paper focuses on the fundamental limit of the sum rate in the downlink. To solve the maximization problem of the sum rate in the downlink, we first introduce an auxiliary variable, known as marginal capacity income of transmit power, and then derive the corresponding power allocation in closed-form expression and present an opportunistic switching selection strategy between broadcast/unicast. Numerical results also show that our proposed scheme achieves a larger downlink sum throughput compared with other existing known schemes.	expectation–maximization algorithm;linear network coding;marginal model;relay;telecommunications link;throughput;unicast	Tao Li;Ke Xiong;Yunquan Dong;Pingyi Fan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2344131	throughput;electronic engineering;linear network coding;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;broadcasting;fading;statistics;computer network;unicast	Mobile	34.2877618114335	79.25290745175269	56957

Compared with the traditional smartphone network, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a special technique of smartphone sensing, however, is still an open issue. In this paper, we consider a practical power-limited cluster-based CSN, in which one end user can only share the sensing messages broadcasted by its neighbors. Aiming at improving the performance of CSS, we propose a relay-assisted random broadcast scheme to extend the range of message sharing. We introduce the message sharing probability (MSP) to quantify the performance of message sharing, and the restricted random broadcast model to simplify the theoretical analysis of MSP. We then employ the proposed scheme for CSS in a CSN, and study the problem of sensing–sharing tradeoff. Simulations show that our proposed scheme can achieve substantial performance improvement on both message sharing and CSS compared to the scheme without relays. Moreover, it is indicated that the performance of CSS can be maximized by optimizing the duration of message sharing when a total sensing time is given.	cascading style sheets;cell signaling;cognitive radio;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;max;performance tuning;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;smartphone	Qi Zhao;Zhijie Wu;Daqiang Zhang;Mina Shim;Changqing Yin	2014	Multimedia Systems	10.1007/s00530-014-0385-x	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	32.94226874994653	83.62933259958612	57150

In this paper, we analyze the performance of the RBF in the presence of other cell interference (OCI), where a base station with $M$ antennas supports $M_s$ users ($M_s\le M$) selected by scheduling among $K$ single antenna users. Employing extreme value theory, we derive a closed-form approximation on the asymptotic ergodic sum rate by examining the limiting distribution of the largest signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among $K$ independent users. Also, we prove that even if the OCI exists, we have the same sum rate scaling law of $M_s\log_2\log_2 K$ as the system without OCI. Simulation results verify that our analysis provides an accurate estimation for the average sum rate performance even when $K$ is not so large.	approximation;beamforming;ergodicity;extreme value theory;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;maxima and minima;multi-user;oracle call interface;radial basis function;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;system analysis;telecommunications link	Sung Hyun Moon;Sang-Rim Lee;Inkyu Lee	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956475	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	37.50296181055247	80.88220388570714	57296

The base station (BS) then calculates the estimated signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each unselected user using the best precoding vector, and choose the one with the largest SINR.

The MAC protocols that were considered are all IEEE 802.15.4 compatible, i.e., the IEEE 802.15.4a optional UWB clear-channel-assessment mode, the IEEE 802.15.4a ALOHA mode, and a protocol termed preamble sense multiple access (PSMA). The impact on the network throughput, energy consumption, and delay are analytically derived and verified by simulation. The results show that these effects have a considerable impact on the performance of IR-UWB MAC protocols, and a classical analysis does not properly evaluate the protocolspsila performances. The results compare the performances of the MAC protocols and highlight a number of issues with regard to adapting narrowband protocols to UWB systems. The probability of frame collision survival on simultaneous transmissions is shown to have a significant impact on the performance of a MAC protocol. The comparison shows superior performance of the PSMA protocol under typical wireless-sensor-network operation ranges.	access control;performance;simulation;throughput;ultra-wideband	Jussi Haapola;Alberto Rabbachin;Leonardo Goratti;Carlos A.

Three types of the K-factor, consisting of narrowband, wideband and delay K-factor, are extracted according to the measured channel responses by using the channel partitioning and combining method. Due to the rich reflecting and scattering components in the U-shape cutting scenario, the K-factor dramatically changes with the frequency. A distance-based statistical narrowband K-factor model covering the frequency variability is proposed. The channel bandwidth dependent property of the wideband K-factor is observed and then a bandwidth-based statistical wideband K-factor model is developed. Moreover, it is found that the K-factor just exists at the beginning of the delay bins in the deep U-shape cutting scenario. These results are provided for use in system design and channel modeling of high-speed railway communications.	hierarchical state routing;k-factor (cisco);software propagation;spatial variability;statistical model;systems design	Tao Zhou;Cheng Tao;Liu Liu;Zhenhui Tan	2014	2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2014.7023077	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;bandwidth	EDA	26.362353906906215	78.4171629953866	57441

The measurement data is collected continuously from the area covered by LTE base stations alongside the railway. By extracting LTE downlink cell-specific reference signal, channel impulse responding (CIR) can be calculated, and based on this the correlation characteristic of MIMO channels is investigated. The results show that the cross-correlation coeffi-cient at the BS side is stronger than the UE side. And correspondingly the statistics of eigenvalues of channel correlation matrix and the interrelation between capacity and condition number are shown. Finally MIMO channel characteristic in different speed will be compared. All the field measurement results would be a profit reference for channel modelling.

Due to some special characteristics of 60 GHz band of frequencies and use of multiple directional antennas, the network level and user level throughput can be increased tremendously by identifying and scheduling the non interfering transmission requests for concurrent transmissions. Instead of direct communication between source and destination, by traversing the traffic flow on optimum path (consists of light weight multiple-relying-hops), can further increase the throughput and balances the load condition across the network. In this paper we present a scheduling scheme for concurrent transmission of non interfering transmission requests on instantaneous optimum path. Performance of scheme is investigated for different path loss exponents.	concurrency (computer science);fairness measure;meltwater entrepreneurial school of technology;multiversion concurrency control;scheduling (computing);throughput	Muhammad Bilal;Moonsoo Kang	2012	2012 14th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	HPC	28.07053489154291	83.16882542651301	57514

We contrast its performance with the traditional Stop And Sense (SAS) frame structure, which involves the secondary users stopping transmissions and sensing for spectrum holes. We obtain near-optimal, easily computable solutions for the sensing duration and sensing thresholds that approximately maximize the secondary throughput under an aggregate interference constraint. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we present a detailed comparison of the two schemes, and characterize the operating regimes where each frame structure is preferable over the other. In general when switching latencies are not accounted for, we find that the proposed Simultaneous Sense and Access (SSA) frame structure performs similar to the existing SAS frame structure in terms of throughput for all values of primary signal SNR. When switching latencies are accounted for, the SSA frame structure offers significantly higher throughput gain for all values of primary SNR. Another advantage of this frame structure over a few other existing frame structures when employed in a network of secondary users is that it does not rely on the data in the previous slot to make decisions about the presence/absence of primary signal in the current slot which makes the frame structure ideal for an adhoc network.	aggregate data;cognitive radio;computable function;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;sas;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Vishnu Vikyath Gowravajhala	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289201	markov chain;cognitive radio;real-time computing;convex optimization;telecommunications;computer science;statistical power;node;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.65962975909051	84.92996442322246	57753

In this paper, the uplink throughput improvement effect of 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is estimated by using the measured throughput and received signal level of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). The estimation results show that 16 QAM yields a higher uplink throughput than QPSK within coverage of 700 m when the base-station antenna height is 58 m. The results are validated by evaluating the uplink throughput performance of 16 QAM measured in the field trial. We consider that 16 QAM is useful to provide a mobile broadband data communication service to subscribers in uplink as well as downlink.	in-phase and quadrature components;key (cryptography);modulation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;throughput	Hiroshi Oguma;Suguru Kameda;Tadashi Takagi;Kazuo Tsubouchi;Noboru Izuka;Yasuyoshi Asano;Yoshiharu Yamazaki	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450327	quadrature amplitude modulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;computer network	Mobile	26.61019304378858	82.28263272343672	57766

A novel upper bound on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is derived, taking into account the quality of the CSIT. It is shown that from a DMT perspective, the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol is strictly optimal over a certain range of the multiplexing gains. When the quality of the CSIT is sufficiently high, the DMT performance of the DF protocol with noisy CSIT equals that of the dynamic DF protocol shifted above by a constant diversity gain, which depends only on the quality of the CSIT about the source-destination link. When the quality of the CSIT reduces, DF relaying is still DMT-optimal, but only over a smaller range of the multiplexing gains. In an intermediate range of the multiplexing gains, nonorthogonal schemes provide some additional gains when the CSIT quality is sufficiently low. It is also shown that the DMT of the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol is offset by a constant term depending on the quality of the CSIT of the source-destination link only.	anisotropic filtering;channel state information;constant term;digital monetary trust;direction finding;disk data format;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);multiplexing;noisy-channel coding theorem;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Thanh Tùng Kim;H.

The behavior of the wireless channel in these bands differ significantly from the sub-6 GHz counterparts. Ray tracing is a complementary effort to detailed measurements in providing quick insight into the coarse channel characteristics. In this paper, we model the 28 GHz outdoor channel through ray tracing using the WinProp tool. We simulate the single base station and multi base station scenarios in the downtown Manhattan area and study channel properties such as coverage and path loss, path diversity and delay spreads. We observe that a typical MMW base station provides coverage to a significant fraction of a 100m cell radius with path diversity, i.e. there exist secondary paths that may sustain the link on the failure of the first path. The improvements to coverage and path diversity with multiple base stations are also characterized. The above channel properties are compared with NYU's [4] results from the same region. We observe a reasonable match for many of the above parameters. The delay spreads with omni and beamformed antennas are also compared. The typical RMS delay spread in a beamformed scenario is seen to be in the order of 20-30 ns which is significantly smaller than the measured values of 100ns or more. This phenomenon is likely due to detailed clutter in the environment not being modeled.	clutter;code coverage;data rate units;existential quantification;ray tracing (graphics);simulation	Zhenliang Zhang;Jung Ryu;Sundar Subramanian;Ashwin Sampath	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248516	telecommunications	Mobile	25.91216193125186	79.81878563534558	57947

In this paper, continuous-wave (CW) envelope fading waveforms are recorded over a period of 50 s with static antennas. This paper focuses on the analysis of the combined effect of wind and rain, which is often encountered in a tropical forest. The induced temporal effects are discussed and compared with theoretical models. It is found that the distribution of temporal fading components resembles a Rician distribution function. Its Rician K factor gradually decreases as the strength of either wind or rain increases due to the movement of the forest components.	software propagation;the forest;ultra high frequency	Yu Song Meng;Yee Hui Lee;Boon Chong Ng	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2021480	electronic engineering;telecommunications;antenna	Visualization	26.679471953798938	76.27762476388513	58142

7728e5b279b8d4e66e741562c1fb83eba6e426fc	opportunistic group antenna selection in spatial modulation systems		"""This paper proposes an opportunistic spatial modulation (OSM) scheme where the transmit antennas are divided into <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$K\geq 1 $ </tex-math></inline-formula> equal groups, and the best antenna from each group is selected to form a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula> transmit antenna subset for implementing spatial modulation (SM). Thus, the activation of one antenna from the subset to transmit one of the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-ary modulation symbols achieves a data rate of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\log _{2} (K) +\log _{2} (M)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> bits per channel use. Notably, special cases of OSM include conventional SM and pure single transmit antenna selection. To characterize and comparatively evaluate OSM, we first consider phase-shift keying modulation and derive a closed-form, improved union-bound of symbol error probability (SEP) with a single-antenna receiver. Explicit expressions for the SEP in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are also presented. Extensions to quadrature amplitude modulation analysis and simulations of multiple-antenna reception case are also provided. Simulation results corroborate the analytical results and reveal the interesting interplay between the signal and spatial constellation diagrams. For a given number of transmit antennas and targeted data rate, asymptotically, the SEP can be minimized by using only one antenna group and the largest size of signal constellation, as this configuration achieves the full-diversity order."""	channel use;color depth;data rate units;diagram;key (cryptography);modulation;openstreetmap;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;symantec endpoint protection	Yuanyuan He;Saman Atapattu;Chintha Tellambura;Jamie S.

In order to tackle rapidly increasing traffic for 2020 and beyond, new radio access network for the 5G mobile communication systems will introduce the use of higher-frequency bands such as spectra higher than 10 GHz to achieve higher capacity and super high bit rate transmission of several tens of Gbps. The target of this experimental trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of using 28-GHz band with super-wide bandwidth of 800 MHz for 5G mobile communication systems. Firstly, the technical concept of this trial and the prototype design of the experimental system are presented. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique is attracting attention to compensate for large path-loss in higher frequency bands. In this experimental trial, the beamforming (BF) based on Massive MIMO is introduced to the transmission using 28-GHz band. Some results of the indoor and outdoor experiments are also shown to evaluate the feasibility of using 28-GHz band with 800-MHz bandwidth.	beamforming;brainfuck;data rate units;elegant degradation;experiment;experimental system;frequency band;multi-user mimo;prototype;radio access network;throughput	Tatsunori Obara;Tatsuki Okuyama;Yuuichi Aoki;Satoshi Suyama;Jaekon Lee;Yukihiko Okumura	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343415	throughput;3g mimo;telecommunications;computer science;prototype;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	26.017196970720583	82.83126768184245	58321

Coexistence of in-band D2D and cellular transmissions requires time synchronization between multiple links to prevent from interference and avoid using longer cyclic prefix or guard bands. This paper proposes a synchronization solution enabling interference-free coexistence of inter-cellular sidelink and existing cellular links, also considering non- synchronized base stations. Multiple synchronization sources including base stations, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and mobile users are hierarchically combined and network-instructed synchronization avoids any misalignments.

We analyze a suboptimal decentralized relay selection (DRS) strategy that only utilizes local channel state information of the relays within a given hop, to select distinct multihop paths for each user pair. Specifically, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability and diversity order of the DRS algorithm which prove that the full diversity order is achieved with complexity that is quadratic with the number of relays in each hop.

Focusing on the uplink of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) network, a noncooperative game is considered in which each user seeks to choose a transmit power that maximizes its own utility while satisfying its (transmission) delay requirements. The utility function measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy and the user's delay constraint is modeled as an upper bound on the delay outage probability. The Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived, and its existence and uniqueness are proved. Using a large-system analysis, explicit expressions for the utilities achieved at equilibrium are obtained for the matched filter, decorrelating and (linear) minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) multiuser detectors. The effects of delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on the users' utilities (in bits per joule) and network capacity (i.e., the maximum number of users that can be supported) are quantified. Using the proposed framework, the tradeoffs between energy efficiency and delay are quantified in a competitive multiuser setting.	access network;decorrelation;downtime;game theory;joule;matched filter;multi-user;nash equilibrium;quality of service;requirement;sensor;system analysis;telecommunications link;utility	Farhad Meshkati;H.

b53a3a3b49ef789ab4cf07355ac255dcb8311c55	cooperative transmission and probabilistic caching for clustered d2d networks		In this paper, we aim at maximizing the cache offloading gain for a clustered device-to-device (D2D) caching network by exploiting probabilistic caching and cooperative transmission among the cluster devices. Devices with surplus memory probabilistically cache a content from a known library. A requested content is either brought from the device’s local cache, cooperatively transmitted from catering devices, or downloaded from the macro base station as a last resort. Using stochastic geometry, we derive a closed-form expression for the offloading gain and formulate the offloading maximization problem. In order to simplify the objective function and obtain analytically tractable expressions, we derive a lower bound on the offloading gain, for which a suboptimal solution is obtained when considering a special case. Results reveal that the obtained suboptimal solution can achieve up to 12% increase in the offloading gain compared to the Zipf’s caching technique. Besides, we show that the spatial scaling parameters of the network, e.g., density of clusters and distance between devices in the same cluster, play a crucial role in identifying the tradeoff between the content diversity gain and the cooperative transmission gain.	cpu cache;cache (computing);cobham's thesis;cooperative mimo;expectation–maximization algorithm;image scaling;loss function;optimization problem;zipf's law;zipf–mandelbrot law	Ramy Amer;Hesham Elsawy;Jacek Kibilda;M.

With multiple users, each given an individual delay requirement, this letter aims to minimize the total transmitted power by optimizing jointly the power distribution and the time sharing of a time-division (TD) multiuser system where the transmitter knows only the channel statistics (CST) but the mobile receivers (or users) have perfect knowledge of the channels. A suboptimal solution which utilizes Gaussian approximation with the mean and variance derived on the instantaneous mutual information and convex optimization, is proposed.

d305e626051b2b3b12437975a6bce127fb5fd685	on the performance of the two-cell cooperative single user (csu) mimo system with hybrid feedback	power control;capacity;mimo	Achievable rates of two different transmission schemes of the two-cell cooperative single user (CSU) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with hybrid feedback is studied, in which one cell has the channel state information (CSI) from a mobile station (MS) and the other has channel covariance information (CCI) from it. Disjoint encoding over two base stations (BSs) is shown to achieve the capacity of the CSU-MIMO with hybrid feedback. Rather than finding an optimal transmission scheme, a suboptimal one is proposed such that the transmit directions of the BSs with CSI and CCI are eigen directions of the instantaneous channel correlation matrix and transmit covariance matrix respectively. The optimum power allocation for these transmit directions is derived as an iterative power allocation (IPA) similar to that of the MIMO multiple access channel (MAC) with CCI only. We also propose a simple disjoint power allocation (DPA). The simulation results show that the proposed transmit directions and IPA for the CSU-MIMO with hybrid feedback outperforms the MIMO-MAC with CCI only, while the DPA achieves almost the same performance as the IPA, only when the SNR is low.	mimo	Janghoon Yang;Seung-Hun Jang;Dong Ku Kim	2011	IEICE Transactions		covariance matrix;telecommunications;control theory;statistics	Mobile	38.41957434532126	85.43306471991026	58943

0e53702402d20f4f589f2478d4703f13ade2233e	a stochastic geometry analysis of multiconnectivity in heterogeneous wireless networks		The shared resource access wireless communication system is regarded as an efficient paradigm that allows the mobile network operators to have extended coverage and satisfy their subscribers’ high capacity demands while keeping the capital and operational expenditure in check. On the other hand, dual connectivity (DC), a small cell enhancement feature, allows the subscribers to have two simultaneous connections increasing throughput and enhancing mobility robustness. The coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception and user-centric virtual cell (VC) improve the signal quality and performance. For all of these mechanisms, the user needs to be under the coverage of multiple base stations (BSs) concurrently. Because of the random nature of the wireless links and distribution of BSs in a network, the practicability/operability of DC and CoMP/VC for a typical user under such random operating conditions (both topological and wireless link randomness) needs to be adequately evaluated. In this paper, we take an extensive look at this problem exploiting tools from Poisson point process theory and stochastic geometry and derive easy-to-evaluate tractable integral expressions for essential performance metrics such as DC and CoMP/VC coverage probability of a typical user in downlink cellular. Unlike most of the existing works, we consider a signal propagation loss model, where the selection of the strongest (not necessarily the closest) BS that serves the typical user is perturbed by arbitrary shadowing, not by fading, i.e., we consider a fading-averaged signal propagation loss process. We derive the coverage probability as a function of various system parameters such as BS density, fading parameters, the cardinality of the coordination set for CoMP/VC, etc. We verify the analytical analysis with simulation results	cobham's thesis;multipoint ground;operability;point process;programming paradigm;randomness;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications link;throughput;virtual cell	Mirza Golam Kibria;Kien Nguyen;Gabriel Porto Villardi;Wei-Shun Liao;Kentaro Ishizu;Fumihide Kojima	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2863280	stochastic geometry;randomness;wireless network;computer network;throughput;fading;robustness (computer science);stochastic process;computer science;distributed computing;cellular network	Mobile	28.557616676470413	85.17277075205857	59115

4fb5b312dc9be2a60d8f931c6a4cb8c6f25a752e	stateful inter-packet signal processing for wireless networking		Traditional signal processing design (e.g., frequency offset and channel estimation) at a receiver treats each packet arrival as an independent process to facilitate decoding and interpreting packet data. In this paper, we enhance the performance of this process in the wireless network domain. We propose STAteful inter-Packet signaL procEssing (STAPLE), a framework of stateful signal processing residing between the physical and link layers. STAPLE transforms the signal processing procedure into a lightweight stateful process that caches in a small-sized memory table physical and link layer header fields as packet state information. The similarity of such information among packets serves as prior knowledge to further enhance the reliability of signal processing and thus improve the wireless network performance. We implement STAPLE on USRP X300-series devices with adapted configurations for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and 802.15.4. The STAPLE prototype is of low processing complexity and does not change any wireless standard specification. Comprehensive experimental results show that the benefit from STAPLE is universal in various wireless networks.	call of duty: black ops;channel state information;entity–relationship model;frequency offset;ibm notes;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;network packet;network performance;prototype;signal processing;state (computer science);stateful firewall;universal software radio peripheral	Shangqing Zhao;Zhengping Luo;Zhuo Lu;Xiang Lu;Yao Liu	2017		10.1145/3117811.3117846	wireless network;computer network;real-time computing;computer science;header;signal processing;stateful firewall;wi-fi array;network packet;communication channel;link layer	Mobile	30.920499284712214	78.35307917422459	59627

By exploiting the relaying capability of the CT, we propose a proactive estimation scheme for the cross-channel gain. Specifically, the CT proactively acts as a full-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF) relay for primary transceivers to trigger the power adaption of a primary transmitter (PT). By carefully designing the relay signal, the CT is able to obtain an estimation of the cross-channel gain by observing the power adaption. To demonstrate the accuracy of the estimation, we analytically characterize both an upper bound and a lower bound of the estimation performance. Furthermore, we study the impact of CT's relaying on the primary transmission and observe that the impact is related to the CT's location. By introducing a factor φ (0 ≤ φ ≤ 1) to denote the probability that the CT's relaying improves the primary transmission instead of causes interference, we design the CT location as a function of φ. Numerical results show that the estimation error of the proactive estimation scheme can be as small as 1.7% with success estimation probability around 91%. By comparing with the state of the art, we show the advantages of the proposed estimator.	anisotropic filtering;cognitive radio;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);numerical analysis;pro tools;proactive parallel suite;relay;simulation;transceiver;transmitter	Lin Zhang;Ming Xiao;Gang Wu;Guodong Zhao;Ying-Chang Liang;Shaoqian Li	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2605298	estimation;telecommunications;computer science;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;transceiver	Mobile	34.86398157019917	82.75683088333625	59720

97a3c1dbe12bff765c2a23d6af093c92324bc863	performance improvement for ofdm-rof transported 60 ghz system using spatial diversity and multiplexing		60 GHz system architectures with Radio over Fiber (RoF) transport and integrated transmitters/receivers provide a comprehensive solution for future mobile systems. Since 60 GHz communication relies on line-of-sight (LoS) conditions and narrow-beam antennas to compensate the high path-loss, it has limitations in terms of coverage for multiple user locations. In this paper, performance analysis of a 60 GHz integrated transmitter and receiver system supported by RoF transport has been performed experimentally at different user locations for up to 1.5m transmission distance. Extension of experimental results to prove feasibility for longer distances has been shown with a simulation model, whose results at various shorter distances have been benchmarked against the acquired experimental results at different user locations. A modified version of the Saleh Valenzuela channel has been used to model the millimeter wave (mmW) LoS indoor experimental environment. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, we present an experimental analysis demonstrating an improvement in performance of the proposed RoF based 60 GHz system using spatial diversity and multiplexing. Channel measurements at different transmitter/receiver locations and their processing have shown that an improvement (decrease from 12.5% to 10.5%) in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) can be achieved using the Alamouti Space Time Block Coding algorithm. Then it has been shown that a two-fold data rate increase can be obtained by combining data from two transmitter locations using the Zero Forcing algorithm.	algorithm;experiment;line-of-sight (missile);multiplexing;radio over fiber;simulation;transmitter;uncompressed video	Usman Habib;Anthony E.

The relay is a user who is willing to help the communication from the source to the destination. In our paper, however, the relay is untrusted in the sense that it may make a passive security attack; that is, it may decode messages of the source. We consider two ways to transmit confidential information of the source to the destination: noncooperative secure beamforming and cooperative secure beamforming. In the noncooperative scheme, the relay is simply treated as an eavesdropper, and does not participate in communication. In the cooperative scheme, the relay is asked to relay signals from the source to the destination. In this paper, the source and relay beamforming is jointly designed to maximize the secrecy rate in the cooperative scheme. The conditions under which the cooperative scheme achieves a higher secrecy rate than the noncooperative scheme are derived in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes of the source-relay and relay-destination links. The performance of the secure beamforming schemes is compared through extensive numerical simulations.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;confidentiality;mimo;numerical analysis;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Cheol Jeong;Il-Min Kim;Dong In Kim	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2172433	computer simulation;communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;information security;antenna;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;physical layer;statistics;computer network;mimo	Security	35.6882206238563	82.97628381665498	60191
a285cd055b7ce313b93381e2a3b941102c591e3a	multi-antenna enabled cluster-based cooperation in wireless powered communication networks		In this paper, we consider a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) consisting of a multi-antenna hybrid access point (HAP) that transfers wireless energy to and receives sensing data from a cluster of low-power wireless devices (WDs). To enhance the throughput performance of some far-away WDs, we allow one of the WDs to act as the cluster head (CH) that helps forward the messages of the other cluster members. However, the performance of the proposed cluster-based cooperation is fundamentally limited by the high energy consumption of the CH, who needs to transmit all the WDs’ messages including its own. To tackle this issue, we exploit the capability of multi-antenna energy beamforming (EB) at the HAP, which can focus more transferred power to the CH to balance its energy consumption in assisting the other WDs. Specifically, we first derive the throughput performance of each individual WD under the proposed scheme. Then, we jointly optimize the EB design, the transmit time allocation among the HAP and the WDs, and the transmit power allocation of the CH to maximize the minimum data rate achievable among all the WDs (the max–min throughput) for improved throughput fairness among the WDs. An efficient optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization problem. Moreover, we simulate under practical network setups and show that the proposed multi-antenna enabled cluster-based cooperation can effectively improve the throughput fairness of WPCN.	algorithm;beamforming;benchmark (computing);data rate units;fairness measure;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;multistage interconnection networks;optimization problem;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications network;throughput;wireless access point	Lina Yuan;Suzhi Bi;Shengli Zhang;Xiaohui Lin;Hui Wang	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2726559	transmitter power output;telecommunications network;wireless sensor network;computer network;throughput;wireless;energy consumption;distributed computing;computer science;beamforming;optimization problem	Mobile	31.80283722958298	87.32884791515501	60237

Fading coefficients of the Rician channel are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. We derive exact expressions for the moment generating function, first and second moments of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the destination to statistically characterize the system behavior. We then analyze the system performance by deriving new analytical expressions for the bit error rate and amount of fading. These performance metrics reveal that strong line of sight components between relay-destination link always limit the performance promised by MIMO scattering environment when both nodes have multiple antennas.	bit error rate;coefficient;coherence (physics);hop;mimo;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	L.

22a5aeb10149b5c666f41e6e6e93e9ec34f7b70e	svm-music algorithm for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks		Adopting accurate and efficient spectrum sensing policy is crucial in allowing cognitive radio users to be aware of the surrounding parameters related to the radio environment characteristics. Especially, in Ad hoc networks scenario, where dynamic spectrum access is highly required, since the most of the spectrum is already assigned statistically, and the unlicensed bands are becoming overcrowded. This is due to the multiplicity of wireless communication technologies that operate in those bands, and the increasing number of connected devices. In this paper, a spectrum sensing algorithm that combines the Support Vector Machines (SVM) supervised learning technique with the Multiple Signal Characterization (MUSIC) subspace method is used. Our ultimate objective is detecting the presence of primary users (technology signals) in the band of interest. The node’s receivers which make up the network collect samples from the radio environment, estimate the number of primary user signals and the corresponding carrier frequencies. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SVM based algorithm in detecting the presence of primary users based on lost-detection and false alarm probabilities evaluation.	algorithm;cognitive radio	Soumaya El Barrak;Abdelouahid Lyhyaoui;Amina El Gonnouni;Antonio Puliafito;Salvatore Serrano	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67910-5_13	false alarm;cognitive radio;computer network;supervised learning;support vector machine;radio resource management;wireless;distributed computing;subspace topology;computer science;wireless ad hoc network	HCI	25.842406273202705	88.07315743487152	60688

We design the optimal spatial precoder, spatial power allocation, and frequency bit loading profile which maximize the sum-rate of the multicasting groups. In addition, we propose two schemes to secure data transmission through the two-group multicasting network. The first scheme secures the network when the eavesdropper is a user in one of the two multicasting groups and, hence, its channel state information is known at the transmitter. The second scheme secures the multicasting network from external passive eavesdroppers and, hence, the channels between the transmitter and the eavesdroppers are assumed to be unknown at the transmitter. The secrecy rate is evaluated for both scenarios.	channel state information;column (database);frequency band;kernel (linear algebra);key (cryptography);like button;mimo;multi-user;multicast;multiplexing;naive bayes classifier;overhead (computing);phy (chip);power-line communication;radio jamming;social inequality;the matrix;transceiver;transmitter	Ahmed ElSamadouny;Ahmed El Shafie;Mohamed M.

Accurate measurement data based on an extreme size virtual antenna array (25×25×25 = 15625 elements) have been provided for an indoor scenario in both line of sight and non-line if sight conditions. The results indicate that the distinct spikes observed in the power-delay profile are caused mainly by specular reflections. There is however also a significant diffuse contribution due to scattering caused by the many smaller objects of the environment. The diffuse paths are spread out in essentially all azimuth and elevation directions except for the empty parts of the floor.	amiga reflections;array data structure;software propagation	Jonas Medbo;Henrik Asplund;Jan-Erik Berg	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343290	antenna aperture;omnidirectional antenna;antenna factor;monopole antenna;antenna rotator;random wire antenna;microstrip antenna;periscope antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;shape;directional antenna;antenna;smart antenna;antenna blind cone;radiation pattern;loop antenna;azimuth;coaxial antenna;scattering;dipole antenna;antenna efficiency	Arch	25.96270329705103	79.44688248843842	61347

Since there are multiple OFDM sub-carriers, the SVD produces a large amount of subchannels and it is computation-intensive to find the exact water-filling solution. Fortunately, the singular values in an OFDM-MIMO system exhibit asymptotic features, which can be utilized to simplify the power allocation process. Our scheme achieves the simplification by using a continuous curve to fit the distribution of singular values and computing only the useful singular values. Simulation results verify the accuracy of our scheme and show that the capacity loss due to the approximation is less than 3%.	approximation;capacity loss;computation;curve fitting;mimo;mimo-ofdm;simulation;singular value decomposition;subcarrier;text simplification;water filling algorithm	Wenhong Zhao	2005	PCCC 2005. 24th IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference, 2005.	10.1109/PCCC.2005.1460638	mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;statistics	HPC	38.85212640024019	87.06835632261762	61462

We consider the symmetric case with K transmitters each equipped with M antennas, a base station with N antennas and an unknown number of eavesdroppers. Without assuming knowledge of the number (or location) of eavesdroppers, we assume that each eavesdropper has a maximum of Ne antennas. The sum sDoF is shown to be upper bounded by Ds = min(max(M, N) − Ne/K, K M − Ne, N). Achievable schemes utilizing cooperative artificial noise transmission and zero-forcing decorrelators are shown to achieve the upper bound for a wide range of values of N/M.	channel state information;mimo;transmitter	Ahmed S.

We consider a topology consisting of a single source, two relays, and multiple destinations. For such a system, we propose a scheme to select a single relay among the two when SSK is used for transmission on each of the links in the cooperative system. We analyze the end-to-end average bit error probability (ABEP) of this system. For binary SSK, we derive an exact expression for the ABEP in closed-form. Analytical results exactly match the simulation results validating the analysis. For non-binary SSK, we derive an approximate ABEP expression, where the analytical ABEP results closely follow simulation results. We also derive the diversity order of the system through asymptotic ABEP analysis.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;consensus dynamics;direction finding;end-to-end principle;key (cryptography);modulation;multicast;parsing expression grammar;relay;simulation	Pritam Som;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952131	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	34.94504352186973	77.1905091300224	61520

In order to gain insights on its performance and complexity, the relationship between this MC-TDMA scheme and a special MC-CDMA technique with maximum multipath diversity gain is emphatically investigated, which reveals that the former can be viewed as an equivalent but simplified implementation approach of the latter and furthermore, the former offers more flexibility in the system design and reconfiguration than the latter.	multi-user;multipath propagation;systems design;telecommunications link	Bin Xu;Chenyang Yang;Guangguo Bi	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

82f0c9a38c6d7a874b0ac1a37e5a3ef215ae9b2e	achievable sum-rate analysis of massive mimo full-duplex wireless backhaul links in heterogeneous cellular networks		This paper proposes a heterogeneous network topology, where the backhaul links are supported by massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with full-duplex (FD) modes. Communication is achieved in two phases. In the first phase, we equip macro cell (MC) base station (BS) with massive receive antennas and few transmit antennas and all small cell (SC) BSs with massive receive antennas and a single transmit antenna. In the second phase, a circulator switches the massive receive antennas into transmit antennas and transmit antennas into receive antennas. Under the assumption of imperfect channel state information and large antenna regime, closed-form expressions have been derived for the uplink/downlink achievable sum-rate. From the results, we check that the strength of self-interference (SI) and SC-to-SC interference which occur due to FD operation depends largely on the number of SCs. By increasing the number of SCs, achievable sum-rates also increase but require more antennas to overcome the deleterious effects of the SI and SC-to-SC interference. Based on our analytical results, a hybrid FD/half-duplex system is proposed according to the interferences and the number of antennas. Furthermore, using our system model, it is shown that the transmit power of the MC BS and the SC BSs can be scaled down proportionally to the massive number of receive antennas (first phase) and the massive number of transmit antennas (second phase) and still achieve a required rate.	backhaul (telecommunications);cell (microprocessor);channel state information;circulator;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);multi-user mimo;network switch;network topology;telecommunications link	Prince Anokye;Roger Kwao Ahiadormey;Changick Song;Kyoung-Jae Lee	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2828598	duplex (telecommunications);computer network;mimo;transmitter power output;channel state information;telecommunications link;computer science;electronic engineering;interference (wave propagation);base station;backhaul (telecommunications)	Mobile	37.417996059911566	82.73267448696656	61874

In this paper, by utilizing linear interference alignment, we investigate the DoF of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) interference relay channels without symbol extensions. An innovative algorithm is presented to align the interference, where the filter matrices at the sources, relays and destinations are determined in an iterative manner. Based on the assumption that improperness of the alignment condition implies its unsolvability, an upper bound for the achievable DoF tuple by linear interference alignment is derived, and then utilized to examine the performance of the proposed alignment algorithm. Simulation results show that the iterative algorithm can achieve the upper bound in medium to high DoF regions.	algorithm;align (company);interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Xiang Chen;Shenghui Song;Khaled Ben Letaief	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214445	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;statistics	Visualization	38.90917919980415	88.11567296341488	61948

The information to be transmitted at the source node is composed of relayed information and non-relayed information. They interfere with each other in the existing scheme when the relay node forwards the relayed information and simultaneously the source node transmits the non-relayed information. In order to improve the transmission reliability, we propose two schemes where the source node chooses the non-relayed information codeword in terms of dirty paper coding (DPC). In Scheme 1, DPC technique is applied during the listening phase; and in Scheme 2, DPC technique is applied during the cooperative phase. Specially, we discuss the capacity behaviors of the proposed schemes and compare them with the baseline, namely the capacity behaviors of the existing scheme without the application of DPC technique. The corresponding numerical results prove that both proposed schemes outperform the existing scheme in the sense of capacity performance.	baseline (configuration management);code word;deferred procedure call;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);numerical analysis;relay channel;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yuli Yang	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073574	communications protocol;transmitter;electronic engineering;channel code;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;engineering;mathematics;interference;relay channel;channel capacity;statistics;computer network;mimo;source code	Mobile	34.18929612632836	75.56056152508863	62157
f94ddcea93d220b76e52e80cda87071a17d8ace7	effective capacity of buffer-aided relay systems with selection relaying		In this work, the achievable rate of three-node relay systems with selection relaying under statistical delay constraints, imposed on the limitations of the maximum delay violation probabilities, is investigated. It is assumed that there are queues of infinite size at both the source and relay node, and the source can select the relay or destination for data transmission. Given a selection relaying policy, the effective bandwidth of the arrival processes of the queue at the relay is derived. Then, the maximum constant arrival rate can be identified as the maximum effective capacity as a function of the statistical end-to-end queueing delay constraints and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at the source and relay, the fading distributions of the links, and the relay policy. Subsequently, a relay policy that incorporates the statistical delay constraints is proposed. It is shown that the proposed relay policy can achieve better performance than the one selecting the relay when source-relay link is stronger. Moreover, it is demonstrated that buffering relay model can still help improve the throughput of relay systems in the presence of statistical delay constraints and source-destination link.	acknowledgement (data networks);duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;numerical analysis;queueing theory;queuing delay;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Deli Qiao	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417513	telecommunications;computer science;probability;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Metrics	33.943601786954744	79.42749615909726	62242

The two source layers are transmitted using superposition coding at the source and relay with optimal power allocation, and successive interference cancellation at the receivers (i.e. relay and destination). The power allocation for the two layers at the source and relay is subject to optimization in order to maximize the expected user satisfaction that is defined by a utility function of the total decoded rates at the destination. We assume that only the channel statistics are known. The relay is half-duplex and applies decode and forward. We characterize the expected utility function in terms of the channel statistics of the fading channels, and we solve the optimization problem using the numerical random search method. We provide many numerical examples to show the prospected gains of using the relay on the expected utility for different channel conditions. Furthermore, we obtain that for some conditions, it is optimal to send only one layer.	data compression;distortion;duplex (telecommunications);expected utility hypothesis;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;power optimization (eda);random search;refinement (computing);relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Mohamed Adel Attia;Mohammed Shaqfeh;Karim G.

This makes RNs very suitable tools for increasing the coverage of low population density areas. The RN is a new type of node that was not previously standardized in 3GPP before and, as such, created new challenges. In particular, for RN, the backhaul link (connecting the enhanced Node B (eNB) and the RN) needs to be defined, and both uplink and downlink grants need to be conveyed to the RNs, either using existing channels (e.g., the Packet Dedicated Control Channel (PDCCH)), or a new channel (commonly referred to as the Relay-PDCCH (R-PDCCH)). In this paper, we discuss both channels for the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode and show that using a R-PDCCH is a more efficient channel. In addition, several features are provided to ensure good performance for the R-PDCCH, such as robust use of frequency diversity by transmitting the R-PDCCH using Distributed Virtual Resource Blocks (DVRBs), or use of rate-matching to ensure optimal usage of the allocated resources for R-PDCCH transmission. This robustness is considered necessary to ensuring good reliability for sparsely populated areas.	backhaul (telecommunications);compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);internet relay chat;population;telecommunications link;transmitter	Philippe J.

fa4c421c60655333ccc8a4900454ed3520d666b0	performance of proactive eavesdropping in dual-hop relaying systems		This paper investigates the performance of a legitimate surveillance system, where a legitimate monitor aims to eavesdrop on a dubious decode-and-forward relaying communication link. In order to maximize the eavesdropping non-outage probability, three different eavesdropping modes are proposed, where the legitimate monitor can adaptively perform eavesdropping or jamming. Optimal jamming power design and exact closed-formed expressions of the eavesdropping non-outage probability for each mode are presented. Numerical results reveal that the eavesdropping mode selection significantly improves the eavesdropping non-outage probability.	downtime;hop;radio jamming	Yuxiang Zhang;Xin Jiang;Caijun Zhong;Zhaoyang Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269118	computer network;hop (networking);computer science;eavesdropping	EDA	34.225414808640764	83.52259540364545	62947

In CDMA cellular systems, the capacity of each cell depends on the actual interference produced by users supported by the other cells of the systems. This is because cell capacity is interference-limited. In this way, valid configurations of the system in terms of users per cell taking into account the average interference are determined. A possible distribution of users per cell where all the users have a required E/sub b//N/sub 0/ for each different service is considered as a valid configuration. This information is used in the development of a birth and death process to evaluate the teletraffic system capacity. A unidimensional cellular system is used in the analysis and numerical results are obtained for different circuit switched services provided for the cdma2000 standard.	channel capacity;circuit switching;interference (communication);numerical analysis	Domingo Lara-Rodríguez;Alfonso Prieto-Guerrero;Fausto Casco-Sanchez	2004	IEEE 60th Vehicular Technology Conference, 2004.

To this end, a simple scheduling scheme is assumed that takes into account only local (per cell) topological information of the D2D links. Stochastic geometry tools are utilized in order to obtain analytical expressions for the interferers density as well as the D2D link signal-to-interference-ratio distribution. The analytical results accuracy is validated by comparison with simulations. In addition, the analytical expressions are employed for efficiently optimizing the parameters of a cellular system with overlay D2D communications. It is shown that coordinated scheduling of D2D transmissions enhances system performance both in terms of average user rate as well as maximum allowable D2D link distance.	interference (communication);link distance;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation;systems design;telecommunications link	Stelios Stefanatos;Antonis G.

Different from existing ICI avoidance schemes such as enhanced ICI cancellation (eICIC) and coordinated beamforming, which generally operate at the MBS, we propose a full duplex (FD)-assisted ICI cancellation (fICIC) scheme, which can operate at each pico BS (PBS) individually and is transparent to the MBS. The basic idea of the fICIC is to apply FD technique at the PBS such that the PBS can send the desired signals and forward the listened cross-tier ICI simultaneously to PUEs. We first consider the narrowband single-user case, where the MBS serves a single macro UE and each PBS serves a single PUE. We obtain the closed-form solution of the optimal fICIC scheme, and analyze its asymptotical performance in ICI-dominated scenario. We then investigate the general narrowband multiuser case, where both MBS and PBSs serve multiple UEs. We devise a low-complexity algorithm to optimize the fICIC aimed at maximizing the downlink sum rate of the PUEs subject to user fairness constraint. Finally, the generalization of the fICIC to wideband systems is investigated. Simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate the advantages of the fICIC on mitigating cross-tier ICI.	algorithm;asymptote;beamforming;catastrophic interference;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);fairness measure;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multi-user;multitier architecture;power usage effectiveness;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Shengqian Han;Chenyang Yang;Pan Chen	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494046	electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;interference;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	37.899281181654146	85.62391174325624	63709
16907de6a55783afac57abe144e081bf7955d56c	detection and mitigation of pilot spoofing attack		In a time-division duplex (TDD) multiple antenna system, the channel state information (CSI) can be estimated using reverse training. A pilot contamination (spoofing) attack occurs when during the training phase, an adversary (spoofer) also sends identical training (pilot) signal as that of the legitimate receiver. This contaminates channel estimation and alters the legitimate beamforming design, facilitating eavesdropping. A recent approach proposed superimposing a random sequence on the training sequence at the legitimate receiver and then using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion to detect pilot contamination attack. In this paper we augment this approach with joint estimation of both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper channels, and secure beamforming, to mitigate the effects of pilot spoofing. We consider two cases: (i) the spoofer transmits only the pilot signal, (ii) the spoofer also adds a random sequence to its pilot. The proposed mitigation approach is illustrated via simulations.	arp spoofing;adversary (cryptography);beamforming;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);minimum description length;pilot ace;pipeline pilot;simulation;spoofing attack;test-driven development	Jitendra K.

e3c643b273a9ecfdc6998ff4e0f4d28fcfa03179	a fine-grained analysis of time reversal mu-miso systems over correlated multipath channels with imperfect csi		Time reversal (TR) is regarded as a potential future transmission scheme for multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. In spite of TR’s good performance in MU-MISO UWB systems, it suffers from performance degradation due to spatial correlation and imperfect channel-state information. In this paper, a comprehensive performance analysis of MU-MISO UWB systems with a TR pre-filter is provided. Both spatial correlation and channel estimation errors (CEE) are taken into account in the propagation channel model, and the system performance is mainly studied in terms of its effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), channel capacity, and bit error rate. The novel closed-form expressions for the average effective SINR are derived in order to characterize the influence of propagation conditions such as channel impulse response duration, spatial correlation, and CEE on TR performance metrics. The expressions reveal more precisely to us that spatial correlation and CEE have different effects on the average power of the desired signal, inter-symbol interference, and inter-user interference. Moreover, the impacts of spatial correlation and CEE on the performance of MU-MISO TR system are thoroughly investigated. In particular, the capacity loss of MU-MISO TR system due to spatial correlation and CEE is quantified and fully discussed at the end of this paper. It is shown that high spatial correlation and CEE cause a remarkable reduction in bandwidth efficiency. Finally, all theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

In previous work, it has been shown that if each transmitter employs the same lattice code, the interference structure of the channel can be exploited to recover an equation much more efficiently than possible with standard multiple-access strategies. Here, we generalize this compute-and-forward framework to the multiple antenna setting. Our results show that it is often beneficial to use extra antennas at the receiver to rotate the channel coefficients towards the nearest integer vector instead of separating out the transmitted signals. We also demonstrate that in contrast to classical strategies, the multiplexing gain of compute-and-forward increases if the transmitters have channel state information. Finally, we apply our scheme to the two way relay network and observe performance gains over traditional strategies.	channel state information;coefficient;interference (communication);mimo;multiplexing;relay;transmitter	Jiening Zhan;Uri Erez;Michael Gastpar;Bobak Nazer	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205264	transmitter;telecommunications;mathematics;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Arch	35.399757054793255	75.02813715843854	63824

This can be achieved by enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC), in which some of the downlink transmitted signals are muted in order to reduce the interference from a macro-cell base station to small cells or vice versa. Because interference control in eICIC is conducted in the time domain, accurate timing synchronization is required between macro and small cells. Network-listening-based synchronization is recently attracting attention as an effective timing synchronization method even for indoor small-cell base stations, which cannot utilize GPS- based synchronization. It uses only the macro-cell downlink signal to establish synchronization with the overlaying macro cell. However, the loop-back signal from the small-cell base station itself interferes with the reception of the macro-cell downlink signal. To solve this issue, we proposed a synchronization method that avoids loop-back interference and clarified its synchronization accuracy by computer simulations. In this paper, we propose an advanced synchronization- timing detection algorithm that improves the tolerance of loop-back self-interference. Furthermore, we prototype the proposed synchronization method and clarify its feasibility and performance by computer simulations and laboratory experiments on actual equipment. Moreover, we propose a control architecture for network-listening based synchronization that enables accurate synchronization even in dense small cell deployments where neighboring small-cell interference degrades the accuracy of macro-cell signal detection.	algorithm;cell signaling;computer simulation;detection theory;experiment;frequency band;interference (communication);loopback;prototype;telecommunications link	Mitsukuni Konishi;Sho Nabatame;Daigo Ogata;Atsushi Nagate;Teruya Fujii	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504127	maintenance engineering;synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;self-clocking signal;interference	Embedded	25.37492392306294	86.53502133829281	63875

Simulation results show that all the proposed placement models have a superior performance when compared with the traditional BSs placement model. In particular, one of the proposed BSs dispositions requires the use of less BSs, which means greener communications and less hardware costs.	channel capacity;consistency model;mimo;scenario testing;simulation;software propagation	Ivo Sousa;Tiago Rosa Maria Paula Queluz;Antonio J.

One of the many problems that exist when developing such a system, is the multipath effect caused by the reflections of the transmitted signals on various surfaces including walls, floors, furniture and people. This degrades the signal quality and reduces the amount of available bandwidth and thus, the quality of the image. Presently, most of Europe is using the IEEE 802.11b hardware for such applications. As an alternative to the existing modulation of 802.11b Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is investigated, especially for use inside hospitals. The advantages of using this modulation over IEEE802.11b hardware for a telemedicine application are examined by means of simulation using three different simulation packages.	central processing unit;channel (communications);firmware;modulation;multiplexing;osi model;quality of service;real-time business intelligence;real-time computing;reflection (computer graphics);simulation;web page	Konstantinos A.

A distributed single relay selection(DSRS) algorithm with low complexity is then investigated under the assumption that only one relay forwards the signals.Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms provide significant performance gain in terms of energy efficiency over the existing AF relay selection algorithms.

65a5e9acb71863d224a58a9dc0a55fe23e9d19d3	mimo uplink noma with successive bandwidth division		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key enabling technology for fifth generation (5G) wireless networks because of its ability to provide greater spectral efficiency. However, a conventional NOMA scheme offers significant interference and higher outage probability especially when the number of users in the network is large. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a suboptimal algorithm which uses the concept of successive bandwidth division (SBD) in NOMA system, which not only reduces the complexity of the receiver side to a great extent, but also enhances the overall signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the uplink NOMA by supporting 2N users with just N base station (BS) antennas. The BS is assumed to have perfect channel state information (CSI) and uses a zero-forcing (ZF) postcoding matrix to recover the signals of different users. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional NOMA techniques in terms of receiver complexity and outage probability.	algorithm;channel state information;downtime;fairness measure;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;oma;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;smart battery;spectral efficiency;sun outage;telecommunications link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Soma Qureshi;Syed Ali Hassan	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564718	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;interference;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	38.02630792399415	85.80806807956819	64296
fafbf34f75cabb4e41d326de446f2ad2fc065f81	downlink analysis in unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) assisted cellular networks with clustered users		The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating as aerial base stations (BSs) has emerged as a promising solution especially in scenarios requiring rapid deployments (e.g., in the cases of crowded hotspots, sporting events, emergencies, and natural disasters) in order to assist the ground BSs. In this paper, an analytical framework is provided to analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability of UAV assisted cellular networks with clustered user equipments (UEs). Locations of UAVs and ground BSs are modeled as Poison point processes, and UEs are assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson cluster process around the projections of UAVs on the ground. Initially, the complementary cumulative distribution function and probability density function of path losses for both UAV and ground BS tiers are derived. Subsequently, association probabilities with each tier are obtained. SINR coverage probability is derived for the entire network using tools from stochastic geometry. Finally, area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the entire network is determined, and SINR coverage probability expression for a more general model is presented by considering that UAVs are located at different heights. Via numerical results, we have shown that UAV height and path-loss exponents play important roles on the coverage performance. Moreover, coverage probability can be improved with smaller number of UAVs, while better ASE is achieved by employing more UAVs and having UEs more compactly clustered around the UAVs.

The impact on sum-rate performance is shown with varying number of transmit and receive antennas, with different amounts of training and with varying receive power levels of the cooperating set. This is done by simulations in a two-user two-cell scenario. The limited scenario size helps to carve out the crucial parameters and show their interrelation with imperfect channel knowledge (CSI). These CSI imperfections are emulated based on a novel model, introduced in this paper. We show that imperfect CSI drastically reduces the relative coordinated multi-point (CoMP) gains over non-coordinated systems. The non-coordinated systems can already perform quite well, when multi-antenna terminals apply interference suppression strategies. Our results motivate that CoMP systems need to be studied under critical system assumptions, taking into account non-idealities, as they have a severe impact on the observed gains.	channel state information;critical system;emulator;interference (communication);simulation;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Thorsten Wild	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092923	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;base station;coordinate system;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;mimo	Mobile	37.714454299744176	83.69618245601711	64317

Effects of inter modulation and adjacent channel leakage are discussed in both mm W beamforming transceiver and receiver, respectively. It is concluded that distortion is behaving differently in multi-antenna transmitter that at the receiver. Over-the-Air (OTA) measured and simulated examples of the nonlinear behavior of an array are given for receiver and transmitter, respectively. Furthermore, smart array linearization scheme given as a reference provides new perspective to consider the direction dependent out-of-band distortion as a part of the future cellular standards.	beamforming;compaq lte;directive (programming);distortion;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);interoperability;modulation;noise reduction;nonlinear system;numerical recipes;out-of-band agreement;over the air;radar;requirement;simulation;spectral leakage;transceiver;transmitter	Marko E.

In particular, our research focuses on low-rate communication under energy constrained situations, and targets maximizing energy efficiency, i.e., bits per Joule. A cross-layer approach to energy efficient design, accounting for both transmit power and signal processing power is suggested. Finally, bits-per-Joule capacity of this channel, based on experimentally measured channel responses, are determined numerically, and an optimized multi-tone frequency shift keying (MFSK) scheme is suggested at the end of this paper.	acoustic cryptanalysis;experiment;frequency divider;joule;key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;selectivity (electronic);signal processing;transducer	Sijung Yang;Andrew C.

4505cbb8a0a7bd59faa1f73a0367c180c2d4d443	secure multiuser scheduling in downlink dual-hop regenerative relay networks over nakagami- $m$ fading channels	network security;relay networks telecommunications;jamming;wireless communication;power outages;fading channels;privacy	In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of multiuser dual-hop relay networks where a base station (BS) communicates with multiple legitimate users through the assistance of a trustful regenerative relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In particular, the maximal ratio transmission scheme is exploited at the BS and a threshold-based multiuser scheduling scheme is employed over the legitimate users, while concerning the imperfect decoding at the regenerative relay. To evaluate the secrecy performance of the considered system, two practical situations are addressed based on the availability of eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), i.e., Scenario I, where the eavesdropper's CSI is not available at the relay, and Scenario II, where the eavesdropper's CSI is available at the relay. For both the scenarios, we further consider two eavesdropping modes, i.e., colluding eavesdropping and non-colluding eavesdropping. For Scenario I, new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived. For Scenario II, we derive new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR). The asymptotic SOPs demonstrate that the secrecy diversity order is independent of the number of legitimate users NB and eavesdroppers NE, the number of antennas equipped at eavesdroppers AE, as well as the fading factor of the wiretap channel mE. Furthermore, we also determine the secrecy multiplexing gain and the power cost to explicitly quantify the impact of the legitimate channel and wiretap channel on the ESR. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the switching threshold, the number of antennas at the BS, and the number of legitimate users has a positive impact on secrecy performance.

There are K transmitter-receiver pairs, each transmitter transmits a single data stream with a rank-one precoding matrix, and the receivers are assumed to be linear. We show that a necessary condition for zero interference (alignment across sub-channels) is K ≤ 2M−2. In contrast, for a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) interference network with M×M spatial channels (full channel matrices) the corresponding condition is known to be K ≤ 2M − 1. We also characterize the sum rate at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) by bounding the SNR offset (x-intercept) of the asymptote of the sum rate vs SNR curve. For a randomly chosen aligned solution as M increases, this offset shifts to the right as logM. In contrast, the SNR offset for a MIMO interference network does not increase with M. An approximation for the performance of sampling the best out of L aligned solutions is also presented. Numerical results show the analytical asymptotes accurately predict the sum rate curves at moderate to high SNRs.	approximation;asymptote;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;numerical method;randomness;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;visual intercept;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Changxin Shi;Randall Berry;Michael L.

90b3bc95564ac23815ce874dde407450507c7c6a	spectral efficiency maximization of single cell massive multiuser mimo systems via optimal power control with zf receiver		This paper investigates the spectral efficiency of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems with a large number of antennas at the base station that serves single-antenna users in one cell. It is assumed that the base station estimates the channel with the help of uplink training and then employs the zero-forcing technique to detect the data signals transmitted by the various users. An optimal power control scheme over pilot and data power based on large-scale fading is proposed to maximize the sum spectral efficiency for a given total energy budget in a coherence interval. Simulation results show that the spectral efficiency of the proposed method is superior to that of other existing methods. It Is also shown that, In order to maximize the sum spectral efficiency, more power should be allocated to the data signal power at high signal-to-nolse ratios and less power at low signal-to-noise ratios.	expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	O.

We study the performance limit in such scenarios by analyzing the outage capacity of slow fading relay channels. Our focus is on the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low outage probability regime, where the adverse impact of fading is greatest but so are the potential gains from cooperation. We showed that while the standard Amplify-Forward protocol performs very poorly in this regime, a modified version we called the Bursty Amplify-Forward protocol is optimal and achieves the outage capacity of the network. Moreover, this performance can be achieved without a priori channel knowledge at the receivers. In contrast, the Decode-Forward protocol is strictly suboptimal in this regime.

In this paper, we consider the uplink of a multicell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system with a 3D base station exploiting variable antenna tilt angles. To illustrate clearly, we model a tall building with several floors. Users are distributed horizontally and vertically according some rules. Due to the storey height, elevations from one BS to different floors also differ, i.e. elevation variation occurs. For such a scenario, we derive the expression of sum rate considering the elevation factor, and discuss the effects of the tilt angle and user distribution on the sum rate. Sum rate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and large number of base station antennas is also studied. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the sum rate and the user number. This work can be seen as a first attempt to analyze the sum rate performance for high-rise buildings and used as a reference for infrastructure.	channel (communications);interference (communication);multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Ling Xie;Lihua Li;Xingwang Li	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966194	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	29.26952631819318	82.42534202077118	64808

The objective is to maximize the aggregate performance of communication subscribers served by the airborne relay. The performance is measured as either the duty cycle in terms of signal-to-noise-ratio or the throughput achieved by communication subscribers. Both measures are computed with realistic channel, terrain, antenna and aircraft characteristics for ground-to-air and air-to-ground communications. Different methods to generate an airborne relay orbit are discussed with their parameters to optimize. Results are specialized to optimization of elliptical orbit parameters. First, an elliptical orbit is optimally selected with the best center and radius (in X and Y-directions) as orbit parameters subject to the specified altitude and speed of the aircraft. Both exhaustive search and gradient search with reduced complexity are considered to find the best set of orbit parameters. This elliptical orbit is then converted to an operational orbit by optimally selecting orbit waypoints and locating smooth turning points while minimizing the fuel consumption of the airborne relay. A software with interactive GUI is designed and implemented for force-level planning that allows the planner to select different properties of airborne relay and communication subscribers, and returns the optimal orbit for the airborne relay.	aggregate data;airborne ranger;brute-force search;duty cycle;gradient;graphical user interface;mathematical optimization;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;waypoint	Yalin E.

Using this function, two example energy harvesters are used to analyze the realistic performances of wireless relaying and wireless energy transfer. Numerical results show that the realistic performances of the wireless systems could be considerably different from the performances predicted by the existing analysis.	curve fitting;exponential hierarchy;heuristic;numerical method;performance;radio frequency	Yunfei Chen;Kalen T.

In this paper, we propose a novel HM system with non-uniform constellation inputs and analytically derive the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)-capacity for each user by means of the mutual information. Different from the power optimization method for the superimposed uniform constellation, we directly optimize the constellation positions in conjunction with the optimal binary labels design for HM in additive white Gaussian noise channels. For maximizing the BICM-capacity, we propose a fairness balanced criterion for HM system by considering both power constraints and user QoS constraints. Multi-start interior-point algorithm is proposed to deal with the constellation optimization problems. Numerical results show that the proposed HM verify the performance gains of optimized HM compared with the optimized quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) based HM and other orthogonal transmission methods.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;modulation;mutual information;numerical method;utility functions on indivisible goods	Baicen Xiao;Kexin Xiao;Zhiyong Chen;Bin Xia;Hui Liu;Lin Wang	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377173	real-time computing;quadrature amplitude modulation;additive white gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;modulation;power optimization;qam;computer science;communication channel;optimization problem;hierarchical modulation	EDA	36.7832923658878	88.20089688427714	65176

An efficient way to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station is by using uplink pilots and reciprocity of the downlink channel. At the same time, it has been shown that pilots from different cells contaminate each other, resulting in corruption of precoding matrices used by base stations, and high inter-cell interference. This paper studies the effects of shifting the location of pilots in time frames used in neighboring cells, and its effectiveness in obtaining better channel estimates, and, thereby, inter-cell interference reduction.	catastrophic interference;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);multi-user;pilot ace;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Kumar Appaiah;Alexei E.

The statistical model characterizes the propagation media when the MS rotates with a constant angular velocity around an axis perpendicular to the azimuthal plane, and moves with a constant velocity on the azimuthal plane in an arbitrary direction. The moving MS, with a constant speed, produces the conventional linear Doppler while the rotating MS introduces angular Doppler. The research shows that the rotation of the MS results in a non-stationary random process as the CCF. The only exception in which the result follows a stationary function is a narrow-band communication system, when either the MS angular velocity or the MS speed is zero.	angularjs;apache axis;cobham's thesis;cross-correlation;direction of arrival;mathematical model;microsoft customer care framework;software propagation;stationary process;statistical model;stochastic process;velocity (software development)	Hamidreza Saligheh Rad;Saeed Gazor	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

Experimental results show that a throughput gain from distributed MIMO is achieved in various TP deployments in the lobby of an office building and an outdoor parking area using two radio units (RUs). In the lobby, a deployment where TP #1 covers the entire lobby and TP #2 covers areas around TP #1 that are non-line-of-sight exhibits a significant advantage over when distributed MIMO is not used yielding a throughput gain of 11 % over most of the area. In the outdoor parking area, a distinct advantage when using distributed MIMO is expected, and a gain in throughput of 124 % is achieved when TPs face the same direction and have a large separation between them over when distributed MIMO is not used. However, a large difference in the mobility reference signal received power (MRSRP) is also confirmed, especially in front of the TPs due to the large difference in the distance between the mobile station and the TPs. We find that if the second TP has a signal power below 14 dB of the first TP's signal, it does not contribute to the MIMO transmission. In order to compensate for the difference in MRSRP, four RUs are installed in the parking area, and the distributed MIMO gain of 77 % is achieved.	beamforming;frequency band;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;mobile phone;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput	Daisuke Kurita;Kiichi Tateishi;Atsushi Harada;Yoshihisa Kishiyama;Shoji Itoh;Hideshi Murai;Arne Simonsson;Peter Ökvist	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288073	mimo;electronic engineering;software deployment;throughput;frequency band;telecommunications link;computer science;beamforming;mobile station	Mobile	26.132085854059905	81.67530455314727	65228

This paper presents an analysis of the statistical properties of methods based on the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). A modification of the algorithm of Smith (1975) is presented, the new method requiring exactly one-half the number of IDPT operations and roughly two-thirds the computer memory of the original method. Evaluations of and comparisons between various variate generation methods using meaningful quantitative measures are believed to be lacking. New quantitative quality measures for random variate generation have been proposed that are, in particular, meaningful and useful for digital communication system simulation. This paper presents the application of these measures to the IDFT method and three other methods of correlated variate generation, comparing the algorithms in terms of the quality of the generated samples and the required computational effort.	discrete fourier transform;rayleigh–ritz method	David J.

Despite the intriguing perspectives of D2D technique, the performance of D2D-aided cellular network may degrade owing to the severe interference imposed by newly introduced D2D links. With a motive to deal with this problem, the key performance parameters of D2D-aided underlaying cellular networks, including the coverage probability and total data rate have been investigated. Firstly, we analyze the expressions of coverage probability for both the conventional cellular links and the D2D links, and then we give out the approximate expression of the ergodic rate for both individual links and that of the whole underlaying system. After that, in order to optimize the performance of the system in terms of throughput, more parameters closely related to the channel capacity are studied. Finally, the simulation results revealed that the best values for key parameters (e.g. the density of D2D users) are attainable, and the total data rate can been greatly improved according to our proposed strategies.	telecommunications link	Tianyu Zhang;Jian Sun;Xianxian Wang;Zhongshan Zhang	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-66625-9_37	throughput;coverage probability;telecommunications link;computer network;channel capacity;upgrade;expression (mathematics);distributed computing;cellular network;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	30.752198117933453	85.30850016498682	65481

Cloud processing enables the centralized implementation o f co perative transmission strategies at the ENs, albeit at the cost of an increased latency due to fronthaul transfer . In contrast, the proactive caching of popular content at the ENs allows for the low-latency delivery of the cached fi les, but with generally limited opportunities for cooperative transmission among the ENs. The interplay betw een cloud processing and edge caching is addressed from an information-theoretic viewpoint by investigating the fundamental limits of a high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) metric, termed normalized delivery time (NDT), which aptures the worst-case latency for delivering any requested content to the users. The NDT is defined under the as sumption of either serial or pipelined fronthaul-edge transmissions, and is studied as a function of fronthaul and cache capacity constraints. Transmission policies that encompass the caching phase as well as the transmission phas e acro s both fronthaul and wireless, or edge, segments are proposed, with the aim of minimizing the NDT for given fro nthaul and cache capacity constraints. Informationtheoretic lower bounds on the NDT are also derived. Achievab ility arguments and lower bounds are leveraged to characterize the minimal NDT in a number of important specia l cases, including systems with no caching capability, as well as to prove that the proposed schemes achieve optimal ity within a constant multiplicative factor of 2 for all values of the problem parameters.	best, worst and average case;cache (computing);centralized computing;cloud computing;coefficient;edge computing;information theory;interrupt latency;network architecture;non-functional requirement;pipeline (computing);signal-to-noise ratio	Avik Sengupta;Ravi Tandon;Osvaldo Simeone	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Mobile	31.889980251403287	84.53544658605026	65611

In this paper, we propose to study the effective capacity of a Nakagami-m fading channel with full channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and at the receiver. We focus on the low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime. We show that the effective capacity for any arbitrary but finite statistically delay Quality of Service (QoS) exponent θ, scales essentially as S NRlog(1/SNR) exactly as the ergodic capacity, independently of any QoS constraint. We also characterize the minimum energy required for reliable communication, and the wideband slope to show that our results are in agreement with results established recently by Gursoy et al. We also propose an on-off power control scheme that achieves the capacity asymptotically using only one bit CSI feedback at the transmitter. Finally, some numerical results are presented to show the accuracy of our asymptotic results.	channel state information;ergodicity;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;switch;transmitter	Fatma Benkhelifa;Zouheir Rezki;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666450	quality of service;telecommunications;power control;computer science;feedback;computer network	Arch	35.66227302649241	78.1918847023024	65615

In cellular networks, achieving reliable communication is challenging due to many factors, particularly the fading of the desired signal and the interference. In this regard, we investigate the potential of several techniques to combat these main threats. The analysis shows that traditional microscopic multiple-input multiple-output schemes with 2×2 or 4×4 antenna configurations are not enough to fulfil stringent reliability requirements. It is revealed how such antenna schemes must be complemented with macroscopic diversity as well as interference management techniques in order to ensure the necessary SINR outage performance. Based on the obtained performance results, it is discussed which of the feasible options fulfilling the ultra-reliable criteria are most promising in a practical setting, as well as pointers to supplementary techniques that should be included in future studies.	channel state information;downtime;futures studies;interference (communication);mimo;reliability (computer networking);requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;sun outage	Guillermo Pocovi;Beatriz Soret;Mads Lauridsen;Klaus I.

In particular, we study the adaptive link selection relaying problem that aims to maximize the constant supportable arrival rate μ to the source (i.e., the effective capacity). Fixed and adaptive source and relay power allocation are investigated. By employing asymptotic delay analysis, we first convert the QoS constraint into minimum QoS exponent constraints at the source and relay queues. We then derive the link selection and power allocation solutions as functions of the instantaneous link conditions and QoS exponents using Lagrangian approach. Solutions for various special cases of link conditions and QoS constraints are presented. Moreover, we compare the effective capacities of the proposed relaying schemes and other existing schemes under different link conditions and QoS constraints. Illustrative results indicate that the proposed schemes offer substantial performance gains, and power adaption outperforms fixed power allocation at low signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) region or under loose QoS constraints.	channel state information;convex optimization;downtime;end-to-end principle;lagrangian system;mathematical optimization;noise power;quality of service;queueing theory;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Khoa Tran Phan;Tho Le-Ngoc;Long Bao Le	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2515620	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Metrics	32.5969960291954	84.37927075798262	65696

In this paper, a new wireless energy harvesting protocol is proposed for an underlay cognitive relay network with multiple primary user (PU) transceivers. In this protocol, the secondary nodes can harvest energy from the primary network (PN) while sharing the licensed spectrum of the PN. In order to assess the impact of different system parameters on the proposed network, we first derive an exact expression for the outage probability for the secondary network (SN) subject to three important power constraints: 1) the maximum transmit power at the secondary source (SS) and at the secondary relay (SR); 2) the peak interference power permitted at each PU receiver; and 3) the interference power from each PU transmitter to the SR and to the secondary destination (SD). To obtain practical design insights into the impact of different parameters on successful data transmission of the SN, we derive throughput expressions for both the delay-sensitive and the delay-tolerant transmission modes. We also derive asymptotic closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the delay-sensitive throughput and an asymptotic analytical expression for the delay-tolerant throughput as the number of PU transceivers goes to infinity. The results show that the outage probability improves when PU transmitters are located near SS and sufficiently far from SR and SD. Our results also show that when the number of PU transmitters is large, the detrimental effect of interference from PU transmitters outweighs the benefits of energy harvested from the PU transmitters.	catastrophic interference;downtime;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);one-class classification;relay;secondary source;sun outage;throughput;transceiver;transmitter;wireless router	Yuanawei Liu;Seyed A.

To fully exploit the benefits of cooperative systems, efficient management of resources including relays and power is required. In this paper, both optimal relay selection and power loading issues are investigated for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cooperative transmission over UWA channel. In our analysis, we consider amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying with perfect channel state information (CSI) at the source, relay, and destination nodes. Moreover, we assume sparse and frequency-selective Rician fading in the presence of colored Gaussian ambient noise. Unlike previous works on this topic, in our study, the power of noise is not identical for all subcarriers at both the relay and destination nodes. We solve two optimization problems that rely on the minimization of the bit error rate (BER) and maximization of the system capacity. In each problem, both optimal relay selection and power loading issues are addressed in two dependent phases. In the first phase, an unconstrained optimization problem is solved to determine the optimal relay out of multiple relays vertically located at different depths of water. We adopt all-subcarrier (AS) basis approach in our OFDM-based transmission model in which a single relay is engaged to transmit the entire OFDM block to the destination. In the second phase, after selecting the optimal relay, another optimization problem is solved to obtain the optimal power allocation. This is jointly done at both the source and relay nodes under total power constraint and fixed subcarrier rate. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithms under different scenarios.	acoustic cryptanalysis;anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;brute-force search;cb unix;channel capacity;channel state information;consensus dynamics;ergodicity;esoteric programming language;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multi-armed bandit;multiplexing;non-functional requirement;optimization problem;quality of service;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;subcarrier;x.690	Abdollah Doosti-Aref;Ataollah Ebrahimzadeh	2018	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2017.2701820	real-time computing;channel state information;bit error rate;telecommunications;rician fading;relay channel;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;relay;distributed computing;computer science;communication channel;optimization problem	Mobile	36.7416868853631	86.53606491480832	65806

In order to achieve good performance, a certain space is required for these antenna configurations. However, the space is a very critical issue for portable terminals. In this paper, the relation between antenna spacing and the receiving level correlation are empirically investigated for diversity and MIMO antennas. Experiments were carried out in a room using dipole and small ceramic antennas operating at 2.4/2.6 GHz bands in order to verify the results collected from the experiments. A simulation was conducted under the same configuration. Theoretically, the correlation is over 0.8 if the antenna spacing is less than 0.1λ. However, experiments have shown that the correlation between antenna elements is under 0.5 for diversity and MIMO configurations even though the antenna spacing is very small. When antenna is located near a metal cylinder simulating the human head, the correlation is 0.1 higher. These results promise the application of a small size MIMO antenna for portable terminals. The results of the various measurements are useful to design actual portable terminal using MIMO antenna.

For fixed antenna separation (limited by node form factor) and carrier frequency (limited by available electronics), the range up to which multiple degrees of freedom are available is limited by the Rayleigh criterion. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture for sidestepping this criterion, leading to spatial multiplexing gains at ranges much larger than those dictated by node form factor and carrier frequency constraints. Although the antenna spacings at the transmitter and the receiver are not large enough to support spatial multiplexing, the use of relays spread out over a larger area enables synthesis of a full rank MIMO channel. We focus specifically on the design of air-to-ground wireless fiber links over ranges of tens of kilometers, which have the following features in addition to relay-enabled spatial multiplexing: (a) the small carrier wavelength enables large beamforming gains even for nodes of compact form factor, (b) the large available bandwidths enable multiGigabit speeds for each spatially multiplexed data stream.	beamforming;carrier frequency;carrier wave;distributed computing;elegant degradation;emoticon;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;point-to-point (telecommunications);randomness;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;spatial multiplexing;transmitter	Andrew T.

The estimated K-factors are modeled as a piecewise-linear function of distance. The statistical fluctuations of K-factors are well considered by introducing the standard deviation to the expression. A detailed comparison between the piecewise-linear K-factor model and that of other literature validates the proposed model.

An adaptive delay-tolerant distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme that exploits feedback is proposed for two-hop cooperative MIMO networks. Maximum likelihood (ML) receivers and adjustable code matrices are considered subject to a power constraint with a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperation strategy. In the proposed delay-tolerant DSTC scheme, an adjustable code matrix is employed to transform the space-time coded matrix at the relay nodes. Least-squares (LS) algorithms are developed with reduced computational complexity to adjust the parameters of the codes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant performance gains and address the delay issue for cooperative MIMO systems as compared to existing delay-tolerant DSTC schemes.

The protocol implements both on-demand relaying and a selection of the best relay terminal so only one terminal is relaying the source message when cooperation is needed. Two additional features are also proposed. The best relay is selected with a splitting algorithm. This approach allows fast relay selection within less than three time-slots, on average. Moreover, a pre-selection of relay candidates is performed prior to the splitting algorithm. Only terminals that are able to improve the direct path are pre-selected. So efficient cooperation is now guaranteed. We prove that this approach is optimal in terms of diversity-multiplexing trade-off. The protocol has been designed in the context of Nakagami-m fading channels. Simulation results show that the performance of the splitting algorithm does not depend on channel statistics.

On one hand, most BAN-based applications involve end-to-end transmission across heterogenous networks. Cognitive communication has been known to be an effective technology for addressing network heterogeneity. On the other hand, a BAN is normally required to provide reliable communications and operate in a very low power level to conserve energy and reduce the electromagnetic radiation impact on human body. Cooperative communication has been known to enhance the transmission reliability and maintain low transmission power. However, the joint cognitive and cooperative mechanism has not been investigated yet in the literature. In this paper, we propose a network architecture for cognitive and cooperative communications in BANs. An intelligent mobile device is introduced as either a cognitive gateway to interconnect heterogenous networks; or a cooperative relay node to achieve transmission diversity. Two cooperative transmission schemes, Energy-conserved Cooperative Transmission and Reliability-driven Cooperative Transmission, are presented for different applications that have distinct energy consumption or reliability requirement. Optimization problems are formulated to optimally allocate power in the cooperative transmission. Results indicate that cooperative transmission schemes can significantly decrease Bit Error Rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption, compared to the non-cooperative schemes. The BER gain is over one order in the high SNR region, while the energy consumption can save up to 50% in the low BER region.

The aim of this paper is to develop an empirical trajectory model for drifted motions. Recently, a highly flexible trajectory model based on the primitives of Brownian fields (TramBrown) was proposed by A. Borhani and M. Pätzold. This paper provides an empirical proof for TramBrown using global positioning system (GPS) data collected from real life user traces drifting to a particular target point or a zone. The recorded location coordinates of the mobile user are processed to compute the total travelling length and the angle-of-motion (AOM) along the drifted trajectory. It is shown that the probability density function (PDF) of the total travelling length follows approximately the lognormal distribution and the PDF of the AOM exhibits a non-uniform distribution that can be approximated by the Gaussian distribution. These results are in line with the theoretical results derived from the TramBrown model.	approximation algorithm;associate-o-matic;global positioning system;portable document format;real life;tracing (software)	H.

Many publications exist that predict strong achievable rate improvements, but usually neglecting various practical issues connected to network MIMO. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a constrained backhaul infrastructure and imperfect channel knowledge on uplink network MIMO from an information theoretical point of view. Especially the latter aspect leads to the fact that the channel conditions for which network MIMO is reasonably beneficial are strongly constrained. We observe different base station cooperation schemes in scenarios of maximal 3 base stations and 3 terminals, provide simulation results, and discuss the practicability of the discussed schemes and the implications of our results.	backhaul (telecommunications);cell signaling;channel state information;fairness measure;maximal set;multi-user mimo;next-generation network;overhead (computing);signal processing;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Patrick Marsch;Gerhard P.

9a44f2bfb7a125ddb42fe622328224780a4f9d58	jointly optimal congestion and power control for rayleigh-faded channels with outage constraints	enump;congestion control;期刊论文;lossy link model;outage probability;rayleigh fast fading channel;power control	We address the problem of joint congestion control and power control with link outage constraints in Rayleigh fast-fading and multihop wireless networks. Because of packet loss caused by the fast-fading-induced link outage, the data rate received successfully at the destination node (the effective rate) is much lower than the transmission rate at the source node (the injection rate). In this paper, a novel model, i.e., effective network utility maximization with power control (ENUMP), is designed to formulate this scenario. In ENUMP, the network utility is associated with the effective rate, and an effective network utility maximization formulation with link outage constraints is used. Although the original problem is non-convex and non-separable, we can still construct a distributed algorithm by applying appropriate transformations. Since in our model we sufficiently take into account the statistical variations of the signal-to-interference ratio, the power updates do not follow the instantaneous state of the fast-fading channel. Simulation results show that the optimal solution of our algorithm is close to the globally optimal solution. Besides, simulation results also verify that ENUMP achieves significant gains of the effective rate, the network utility, and the network congestion control over an existing famous model.	convex function;data rate units;distributed algorithm;downtime;end-to-end principle;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);jensen's inequality;lossy compression;maxima and minima;network congestion;network packet;network utility;numerical analysis;numerical method;penalty method;rayleigh–ritz method;scheduling (computing);simulation;social inequality;sun outage;throughput	Fei Wang;Xiaofeng Liao;Songtao Guo;Hongyu Huang	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1497-x	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;power control;computer science;flow control;network congestion;computer network	Metrics	33.95427287646969	87.81997285634078	66995

Therefore it becomes an important issue to satisfy QoS requirements of each MS at the cell boundary. The deployment of fixed relay stations has been actively considered to solve this spectral efficiency problem at the cell boundary. In this paper, we consider some radio resource management policies that are path selection rule, frequency reuse pattern matching, and frame transmission pattern matching among cells. We evaluate performances of using relays under these policies by varying parameter values such as the relay station's position and frequency reuse factor. Through Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical analysis, we also suggest some optimal values of parameters and policies.

bc2434ef5f6439a5547240dde74f28ffe94550ba	performance analysis of hybrid arq with incremental redundancy over amplify-and-forward dual-hop relay channels.		In this paper, we consider a three node relay network compris ing a source, a relay, and a destination. The source transmits the message to the destination using hybri d automatic repeat request (HARQ) with incremental redundancy (IR). The relay overhears the transmitted messa g , amplifies it using a variable gain amplifier, and then forwards the message to the destination. This latter co mbines both the source and the relay message and tries to decode the information. In case of decoding failure, the d estination sends a negative acknowledgement. A new replica of the message containing new parity bits is then tra smitted in the subsequent HARQ round. This process continues until successful decoding occurs at the destinat ion or a maximum number M of rounds is reached. We study the performance of HARQ-IR over the considered relay c hannel from an information theoretic perspective. We derive exact expressions and bounds for the information out age probability, the average number of transmissions, and the average transmission rate. Moreover, we evaluate th e delay experienced by Poisson arriving packets over the considered relay network. We also provide analytical ex pr ssions for the expected waiting time, the sojourn time, and the energy efficiency. The derived exact expressio n are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.	ergodic theory;hop;hybrid automatic repeat request;monte carlo method;parity bit;profiling (computer programming);relay;simulation;variable-gain amplifier	Ali Chelli;Amir Hadjtaieb;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2014	CoRR		relay channel;hop (networking);decoding methods;hybrid automatic repeat request;parity bit;real-time computing;acknowledgement;network packet;communication channel;computer science	Metrics	33.182858532581825	77.86211778213486	67118

Our objective is to maximize energy efficiency by adjusting the training duration, training power, and data power, under the constraint of the total transmit energy and spectral efficiency requirement for the user, which evaluates the impacts of the training and data transmission phases simultaneously. The optimization problem is established in a complicated form, where the difficulties lie in the nonanalytic expression of the involved objective function, as well as the nonconvex nature of the optimization problem. To solve it, the deterministic equivalent approximation methodology is introduced to obtain an accurate analytical expression of the cost function. Based on this, the optimization problem in a nonconvex fractional form is transformed into an equivalent optimization problem with a parametric subtractive form, which is still nonconvex. Thus, the objective function is lower bounded by a concave function, which leads to the availability of standard convex theory, and finally, an iterative resource allocation algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we obtain the closed-form solutions using the Lambert W function for some special channel cases. Numerical results validate the benefits of the proposed scheme and illustrate the tradeoff between training and data transmission.	approximation algorithm;concave function;duplex (telecommunications);iterative method;let expression;mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;rayleigh fading;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Yi Wang;Chunguo Li;Yongming Huang;Dongming Wang;Tian Ban;Luxi Yang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2483519	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;resource allocation;resource management;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;correlation;statistics;mimo	Metrics	38.261395344098744	87.39168613140171	67152

The focus of this paper is on understanding mmW channel properties that have an important bearing on the feasibility of mmW systems in practice and have a significant impact on physical layer design. In this direction, simultaneous channel sounding measurements at 2.9, 29, and 61 GHz are performed at a number of transmit–receive location pairs in indoor office, shopping mall, and outdoor environments. Based on these measurements, this paper first studies large-scale properties, such as path loss and delay spread across different carrier frequencies in these scenarios. Toward the goal of understanding the feasibility of outdoor-to-indoor coverage, material measurements corresponding to mmW reflection and penetration are studied and significant notches in signal reception spread over a few gigahertz are reported. Finally, implications of these measurements on system design are discussed, and multiple solutions are proposed to overcome these impairments.	automatic sounding;carrier wave;phy (chip);systems design	Vasanthan Raghavan;Andrzej Partyka;Lida Akhoondzadeh-Asl;M.

A distortion minimization problem over a finite-time horizon with causal and non-causal information is studied and the optimal energy allocation policy for transmission and sharing is derived.

596946c224170f06003af286616df176d555ed25	outage performance of cognitive multi-hop network under interference constraints over nakagami-m fading		The outage performance of multi-hop cooperative spectrum sharing systems with interference constraints over Nakagami-m fading is investigated. Employing a Decode-andForward (DF) relaying protocol, the closed-form analytic expression is derived for the Outage Probability (OP), which is validated through comparison with results from Monte-Carlo simulations. In addition, the corresponding asymptotic performance for the maximum transmit power is investigated as well. The obtained expressions provide useful insights on the behavior of the system performance under different operation parameters. Numerical results reveal that the system performance degrades as the number of relays increases, the relationship between the interference constraints and maximum transmits power leads to the emergence of the outage error floor. In addition, we compare the effectiveness of the interference link channel quality and the transmission link channel quality on the system performance improvement. Our results show that good performance of the system relies on the improvement of transmission links deeper than that of the interference links. However, the performance improvement of the overall system comes from good channel quality of all the links. Moreover, the presented results also demonstrate that underlay multi-hop cognitive networks depends on numerous factors and differs substantially from that of traditional multi-hop networks.	cognitive network;downtime;emergence;error floor;hop;interference (communication);numerical method;relay;simulation;transmission (bittorrent client)	Hui Guo;Shilong Ji;Lihong Wang	2016	JCM	10.12720/jcm.11.7.686-692	fading distribution	Metrics	36.0531986430618	81.02229465765504	67406

The scheme is based on orthogonal PNC OPNC. In the scheme, the two source nodes employ orthogonal carriers, and the relay node makes an orthogonal combining of the two information bits rather than exclusive or XOR, which is employed in most PNC schemes. The paper also analyzes the bit error rate BER performance of PNC, OPNC, and COPNC for Rayleigh fading model. Simulation results for Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels show that COPNC can provide outstanding BER performance compared with PNC and OPNC, especially when the uplink channel conditions are asymmetric. The results in Nakagami-m channels also imply that COPNC will provide higher BER gain with more severe fading depth. Potential works about COPNC are also presented in this paper.

4bc0ce30630284fb71c7a1a0ee75135266c1fe31	beamformer design and performance analysis of multi-antenna wireless legitimate surveillance systems		From the perspective of national security, legitimate government agencies have long been committed to enforcing powerful surveillance measures on suspicious individuals or communications. This paper investigates a wireless legitimate surveillance system, where a full-duplex multi-antenna legitimate monitor aims to eavesdrop on a dubious communication link between a suspicious pair via proactive jamming. It is assumed that the legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop the suspicious information only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that of the suspicious receiver. To maximize the eavesdropping non-outage probability, optimal joint design of the jamming power, receive and transmit beamformers at the legitimate monitor is presented. Moreover, two low-complexity suboptimal beamforming schemes are proposed and the corresponding analytical results are obtained. Our outcomes demonstrate that by exploiting multiple antennas at the legitimate monitor, the eavesdropping non-outage probability exhibits a significant improvement compared to the single antenna case. In addition, the proposed suboptimal transmit zero-forcing scheme yields similar performance as the optimal scheme.	algorithm;beamforming;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);profiling (computer programming);radio jamming;sun outage;uncompressed video	Xin Jiang;Sheng Yang;Caijun Zhong;Fengzhong Qu;Xiaoming Chen;Zhaoyang Zhang	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170995	computer science;national security;computer network;wireless;jamming;beamforming;government;eavesdropping	Mobile	35.84870230676127	83.73747630131577	67848
204a9cd0019a91a31dad216f9ab7b6993ea0ebf4	precoder design for cooperative multi-user downlink miso channels with finite side-link capacity		For a pair of closely located and cooperating user equipments (UEs), a precoder is designed at the base station (BS) which considers the UE cooperation. The UEs collaborate over an out-of-band side-link with a finite capacity. The side-link may be used for interference cancellation (IC) or for relaying decoded symbols. The precoder has two parts, a cooperative part based on channel inversion and a non- cooperative part based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) metric. It is the interference from the former part which is managed at the UEs in the cooperative IC phase. The latter part is included at the BS to further improve the performance if there is transmit power remaining at the BS after the cooperative phase; this due to the assumption of finite capacity side-link. To study the performance of the precoder design, various joint optimization problems that maximize a sum-rate objective are considered. The effects of power imbalance and correlation between the UEs are included into the problems. From the numerical results it is observed that the sum-rate increases with cooperation. Further, with an increase in the side-link capacity the objective value approaches the single-user water-filling capacity limit. By modifying the precoder structure and the user cooperation mechanism, a unidirectional side-link case, where only one of the users accesses the side-link, is also discussed.	catastrophic interference;code;deferred procedure call;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;numerical analysis;out-of-band agreement;quality of service;software propagation;system analysis;telecommunications link;unreal development kit	Krishna Chitti;Fredrik Rusek;Chaitanya Tumula	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417568	transmitter power output;single antenna interference cancellation;computer network;real-time computing;computer science;telecommunications link;multi-user;decoding methods;minimum mean square error;optimization problem;communication channel	Robotics	37.57908212466297	85.56402650707007	68043
67cfc9129b0a1a73dc6f665aa439e3f68755a47c	massive connectivity with massive mimo—part ii: achievable rate characterization		This two-part paper aims to quantify the cost of device activity detection in an uplink massive connectivity scenario with a large number of devices but device activities are sporadic. Part I of this paper shows that in an asymptotic massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) regime, device activity detection can always be made perfect. Part II of this paper subsequently shows that despite the perfect device activity detection, there is nevertheless significant cost due to device detection in terms of overall achievable rate, because of the fact that nonorthogonal pilot sequences have to be used in order to accommodate the large number of potential devices, resulting in significantly larger channel estimation error as compared to conventional massive MIMO systems with orthogonal pilots. Specifically, this paper characterizes each active user's achievable rate using random matrix theory under either maximal-ratio combining (MRC) or minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receive beamforming at the base station (BS), assuming the statistics of their estimated channels as derived in Part I. The characterization of user rate also allows the optimization of pilot sequences length. Moreover, in contrast to the conventional massive MIMO system, the MMSE beamforming is shown to achieve much higher rate than the MRC beamforming for the massive connectivity scenario under consideration. Finally, this paper illustrates the necessity of user scheduling for rate maximization when the number of active users is larger than the number of antennas at the BS.	beamforming;channel state information;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo;mathematical optimization;maximal set;mean squared error;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Liang Liu;Wei Yu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2818070	mimo;random matrix;algorithm;mathematical optimization;telecommunications link;scheduling (computing);mathematics;beamforming;maximization;base station;communication channel	Mobile	37.91638608436211	86.17036724959026	68100

However, neither o f them can approach the capacity bound when the channels in the broadcast phase are asymmetric. In t his paper, we present a new physical layer network coding (PLNC) scheme, called superimposed XOR. The new scheme advances the existing schemes by specifically taking into account the channel asym metry as well as information asymmetry in the broadcast phase. We obtain its achievable rate regions o ver Gaussian channels when integrated with two known time control protocols in two-way relaying. We als o demonstrate their average maximum sum-rates and service delay performances over fading chann els. Numerical results show that the proposed superimposed XOR achieves a larger rate region than both XOR and superposition and performs much better over fading channels. We further deduce the boundary of its achievable rate region of the broadcast phase in an explicit and analytical expression. Based on the se r sults, we then show that the gap to the capacity bound approaches zero at high signal-to-noise rat io.	additive white gaussian noise;ampersand;bitwise operation;decibel;exclusive or;linear network coding;network packet;performance;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;symbol level;two-phase commit protocol;ver (command)	Jianquan Liu;Meixia Tao;Youyun Xu;Xiaodong Wang	2010	CoRR		information asymmetry;physics beyond the standard model;linear network coding;telecommunications;information theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;statistics	Security	34.50968166608094	75.73440595454588	68326

The setup assumes a packet erasure channel and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information simultaneously. The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before stopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of freedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. We provide an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. We show that its performance is very close to that of a full duplex system, while transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in performance, especially if latency is high. Also, we study the throughput performance of our scheme and compare it to existing half-duplex Go-back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ schemes. Numerical results, obtained for different latencies, show that our scheme has similar performance to the Selective Repeat in most cases and considerable performance gain when latency and packet error probability is high.	acknowledgement (data networks);binary erasure channel;bit error rate;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;go-back-n arq;linear network coding;lookup table;mathematical optimization;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;packet erasure channel;precomputation;recursion;reliability (computer networking);selective repeat arq;throughput;transmitter	Daniel Enrique Lucani;Milica Stojanovic;Muriel Médard	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062100	nickel;binary erasure channel;transmitter;throughput;linear network coding;real-time computing;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;probability of error;wireless network;linear code;feedback;mathematics;degrees of freedom;go-back-n arq;automatic repeat request;time-division multiplexing;encoding;statistics;computer network	Metrics	33.192458527920465	75.38662211355843	68431
2f9cb428ac37e99bca9d735ad9db4d9037ca5457	rate-energy tradeoff and decoding error probability-energy tradeoff for swipt in finite code length		In this paper, the fundamental performance of the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system is studied. Unlike any existing works where the codelength was assumed to be infinity, we explicitly consider the case of the finite codelength, which is much more realistic especially for the practical SWIPT system due to its limited power and complexity. For the four well-known SWIPT schemes, we analyze the tradeoff between the rate and energy; then we study the optimality of those SWIPT schemes. Furthermore, to fully characterize the fundamental performance of the SWIPT system in the regime of finite codelength, we propose to additionally use the new tradeoff between the decoding error probability and the harvested energy. In the sense of this new tradeoff, we study the optimality of the four SWIPT schemes. For the analysis of the two types of tradeoffs, we consider two different cases: when the transmit power of symbols is adapted or not. For various scenarios, we provide useful insights into the performance of the SWIPT system in the finite codelength.

In this paper we propose an adaptive subband selection technique based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to avoid interference for better system coexistence when multiple systems are operating in the same unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands. Under the assumption that the interference power level and the interfered frequency bands are identified at the receiver, interference thresholds, determined over both Gaussian and multipath fading channels, are applied to adaptively select the transmission subbands so that interference is avoided and the system coexistence issues are relaxed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive subband selection method, the system bit error rates (BERs) under different interference levels are simulated and compared.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;coexist (image);cognitive radio;discrepancy function;frequency band;frequency divider;interference (communication);multipath propagation;multiplexing;sfiaplus	Pingzhou Tu;Xiaojing Huang;Eryk Dutkiewicz	2008	2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562463	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	EDA	35.900460268689685	85.81963344938528	68508

We believe that the results presented here validate the adoption of massive MIMO as a key enabling technology for 5G and pave the way for further pragmatic research by the massive MIMO community. The testbed operates in real-time with a Long-Term Evolution (LTE)-like PHY in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode and supports up to 24 spatial streams, providing an excellent basis for comparison with existing standards and complimentary testbeds. Through line-of-sight (LOS) measurements at 3.51 GHz in an indoor atrium environment with 12 user clients, an uncoded system sum-rate of 1.59 Gbps was achieved in real-time using a single 20 MHz LTE band, equating to 79.4 bits/s/Hz. In a subsequent indoor trial, 22 user clients were successfully served, which would equate to 145.6 bits/s/Hz using the same frame schedule. To the best of the author's knowledge, these are the highest spectral efficiencies achieved for any wireless system to date.	charge-coupled device;compaq lte;data rate units;duplex (telecommunications);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;phy (chip);patch panel;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;software deployment;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;test-driven development;testbed	Paul Harris;Wael Boukley Hassan;Steffen Malkowsky;Joao Vieira;Siming Zhang;Mark A.

Consequently mechanisms are required to permit co-existence of non-cooperative technology. The purpose of this paper is to bring our experiences of this problem to the wireless area, by presenting a simulation system constructed to investigate the effects of imposing various spectrum sharing schemes upon wireless networks operating in the same spectrum band. In particular, wireless metropolitan and local area networks are considered operating in the 5 GHz band using two common sharing schemes—simple frequency hopping and move if interfered, both of which are compared against a spectrum commons approach (free for all). The system’s design and operation is explained, as are the sharing schemes that have been incorporated. Results indicate that significant performance improvements can be obtained compared to a free-for-all approach and that differences occur depending on whether a planned or random frequency allocation is initially used.	emoticon;frequency allocation;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);intranet;link building;mii;nsa product types;network performance;simulation;software deployment;throughput;time complexity	Stephen Hurley;Archie Wade;Roger M.

DTV channels in major U.S. cities could be victimized by interference from unlicensed or uncontrollable clusters. This paper shows how and why interference by clusters of broadband devices would be significantly higher than interference by individual broadband devices or by interference from clusters of single-tone devices. This paper also provides a real-world assessment of the maximum interference that consumer-grade receivers can accept from clusters of broadband devices operating on unoccupied DTV channels. To prevent interference to DTV and to maximize spectral efficiency individual base stations would have to be licensed as part of a network, and portable unlicensed devices would have to be equipped with dual DTV tuners with GPS chips.	fm broadcasting;global positioning system;interference (communication);spectral efficiency;transmitter;uncontrolled format string	Oded Bendov	2008	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2008.921398	embedded system;electronic engineering;global positioning system;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;broadcasting	Arch	26.875493557527236	81.40556474797488	69048

However, there is a tradeoff between the access opportunities for SUs and communication constraints from primary networks. Moreover, considering the interplay among SUs sharing the limited spatial access resources, how much the access opportunity a SU can derive become complex to determine. In this paper, to protect the primary users(PUs) from the interference caused by SUs, a location-aware discrete region model for spatial spectrum access opportunities of SUs is highlighted, in which the exact value of access opportunity is quantitative as the expected allowed-transmitting number (EATN) of SUs surrounding a PU. Considering the impact of SUs transmission probability and mobility, a probabilistic analysis and a finite-state Markov chain is undertaken. Simulation results show the change rules of SUs access opportunities with parameters of primary and secondary networks, which is full of conductive in determining the deployment and operation of secondary network.	cognitive radio;computer simulation;discretization;interference (communication);location awareness;markov chain;one-class classification;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;simulation;software deployment;transmitter	Zebing Feng;Zhiyong Feng;Qixun Zhang	2013	ICT 2013	10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632139	cognitive radio;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;interference;markov process;computer network	Mobile	31.114493980287172	86.29909797852775	69284

The scenarios envisioned for WPANs are likely to involve a large number of POSs operating in an indoor environment. Among short-range wireless technologies, BluetoothTM 1 based ad-hoc connectivity comes closest to satisfying the WPAN requirements. Bluetooth provides a gross rate of 1 Mbps per network and allows several such networks to overlap using frequency hopping. The 'aggregate throughput' thus achieved is much higher than 1 Mbps. In the absence of external interfering sources, aggregate throughput is limited by self interference which depends upon, (i) physical layer parameters like hopping rate, hopping sequences, transmitted power, receiver sensitivity, modulation, forward error correction (ii) channel characteristics like coherence bandwidth and coherence time (iii) spatial characteristics. In this work we consider the problem of finding the capacity of Bluetooth based ad-hoc systems by accurately modeling the Bluetooth physical layer and the indoor wireless channel. We predict the throughput in Bluetooth based ad-hoc systems as a function of a generalized set of parameters using realistic scenarios and assumptions.	aggregate data;aggregate function;bluetooth;data rate units;eb/n0;error detection and correction;forward error correction;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);modulation;network packet;power semiconductor device;requirement;simulation;throughput	Apurva Kumar;Rajeev Gupta	2001		10.1145/378420.378443	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ant;computer network	Mobile	25.39333485420028	84.30444989690135	69306

Instead of fixing a probing threshold in a polling-based system, we vary the probing threshold and allow users to feed back quantized information indicating their channel's state. The probing threshold starts with the system's minimum threshold level and increases towards the system's maximum depending on the number of employed modulation levels and the users' channel state information. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the feedback load and the guard-time requirements with a slight penalty loss in the spectral efficiency when compared to the optimal algorithm (full feedback). Furthermore, we study the effect of our algorithm on the probability of access, system throughput and scheduling delay after deriving closed-form expressions for the feedback load and the spectral efficiency.	algorithm;data system;multi-user;scheduling (computing)	Mohammed E.

In particular, modeling of effects such as signal suppression, intermodulation noise, and gain setting is discussed. By considering each component of the end-to-end link performance separately, the factors limiting performance are more apparent, enabling the system designer to identify which improvements would have the greatest impact.	amplifier;baseband;coverage data;end-to-end principle;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;intermodulation;jam;nonlinear system;open biomedical ontologies;radio jamming;satellite dish;signal-to-noise ratio;systems design;telecommunications link;the hub (forum);transponder;usb hub;waveform;zero suppression	IV C.

However, there is an implicit loss in data throughput even due to partial CSI feedback which is not included in conventional sum-rate computations. We introduce a sum-rate distortion model including the implicit loss for a multiuser MIMO downlink with block diagonalization. A distortion function is subsequently presented which accounts for quantization error at the receiver, feedback latency due to non-homogenous receiver channel coherence times and the loss in net capacity due to feedback overhead. This system model is used to derive bounds on the amount of feedback that can be supported under various antenna, channel and signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. Simulation results are presented to show the impact of feedback on the sum- rate for multi-antenna wireless systems with multiple users.	1-bit architecture;channel (communications);channel state information;computation;distortion;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;image scaling;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;overhead (computing);quantization (signal processing);rate–distortion theory;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video	Amitav Mukherjee;Hyuck M.

In this context, we first provide a comparative analysis of the optimal resource allocation scheme with respect to several other approaches in order to provide insights into the system behavior and show the benefits of each alternative. Then, assuming the optimal resource allocation, a closed form expression for the distribution of the mean and outage data rates is derived. It turns out that the corresponding mean e2e data rate formula attains an expression in terms of an integral that does not admit a closed form solution. Therefore, a tight lower bound formula for the mean e2e data rate is presented. Results can be used to select the most convenient resource allocation scheme and perform link dimensioning in the network planning phase, showing the explicit relationships that exist between component link bandwidths, SNR values, and mean data rate.	data rate units;direction finding;downtime;end-to-end principle;qualitative comparative analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;uncompressed video	Inam Ullah;Alexis Alfredo Dowhuszko;Zhong Zheng;David González González;Jyri Hämäläinen	2017	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2017/3708142	closed-form expression;computer science;network planning and design;distributed computing;mathematical optimization;end-to-end principle;resource allocation;upper and lower bounds;dimensioning	Metrics	31.947221815849016	84.28191158532937	69457

Recently, a scheme (termed the quantize-and-forward scheme in this paper) without binning and using joint decoding at the destination node has been proposed, which has been shown to achieve the same rate as the original compress-and-forward scheme. Since the previous work focuses on the so-called full duplex relay network, in this paper, an adaption of it for relay networks with a half-duplex relay is provided. Coding schemes and achievable rate results are presented for discrete memoryless half-duplex relay channels and half-duplex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) relay channels. Moreover, slow fading channels are considered, for which outage-related performance measures are evaluated. Specifically, the outage probability and the expected rate of the quantize-and-forward scheme are derived and compared with other well-known schemes. Furthermore, the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is derived. It is shown that the quantize-and-forward scheme is a more suitable scheme than the compress-and-forward scheme over slow fading channels and it achieves the optimal diversity-multiplexing trade-off of a half-duplex relay channel.	additive white gaussian noise;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);internet relay chat;multiplexing;product binning;quantization (signal processing);relay channel;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sha Yao;Mikael Skoglund;Thanh Tùng Kim;H.

However, interference is added to the system due to large number of uncontrolled user deployed femtocells. In this paper, downlink coexistence between macro-cells and co-channel femtocells in a single frequency OFDMA network is investigated with realistic Long Term Evolution (LTE) system parameters. The impact of femtocell density and load variation in femtocells on the performance of macrocell and femtocell UEs is presented. SINR and capacity analysis is used to evaluate the performance of the 3GPP LTE system. An auto-configuration method for femtocells by UE measurements based downlink power control is described. Results show that the interference measurement based power control significantly reduces the downlink interference in a co-channel macrocell-femtocell networks thereby providing method for realizing fem-tocell networks.	auto-configuration;channel capacity;coexist (image);compaq lte;interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput;uncontrolled format string	Prabhu Chandhar;Priyangshu Ghosh;Suvra Sekhar Das	2014	2014 Twentieth National Conference on Communications (NCC)	10.1109/NCC.2014.6811377	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.356447445396572	87.96422747851088	69499

Paterakis (1984). The authors assume ternary feedback broadcast per slot, and in the presence of capture, identification of the captured packet by all the users in the system. It is also assumed that a successfully received signal transmission cannot be distinguished from a capture in the presence of multiple transmission. The performance of the algorithm is compared to an appropriate modification of J.I Capetanakis' (1979) dynamic algorithm. The proposed algorithm, and in contrast to the latter, it can be easily modified to operate in limited feedback sensing environments. >	algorithm;random access	Daniel F.

The combined use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with NCC has been further studied in the literature to exploit the multipath diversity gains. In this paper, we consider orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), an extension of OFDM to a multiuser system where subsets of carriers are assigned to different users. We first derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability of NCC-OFDMA over Rician fading channels and then present the asymptotical and finite-SNR DMT expressions. Our results provide insight into the performance mechanisms under practical SNR regime of NCC-OFDMA systems and demonstrate that NCC-OFDMA is able to fully exploit both frequency and spatial diversity. We also show that the derived finite-SNR DMT converges to an asymptotical one as expected. Furthermore, special cases for our derived analytical expressions are presented, to show that the derived expression is a generalized case of the related the state of the art results. Simulation results are further presented to verify our theoretical analyses.	asymptote;cc system;digital monetary trust;downtime;effective method;frequency divider;glonass-k2;multi-user;multipath propagation;multiplexing;neural correlates of consciousness;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;sun outage;throughput	Ali Reza Heidarpour;Gunes Karabulut Kurt;Murat Uysal	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2633354	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;signal-to-noise ratio;broadcasting;bandwidth;laboratory	Mobile	36.64378832380189	78.53768667365092	69539

In fact, the transmission rate is primarily determined by the distance between the train and the base station. As a result, the data transmission between the base station and the tain can only be measured in term of average transmission rate. This paper investigates the influence of train speed on system performance. As shown, the average transmission rate is independent of train speed. However, the total service that the train receives from a certain base station is inversely proportional to train speed. A lower bound as well as an upper bound on the average transmission rate are also presented.	clock rate;mobile phone	Yunquan Dong;Pingyi Fan	2013	2013 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)	10.1109/HMWC.2013.6710295	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	27.054835387462393	84.31181651837873	70150

While existing multi-point transmission features for WCDMA have concentrated on soft/softer handover (HO) mechanisms and are applicable only for Rel-99 based networks, HS-SFN brings an over-the-air combining approach to multi-cell transmissions for packet-oriented HSDPA. We introduce also a so-called ”High-Speed Data-Discontinuous Transmission (HS-DDTx)” concept, an inter-cell interference mitigation scheme designed to improve the data throughput especially for low geometry users residing at cell borders. The presented results show how these low complexity concepts together offer a high gain for low and medium throughput users, without sacrificing the overall network performance. The proposed schemes also allow further upgradeability and there are ways to improve the efficiency by enhancements on both network side and user terminal equipment.	cell (microprocessor);discontinuous transmission;hs algorithm;interference (communication);mobile phone;network packet;network performance;packet switching;prospective search;scheduling (computing);single-frequency network;telecommunications link;throughput;unreachable memory	Vesa P.

This article presents an elementary analysis of the physical mechanisms underlying these emissions, from which the interference characteristics of BPL systems can be derived. Numerical models are evaluated for idealized systems using overhead medium-voltage wires, a configuration that is of particular interest for U.S. deployments. The central conclusions of the analysis are: (i) BPL interference is governed primarily by two parameters: signal power and electrical balance of system excitation; (ii) interfering emissions are typically confined to the immediate vicinity of the BPL wire, but long-range effects cannot be neglected; and (iii) measurements on an installed BPL system suggest that it is operating within, but very close to, the limits set by rules recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission.	aerial photography;bpl (complexity);interference (communication);internet access;overhead (computing);power-line communication	Paul S.

b6f719265ef285b0118c61cc92dc2b6f91ad2aa3	rf energy harvesting in wireless networks with harq	tk5101 6720 telecommunication	In this paper, we consider a class of wireless powered communication networks using data link layer hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol to ensure reliable communications. In particular, we analyze the trade-off between accumulating mutual information and accumulating RF energy at the receiver of a point-to-point link using HARQ with incremental redundancy over a Rayleigh fading channel. The transmitter is assumed to have a constant energy source while the receiver relies, solely, on the RF energy harvested from the received signal. First, we target the optimal time switching (TS) policy in order to maximize the probability of successful decoding within a fixed number of re- transmissions, in the absence of CSI information at the receiver. Towards this objective, we cast the problem as a finite time- horizon dynamic programming problem. However, motivated by the sheer complexity of the problem attributed to the continuous state space, we characterize the optimal solution for a discrete version of the problem. Second, we propose a simple greedy algorithm and compare its performance to the optimal and a non-causal lower bound. Third, when CSI is available at the receiver, we introduce a heuristic TS policy which is shown to have a performance superior to the greedy policy and close to that of the lower bound. Finally, the numerical results exhibit the merits of the proposed heuristic and greedy algorithms, approaching the lower bound, for a variety of scenarios.	causal filter;computational complexity theory;dynamic programming;greedy algorithm;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);hybrid automatic repeat request;mutual information;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);rf modulator;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;reliability (computer networking);state space;telecommunications network;transmitter	Maha Zohdy;Tamer A.

In this work, interference forwarding by a half-duplex dynamic decode-and-forward (HD DDF) relay in a two-user Z-channel is considered. In the two-user Z-channel, one user is interference-limited while the other user is interference-free. The diversity gain region (DGR), which characterizes the tradeoff between the achievable diversity orders between the two users, is an appropriate performance metric for the Z-channel. Closed-form expression for the achievable DGR with the interference forwarding by the HD DDF relay is presented. The multiplexing gain regions (MGRs) where the HD DDF protocol achieves better DGR over the direct transmission scheme, full-duplex decode-and-forward (FD DF) and FD partial DF relay assisted Z- channel are identified. The HD DDF protocol is shown to achieve better DGR than the FD DF and FD PDF relay for a large range of MGR. The achievable DGRs for the HD DDF, FD DF, and FD PDF relay-assisted Z-channel and direct transmission scheme are presented for various interference levels and multiplexing gain pairs.	relay	Rajendra Prasad Sirigina;A.

f5cf44bbb76ada37a9848f8a01339321c23c5374	cognitive access-transmission policies under a primary arq process via chain decoding		"""Abstract This paper introduces a novel technique that enables access by a cognitive secondary user (SU) to a spectrum occupied by an incumbent primary user (PU) that employs Type-I Hybrid ARQ. The technique allows the SU to perform selective retransmissions of SU data packets that have not been successfully decoded in the previous attempts. The temporal redundancy introduced by the PU ARQ protocol and by the selective retransmission process of the SU can be exploited by the SU receiver to perform interference cancellation (IC) over multiple transmission slots, thus creating a """"clean"""" channel for the decoding of the concurrent SU or PU packets. The chain decoding technique is initiated by a successful decoding operation of a SU or PU packet and proceeds by an iterative application of IC in order to decode the buffered signals that represent packets that could not be decoded before. Based on this scheme, an optimal policy is designed that maximizes the SU throughput under a constraint on the average long-term PU performance. The optimality of the chain decoding protocol is proved, which determines which packet the SU should send at a given time. Moreover, a decoupling principle is proved, which establishes the optimality of decoupling the secondary access strategy from the chain decoding protocol. Specifically, first, the SU access policy, optimized via dynamic programming, specifies whether the SU should access the channel or not, based on a compact state representation of the protocol; and second, the chain decoding protocol embeds four basic rules that are used to determine which packet should be transmitted by the SU. Chain decoding provably yields the maximum improvement that can be achieved by any scheme under our assumptions, and thus it is the ultimate scheme, which completely closes the gap between previous schemes and optimality."""	access control;catastrophic interference;coupling (computer programming);dynamic programming;hybrid automatic repeat request;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iteration;mathematical optimization;network packet;one-class classification;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;superuser;throughput	Nicolò Michelusi;Petar Popovski;Michele Zorzi	2015	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Security	33.06126976085485	77.13607164212365	71224

Assuming the Nakagami-m blockfading environment, we aim at maximizing the performance of secondary user's link in terms of average spectral efficiency (ASE) and error performance under the specified packet error rate (PER) and average interference limit constraints. To this end, we employ a cross-layer design policy which combines adaptive power and coded discrete M-QAM modulation scheme at the physical layer with a truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol at the data link layer, and simultaneously satisfies the aforementioned constraints. Numerical results affirm that the secondary link of spectrum sharing system combining ARQ with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) achieves significant gain in ASE depending on the maximum number of retransmissions initiated by the ARQ protocol. The results further indicate that the ARQ protocol essentially improves the packet loss rate performance of the secondary link.	adaptive server enterprise;advanced mezzanine card;automatic repeat request;bit error rate;interference (communication);modulation;network packet;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Krishna Nehra;Amir Shadmand;Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683511	sliding window protocol;data link layer;spectrum;communications protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;transmitter;link layer;quadrature amplitude modulation;stop-and-wait arq;bit error rate;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;interference;go-back-n arq;automatic repeat request;fading;physical layer;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	34.72018926563845	79.04802370359404	71550

However, no framework for multicarrier-based broadband systems, e.g., multicarrier code-division multiple access and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access, is available based on the perspective of link capacity. This paper presents a handover technique referred to as semisoft-handover-utilizing macroscopic diversity, which permits both hard and soft handover advantages for services over multicarrier-based broadband networks to be retained. Theoretical analysis is then performed to measure the handover gain over the forward link in terms of an outage probability. Simulation data verify that semisoft handover outperforms other traditional handover techniques, in particular for high-data-rate services.	downtime;numerical analysis;quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications network	Hyungkeuk Lee;Hyukmin Son	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.927041	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;information technology;soft handover;computer network;broadband networks	Visualization	29.382665700059963	87.40191542623585	71657

The continuous measurement campaign was conducted on a city expressway through the complex dense urban area in Wuhan, China. Small-scale channel characteristics including power delay profile, amplitude fading distribution, K-factor, delay spread and Doppler shift were obtained, respectively. Specifically, the cumulative distribution function of root mean square delay spreads and root mean square Doppler spreads in the non-congested scenario and congested scenario were all fitted well with Lognormal distribution. We also found out that different intensity of traffic and speed of vehicles have little effect on root mean square delay spreads, but have a big impact on root mean square Doppler spreads and level crossing rate. According to estimation outcomes, the V2V channel characteristics for urban areas in Chinese big city were different from the previous measured results under similar scenarios in Europe. Delay spread and level crossing rate in this study can provide significant references to design the wireless communication system for vehicle-to-vehicle channel.	akaike information criterion;algorithm;doppler effect;k-factor (cisco);mean squared error;network congestion;systems design;vehicle-to-vehicle	Fang Li;Wei Chen;Yishui Shui;Lida Xu;Junyi Yu;Changzhen Li;Kun Yang	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330437	cumulative distribution function;computer network;amplitude;fading distribution;computer science;power delay profile;log-normal distribution;electronic engineering;root mean square;delay spread;communication channel	Mobile	26.309134297078977	78.62293944795248	71764

In addition, time division duplex (TDD) as compared to frequency division duplex (FDD) represents an appropriate method to cater for the asymmetric use of a duplex channel. However, the TDD technique is subject to additional interference mechanisms compared to an FDD system, in particular if neighboring cells require different rates of asymmetry. If TDD is combined with an interference limited multiple access technique such as CDMA, the additional interference mechanism represents an important issue. This issue poses the question of whether a CDMA/TDD air-interface can be used in a cellular environment. The problems are eased if a hybrid time division multiple access (TDMA)/CDMA interface (TD-CDMA) is used. The reason for this is that the TDMA component adds another degree of freedom which can be utilized to avoid interference. This, however, requires special channel assignment techniques. A notable example of a system which uses a TD-CDMA/TDD interface is the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This paper presents a novel centralized dynamic channel assignment (DCA) algorithm for a TD-CDMA/TDD air-interface. The DCA algorithm exploits a new technique which is termed “TS-opposing technique.” The key result is that the new DCA algorithm enables neighboring cells to adopt different rates of asymmetry without a significant capacity loss.	algorithm;capacity loss;centralized computing;duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;interference (communication);multi-user;test-driven development	Harald Haas;Stephen McLaughlin	2001	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.957300	code division multiple access;universal mobile telecommunications system;td-cdma;index term;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;interference;degrees of freedom;time division multiple access;umts frequency bands;time-division multiplexing;computer network	Mobile	28.286823396504104	87.68234173300304	71789

5ad5c744eea4b0053706ca5c68bd3e7a2f626042	outage probability of cognitive selective df relay networks with multiple primary nodes and heterogenous non-identical constraints	outage probability;cognitive selective df relay networks;multiple primary nodes;maximum transmission power limits	Outage probability analysis of cognitive selective DF relay networks with selection combining technique taking into account all the following issues is important: multiple SU relays, multiple PUs, non-identical independent Rayleigh fading channels, non-identical interference power limits of PUs, non-identical maximum transmission power limits of SUs, and non-identical noise powers in signals. However, no existing works solve this task exactly. In this paper, to overcome the complexity in analyzing such non-identical-parameter networks directly, we conduct the analysis in two steps indirectly. In the first step, we obtain outage probability expressions of identical-parameter networks. Then in the second step, we propose a method for transforming a non-identical-parameter network into a new identical-parameter network, meanwhile guaranteeing that the distributions of end-to-end signal to noise ratio of the two networks before and after the transformation are identical. Thus the outage probability of the identical-parameter network can be regarded as outage probability of the corresponding non-identical-parameter network. Numerical simulations validate our analysis results and confirm the feasibility of the two-step indirect analysis approach.	cognition;computational fluid dynamics;direction finding;downtime;end-to-end principle;householder transformation;interference (communication);model transformation;network model;numerical linear algebra;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Zhen-guo Gao;Danjie Chen;Nianmin Yao;Zhimao Lu;Bingcai Chen;Guozhen Tan	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3587-z	telecommunications;computer science;statistics	ML	35.63430579709046	81.13495512430354	71972
40ba2947c4e5e1068b692db120183c25cb2ac22c	modelling and performance analysis of wireless lan enabled by rf energy transfer		RF signals can be relied upon for transferring energy to those power-thirsty wireless devices. Thanks to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, dedicated RF signals for delivering information to specific devices can also be received by others for energy harvesting. Coordinating the conventional wireless information transfer and the wireless energy transfer (WET) requires a systematic design in all OSI layers, which yields data and energy integrated communication networks. Based on the classic carrier-sense-multiple-access with collision avoidance protocol, we originally propose a distributed multiple access protocol in the medium access control (MAC) layer for the indoor wireless-local-area-network (WLAN) powered by RF signal-based WET. The operation of our proposed protocol in the WET powered indoor WLAN is modeled by a multi-dimensional Markov chain, which is exploited for deriving the closed-form throughput of the WLAN studied. The simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis, which pave the way for the future optimization design in the MAC layer of WET powered indoor WLAN.	access control;backoff;carpal tunnel syndrome;communications protocol;counterfactual conditional;design rule for camera file system;emoticon;energy level;entropy (information theory);handshaking;ibm basic programming support;inter-process communication;markov chain;mathematical optimization;network packet;osi model;profiling (computer programming);rs-232;radio frequency;report definition language;simulation;stationary process;stationary state;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput;uc browser	Yizhe Zhao;Jie Hu;Yingfei Diao;Qin Yu;Kun Yang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848974	electronic engineering;telecommunications network;throughput;channel access method;wireless;energy harvesting;osi model;information transfer;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	33.083615855533104	80.9905797950984	71995

Assuming a downlink channel and that the transmitter knows only the statistical information about the channel, our aim is to minimize the overall transmit power for achieving the users’ outage constraint by jointly optimizing the power allocation and the time-sharing (i.e., the number of time slots) of the users. This paper first derives the so-called minimum power equation (MPE) to solve for the minimum transmit power required for attaining a given outage rate probability of a single-user MIMO block-fading channel if the number of blocks is predetermined. We then construct a convex optimization problem, which can mimic the original problem structure and permits to jointly consider the power consumption and the probability constraints of the users, to give a suboptimal multiuser time-sharing solution. This is finally combined with the MPE to provide a joint power allocation and time-sharing solution for the time-division multiuser MIMO system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs nearly the same as the global optimum with inappreciable difference.	convex optimization;downtime;global optimization;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;optimization problem;sun outage;telecommunications link;time-sharing;transmitter	Kai-Kit Wong;Jia Chen	2008	EURASIP J.

The multidimensional estimation data are obtained using a recently developed 3-D high-resolution channel sounder. The estimation results are compared with results obtained from a 3-D deterministic propagation prediction tool. For a better analysis, a hierarchical clustering method is presented that can separate and group the multidimensional estimation data into clusters. Measurements performed at a fixed position as well as along a trajectory are used to characterize the angular dispersion in both azimuth and elevation. The angular dispersion in terms of the rms cluster angular spread in both elevation and azimuth of the different clusters is analyzed over space and time and related to its physical scattering sources. Compared to the measurements, a large number of multipath clusters are missing in the predictions. Furthermore, it is observed from the measurements that different objects cause different angular spread values in azimuth and elevation. The results can be very helpful for the identification, improvement and calibration of deterministic propagation prediction models.	multipath propagation	Maurice R. J. A. E. Kwakkernaat;Matti H. A.

We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of utilising millimetre wave in bands 71 - 76 and 81 - 86 GHz and free space optics (FSO) to fronthaul/backhaul links. As an initial study, the proposed architecture based on D-RAN is applied to a dense urban city area where moving vehicles and other users are served mixed traffic, including high resolution on demand and real time video. The analysis shows that the unevenly distributed traffic caused by different user types and mobility requires that the location and number of backhaul links need to be carefully designed to overcome the problems of bottlenecks on the backhaul links.	backhaul (telecommunications);c-ran;high- and low-level;image resolution;radio access network;requirement;software deployment	Jialu Lun;David Grace;Alister G.

However, at ultrahigh frequency (UHF) and above, pedestrian movement may significantly affect the multipath propagation conditions in indoor environments. For the first time, a systematic analysis of the effect of pedestrian movement on channel capacity for an otherwise line-of-sight MIMO link in a single room is presented. A novel channel model for the populated indoor environment is also introduced, based on geometrical optics and a detailed radar cross-section representation of the human body. The new model generates a temporal profile for the complex transfer function of each antenna combination in the MIMO system in the presence of specified pedestrian movement. Channel capacity values derived from this data are important in terms of understanding the limitations and possibilities for MIMO systems. Capacity results are presented for a 42-m/sup 2/ single room environment, using a 2.45-GHz narrowband 8/spl times/8 MIMO array with 0.4/spl lambda/ element spacing. Although the model predicts significant increases in the peak channel capacity due to pedestrian movement, the improvement in mean capacity values was more modest. For the static empty room case, the channel capacity was 10.9 b/s/Hz, while the mean capacity under dynamic conditions was 12.3 b/s/Hz for four pedestrians, each moving at the same speed (0.5 m/s). The results presented suggest that practical MIMO systems must be sufficiently adaptive if they are to benefit from the capacity enhancement caused by pedestrian movement.	adaptive coding;blocking (computing);channel (communications);channel capacity;fibre channel point-to-point;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;multipath propagation;population;radar;revision control system;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;sun outage;transfer function;ultra high frequency	K.

It is shown that the average throughput decreases by 90% and average delay increases ten-fold in a severe shadowing environment (/spl sigma/=8 dB) compared to no shadowing. However, by introducing an outage probability of 0.05 as opposed to serving all the mobiles, the average system throughput can be increased six-fold and the average delay can be reduced by about 80% in such channel conditions. We analyze the trade-off between the throughput and delay performance of the system and the operating point of the outage. We consider two modes of transmission: a uni-access mode in which only one user is allowed to access the channel at a time, and a multi-access mode in which multiple users are allowed. We compare the performance of four scheduling schemes such as round-robin and fastest-first schemes that are appropriate for the uni-access mode, and equal-rate and equal-weight schemes that are for multi-access mode transmission. Simulation results show that the system employing the uni-access mode schemes performs better than one with multi-access mode schemes in terms of the average delay, and performs worse in terms of fair allocation of data rates.	scheduling (computing)	Rath Vannithamby;Elvino S.

Inter-cell interference has been shown to be the main limiting factor at high altitudes. Using a realistic 3D simulator model, with real base station locations, this study confirms that UAVs at high altitudes suffer from significant interference, resulting in a worse coverage compared to ground users. When replacing the existing base stations by mmWave cells, our results indicate that ground coverage is decreased to only 90%, while UAVs just above rooftop level have a coverage probability of 100%. However, UAVs at higher altitude still suffer from excessive interference. Beamforming has the potential to improve mmWave link budget and to decrease interference and is for this reason a promising technology for ensuring connectivity to aerial users.

1f5932a6bd7f599956e01e81ab4b4ff3c77fcbe2	machine learning based channel modeling for molecular mimo communications		In diffusion-based molecular communication, information particles locomote via a diffusion process, characterized by random movement and heavy tail distribution for the random arrival time. As a result, the molecular communication shows lower transmission rates than the traditional communication. To compensate for such low rates, researchers have recently proposed the molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique. Although channel models exist for single-input single-output (SISO) systems for some simple environments, extending the results to multiple molecular emitters complicates the modeling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning technique for modeling the molecular MIMO channel and confirm the effectiveness via extensive numerical studies.	channel (communications);mimo;machine learning;numerical analysis;soft-in soft-out decoder;time of arrival;transmitter;x.690	Changmin Lee;Huseyin Birkan Yilmaz;Chan-Byoung Chae;Nariman Farsad;Andrea J.

With CSI feedback from relay to sources, allocating the number of channel uses is sufficient to match the performance of power allocation. However, power control is instrumental to efficiently exploit CSI feedback from sources to relay.	channel state information;digital monetary trust;duplex (telecommunications);multiplexing;relay;transmitter	Thanh Tùng Kim;H.

When used on the downlink of multi-user MIMO systems with multiple-antenna mobiles, this algorithm achieves significantly better performance than the ZF criterion based pre-processing and joint transmitter-receiver processing algorithms known in the literature, because it successfully constrains the transmitted power increase and effectively utilizes the processing capabilities of the mobiles.

Although it is not directly specified, it is expected in practice to use cross-polarized 2×2 MIMO (i.e., horizontal and vertical polarization) to retain multiplexing capabilities in line-of-sight conditions. MIMO allows overcoming the channel capacity limit of single antenna wireless communications in a given channel bandwidth without any increase in the total transmission power. But in the U.S. MIMO can actually provide a larger comparative gain because it would be allowed to increase the total transmit power, by transmitting the nominal transmit power in each polarization. Hence, in addition to the MIMO gains (array, diversity, and spatial multiplexing), MIMO could exploit an additional 3 dB power gain. The MIMO scheme adopted in ATSC 3.0 re-uses the single-input single-output antenna baseline constellations, and hence it introduces the use of MIMO with non-uniform constellations.	atsc 3.0;atsc standards;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);broadcast television systems;channel (communications);channel bonding;channel capacity;data rate units;digital video broadcasting;forward error correction;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hadamard transform;line code;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;polarization (waves);power gain;radio frequency;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;spatial multiplexing gain;terrestrial television;transmitter	David Gomez-Barquero;David Vargas;Manuel Fuentes;Peter Klenner;Sangchul Moon;Jin-Yong Choi;Daniel Schneider;Kenichi Murayama	2016	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2015.2505399	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;gain;computer science;engineering;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;precoding;multiplexing;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	27.87500587107533	81.28602296016678	73051

Both designs are easy to construct and suitable for small mobile devices. By using light emitting diodes for both illumination and data transmission, our receiver designs consist of multiple photodetectors (PDs), which are oriented with different inclination angles to achieve high-rank MIMO channels and can be closely packed without the requirement of spatial separation. Due to the orientations of the PDs, the proposed receiver designs are named pyramid receiver (PR) and hemispheric receiver (HR). In a PR, the normal vectors of PDs are chosen the same as the normal vectors of the triangle faces of a pyramid with equilateral N-gon base. On the other hand, the idea behind HR is to evenly distribute the PDs on a hemisphere. Through analytical investigation, simulations and experiments, the channel capacity and bit-error-rate (BER) performance under various settings are presented to show that our receiver designs are practical and promising for enabling VLC-MIMO. In comparison to induced link-blocked receiver, our designs do not require any hardware adjustment at the receiver from location to location so that they can support user mobility. Besides, their channel capacities and BER performance are quite close to that of link-blocked receiver. Meanwhile, they substantially outperform spatially-separated receiver. This study reveals that using angle diversity to build VLC-MIMO system is very promising.	bit error rate;boyce–codd normal form;channel capacity;diode;experiment;gon;lattice boltzmann methods;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mobile device;multiplexing;simulation;transmitter;vlc media player;x.690	Asanka Nuwanpriya;Siu-Wai Ho;Chung Shue Chen	2015	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2015.2432514	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;channel capacity;wireless;statistics;mimo;light-emitting diode	Mobile	36.25371791799981	75.66741939736141	73070
212322ce2caf6a61ccbb79431d0d3254948a61ab	uplink resource allocation in cellular systems: an energy-efficiency perspective		In this work we address the problem of optimal resource allocation in the uplink of a wireless cellular network with Rayleigh fading channels, where the aim is to minimize the average total energy spent for packet delivery. The devices are assumed to transmit over orthogonal resources where the total energy used for each resource is modeled as the sum of the transmit energy and an overhead circuit energy. We first derive the optimal allocation for the single-user case when varying our assumptions on both the Channel State Information available at the transmitter and the Automatic Repeat reQuest capabilities. Then, we generalize the analysis to the multi-user case and compare the results obtained for the different scenarios.	automatic repeat request;channel state information;condition number;mathematical optimization;multi-user;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);simulation;social inequality;telecommunications link;transmitter	Andrea Biral;Howard C.

870662ab07ee03c70f5640d3e50de32e3fc84a59	an efficient method for avoiding shadow fading maps in system level simulations		In system-level simulations of wireless communication systems, shadow fading is commonly modeled by spatial autocorrelation. Currently, shadow fading values are generated using a shadow fading map, which rasterizes the region of interest. This map is commonly generated at its full extent, although only a small part of it may be needed. In this paper we propose an approach for generating shadow fading maps that is also capable of generating single shadow fading values. This is achieved by generalizing the shadow fading map to an N -dimensional array of correlated random variables, which is generated by applying a coloring transformation, in form of linear filtering, to an array of uncorrelated random variables. Moreover, in the paper we will also discuss the feasibility of this approach and its application for generating correlated variables over a continuous curve in space.	autocorrelation;computer simulation;graph coloring;map;raster graphics;region of interest;spatial analysis	Thomas Dittrich;Martin Taranetz;Markus Rupp	2017			fading;mathematical optimization;computer science;shadow	Robotics	38.09846118459841	76.36323942467631	73157

However, the performance of this collaborative communication is sensitive to spectrum sensing accuracy and the unpredictable activities of PUs. To quantify the impact of these factors, this article studies the performance of amplify and forward based incremental relaying (IR) in an opportunistic spectrum sharing environment. Using rigorous mathematical analysis, closed form expressions are derived for the average spectral efficiency and the outage probability. The derived results show that imperfect spectrum sensing and the unpredictable activities of PUs degrade the quality of the direct link and thwart the relay from assisting the destination, hence causing significant performance losses. To recover some of these losses, this article proposes a novel selective IR protocol that allows the source to retransmit whenever the relay fails to assist the destination. Hence, creating a second chance of assistance. This protocol is shown to outperform IR while not sacrificing spectral efficiency. Computer simulations are used to verify the accuracy of the derived results.	agile software development;assistive technology;catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;downtime;ibm systems network architecture;inline linking;interference (communication);relay;simulation;spectral efficiency;sun outage	Ala Abu Alkheir;Mohamed Ibnkahla	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4373-2	computer science;computer network;real-time computing;outage probability;cognitive radio;relay;expression (mathematics);spectral efficiency	Mobile	35.248277053524525	81.30328326945185	73253

In addition to assessing the effect of the interference between pairs of technologies, we also analyzed the simultaneous interference among the three systems, a scenario that has never been studied before.

650ab5c844e5f6ccb19856adf28cf37f212d974a	stability and throughput of random access with cs-based mud for mtc		Recently, compressive random access has been considered for machine-type communications (MTC) as it has a potential to support massive connectivity by exploiting the sparsity of device activity. However, its performance limitations are not well studied yet compared with other well-known candidates for MTC, e.g., multichannel ALOHA. In this paper, we investigate the stability of compressive random access with a controlled access probability strategy under ideal conditions, and derive the maximum stable throughput, which shows that the maximum stable throughput of compressive random access is higher than that of multichannel ALOHA by a factor of 2. We also carry out simulations to see the performance of compressive random access under more realistic conditions with low-complexity multiuser detection (MUD) algorithms. Based on analysis and simulation results, we can claim that compressive random access can support more devices than conventional multichannel ALOHA and is well-suited for MTC.	algorithm;mud;multi-user;random access;simulation;sparse matrix;throughput	Jinho Choi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2770171	throughput;multiuser detection;computer network;aloha;computer science;random access	Mobile	30.05393723594048	87.36899853400308	73429

However, the benefits of multi-user (MU) MIMO highly rely on an accurate channel knowledge at the transmitter. So proper codebook design is a key problem for LTE-A FDD downlink system. In this paper, the channel characteristic specific to cross-polarized linear antenna array is analyzed, then its codebook design based on amplitude and phase adjustment is proposed for LTE-A downlink system. The proposed codebooks are compared to the differential scheme [7] on the average cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge user spectral efficiency evaluated through system level simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed codebooks significantly improve channel feedback efficiency and system performance.	codebook;compaq lte;mimo;multi-user;overhead (computing);polarization (waves);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter	Lu Wu;Jinhui Chen;Hongwei Yang;Di Lu	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092989	spectrum;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;cross-polarized wave generation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;computer performance;antenna array;statistics;spectral efficiency;mimo	Mobile	27.864149501815493	82.93798514631182	73457

Among the joint transmission designs for base station (BS) cooperation, the linear joint transmissions with per-base power constraint is preferred due to its computational simplicity and reality. However, since the transmissions with per-base power constraint sometimes make BSs cannot fully utilize their usable power, it leads considerable capacity loss. In this paper, we propose a BS selection technique for MMSE joint transmitter in downlink cooperative MIMO system to relive the inefficient usage of power under per-base power constraint. To find the BS group which yields the highest capacity, we compare the system capacity of all the possible BS groups. Simulation results show that the BS selection significantly improves the system capacity compared to the conventional linear joint transmissions by overcoming the aforementioned power allocation problem.	capacity loss;channel capacity;cooperative mimo;interference (communication);simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Namjeong Lee;Keonkook Lee;Eunhye Nam;Sunhyoung Kwon;Joonhyuk Kang;Gye-Tae Gil	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917607	cellular network;niobium;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;base station;control theory;co-channel interference;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;channel capacity;mimo	Mobile	37.295216890466854	85.47555713394657	73521

This requires new advanced channel models, which need to be verified by real-world channel sounding measurements. In this context the reliable estimation and tracking of the model parameters from measurement data is of particular interest. In this paper, we build a state-space model, and track the propagation parameters with the Extended Kalman Filter in order to capture the dynamics of the channel parameters in time. We then extend the model by considering first order derivatives of the geometrical parameters, which enhances the tracking performance due to improved prediction and robustness against shadowing and fading. The model also includes the effect of distributed diffuse scattering in radio channels. The issue of varying state variable dimension, i.e., the number of propagation paths to track, is also addressed. The performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated using both simulated and measured data.	algorithm;automatic sounding;extended kalman filter;propagation constant;simulation;software propagation;state space	Jussi Salmi;Andreas Richter;Visa Koivunen	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;simulation;geography;telecommunications;radio propagation model;fading	Robotics	26.607091957365615	77.381466120339	73556

For a given transmit power constraint, those points on the boundary of the capacity region can be regarded as the set of optimal operational points. The present work addresses the problem of selecting the point within this set that satisfies given constraints on the ratios between rates achieved by the different users in the network. This problem is usually known as rate balancing. To this end, the optimum iterative approach for general MIMO channels is revisited and adapted to an OFDM transmission scheme. Specifically, an algorithm is proposed that exploits the structure of the OFDM channel and whose convergence speed is essentially insensitive to the number of subcarriers. This is in contrast to a straightforward extension of the general MIMO algorithm to an OFDM scheme. Still, relatively high complexity and the need of a time-sharing policy to reach certain rates are at least two obstacles for a practical implementation of the optimum solution. Based on a novel decomposition technique for broadcast channels a suboptimum non-iterative algorithm is introduced that does not require time-sharing and very closely approaches the optimum solution.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;emoticon;entropy (information theory);iteration;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;random graph;social inequality;subcarrier;time-sharing;weight function	Pedro Tejera;Wolfgang Utschick;Josef A.

The achievable throughput under such constraints is captured by the effective capacity formulation. It is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed for transmission. Under this assumption, a recent result on the channel coding rate in the finite blocklength regime is incorporated into the analysis, and the throughput achieved with such codes in the presence of queueing constraints and decoding errors is identified. The performance of different transmission strategies (e.g., variable-rate, variable-power, and fixed-rate transmissions) is studied. Interactions and tradeoffs between the throughput, queueing constraints, coding blocklength, decoding error probabilities, and signal-to-noise ratio are investigated, and several conclusions with important practical implications are drawn.	throughput	M.

A closed form expression for the pairwise error probability is derived which leads to design criteria for full diversity and coding gain. Furthermore, the power distribution between the source and relay units is introduced as a design parameter. Fixed power distribution allocation has the potential of improving performance with no increase in the system complexity. Several techniques for improving the coding gain are given based on the power distribution during the cooperation phase of the transmission. As an example, the (1,7/5) convolutional code was considered. Simulation results for this example show that a 1 dB performance gain can be achieved by modifying the power distribution of the source and relay. For the code considered, the equal power allocation method most commonly used gave the worst performance. The best performance was achieved when the source was silent during the cooperation phase. This observation simplifies protocol design.	asymptotic equipartition property;channel (communications);coding gain;communications protocol;convolutional code;decibel;pairwise error probability;programming paradigm;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Paul Lusina;Robert Schober;Lutz H.-J.

In the modern day of communication systems, the energy harvesting (EH) technique is considered as a promising technology to design more energy efficient communication systems. Integrating VLC with the EH technology in wireless networks guaranties the reliability of these networks. In this paper, we consider a dual-hop VLC/RF wireless communication, composed of two Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and two receivers, assisted by a decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system operating with EH in order to boost the coverage of VLC systems. Using successive interference cancellation, we derive achievable rates of both users. Afterwards, we determine the achievable rate-region for this communication system where we show that this region can take four shapes depending on the communication scenario. Then, we formulate the achievable rate-region maximization problem, and we develop solution to find the optimal design for the EH time switching protocol. Further, we show that EH enhances the performance of the communication system in a certain regime of its initial power. We finally present selected numerical result to verify the analytic results.	bell laboratories layered space-time;diode;direction finding;exception handling;expectation–maximization algorithm;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);numerical analysis;optimal design;radio frequency;relay;vlc media player	Mohamed Ridha Zenaidi;Zouheir Rezki;Mohamed M.

Good trend correspondence is observed between the averaged error rate results of experiment and simulation, when zero forcing (ZF) detection is employed and a simple constraint on the average power per relay is used. The challenges of relaying a regenerated digital header and simply amplified spatially multiplexed payload are discussed. It is proven theoretically that the effect of the growth of the number of fixed-gain relays is to bring the destination into the location of the relays. For the case of variable gain, subject to a per-node average power constraint, the destination is also brought asymptotically closer, but not as close as the fixed-gain. However, the gap is approximately closed by allowing relays to deactivate if their gain exceeds a threshold.	anisotropic filtering;commercial software;constraint algorithm;experiment;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;relay;simulation;transceiver;variable-gain amplifier;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Qiongjie Lin;Yong Jun Chang;Feng Wang;Mary Ann Weitnauer	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2014.6881168	3g mimo;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Robotics	38.39211453179104	81.80073028288702	73954

Cochannel interference for the proposed cellular architecture is considered and analyzed. An analytic expression for the proposed method is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides better signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio than the existing cochannel interference reduction methods. A significant reduction of cochannel interference is achieved compared to sectoring and omnidirectional architectures in the proposed microzoning architecture.

The distributed NOSTM signal is firstly proposed based on unitary space-time modulation (USTM) and spatial multiplexing (SM). The dynamic DF relaying protocol is investigated to process the non-orthogonal feature of the NOSTM signal. A Raptor-coded distributed scheme is then constructed for the relay network, and the corresponding transmission and reception procedures are also investigated. It is shown that the throughput performance can be effectively improved, especially for cases when the location of the chosen relay nodes is distant from the source node.	direction finding;modulation;relay;spatial multiplexing;throughput	Yen-Ming Chen;Wei-Min Lai;Yeong-Luh Ueng	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108307	spatial multiplexing;mimo;electronic engineering;throughput;computer science;spacetime;modulation;space time;relay	Mobile	34.3393688896424	77.1854409584091	74336

Since both links operate at vastly different carrier frequencies, we model the hybrid channel as a pair of parallel channels. Moreover, since the FSO channel signals at a higher rate than the RF channel, we incorporate this key feature in the parallel channel model. Both channels experience fading due to scintillation, which is slow compared to typical signalling rates. Under this framework, we study the fundamental limits of the hybrid channel. In particular, we analyse the outage probability in the large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and obtain the outage diversity or SNR exponent of the hybrid system. First we consider the case when only the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSIR case), and obtain the exponents for general scintillation distributions. These exponents relate key system design parameters to the asymptotic outage performance and illustrate the benefits of using hybrid systems with respect to independent FSO or RF links. We next consider the case when perfect CSI is known at both the receiver and transmitter, and derive the optimal power allocation strategy that minimises the outage probability subject to peak and average power constraints. The optimal solution involves non-convex optimisation, which is intractable in practical systems. We therefore propose a suboptimal algorithm that achieves significant power savings (on the order of tens of dBs) over uniform power allocation. We show that the suboptimal algorithm has the same diversity as the optimal power allocation strategy.	algorithm;carrier wave;channel (communications);channel state information;convex function;convex optimization;downtime;hybrid system;information theory;key;large-signal model;mathematical optimization;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage;systems design;transmitter	Nick Letzepis;Khoa D.

5761a054bcfe271838211c33cb0c4204b1b453f4	3d mimo outdoor-to-indoor propagation channel measurement		The 3-D multiple-input multiple-output (3-D MIMO) systems have received great interest recently because of the spatial diversity advantage and capability for full-dimensional beamforming, making them promising candidates for practical realization of massive MIMO. In this paper, we present a low-cost test equipment (channel sounder) and post-processing algorithms suitable for investigating the 3-D MIMO channels as well as the results from a measurement campaign for obtaining elevation and azimuth characteristics in an outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) environment. Due to limitations in available antenna switches, our channel sounder consists of a hybrid switched/virtual cylindrical array with effectively 480 antenna elements at the base station. The virtual setup increased the overall MIMO measurement duration, thereby introducing phase drift errors in the measurements. Using reference antenna measurements, we estimate and correct for the phase errors during post-processing. We provide the elevation and azimuth angular spreads for the measurements done in an urban macro-cellular and urban micro-cellular environments, and study their dependence on the user equipment (UE) height. Based on the measurements done with UE placed on different floors, we study the feasibility of separating users in the elevation domain. The measured channel impulse responses are also used to study the channel hardening aspects of the massive MIMO and the optimality of the maximum ratio combining receiver.	algorithm;angularjs;beamforming;built-in test equipment;channel (communications);mimo;network switch;software propagation;video post-processing	Vinod Kristem;Seun Sangodoyin;C.

The system consists of a software-defined radio (SDR) platform, and a pattern reconfigurable antenna mounted on a hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). First, the system design aspects of the tesbed are described. The performance of the reconfigurable antenna is characterized through radiation pattern measurements while the antenna is mounted on the underbelly of the UAV. A low complexity reinforcement learning based adaptive antenna selection algorithm is implemented on the aerial SDR testing platform to enhance the link quality. We present SNR measurements obtained during various indoor and outdoor flight scenarios. The results show that utilizing a reconfigurable antenna and intelligent antenna selection strategy onboard a UAV provides a higher mean SNR compared to an omni-directional antenna in both line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) scenarios, and is more resilient to co-channel interference.

A secondary (unlicensed) link is also active in the same band and can access the channel through a spectrum leasing (SL) mechanism, whereby the primary system grants transmission opportunities to the secondary link. This paper investigates the possibility that the secondary link gains access to the channel, to transmit its own data, by cooperating with the primary link via interference mitigation. Specifically, SL is enabled if the interfering signal is decoded by the secondary link and is forwarded to the primary link to allow for interference mitigation. The SL decision at the primary link hinges on whether the advantage accrued from interference mitigation by allowing secondary transmissions overcome the loss of spectral resources due to SL. This form of primary-secondary cooperation contrasts with previously proposed approaches to SL, whereby the secondary user gains credit by forwarding the primary packet, and not the knowledge of interference to the primary receiver (PR). A SL scheme is proposed that leverages the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmission processes at primary and interfering links. Numerical results demonstrate conditions under which the proposed approach based on interference forwarding outperforms more conventional techniques based on primary packet relaying.	hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);network packet;retransmission (data networks);sl (complexity)	Tariq Elkourdi;Osvaldo Simeone	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2231971	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;co-channel interference;radio receiver;automatic repeat request;computer network	Mobile	35.16707098696422	84.87245163583758	75323

A condition is introduced to maximize the upper bound of the overall received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The relay nodes which have bad channel conditions are excluded in turn from the cooperation so that their released resources can be reallocated to other nodes. This paper adopts a simplified power allocation scheme that assumes each selected relay has equal power. The total power is optimally assigned between the source and the relay set. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve similar BER performance with the scheme which employs all relays and optimal power allocation, but only applies a subset of available relays.

Frequent inter-layer reselections and handovers should be minimized when dealing with high-speed users by taking into account both user speeds and relative cell sizes. In this paper we propose a simple User Equipment (UE) speed estimation algorithm for application in mobility-aware cell reselection and handover strategies in Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless networks where Self-Organising Networks (SON) are intended to play a key role. The suitability of mobility-aware RRM strategies based on the exchange of speed and cell size information between terminals and base stations is analysed. A simple structure for speed detection is proposed that relies on the analysis of the downlink Doppler spread spectrum. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm is accurate enough for performing advanced RRM techniques based on user speed.	algorithm;compaq lte;computer simulation;filter (signal processing);radio resource management;relative change and difference;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;telecommunications link;velocity (software development)	J.

For the practically important best-M scheme, in which each user feeds back only its M strongest subchannels and their indices to the base station (BS), we derive a throughput-optimal rate adaptation policy that enables the BS to assign rates to the subchannels of every user. We present it in closed-form for the widely used exponential correlation model. The novelty of the policy lies in its exploitation of the structure of the information fed back by the best-M scheme and the correlation among subchannel gains. We also present a near-optimal, lower computational complexity approach. In effect, our approach facilitates rate adaptation and scheduling by the BS even on subchannels that are not fed back by a user due to feedback constraints.

We consider the problem of maximizing the EE with respect to (M, K) for a fixed sum spectral efficiency. Through analysis, we study the impact of system parameters on the optimal EE. System parameters consists of the average channel gain to the users and the power consumption parameters (PCPs) (e.g., power consumed by each RF antenna/ receiver at BS). When the average user channel gain is high or else the BS/UT design is power inefficient, our analysis reveals that it is optimal to have a few BS antennas and a single user, i.e., nonmassive MIMO regime. Similarly, when the channel gain is small or else the BS/UT design is power efficient, it is optimal to have a larger (M, K), i.e., massive MIMO regime. Tight analytical bounds on the optimal EE are proposed for both these regimes. The impact of the system parameters on the optimal EE is studied, and several interesting insights are drawn.	mimo;radio frequency;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transceiver;ut-vpn;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Saif K.

caed664afab36eecbdbc7ca2c7c72fd248f02f03	spatial and time domain model for laa/wi-fi coexistence		In Release 13 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project standard, the deployment of long-term evolution (LTE)/ LTE-advanced to the unlicensed spectrum called licensed-assisted access (LAA) was introduced to satisfy the high demand of traffic data with a new type of services mostly multimedia streams. The unlicensed spectrum is a shared resource between different radio access terminals such as Wi-Fi and radar system, and listen before talk (LBT) in LTE side makes this coexistence possible. In this letter, we propose a new framework to model and evaluate the performance of LAA/Wi-Fi coexistence based on marked Poisson point process (MPPP) and Markov chain model. The proposed model captures the back-off procedure in the spatial and time domain to provide a more realistic analysis of the channel busy probability and the signal to interference plus noise ratio coverage probability. Numerical results show the validity of the proposed model with the overestimation of the LAA and Wi-Fi nodes density in MPPP model.	coexist (image);compaq lte;domain analysis;domain model;interference (communication);markov chain;numerical analysis;point process;radar;software deployment;telecommunications link	Amsatou Mbengue;Yongyu Chang	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2854556	real-time computing;computer science;streams;spectrum management;computer network;radar;time domain;markov chain;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;communication channel;markov process	Metrics	26.681208574919975	86.0179612114802	75608
c055a1169e842c947a03601a99b92921e60e22ef	multi-cell cooperation using subcarrier-cooperative two-way amplify-and-forward relaying		We consider two-way communication between multiple MIMO transceiver pairs that is assisted by non-regenerative half-duplex two-way relays. A generalized system model is formulated in which an arbitrary number of multi-antenna relays can make use of symbol extensions in frequency, e.g. OFDM subcarriers. In contrast to conventional approaches, the relays can forward arbitrary linear combinations of their receive symbols in the spatial as well as frequency domain. We apply a closed form zero-forcing approach to orthogonalize the different transceiver pairs and compare simple heuristic power allocation with numerically optimized relay gain allocation schemes. Based on simulation results, we study the advantages of cooperation between subcarriers to improve the sum rate of two-way relaying. Furthermore, we show how such a two-way relaying scheme can beneficially be implemented in a cellular network.	anisotropic filtering;backhaul (telecommunications);channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);heuristic;kernel (linear algebra);mimo;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;relay;simulation;subcarrier;transceiver;zero-forcing precoding	Raphael Rolny;Marc Kuhn;Aditya Umbu Tana Amah;Armin Wittneben	2013			mimo;frequency domain;real-time computing;computer science;subcarrier;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;transceiver;distributed computing;system model;relay;cellular network	ECom	38.31325624758007	87.0158547022331	75680

Different from prior works, we assume that the PU can be located anywhere inside an arbitrarily-shaped convex network region. Using the moment generating function (MGF) of the interference from a random SU, we derive general expressions for the n-th moment and the n-th cumulant of the aggregate interference for guard zone and multiple-threshold SU activity protocols. Using the cumulants, we study the convergence of the distribution of the aggregate interference to a Gaussian distribution. In addition, we compare the well-known closed-form distributions in the literature to approximate the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the aggregate interference. Our results show that care must be undertaken in approximating the aggregate interference as a Gaussian distribution, even for a large number of SUs, since the convergence is not monotonie in general. In addition, the shifted lognormal distribution provides the overall best CCDF approximation, especially in the distribution tail region, for arbitrarily-shaped network regions.	aggregate data;approximation algorithm;catastrophic interference;cognitive network;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);one-class classification;superuser;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jing Guo;Salman Durrani;Xiangyun Zhou	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036933	normal distribution;communications protocol;combinatorics;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference;fading;statistics;computer network	Arch	29.595844103346753	85.72164496741775	75874

The two belt-head and belt-chest channels are compared, where, belt, refers to the transmitter’s location, while the second part refers to the receiver location. The on-body channel model is constructed by using the Rice factor, the path loss, the shadowing deviation as well as the correlation matrice extracted from an intensive measurement campaign in the 2.45 GHz band. Unlike the conventional wireless models, different pathloss and Ricean factor values are evaluated and assigned for each spatial on-body subchannel in order to characterize the different statistical properties noted in the subchannels. This results in a good agreement with the measured channel. Furthermore, the maximum achievable capacity is investigated with the classic uniform power and the waterfilling schemes. It is shown that at the low SNR range, the waterfilling scheme yields a higher capacity performance, whilst similar performance is achieved with both schemes at high SNR values.	channel (communications);digital subchannel;mimo;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;while	Khalida Ghanem;Peter S.

In an exemplary environment we arrange three mobile terminals in an equilateral triangle. These mobile terminals determine their position relatively to each other by transmitting and receiving mobile radio signals. In addition they observe a signal of opportunity which is emitted from a transmitter. In our case this signal is a single carrier. We evaluate the performance improvement for positioning of the mobile terminals when observing such a signal of opportunity. The evaluation is based on the calculation of the Cramér-Rao lower bound. For an exemplary environment with three mobile terminals and one signal of opportunity a performance gain of up to ≈ 38.8 % can be expected theoretically.	cr rao advanced institute of mathematics, statistics and computer science;mobile phone;transmitter	Armin Dammann;Stephan Sand;Ronald Raulefs	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;radio;remote radio head	Mobile	26.30599310267339	80.83959286453833	75979

Assume that each transmitter is equipped with t antennas and the receivers with r antennas, we show that in the absence of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, the asymptotic network throughput is limited by r nats/s/Hz as K/spl rarr//spl infin/. With CSI corresponding to the desired receiver available at the transmitter, we demonstrate that an asymptotic throughput of t+r+2/spl radic/tr nats/s/Hz can be achieved using a simple beamforming approach. Further, we show that the asymptotically optimal transmission scheme with CSI amounts to a single-user waterfilling for a properly scaled channel.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;hoc (programming language);mimo;multi-user;network address translation;throughput;transceiver;transmitter	Biao Chen;M.

This paper reports on extensive continuous wave (CW) and wideband measurements performed at four carrier frequencies: 1.44275 GHz, 6.7 GHz, 14.72 GHz and 22.025 GHz. Measurements were carried out in the Montreal metropolitan and suburban areas with both transmitter and receiver stationary. The transmitter was located outside on the rooftop of a high rise building and the receiver inside another building. The receiver was then moved for each new set of measurements such that a whole room was covered in a grid-like fashion. Results from the temporal experiments show, that for the suburban area, the amplitude distributions are lognormal-distributed. The urban area presents more Ricean-distributed amplitude data. The data for the spatially-distributed case also showed that for the suburban and urban areas, the local means of the fluctuations are well described by a Nakagami distribution.	ultra high frequency	Daniel Lacroix;Charles L.

Three multihop relay strategies for NFMIC are proposed: Non Line of Sight Magnetic Induction Relay (NLoS-MI Relay), Non Line of Sight Master/Assistant Magnetic Induction Relay1 (NLoS-MAMI Relay1) and Non Line of Sight Master/Assistant Magnetic Induction Relay2 (NLoSMAMI Relay2). In the first approach only one node contributes to the communication, while in the other two techniques (which are based on a master-assistant strategy), two relaying nodes are employed. This paper shows that these three techniques can be used to overcome the problem of dead spots within a body area network and extend the communication range without increasing the transmission power and the antenna size or decreasing receiver sensitivity. The impact of the separation distance between the nodes on the achievable RSS and channel data rate is evaluated for the three techniques. It is demonstrated that the technique which is most effective depends on the specific network topology. Optimum selection of nodes as relay master and assistant based on the location of the nodes is discussed. The paper also studies the impact of the quality factor on achievable data rate. It is shown that to obtain the highest data rate, the optimum quality factor needs to be determined for each proposed cooperative communication method.

In this paper, we derive an IPS upper bound in cognitive radio networks. The upper bound is tight when the number of primary user (PU) channels is large. We discover that the IPS upper bound is determined by both the PU activity level and the transmission range of cognitive radios. When the PU activity level is below a certain threshold value, the IPS upper bound is achieved if cognitive radios transmit at their maximum transmission ranges. When the PU activity level is above the threshold, the cognitive radios have to use a smaller transmission range to reach the IPS upper bound. In addition, we also provide a numerical method for computing the threshold value of PU activity level and the optimal transmission range for achieving the IPS upper bound. The correctness of our analysis is validated by simulations. Our work can provide important insights and guidelines for optimal secondary user placement in cognitive radio networks.	cognitive radio;correctness (computer science);ibm systems network architecture;numerical method;one-class classification;simulation;software propagation	Chuan Han;Yaling Yang	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683168	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Robotics	31.2637487073264	84.75670338397867	76511

A virtual array measurement scheme is investigated and used to generate SIMO channel impulse responses (CIRs) from single-antenna measurements in three typical HSR scenarios, including obstructed viaduct, deep cutting, and open station. According to the multi-antenna data, angle of arrival (AOA) is extracted using the Unitary ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters by the Rotational Invariance Techniques) algorithm, and is compared to the theoretical result. Power angular spectrum (PAS) and corresponding angular spread (AS) are provided, and the AS results in the three HSR scenarios are modeled and compared. These angular characteristics can fulfill the gap of multi-antenna channel models and provide the reference for the assessment of multi-antenna technologies in HSR scenarios.	algorithm;angle of arrival;angularjs;hierarchical state routing;mimo;performance evaluation;soft-in soft-out decoder;statistical model	Tao Zhou;Cheng Tao;Liu Liu;Hui Wen;Nan Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108206	rotational invariance;mimo;computer science;impulse (physics);electronic engineering;angular spectrum method;angle of arrival;communication channel	Visualization	26.477375861415336	78.81633566678593	76547

Most of proposed approaches rely mainly on the fact that cooperation at transmitter side alone seems to be much more powerful than receiver cooperation alone. The scenario that is analysed in this contribution includes the effect of interference of other clusters located closely that clearly degrades whatever cooperation type aforementioned. Under these circumstances, the use of additional sensors at receiver side helps creating a set of virtual beamformers, optimally designed to cancel the undesired signal. So, transmitter cooperation based on Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) strategies to minimize intra-cluster interference and virtual beamformers to minimize inter-cluster interference seems to be a very satisfactory combination.	beamforming;deferred procedure call;dummy variable (statistics);interference (communication);mimo;sensor;transmitter	Santiago Zazo;Ivana Raos;Benjamín Béjar Haro	2008	2008 16th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	37.635701485267894	83.88426615113555	76587

Using the effective propagation area method, the effective propagation region to be considered can be constructed from a given geographical database, and buildings that have a substantial effect on the total received power can be considered in a very efficient manner. In order to verify the predicted accuracy of the proposed model, the received power has been predicted for the real microcellular environment and compared with the published measurement. It is observed from the prediction results that the proposed model shows considerable improvement in computation speed and good agreement with the measurements. In addition, the effect of beam tilting on the path loss in an urban area is analyzed using the proposed model. It has been observed that beam downtilting can effectively confine the signal to the desirable home cell with reduced transmitting power, narrow half-power beam width (HPBW), and suitable fixed antenna height.

In this paper, we investigate challenges to the adoption of OFDM for use in lighting systems that support both intensity control and data communication based on the visible light communication (VLC) technology. In particular, we survey the requirements for energy efficiency, intensity control (dimming) and light-emitting diode (LED) driver integration in lighting systems. These requirements are mapped to contemporary and novel OFDM adaptations to show how both the lighting and communications needs can be met in dual-use scenarios while preserving both missions with reasonable performance.	clipping (signal processing);diode;dynamic range;frequency divider;modulation;oled;pulse-width modulation;quality of service;radio frequency;requirement;spectral efficiency;vlc media player;wavelength-division multiplexing;x.690	Thomas D.

In this paper, therefore, we derive closed-form expressions of the ergodic capacity and outage probability for amplify-and-forward GSC over independent and identically distributed Rayleigh channels. Monte-Carlo simulations are set up to corroborate the correctness of our theoretical analysis. The analytical and numerical results reveal that GSC is an effective way to combat the effect of outdated CSI. When using the perfect CSI, a full diversity on the number of all cooperating relays K is available. With the outdated CSI, where the performance of the conventional opportunistic relaying drastically degrades and its diversity order is limited to 1 (i.e., no diversity), a diversity order on the number of selected relays N can still be achieved. However, the performance gain on the diversity comes at the price of sacrifice in the spectral efficiency.	channel capacity;channel state information;correctness (computer science);downtime;end-to-end principle;ergodicity;gsc bus;generalized selection;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Wei Jiang;Hanwen Cao;Thomas Kaiser	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952118	telecommunications;cooperative diversity	Metrics	36.393252109560855	79.85082617996842	77018

In all cases, it is shown that the significant parameter is the coefficient of variation of power density. We give the relation between the error on the estimation of local average power density and the number of independent points that are used in the averaging process.

fdf2f1517cd751a05dfda92453c047165b84a006	achievable data rate of coordinated multi-point transmission for visible light communications		This paper studies the sum data rate that a Visible Light Communication (VLC) system with multiple users can achieve when phosphor-converted white LED panels are used to provide illumination and communication simultaneously. Three different transmission schemes based on Asymmetrically Clipped Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) are considered to allocate the communication resources in each transmission point: Frequency Reuse (FR), Joint Transmission Coordinated Multi-Point (JT-CoMP), and a Hybrid combination of them. Since phosphor-converted white LEDs have a larger modulation bandwidth for blue optical wavelengths rather than green-yellow-red ones, the performance of each transmission method is also evaluated using a visible and/or blue light optical filter in front of the Photodetector (PD). When the transmission points apply FR, strong inter-cell interference results in high variability of the achievable data rate at different locations. On the other hand, when JT-CoMP is applied, a more homogeneous data rate coverage is achieved, reducing the peak data rate in the inner parts of the cells but improving notably the data rate in cell-edge areas.	data rate units;interference (communication);jt (visualization format);jt storage;modulation;multi-user;multiplexing;passive optical network;phosphor;rca spectra 70;spatial variability;uncompressed video;vlc media player	Alexis Alfredo Dowhuszko;Ana I.

It provides diversity by emulating multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system for devices that are spatially too small to harbor multiple antennas. Conventional cooperative protocols such as amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) attain diversity gain at a cost of reduced spectral efficiency which becomes a cause for reduced throughput. To fight this reduction in throughput different approaches can be implemented. In this paper, adaptive modulation in conjunction with optimal power allocation is applied both at the source and the relay. In the process, the bit error rate (BER) at the destination, after performing optimal power allocation, is used as a constraint to determine the operating SNR regions of different M-QAM modulation types to be applied by the source and relay. Experimental results on AF strategy show that adaptive modulation with optimal power allocated BER as a constraint has better performance over the equal power allocated counterpart. The spectral efficiency and throughput performance differences become even higher when channel conditions worsen.	adaptive grammar;anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;cooperative mimo;data rate units;direction finding;emulator;input/output;modulation;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;x.690	Yihenew Wondie Marye;Hua-An Zhao	2014	2014 14th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2014.7011925	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;cooperative diversity;spectral efficiency;computer network	Metrics	36.52631744716026	85.73737413692909	77377
27480fb5f057aefa0b1ab669ebdb179ab6630ed6	subcarrier and power allocation for multiuser mimo-ofdm systems with various detectors		Radio resource allocation for multiuser multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems is an important issue to improve overall system performance. Although the achievable rate has been adopted for a performance indicator in most resource allocation schemes, it may not be practical if a nonideal receiver including a suboptimal detector is used instead of optimal one. Under this practical circumstance, we study the subcarrier and power allocation to minimize the average bit error rate (BER) subject to a total power constraint. Different allocation algorithms are proposed for various MIMO detectors such as the maximum likelihood (ML) detector, linear detectors and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector. We also propose suboptimal algorithms to reduce the complexity. Based on the simulation results, we can confirm that the proposed suboptimal algorithm for each detector can achieve a comparable performance with the optimal allocation with a much lower complexity.	algorithm;bell laboratories layered space-time;bit error rate;brute-force search;frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;memory management;multiplexing;numerical method;sensor;simplified instructional computer;simulation;subcarrier;x.690	Jing Mao;Chen Chen;Lin Bai;Haige Xiang;Jinho Choi	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.3837/tiis.2017.10.004	detector;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics;mimo	Embedded	37.307051388885164	87.44240910257567	77384

This paper focuses on coverage and downlink throughput performance, which are the most important criteria for assessing wireless data communication systems. The field trial results show that the base-station can communicate to a subscriber at a cell edge with a throughput of 1.5 Mbit/s assuming circular cells of 0.4 km2, 0.6 km2, and 1.7 km2 when the sector antenna heights are 19 m, 58 m, and 84 m, respectively. Therefore, it is considered that the MBWA system is suitable to provide a broadband mobile data communication service to subscribers in an urban area.	access network;experiment;frequency divider;interference (communication);low-density parity-check code;megabit;multiplexing;performance evaluation;r language;seamless3d;signal processing;software propagation;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput	Suguru Kameda;Hiroshi Oguma;Noboru Izuka;Yasuyoshi Asano;Yoshiharu Yamazaki;Noriharu Suematsu;Tadashi Takagi;Kazuo Tsubouchi	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems		throughput;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;antenna;signal-to-noise ratio;communications system;computer network;low latency	Mobile	26.581441194964473	82.34199979777637	77537

We consider a time-division duplex system where uplink training is required and an active eavesdropper can attack the training phase to cause pilot contamination at the transmitter. This forces the precoder used in the subsequent downlink transmission phase to implicitly beamform towards the eavesdropper, thus increasing its received signal power. We derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy rate for matched filter precoding and artificial noise (AN) generation at the transmitter when the number of transmit antennas goes to infinity. For the achievability scheme at hand, we obtain the optimal power allocation policy for the transmit signal and the AN in closed form. For the case of correlated fading channels, we show that the impact of the active eavesdropper can be completely removed if the transmit correlation matrices of the users and the eavesdropper are orthogonal. Inspired by this result, we propose a precoder null space design exploiting the low rank property of the transmit correlation matrices of massive MIMO channels, which can significantly degrade the eavesdropping capabilities of the active eavesdropper.	duplex (telecommunications);kernel (linear algebra);mimo;matched filter;multi-user;telecommunications link;transmitter	Yongpeng Wu;Robert Schober;Derrick Wing Kwan Ng;Chengshan Xiao;Giuseppe Caire	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248525	telecommunications;control theory	Robotics	35.971553777846026	83.20273490311504	77626

This work extends upon the discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) proposed in our prior work, where it was previously assumed that training signals can only be sent by the transmitter. The DCE design criterion is to minimize the channel estimation error at the LR while confining the channel estimation error at the UR above a minimum level. In the case of two-way training, training signals can first be transmitted on the reverse link to enable channel estimation at the transmitter and allow the transmitter to insert artificial noise (AN) along with the training signal in the forward link to disrupt the training at the UR, while minimizing the interference on the LR. The optimal power allocation between training and AN signals is devised for systems that are subject to both average and peak power constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed two-way training scheme when used in discriminating the performances between LR and UR.	authorization;channel state information;interference (communication);lr parser;mimo;numerical method;performance;telecommunications link;transmitter;ur, ur/web	Chao-Wei Huang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963481	transmitter;real-time computing;telecommunications;resource management	Mobile	35.982216504813245	83.78616653477401	77901

The RoFSO is broadband RF optical wireless communication link with fiber-optic technologies. It can provide universal platform for heterogeneous radio entrance network, in especially rural area with no fiber infrastructure. The developed RoFSO transceiver can directly connect multiple radio-on-fiber(RoF) signals from an optical fiber to the air, and can receive an optical signal from the air into a fiber core. One of issues in designing an FSO link including optical scintillation, new analysis model is proposed in order to estimate its variation speed. By using proposed model, scintillation speed and their variance in experimental results are presented. Finally, increasing FSO distance due to the optical power allocation among four DWDM optical sources for each radio services under the power limitation of eye safety regulation based on spectrum mask test in indoor short range experiment is presented.	core (optical fiber);fiber to the x;optical fiber;optical wireless;point-to-point (telecommunications);radio frequency;spectral mask;transceiver;wavelength-division multiplexing	Takeshi Higashino;Katsutoshi Tsukamoto;Shozo Komaki;Kamugisha Kazaura;Kazuhiko Wakamori;Mitsuji Matsumoto	2009	2009 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Innovations for Digital Inclusions		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Networks	24.638163734955356	80.74219807643402	78285

A two-dimensional Unitary ESPRIT algorithm is employed to give a high resolution estimation of AOA including both the azimuth and elevation angles of multipath components. The frequency dependence of AOA is investigated over the UWB frequency band. The multipath rays form clusters in both angular and temporal domains. Within a cluster the azimuth and elevation AOAs are determined to follow Laplacian and Gaussian distributions respectively. In the indoor environment considered, a typical cluster extends over an angular sector of approximately 14 degrees in azimuth and 9 degrees in elevation, with up to 5 clusters observed. We note that these propagation characteristics will allow UWB systems to utilise smart antennas or MIMO structures to improve overall throughput.	algorithm;angle of arrival;angularjs;bandwidth (signal processing);cluster analysis;external ray;frequency band;image resolution;laplacian matrix;mimo;multipath propagation;portable document format;smart antenna;software propagation;throughput;ultra-wideband	Yongwei Zhang;Anthony K.

In the first proposed protocol, the relay with the best mutual information relay path (source-relay-destination) will relay the source information¿thus termed as best-relay protocol. In the second proposed protocol, called N-relay cyclic protocol, each relay will transmit only a portion of the signal transmitted by the source. We derive the probability density functions of the mutual information for both of these protocols and using these densities, we analyze the outage probability and outage capacity performances. The results show that the proposed protocols achieve the maximum diversity order N + 1. The simulation results using turbo code are given and results show the superior performance of the best-relay protocol.	downtime;duplex (telecommunications);mutual information;performance;relay;simulation;turbo code	Tharmalingam Ratnarajah;Mathini Sellathurai;Zhiguo Ding	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394624	turbo code;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Arch	34.67686621442994	77.10656656305274	78633

acabad8444d3ffc2d932bf230c8e65be6db9fe69	power domain noma to support group communication in public safety networks		Abstract Power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receiver side has drawn great attention recently as a promising multiple-access scheme for next-generation (5G) mobile-communication systems. PD-NOMA utilizes the power domain for user multiplexing, which allows users to share resources to increase the system spectral efficiency, so as to improve system throughput. In this paper, we introduce an PD-NOMA application scenario, i.e., supporting group communication in public safety network. Because of the power-difference requirements of users in the PD-NOMA system, for the group communications, the number of users who can share these resources is limited; and the cryptographic keys thus cannot be distributed to user equipment efficiently. To solve this problem, we investigate combining PD-NOMA and spatial multiplexing technologies to meet the demand for high spectral efficiency. That is, we present a scheme for combining PD-NOMA with space shift keying (SSK) modulation, namely PD-NOMA-SSK, to help meet the demand for high spectral efficiency by exploiting the additional spatial domain. At the same time, we also suggest that the system throughput can be further enhanced by using PD-NOMA-SSK with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiplexing technology. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed schemes by comparing them with the conventional SSK and MIMO multiplexing schemes.	power domains	Xin Su;Aniello Castiglione;Christian Esposito;Chang Choi	2018	Future Generation Comp.

967d78ff1a2cb77b1fb08c4f0a491972c18dec4b	resource allocation for 3d drone networks sharing spectrum bands		This paper provides an appropriate allocation scheme of channel resources for drone communications. In recent years, the usage of drones has been increasing for a wide range of applications, and their communications require using additional frequency bands. However, their communications must avoid interference with primary users (e.g., radar systems) when they use additional frequency bands. We assume that their communications use two frequency bands, the main band and the backup band, to avoid interference. The proposed resource allocation method, which determines whether each drone should use the main or the backup bands, enables drone communications to use the main band efficiently without causing interference. For the proposed resource allocation scheme, this paper presents a stochastic geometry analysis of interference in drone networks. Based on the assumption that the distribution of drones follows a 3D Poisson point process, we analytically derive the radar's outage probability (OP) and the drone's OP. From these analyses, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the number of drones using the main band, since drones can transmit massive amounts of data by using the main band. Then, we numerically evaluate the solution of the optimization problem. Our results show that the maximum ratio of the number of drones using the main band to the total number of all drones increases along with the size of the primary exclusive region.	backup;exclusive or;frequency band;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;point process;radar;sun outage	Keiji Yoshikawa;Shota Yamashita;Koji Yamamoto;Takayuki Nishio;Masahiro Morikura	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287974	stochastic geometry;computer network;radar;drone;radio spectrum;real-time computing;computer science;backup;optimization problem;communication channel;resource allocation	Embedded	29.607395107365654	85.22468462619722	79927

We assume that perfect knowledge of the channel correlation is available at the receiver and find upper and lower bounds on the mutual information for Gaussian input signals. We prove that for a generic input covariance matrix, the gap between these two bounds at high transmit powers does not exceed a certain value, which depends on the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the receive correlation matrix. We also show that in a system with uncorrelated transmit antennas and correlated receive antennas and with uniform power distribution over the transmit antennas, these bounds are asymptotically tight for a large number of transmit antennas. We show that when the correlation information is available at the transmitter, the transmitting strategy that maximizes the mutual information lower bound is to transmit toward the directions of the eigenvectors of the transmit correlation matrix. We further derive upper and lower bounds on the mutual information of a MIMO multiple-access channel with imperfect channel estimation at the receiver. We also prove that when the input power at each user is uniformly distributed over its transmit antennas, the bounds on the mutual information are asymptotically tight for Gaussian input signals, and this tightness increases when the number of users increases. Numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate theoretical results.	channel state information;mimo;mutual information;numerical linear algebra;obedience (human behavior);rayleigh fading;simulation;transmitter	Leila Musavian;Mohammad Reza Nakhai;Mischa Dohler;Hamid Aghvami	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.898412	computer simulation;electronic engineering;spatial correlation;telecommunications;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;precoding;channel capacity;statistics	ML	38.725651768198865	75.08123461577571	79969

Assuming that nodes are homogeneously distributed according to Poisson point process, the authors find closed-form expressions of the outage probability and transmission capacity for the OR wireless networks. After this, they further derive the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for OR at finite signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and then find an upper bound of source node density to guarantee the diversity gain to be positive, that is, the outage probability of OR decreases as SNR grows. On the basis of these analyses, the authors find out the relay selection region where the transmission capacity of OR is better than that of direct transmission (DRT). The simulation results show that OR does not always perform better than DRT when the density of source nodes is large. In this case, we can improve the performance of OR by selecting the region of relays. In addition, the results show that DMT is degraded as the spatial correlation (interference) increases and OR cannot achieve full diversity order in the interfered network. Moreover, asymptotic analyses show that the proposed framework can also be used for the interference-free situation.	hoc (programming language);profiling (computer programming);relay	Yi Xu;Lei Shen;P.

Based on the moment generating function (MGF) approach, the exact ASEP expressions are derived for several modulation schemes. The exact closed-form OP expressions are also presented. Then, the ASEP and OP performance under different conditions are evaluated through numerical simulations to confirm the accuracy of the analysis. The simulation results show that the number of antennas, the fading coefficient, and the number of cascaded components have an important influence on the ASEP and OP performance.	profiling (computer programming)	Jingjing Wang;Lingwei Xu;Xinli Dong;Wei Shi;Qiuna Niu	2016	IJDSN	10.1155/2016/8495097	telecommunications	Mobile	37.543720008347066	78.69980667636413	80247

This method chooses the optimal code-to-user allocation for transmission between different combinations of the available signature waveforms according to the data to be transmitted at every symbol period by the base station (BS) at the downlink of a cellular code division multiple access (CDMA) system. The selection is done with the aim to minimise the destructive and maximize constructive interference between users. This effectively spreads the signal constellation and enhances the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver with no additional power-per-user investment. However, the trade-off to this is some extra side information. Theoretical analysis and simulations presented suggest that this method can provide a bit error rate reduction of an order of a magnitude when combined with multiuser detection.	bit error rate;code;ibm common user access;interference (communication);mud;mathematical optimization;modulation;multi-user;overhead (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;x.690	Emad Alsusa;Christos Masouros;Ulises Pineda Rico	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.171	code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	Embedded	38.41613696372552	86.04167980368496	80265

Different from multiple-input multiple-output systems, the channel matrix of the cooperative AF system is a function of the parameters to be optimized and hence water-filling over the square of the singular values is no longer optimal. Furthermore, given that the mutual information of the AF system is not a concave function, conventional optimization methods cannot be applied. Instead, by deriving and comparing all local solutions, we characterize the optimal input covariance matrix at the source and the optimal power allocation scheme at the relay that maximize the achievable rate. First, for the individual power constraint scenario, it is shown that the capacity of the AF system is achieved by either a direct transmission (DT) scheme, a non-orthogonal AF (NAF) beamforming (BF) protocol with a unit-rank covariance matrix, or a NAF system using a specific full-rank covariance matrix. Then, for the global power constraint scenario, it is shown that only a DT or a NAF-BF protocol can achieve the capacity. In both cases, orthogonal transmission is strictly suboptimal. The capacity of the AF system is finally analyzed for some concrete examples, such as under asymptotically high and low transmission powers and for several network models.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;brainfuck;concave function;duplex (telecommunications);mimo;mathematical optimization;mutual information;nato architecture framework;relay channel	Leonardo Jiménez Rodríguez;Nghi H.

All nodes are single-input single-ou tp t (SISO) and half-duplex, i.e., they cannot transmit and receive data simultaneously. The outage probability is ana lyzed and we show comparisons of outage probability with various scenarios under Rayleigh fading channel. Our resul ts how that the relay selection with EDDF and network coding (RS-EDDF&NC) scheme has the best performance in the s ense of outage probability upon the considered decode-and-forward (DF) relaying if there exist sufficient ly relays. In addition, the performance loss is large if we select a relay at random. This shows the importance of relay s election strategies.

I NTRODUCTION In recent years, cooperative communications have attracte d considerable interests and studies in communications. In cooperative communication networks, relay terminals sh are their antennas and other resources to create a virtual array through distributed transmission and signal process ing to against the fading arising from multipath propagatio n in wireless communications. Thus, cooperative communicat ion systems can be viewed as virtual multi-input multioutput (MIMO) systems and provide a space diversity. This fo rm f space diversity is called cooperative diversity (cf., user cooperation diversity of [1]). Hence, the diversity-m ultiplexing tradeoff (DMT) [2] framework can be adopted to Manuscript received January 31, 2016.

July 15, 2018 DRAFT 2 the cooperative communication systems for further perspec tive. Many well-known half-duplex cooperative protocols with single relay have been identified in the literature such as amplify-and-forward (AF), decode-and-forward (DF), selection DF (SDF), incremental AF (IAF) [3], distributed s pace-time coding (DSTC) [4], nonorthogonal AF (NAF), dynamic DF (DDF) [5], enhanced static DF (ESDF), enhanced DD F (EDDF) [6] and cooperative network coding (CNC) [7]. Moreover, the cooperative communications can ex tend many advanced topics such as beamforming [8], opportunistic relaying [9], cooperative relaying in ortho gonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) [10] and MIMO [11] systems. There are still many areas to be explored i n cooperative communications. In multi-relay cooperative communication systems, relays re usually assumed to transmit over orthogonal channels in order to avoid the interference. These orthogon al cooperation schemes result in low bandwidth efficiency as the number of relays increase. To overcome this problem, t here are various cooperative communications schemes which have been developed such as beamforming, opportunist ic relaying and DSTC. A. Related Work In [9], the authors proposed an opportunistic relaying prot oc l in which relays overhear the request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) packets exchanged between the sour ce and the destination before the data transmission. Then the optimal relay is selected by the selection criterio n according to the quality of source-relay and relaydestination links. This protocol can be easily implemented in a decentralized way. It was proved that with the same intermediate relays, the DF based on this protocol achieves th same DMT of the DSTC scheme in [4]. In [12], the authors further considered reactive and proactive rela y selection schemes. The authors proved that both reactive and proactive opportunistic DF relaying are outage-optima l. Moreover, the proactive strategy is much efficient since it can be viewed as energy-efficient routing in the network an d reduces the overhead of the system. In [13], the authors proposed two schemes: single relay selection with n etwork coding (S-RS-NC) and dual relay selection with network coding (D-RS-NC), and show that the D-RS-NC scheme o utperforms other considered RS schemes in two-way relay channels. More related studies about relay se lection are listed in [14]–[15]. B. Goal In our research, we would like to construct the system model o f EDDF scheme and network coding based on the relay selection criterion of [9] in a two-hop two-way multirelay network, which is named RS-EDDF&NC. We then analyze the outage probability of the system model and give n umerical results of outage probability with various scenarios under Rayleigh fading channel. C. Paper Outline The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II giv es the system model of relay selection with DDF and network coding, which is named RS-DDF&NC. We also derive the outage probability of the RS-DDF&NC system. In section III, we show the system model and analyze the outag e probability of the RS-EDDF&NC scheme. In section IV, we give numerical results of outage probability with various scenarios under Rayleigh fading channel. Conclusions are given in section V. July 15, 2018 DRAFT 3 II. RELAY SELECTION WITH DYNAMIC DECODE-AND-FORWARD AND NETWORK CODING SYSTEM A. System Model To construct our system model, we utilize a baseband-equiva lent, discrete-time channel model. For any two nodes X andY , we denote the channel coefficient from node X to nodeY ashX,Y , wherehX,Y ’s are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. Given the transmitted signal xk[n], assuming that E{|xk[n]|} = P for all n, wherek ∈ {a1, b1, c1}, c1 = a1⊕b1. We denotea1 andb1 as information bit streams of user A and user B, respectively . The subscript ‘1’ denotes that the information bit stream was encoded by using codebook 1. Noise at each receiver is assumed to be i.i.d. circularly sym metric complex Gaussian random variables CN(0, N0). We denote the noise at the node X during thenth symbol interval aswX [n]. We will first list some main assumptions then describe each phase of the system model for detail in the following subsections. B. Assumptions The main assumptions are as follows: 1) We consider a two-hop two-way relay network that consists of L relays. 2) All nodes are single-input single-output (SISO) and half -duplex. 3) Codewords transmitted from user A and user B both have the s ame frame duration of J symbol intervals. 4) The codeword transmitted by the source is of the incremental redundancy type in which it can be decoded by observing just one or a few of its segments. 5) We assume all the channel coefficients remain constant dur ing the whole cooperative transmission intervals. The forward and backward channels between two nodes X andY are the same during the whole cooperative transmission due to the reciprocity theorem[16], i.e.,hX,Y = hY,X . 6) Channel state information (CSI) is not available at the so urce (user A and user B). 7) CSI between the source to relay l and relayl to the destination is available at each relay , l = 1, 2, ..., L. 8) We assume the use of random Gaussian codebooks, and the len gth of the codeword is sufficiently long. 9) For relay selection, we assume all relays are hidden from e ach other and we ignore losses, delays and collisions of relays’ flag packets [9] and destination’s notification packet. C. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of RS-DDF&NC The phase 1 and phase 2 of the RS-DDF&NC are shown in Fig. 1.

The experimental results in large-cell scenario shows that up to 30 % throughput gain compared to non-multi-point transmission is achieved although the difference for the RSRP of two TPs is over 10 dB, so that the improvement for the antenna correlation is achievable and important aspect for the multi-point transmission in the 15 GHz frequency band as well as the improvement of the RSRP. Furthermore in small-cell scenario, the throughput gain of 70% and over 5 Gbps are achieved applying multi-point transmission in the condition of two different MIMO streams transmission from a single TP as distributed MIMO instead of four MIMO streams transmission from a single TP.	data rate units;frequency band;mimo;mobile phone;multipoint ground;prospective search;software propagation;telecommunications link;throughput	Daisuke Kurita;Kiichi Tateishi;Atsushi Harada;Yoshihisa Kishiyama;Stefan Parkvall;Erik Dahlman;Johan Furuskog	2015	2015 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414001	throughput;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;spatial multiplexing;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	26.44865669816308	82.63460053465371	81184

Thus, feedback reduction in multiuser multi-carrier systems becomes more of an issue due to the large amount of feedback required to pass to the base station. In this paper, we propose a novel feedback reduction scheme preserving the essential of multi-user diversity. In our proposed scheme, active users determine their feedback amount based on the feedback efficiency factor in a distributed manner. The objective is to reduce the feedback load remarkably while achieving almost the same performance to the full feedback condition. Our proposed scheme offers several advantages over existing ones. First, it does not distort the property of the scheduling policies. Second, total feedback load can be explicitly controlled to a target level regardless of the number of users in a system by adjusting each user's feedback load adaptively.	algorithmic efficiency;data system;distortion;feedback;multi-user;scheduling (computing)	Jeongho Jeon;Kyuho Son;Hyang-Won Lee;Song Chong	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.976	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;base station	Visualization	38.5981666514764	85.7514231959621	81243

In this paper, we present a distributed LDLC-based cooperative relaying scheme for the multiple-access relay channel (MARC). The relay node decodes LDLC-coded packets from two sources and forwards a network-coded combination to the destination. At the destination, a joint iterative decoding structure is designed to exploit the diversity gain as well as coding gain. For the LDLC-based network coding operation at the relay, we consider two alternative methods which offer a tradeoff between implementation complexity and performance, called superposition LDLC (S-LDLC) and modulo-addition LDLC (MA-LDLC). Soft symbol relaying is considered as an alternative to hard decision relaying which is capable of reducing the effect of error propagation at the relay. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can provide greater diversity gain and up to 6.2 dB coding gain when compared with noncooperative LDLC coding and uncoded network-coded transmission. The proposed scheme also achieves 2.5 dB gain over network-turbo-coded cooperation, for the same code rate and overall transmitted power. Also, soft symbol relaying is shown to provide approximately 2 dB gain over hard decision relaying when the source-relay link suffers from deep fading.	code rate;coding gain;decibel;iteration;linear network coding;modulo operation;multi-user mimo;point-to-point protocol;propagation of uncertainty;relay channel;simulation;software propagation	Bin Chen;Dushantha N.

If the primary user is found to be absent/ present, the cognitive radio user will transmit/wait for a while accordingly. We optimize a different transmitting/waiting duration when a detected energy value is within a different interval. Then an adaptive transmitting/waiting duration varying with the detected energy value is formulated.

In this paper we highlight cell-planning aspects for the implementation of licensed shared access (LSA) in LTE cellular networks. Different cellular deployments are evaluated by means of system-level simulations. Numerical results show that transmit power, antenna type and orientation, as well as antenna downtilt should be carefully evaluated during the planning of spectrum sharing deployments using LSA in cellular wireless.	compaq lte;elegant degradation;gene expression programming;interference (communication);mobile phone;numerical linear algebra;software deployment;system-level simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Thomas Wirth;Bernd Holfeld;Dennis Wieruch;Rüdiger Halfmann;Karl-Josef Friederichs	2014	2014 1st International Workshop on Cognitive Cellular Systems (CCS)	10.1109/CCS.2014.6933804	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	25.379395779576534	85.79269818207469	81597

This is the first paper analyzing the physical layer security issues of electric-field IBC (EF-IBC). The EF-IBC channel gain and the channel radiation gain (gain from an active EF-IBC channel to a nearby EF-IBC receiver) is measured, compared and analyzed. When considering channel gain, channel radiation gain, environmental interference, and the channel security, the desirable frequency band for IBC should be from 45MHz to 80MHz when the security is not of primary concern. The band from 60MHz to 80MHz is preferred when open-arm position is involved and security is important.	coat of arms;entity framework;frequency band;information-based complexity;interference (communication);simulation;x.690	Hongjie Zhu;Wai Chiu Ng;Hengying Shan;George Jie Yuan	2012	2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167400	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	30.771707439320302	76.85003432551227	81688

A closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability when only statistical channel state information is available at the secondary transmitter is derived.

This feature has been already included in second-generation systems, such as the CdmaOne based on the IS-95 standard. Nonetheless, synchronous operation does not seem to be assessed as a basic system option for third-generation systems. This is mainly due to the contrasted choice of having global positioning system (GPS) receivers located at any of the base transceiver stations (BTSs) to perform station synchronization. However, the existingCdmaOneinterface permits time transfer between the various BTSs and a simple time difference measurement technique can provide an internal, network-based means for time synchronization of base stations clocks. This paper considers a recently proposed approach based on the pilot strength measurements message delivered by every mobile station (MS), combined with round trip delay measurements that BTSs perform on the MS transmissions. In this paper, we consider some possible algorithms to reduce time misalignments, and continuously phase-lock the clocks at different BTSs. Having developed an appropriate analytical/simulation approach, in the environment of a CDMA network, the paper evaluates and compares the performance of two suitable centralized architecture configurations, i.e., master–slave synchronization (MSS) and mutual synchronization (MUS). Both network architectures turn out to be applicable and provide suitable timing performance. Finally, the paper provides a preliminary discussion on some related issues, such as GPS avoidance, synchronization of BTSs inside buildings, tunnels, and subways and hybrid MSS/MUS synchronization network architectures.	algorithm;centralized computing;global positioning system;master/slave (technology);performance evaluation;simulation;synchronization (computer science);transceiver	Franco Mazzenga;Francesco Vatalaro;Chuck E.

cfad2b5fa6bfff168f258565f735a19ce438fed2	precoding design for full-duplex transmission in millimeter wave relay backhaul		As the amount of user equipment and massive volumes of data continue to increase, high data rate requirements remain a major challenge, particularly in cellular networks. In networks composed of small cells, applying full-duplex (FD) millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless backhauls is a more effective and convenient approach than utilizing conventional optical fiber links. The mmWave communication technology is promising for future wireless communications due to its considerable available bandwidth, which is the basis of a high transmission rate. However, the short wavelength of mmWave leads to high propagation loss and shortens the transmission distance of the system. FD relaying can expand the coverage of the base station and achieve higher spectral efficiency than half-duplex (HD) transmission. However, the residual self-interference (SI) may degrade the performance of FD. The combination of mmWave and FD technologies compensates for the high path loss and realizes efficient transmission. In this paper, we consider an FD mmWave relay backhaul system and the SI of FD communication. We first propose an FD SI channel model in the mmWave band, which is composed of two parts: line-of-sight (LOS) SI and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) SI. According to the special mmWave MIMO structure limitation, two SI cancellation precoding algorithms are proposed to eliminate the SI in the system and achieve high spectral efficiency. The decoupled analog-digital algorithm eliminates the SI by utilizing the zero space of the channel, and the enhanced algorithm achieves higher performance. The spectral efficiency of the subconnected structure is analyzed. With appropriate performance loss, the simplified structure achieves significantly low configuration complexity.	backhaul (telecommunications);duplex (telecommunications);relay	Shuai Han;Yi Zhang;Weixiao Meng;Zhensheng Zhang	2018	MONET	10.1007/s11036-018-1080-5	mimo;duplex (telecommunications);computer network;precoding;path loss;computer science;spectral efficiency;bandwidth (signal processing);communication channel;cellular network	EDA	26.110598410938906	82.12646298993086	81857

In this paper, the energy efficiency of a multibeam downlink system is investigated in terms of maximizing the ratio of system throughput over consumed power. More specifically, the consumed power comprises both operating power which is needed for running the network equipment and transmit power which is needed for forwarding the information to the end users. Regarding the employed transmission technique, Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) beamforming together with power optimization for satellite downlink channel is used while full frequency reuse is assumed. By varying the ratio of operating and transmit power, we study the performance of the forward link in terms of spectral and energy efficiency.	beamforming;communications satellite;loss function;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;optimization problem;power optimization (eda);signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;throughput	Symeon Chatzinotas;Gan Zheng;Björn E.

Multi-cell BD algorithm is used to coordinate the transmissions across multiple evolved base stations (BSs) for downlink. In this paper, we apply BD to the downlink transmission in a cooperative multi-cell system, where the signals from different BSs to all the mobile stations (MSs) are jointly designed with the perfect knowledge of the downlink channels and transmit messages. The optimal form of BD with per-antenna power constraints and sum rate capacity are derived.

Furthermore, all the channels are mutually independent and experiencing quasi-static Nakagami-m fading. We derive closed-form expressions for the exact secrecy outage probability as well as the average secrecy capacity with both non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers. Such performance metrics are used to analyze the impacts of the number of receivers and eavesdroppers on the system. Remarkably, our results reveal that, for non-colluding eavesdroppers, increasing the number of users will cause greater secrecy degradation than the number of eavesdroppers, especially when the main channel is far superior to the wiretap channel or the value of the fading parameter is high. And for the colluding case, it turns out to be the opposite.	channel (communications);downtime;elegant degradation;high-level programming language;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;transmitter	Yongjue Chen;Wei Li;Huixi Shu	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343381	telecommunications;computer science;information security;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;fading;wireless;computer network	Arch	35.304019344198274	81.91089380365501	82091

Measurements are performed using a 5×5 parasitic RECAP for a bandwidth of 70 MHz centered at 2.55 GHz. Both noise-limited as well as interference-limited cases are considered with a varying level of interference under two different realistic power constraints: average receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fixed total transmit power. For RECAP optimization a simple genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented and its performance is compared with that of a random search. Measurements confirm that a large increase in capacity is possible especially for the case when there is high interference present.	aperture (software);fractal antenna;genetic algorithm;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;mathematical optimization;prototype;random search;reconfigurable computing;signal-to-noise ratio	Rashid Mehmood;Jon W.

The MV power lines are modeled as a 3-phase set of parallel wires with infinite length and above a lossy earth. Electric field strength is calculated. Two important parameter settings are addressed for the measurement of BPL emission field, namely, the measurement height and the extrapolation factor. The latter is defined as the falloff of field strength, in dB/decade, with lateral distance from the power line. BPL interference is evaluated in terms of the 3-dB critical distance, i.e., the lateral distance at which the total noise into a radio receiver is increased by 3 dB. Using this metric, we explore the relationship between capacity and BPL interference potential.	bpl (complexity);extrapolation;interference (communication);lateral computing;lateral thinking;lossy compression;overhead (computing);power-line communication	Song Liu;Larry J.

Since energy harvesting BSs may need to be kept OFF and allowed to recharge, users connected to a BS that turns OFF need to be served by neighboring BSs that are ON. This hand-off of a call can impact the call performance from a users point of view. We formulate the call completion probability for HetNets by adapting the definition from traditional cellular networks. Adopting a realistic BS energy consumption model and using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive very tight upper and lower bounds on the call completion probability in the presence of Rayleigh fading, interference and energy harvesting BSs. We examine the impact of the system parameters on the completion probability. The results show that the macro BS energy harvesting parameters have the dominant impact on the call completion probability. In particular, the call completion probability is an increasing function of the macro BS battery capacity and the minimum energy level at which macro BS switches back ON. However, it is an increasing function of the macro BS energy harvesting rate only when the macro BS battery capacity and the minimum energy level at which macro BS switches back ON are large. The results can be used in network planning to ensure certain quality-of-service (QoS) to users in terms of call completion probability.	energy level;interference (communication);multitier architecture;network switch;quality of service;rayleigh fading;rechargeable battery;semantic network	Craig Wang;Salman Durrani;Jing Guo;Xiangyun Zhou	2015	2015 22nd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2015.7124681	renewable energy;stochastic process;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;energy level;base station;energy harvesting;quantum mechanics;statistics	Robotics	29.69077373323379	85.2554897074154	82372
833447deef5ff52fc216e6ef7b5ba54ad90dc825	rateless coding based incremental redundancy harq scheme for scma systems		In this paper, we present a rateless coding based incremental redundancy (IR) HARQ scheme for sparse code multiple access (SCMA) systems over fading channels, where each user is assumed to use rateless codes. Two different IR-HARQ strategies are proposed for the SCMA system to investigate the performance from different angles. One scheme mainly focuses on how to combine the incremental decoding and the multi-user detection (termed as the original rateless coding based IR-HARQ strategy). The other scheme employs the iteration between the incremental decoding and the multi-user detection to improve the performance (termed as the joint detection-decoding rateless coding based IR-HARQ strategy). We investigate the performance of these two strategies over the AWGN and fast-fading channels. Simulation results show that, with the proposed IR-HARQ scheme, the SCMA system performance improves with the increase of the retransmission. Furthermore, with the help of the iteration between the detector and the decoding, the SCMA system with the joint detection-decoding rateless coding based IR-HARQ strategy outperforms the original one.	hybrid automatic repeat request	Min Zhu;Qingli He;Rui Zhang;Baoming Bai	2018	MONET	10.1007/s11036-017-0968-9	fading;distributed computing;coding (social sciences);hybrid automatic repeat request;redundancy (engineering);computer science;decoding methods;detector;retransmission;communication channel	Embedded	34.80454308529486	76.08645059263186	82455

With the proposed transmission structure, a multihop network can be decomposed into several independent two-way two-hop AF relay systems. Based on the structure characteristics, we then present a cooperative two-way routing protocol based on geographic information, which mainly consists of a forwarder selection part and a relay selection part; the former aims to minimize the number of transmission hops, and the latter is used to improve the reliability of communication links. We obtain the coverage regions of available relays and forwarders based on an asymptotic symbol error probability (SEP) analysis, and then combine the results with geographic information for minimum-SEP relay selection and maximum-coverage forwarder selection. It is shown that the proposed approach provides better effective throughput performance than a related method. Simulation results are given to validate the analyses as well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	anisotropic filtering;relay;routing;simulation;symantec endpoint protection;throughput	Chin-Liang Wang;Ting-Nan Cho;Po-Hsiang Yu	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037529	wireless routing protocol;throughput;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;geographic routing;wireless;computer network	Mobile	34.27751960220142	78.00247019609202	82548

In conventional ARQ protocols developed for systems with energy-unconstrained receivers, an acknowledgement/negative-acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) message is fed back when decoding succeeds/fails. Such kind of non-adaptive feedback consumes significant amount of energy, and thus will limit the performance of systems with energy harvesting (EH) receivers. In order to overcome this limitation and to utilize the harvested energy more efficiently, we propose a novel ARQ protocol for EH receivers, where the ACK feedback can be adapted based upon the receiver's EH state. Two conventional ARQ protocols are also considered. By adopting the packet drop probability (PDP) as the performance metric, we formulate the throughput constrained PDP minimization problem for a communication link with a non-EH transmitter and an EH receiver. Optimal reception policies including the sampling, decoding and feedback strategies, are developed for different ARQ protocols. Simulation results will show that the proposed ARQ protocol not only outperforms the conventional ARQs in terms of PDP, but can also achieve a higher throughput.	acknowledgement (data networks);automatic repeat request;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;feedback;network packet;sampling (signal processing);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Yuyi Mao;Jun Zhang;Khaled Ben Letaief	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564791	sliding window protocol;communications protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;transmitter;throughput;stop-and-wait arq;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;go-back-n arq;automatic repeat request;energy harvesting;computer network	Mobile	34.02633309005971	79.07424912522734	82568

Specifically, the proposed algorithms select two or three intermediate nodes to enhance security against the malicious eavesdropper. The first selected node operates in the conventional relay mode and assists the sources to deliver their data to the corresponding destinations using an amplify-and-forward protocol. The second and third nodes are used in different communication phases as jammers in order to create intentional interference upon the malicious eavesdropper. First, we find that in a topology where the intermediate nodes are randomly and sparsely distributed, the proposed schemes with cooperative jamming outperform the conventional nonjamming schemes within a certain transmitted power regime. We also find that, in the scenario where the intermediate nodes gather as a close cluster, the jamming schemes may be less effective than their nonjamming counterparts. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid scheme to switch between jamming and nonjamming modes. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that the hybrid switching scheme further improves the secrecy rate.	algorithm;interference (communication);malware;radio jamming;randomness;relay;simulation	Jingchao Chen;Rongqing Zhang;Lingyang Song;Zhu Han;Bingli Jiao	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/icc.2011.5962776	communications protocol;systems modeling;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;qualitative research;information security;interference;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;computer network;data transmission	Security	34.238945757916056	82.62156883650445	82658

Exploiting these analytical results, we formulate a power allocation problem with energy consumption fairness constraints for the source and the relays, which is solved using monomial fitting and a series of geometric programs.

In order to allocate the transmitted power to each user's signal, we set up an iterative procedure based on a modified waterfilling distribution, which approaches the optimal performance with a viable complexity with respect to the numerical optimization. A further simplification may be introduced, giving a simple iterative waterfilling scheme, at the expense of some performance loss. The performance is illustrated obtaining the achievable rates for different antenna configurations and different kinds of power constraints. A comparison with a Block-Diagonalization approach shows the advantage of MMSE, in particular at low SNR.	beamforming;blu-ray;brute-force search;interference (communication);iterative method;level of detail;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Ana García Armada;Roberto Corvaja;Matilde Sánchez Fernández;Ana Santos-Rodriguez	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956154	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;resource management;control theory	Vision	38.573970255193714	86.98018029681191	82895

We then address the case of slow fading, where we determine the optimal pair of rates that minimizes the sum distortion, using outage probabilities. Results show that the sum distortion for slow fading is larger than for fast fading and that the use of individual outage probabilities outperforms the use of common outage probability.

A simulation based approach is used: the optimized fixed-point implementation of an OFDM receiver is found for different simulated channel conditions, depending on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the channel type. During the execution, the receiver estimates the channel conditions and chooses the optimum word-length to decode the received information. A realistic energy consumption of the receiver is estimated with a library that contains the energy consumption of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) basic operators depending on the bit-width, obtained from experimental data. Up to 57% of the dynamic energy can be saved using this method.	field-programmable gate array;image scaling;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Fernando Cladera;Matthieu Gautier;Olivier Sentieys	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362648	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	EDA	38.97418438095237	82.68834087304525	83757
acfe35304b94e29a0a370a46475811ddbf94a062	wireless information and power transfer in full-duplex two-way massive mimo af relay systems		In this paper, we investigate wireless information and power transfer in full-duplex (FD) two-way massive MIMO amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying network. In the considered network, the relay is an energy demander and applies time switching scheme to harvest energy from the users for amplifying and forwarding the users'' signals. Different from prior studies, MIMO users and antenna correlation are considered. Achievable sum-rate is analyzed and the impact of antenna correlations is discovered. It is revealed from the analysis that the transmission power at the MIMO users can be cut down proportionally to $1/M_r$ and/or the transmission power at the relay can be scaled down proportionally to $1/M^{2}_r$ to maintain a constant sum-rate, when massive antennas are equipped at the relay. Here $M_r$ denotes the number of antennas at the relay. Moreover, the optimal time switching ratio for energy harvesting at the relay is found to maximize the sum-rate. Finally, the analytical results are validated by computer simulations.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);image scaling;mimo;mimo-ofdm;power glove;relay	Junjuan Feng;Shaodan Ma;Guanghua Yang;Bin Xia	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108265	electronic engineering;computer network;duplex (telecommunications);3g mimo;computer science;mimo;wireless;multi-user mimo;energy harvesting;relay;maximum power transfer theorem	Mobile	33.9550973670685	83.88807665707908	83812

The goal is to minimize the maximum transmitted power of the relays under constraints on the signal-to-noise ratios at the destinations. To increase the degrees of freedoms in the system, the relays process two source signals jointly, using two different relay beamforming weight vectors. The Alamouti space-time block code is transmitted over two beams.

We focus on secured data connections from all users to all users of the conferencing group. A typical example is secured group communication between a group of users e.g. a social group during a multi-user audio or video conference. Secured unicast scheme, secured broadcast scheme, and network coding scheme are considered for the data distribution scheme in downlink. The layered transmission can achieve improvement of the network throughput. In addition, the hierarchical modulation is introduced to improve the network throughput, and an effective region of the hierarchical modulation is shown. Finally, the network throughput of the secured unicast, the secured broadcast, and the network coding is compared, and we find that the network coding is the most effective scheme for the data sharing system using the coordinator with layered transmission.

The adaptive protocol consists of a selection between all possible realizations of the two-way transmission based on a criterion which maximizes the instantaneous achievable sum rate. Outage probability analysis as well as bit error rate performance results obtained by computer simulations show that significant performance improvement is provided by the proposed adaptive protocol compared to the classical straightforward network coding (SNC) and PLNC. Moreover APLNC offers a solution to the poor error performance of the classical cooperative communication protocols at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region.	bit error rate;computer simulation;linear network coding;relay;sap netweaver;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage	Ture Peken;Ümit Aygölü	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM)	10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158329	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	35.20151490675721	76.6084593841175	84993

In the proposed method, rateless coding is used at the packet level and a separate physical layer coding is used at the physical layer. As rateless codes are originally designed and optimized for erasure channels, using these codes at the physical layer can lead to significant performance degradation. The proposed scheme has the advantage of a cross-layer design which uses a rateless code at the packet level modeled by an erasure channel. Based on the analysis and simulation results provided in this paper, the cross-layer scheme results in earlier successful decoding at the destination.	binary erasure channel;code;elegant degradation;network packet;r language;relay;simulation	Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam;Babak Hossein Khalaj;Ehsan Pasandshanjani	2011	2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference	10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982768	binary erasure channel;online codes;telecommunications;computer science;physical layer;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.817936352122146	75.03009120014137	85310

Although the achievable rate has been adopted for a performance indicator in most resource allocation schemes, it may not be practical if a nonideal receiver including a suboptimal detector is used instead of optimal one. Under this practical circumstance, we study the subcarrier and power allocation to minimize the average bit error rate (BER) subject to a total power constraint. Different allocation algorithms are proposed for various MIMO detectors such as the maximum likelihood (ML) detector, linear detectors and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector. We also propose suboptimal algorithms to reduce the complexity.

These advanced techniques have great impacts on the capacity and radio resource management (RRM) schemes. In this paper, the UL capacity and load models specified for TD-SCDMA systems are proposed, in which the impacts from SA and MUD techniques are considered, and the UL load can be estimated based on the total received power in the base station. According to the proposed theoretical capacity and load evaluation models, the call admission control (CAC) strategies suitable for TD-SCDMA systems are presented. Since there are two kinds of SA schemes (i.e., tracking beam antenna (TBA) and switched beam antenna (SBA)) utilized in TD-SCDMA systems, the efficient CAC algorithms suitable for these two SA schemes are designed and evaluated, which are based on principles of the interference increase estimation. All simulation results show that the proposed CAC strategies can work efficiently and improve performances of TD-SCDMA systems dramatically.

Assuming that the battery is infinite and the sensor always has information to transmit, we first maximize the channel service theoretically, and then implement the event-triggered scheduling to control the time for starting transmission. We prove that energy depletion time is only relevant to the initial energy in the battery. There is no relation between the harvesting power and the energy depletion time. We provide the transmission triggered condition by deriving the initial energy threshold. Moreover, we extend the transmission model in single time-slot to an M/G/s(0) queuing system in multiple time slots and discuss the blocking probability caused by the event-triggered strategy. Our numerical results show the channel service of the scheme along with constant PA under various different configurations.	blocking (computing);depletion region;erlang (unit);numerical analysis;numerical method;point-to-point protocol;scheduling (computing);sensor	Yinxi Tan;Zhengchuan Chen;Pingyi Fan	2017	2017 23rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.23919/APCC.2017.8304039	real-time computing;computer network;battery (electricity);communications system;computer science;scheduling (computing);energy harvesting;wireless;queue management system;transmission (mechanics);communication channel	Mobile	32.49290386330777	85.94967409599033	85749

In practical networks, since sensor nodes in the networks are not independently placed, there exists a correlation among the locations of the nodes. In order to capture the effect of the correlation, we model the spatial distribution of nodes as α-Ginibre point processes (GPPs) which reflect the repulsion. It is assumed that each sensor node is associated with the closest gateway and employs a channel inversion power control which adjusts transmit power based on the contact distance. We first identify the characteristics of the contact distance and transmit power, and then investigate the outage performance of the networks using the derived characteristics. Since the α-GPP contains the Poisson point process (PPP) as a particular case, our analysis can be interpreted as a generalization of previous works on the networks modeled by PPPs. The accuracy of our analysis is validated through simulation results.	downtime;point process;process modeling;profiling (computer programming);sensor node;simulation	Han-Bae Kong;Ping Wang;Dusit Niyato	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996585	stochastic geometry;power control;wireless sensor network;computer network;computer science;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;sensor node;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;point process	Robotics	29.59139262753301	84.70920322547862	85809

3a35628b8a9b33e473ca7da362d37e4e312ac8f6	statistical analysis of time-variant channels in diffusive mobile molecular communications		In this paper, we consider a diffusive mobile molecular communication (MC) system consisting of a pair of mobile transmitter and receiver nano- machines suspended in a fluid medium, where we model the mobility of the nano-machines by Brownian motion. The transmitter and receiver nano-machines exchange information via diffusive signaling molecules. Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the statistics of the channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. We introduce a statistical framework for characterization of the impulse response of time-variant MC channels. In particular, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the mean and the autocorrelation function of the impulse response of the channel. Given the autocorrelation function, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC channel as a metric that characterizes the variations of the impulse response. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the considered system. In order to investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the performances of a detector with perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the proposed analytical expression is verified via particle-based simulation of the Brownian motion.	acf;autocorrelation;brownian motion;cell signaling;channel state information;committed information rate;decorrelation;exptime;gnu nano;modulation;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nanorobotics;particle filter;performance;portable document format;simulation;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690;z1 (computer);z2 (computer)	Arman Ahmadzadeh;Vahid Jamali;Robert Schober	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254237	channel state information;real-time computing;autocorrelation;detector;impulse response;control theory;computer science;coherence time;stochastic process;decorrelation;communication channel	Mobile	37.16692377201785	77.38148688280228	86053

As a result, wireless communications are often susceptible to the jamming attack in which the attacker injects a high level of noise into the system. Spread spectrum has long been used to resist jamming attacks in unicast environments, or when the jammer has less information than the other receivers. Recently, we proposed a scheme for broadcast jamming mitigation based on spread spectrum and a binary key tree and showed some improvements over a multiple-unicast system. In this paper, we extend our previous work in five ways. First, we provide a theoretical result that under our scheme, jammers can cause only a limited number of losses. Second, we develop a dynamic tree-remerging scheme that achieves higher power efficiency than previously proposed schemes, and scales to an arbitrary number of receivers without increasing the number of codes in use; in particular, we send each transmission on at most 2j + 1 codes, where j is the number of jammers. Third, we show that our scheme is close to optimal, demonstrating that under certain realistic restrictions, the system cannot escape jamming without using at least j +1 codes. Fourth, we provide a detailed analysis of false alarm rates, showing both experimental and theoretical results. Finally, we perform a more extensive analysis of our system using both a chip-accurate MATLAB simulation and a bit-accurate event-driven simulation in the ns-2 network simulator; these simulations demonstrate that our scheme approaches the best possible performance.	code;event-driven programming;high-level programming language;like button;link/cut tree;matlab;performance per watt;radio jamming;simulation;transmission (bittorrent client);ultra-wideband;unicast	Jerry T.

fc0d9f432d19fe4984fa35a1a2c400c54b745076	a hybrid artificial-noise and secret-key scheme for securing ofdm transmissions in v2g networks		We propose a new scheme to enhance the physical-layer security of wireless single-input single-output orthogonal-frequency division-multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions from an electric vehicle, Alice, to the aggregator, Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. To prevent information leakage to Eve, Alice exploits the wireless channel randomness to extract secret key symbols that are used to encrypt some data symbols which are then multiplexed in the frequency domain with the remaining unencrypted data symbols. To secure the unencrypted data symbols, Alice transmits an artificial-noise (AN) signal superimposed over her data signal. We propose a three-level optimization procedure to increase the average secrecy rate of this wiretap channel by optimizing the transmit power allocation between the encrypted data symbols, unencrypted data symbols and the AN symbols. Our numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves considerable secrecy rate gains compared to the benchmark cases.	an/cyz-10;algorithm;benchmark (computing);division by zero;encryption;eve;frequency divider;information leakage;key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;multiplexing;numerical analysis;plaintext;public-key cryptography;randomness;ski combinator calculus;spectral leakage	Ahmed El Shafie;Mohamed F.

The data collected by such satellites are used in agriculture, maritime services, disaster and environmental monitoring, and so on. Earth observation satellites are low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites typically with a sun-synchronous, polar orbit. The amount of collected data has significantly increased over the years. This calls for finding new ways to increase the transfer rate on the satellite link. As a consequence, the present paper analyzes the possibility of moving from low to high radio frequencies. In addition, different topologies are analyzed, such as the conventional direct LEO satellite to ground station link, and the data relay link from the LEO satellite to the ground station through a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite. The present paper thus analyzes the foreseeable performance of Ka-band and Q-band direct links, and Ka-band, Q-band, and W-band data relay links. The following channel adaptation techniques were assumed during the analysis: adaptive coding and modulation and variable coding and modulation. According to the results, the link margin is significantly high in clear sky, reaching at least 7 dB, even using the least robust modulation and coding (ModCod) scheme, which applies 1024-amplitude and phase-shift keying (1024-APSK) modulation scheme. As a consequence, it shall be important in the future to further increase the spectral efficiency of the link, by, for example, reducing phase noise in order to enable even higher-order modulation schemes.

The authors investigate the effect of the MIMO diversity on such multi-constraint CR-MIMO systems. They consider peak interference power constraint at the primary receiver and peak transmit power constraint at the CR transmitter. In MIMO systems, the allowable transmit power is distributed over the transmit-antennas. The power allocation problem of such CR systems is studied under both sum power and interference constraints. The authors show that the equal power allocation does not improve the ergodic capacity but improves the outage capacity over the single-input single-output (SISO) system. Transmit antenna selection (TAS) which is a special case of power allocation is also investigated. The authors show that, under the peak interference and transmit power constraint, selecting a single transmit-antenna and allocating all the power to the selected best antenna achieves the same performance as the optimal power allocation (OPA). The authors evaluate ergodic capacity and outage capacity for both power allocation- and antenna selection-based schemes. The closed-form expressions of the outage probabilities are also derived. Results show that both OPA and TAS significantly improves the capacities over the SISO system.	cognitive radio;downtime;ergodic theory;ergodicity;interference (communication)	Asaduzzaman;Hyung Yun Kong	2011	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2010.0385	transmitter;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver;computer network	Mobile	37.11308765921187	84.76277095988931	86615

Since the CM technique achieves multiplexing by using time delays exceeding the coherence time of the light sources, crosstalk between CM channels depends on a space of delay difference between CM channels. We analyze the ratio of crosstalk to signal as a function of the space, and find a channel space enough to neglect crosstalk from other CM channels. Using this channel space, we obtain the number of CM channels accommodated within one chip duration. Since the conventional FH-CDMA supports traffic by the code channels only, its capacity is limited by OBI as traffic increases. In addition to the code channel, the proposed network supports traffic by the CM channels. Since the addition of CM channels decreases the number of active code channels for uniform traffic, OBI is reduced. Numerical results show that the proposed network attains larger capacity than the conventional FH-CDMA.	crosstalk;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);multiplexing	Katsuhiro Kamakura;Iwao Sasase	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.937329	chip;code division multiple access;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;interference;multiplexing;computer network	HPC	31.786474692790165	76.47246733301544	86669

4c9a4d9ab04fea093af46219f8d2d71e31a44d7e	an adaptive combiner model for multi-rate relaying transmissions in cognitive systems		This paper proposes an adaptive combiner model that maximizes the performance of multi-rate cooperative relaying transmission in resources aware systems. Users’ cooperation is applied to smartly profit from the network resources to reach for efficient multi-rate transmissions. The low rate terminal uses a part of his bandwidth and power to relay the high rate user data side by side with his own data. This results in small performance degradation to the low rate user performance. The combiner model at the high rate terminal is carefully investigated for an optimized system performance and an adaptive combiner is proposed. The model calculates the weights adaptively for each bit based on a dynamic-blind method. The adaptive combiner is evaluated against the maximal-ratio combiner MRC and the equal gain combiner EGC to reach for the best model for the multi-rate relaying framework. Based on half-duplex mode, the probability of error performance is studied and compared for each combiner model under different channel conditions. The results show that the proposed adaptive combiner, characterized by its reliability and simplicity, leads to the best performance compared to the other models.	adaptive grammar;algorithm;artificial intelligence;context-aware pervasive systems;diplexer;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;maximal set;multi-user mimo;power dividers and directional couplers;relay;simulation;user error	Noha Ossama El-Ganainy;Said Esmail El-Khamy	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3797-4	probability of error;computer network;computer science;real-time computing;resource (disambiguation);relay;bandwidth (signal processing);communication channel	HPC	31.817733724187175	88.10025256030862	86899

In such a network, channel probing takes place in two phases: 1) in phase I, all transmitters contend for the channel using random access to reserve the channel, and the probing to accomplish a successful channel contention takes a random duration; and 2) in phase II, subsequent probings are carried out to estimate the link conditions from the successful transmitter in phase I to its intended receivers, according to specific probing mechanisms, and the probing for each receiver takes a constant duration. In this paper, we shall study various probing mechanisms for utilizing multi-receiver diversity in phase II and multiuser diversity in phase I for ad hoc (peer-to-peer) communications. Clearly, further probing increases the likelihood of seeing better channel conditions for exploiting diversities, but at the cost of additional time. Therefore, channel probing must be done efficiently to balance the tradeoff between the throughput gain from better channel conditions and the probing cost. One main objective of this study is to characterize this tradeoff in a stochastic decision making framework. Specifically, we cast network throughput optimization as an optimal stopping problem, and then explore channel aware distributed scheduling to leverage multi-receiver diversity and multiuser diversity in a joint manner. We show that the optimal scheduling policies for all proposed probing mechanisms exhibit threshold structures, indicating that they are amenable to easy distributed implementation. We show that the optimal thresholds and the maximum network throughput can be obtained off-line by solving fixed point equations. We further develop iterative algorithms to compute the optimal thresholds and the throughput.	algorithm;fixed point (mathematics);hoc (programming language);in-phase and quadrature components;iterative method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multi-user;numerical method;online and offline;optimal stopping;phy (chip);peer-to-peer;random access;scheduling (computing);theory;throughput;transmitter	Dong Zheng;Min Cao;Junshan Zhang;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2008	IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.204	wireless ad hoc network;stochastic process;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;iterative method;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.83238155258406	79.91721937632431	86957

79927d1e01bc6e0a9b7def7ec649a8aced6ce1de	secrecy outage performance analysis for energy harvesting sensor networks with a jammer using relay selection strategy		In this paper, we study radio frequency energy harvesting (EH) in a wireless sensor network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (EAVs). Specifically, the sensor source and multiple sensor relays harvest energy from multiple power transfer stations (PTSs), and then, the source uses this harvested energy to transmit information to the base station (BS) with the help of the relays. During the transmission of information, the BS typically faces a risk of losing information due to the EAVs. Thus, to enhance the secrecy of the considered system, one of the relays acts as a jammer, using harvested energy to generate interference with the EAVs. We propose a best-relay-and-best-jammer scheme for this purpose and compare this scheme with other previous schemes. The exact closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is obtained and is validated through Monte Carlo simulations. A near-optimal EH time algorithm is also proposed. In addition, the effects on the SOP of key system parameters such as the EH efficiency coefficient, the EH time, the distance between the relay and BS, the number of PTSs, the number of relays, and the number of EAVs are investigated. The results indicate that the proposed scheme generally outperforms both the best-relay-and-random-jammer scheme and the random-relay-and-best-jammer scheme in terms of the secrecy capacity.

39e9e88a9e7634107ff1e6836f2185d0531fc945	superposition coding in alternate df relaying systems with virtual mimo iri cancellation		This paper considers a layered transmission between the source and the destination aided by two half-duplex relays. In the proposed system, the single antenna source continuously broadcasts superposition coded (SC) base and enhancement layers, while relays, with one active antenna, retransmit in turn the enhancement layer. Using two antennas, the destination as well as the relays receive mixed base, enhancement, and delayed enhancement layers through over-the-air signal summation. To recover from inter-relay interference (IRI), the receiving relay decouples two spatial streams representing data of interest using the virtual Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channel from the source and the transmitting relay. Because of the network topology, the receiver deploys both virtual MIMO and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) techniques to first decode the delayed enhancement layer and then the delayed base layer. In this decode-and-forward (DF) transmission scheme, the transmissions from the source and the relays are aligned in time, power, and spatial domains to optimize the system throughput and reliability. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the SC with alternate relaying in the proposed single input multiple output (SIMO) setup has a better performance than similar conventional schemes.

This is relevant to perform accurate cross layer analyses of fixed wireless systems as Wireless Local Loop, relay networks, WiMax for fixed or repositionable users or sensor networks. To the best of our knowledge, published modules for NS-2 assume that all the stations are moving during the simulation or that published PHY models for mobile systems are also applicable to the fixed case. We show that while the latter method may be valid as a first approach, the shape of the Doppler spectrum for both cases differ significantly and performance metrics as packet loss rate will not be predicted well in all cases when using an inappropriate channel model. We also show that (as expected) a maximum ratio combiner with uncorrelated antennas achieves a higher throughput than equal gain or selection combiners.	channel (communications);diplexer;network packet;phy (chip);relay;simulation;throughput;wireless local loop	Sebastian Castillo;Luciano Ahumada	2010	2010 15th IEEE International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling, Analysis and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)	10.1109/CAMAD.2010.5686973	telecommunications;computer science;fading;empirical modelling;computer network	Mobile	25.213404401072438	83.89918019408726	87164

This poor network performance has a negative impact on customer experience and satisfaction, which may result in increased churn for CDMA wireless carriers. Previous research on the impact of dirty devices has used computer-based simulations. This paper demonstrates the influence of dirty devices on a live commercial CDMA network using two distinct approaches. The first approach deploys dirty and non-dirty devices in a live commercial cell, and measures the impact on forward base transceiver station (BTS) power and forward link Ec/Io (Ec is the received pilot chip energy and Io is the spectral density of the total power seen by the device). A series of tests on a live CDMA network with known dirty devices shows an increase in BTS transmit power resources compared with non-dirty devices, leading to the degradation of forward link Ec/Io. The second approach uses a statistical study of the aggregated pilot strength measurement messages reported by the mobile to ascertain the impact of known dirty devices on the overall network Ec/Io of non-dirty devices.	broadcast television systems inc.;elegant degradation;mobile phone;network performance;simulation;spectral density;telecommunications link;transceiver	Prakash Suman;Jeff Baenke;Andrew Harmon;Michael S.

Furthermore, an increase in Lp reduces the sum-throughput and the achievable gain in sum-throughput through our optimization approach.	coherence (physics);mathematical optimization;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;time of arrival	Arman Shojaeifard;Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei	2012	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2012.083012.120347	code division multiple access;throughput;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;fading	Theory	37.382953499166	79.6603647813964	87206

We first construct iterative algorithms to find the jointly optimum temporal signatures and transmit beamformers under the assumption of perfect temporal signature and transmit beamforming feedback. Next, motivated by the need to reduce the amount of feedback, we present a low-complexity sequential orthogonal temporal signature assignment algorithm for given transmit beamformers. Our approach is based on minimizing the difference between the performance of the MIMO-CDMA system and the described upper bounds at each signature assignment step. We next note that the transmit beamformers can be shaped depending on the channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter. We investigate the cases of various levels of available feedback resulting in different beamformer structures and present a joint orthogonal temporal signature assignment and beamforming algorithm. We observe that as the available feedback level is increased, the performance of the joint signature and beamformer assignment algorithm approaches the performance upper bounds. In particular, we observe that a substantial performance gain is obtained when the individual channel state information is available at the transmitter side	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;electronic signature;feedback;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;telecommunications link;transmitter	Semih Serbetli;Aylin Yener	2006	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2006.874787	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;statistics	Mobile	36.664358542358904	87.73069046337058	87236

The optimum power profile and the ergodic capacity of the secondary link are derived for general fading channels (with continuous probability density function) under average and peak transmit-power constraints and with respect to two different interference constraints: an interference outage constraint and a signal-to-interference (SI) outage constraint. When applied to Rayleigh fading channels, our results show that the interference constraint is harmful at high-power regime, whereas at low-power regime, it has a marginal impact and no-interference performance may be achieved.	catastrophic interference;channel state information;cognitive radio;ergodicity;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;marginal model;rayleigh fading;sun outage;transmitter	Zouheir Rezki;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems	10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624281	constrained optimization;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;fading;statistics	Arch	34.84973466521075	86.03103327972525	87266

However, very-little work shows that the Gaussian assumption does not hold true in OFDMA systems. In this paper, the statistical property of CCI in downlink OFDMA systems is studied, and spectral efficiency of downlink OFDMA system is analyzed based on the derived statistical model. First, the probability density function (PDF) of CCI in downlink OFDMA cellular systems is studied with the considerations of path loss, multipath fading and Gaussian-like transmit signals. Moreover, some closed-form expressions of the PDF are obtained for special cases. The derived results show that the PDFs of CCI are with a heavy tail, and significantly deviate from the Gaussian distribution. Then, based on the derived statistical properties of CCI, the downlink spectral efficiency is derived. Numerical and simulation results justify the derived statistical CCI model and spectral efficiency.

In this paper, the capabilities of the physical layer in a multi-user MISO system are described in terms of the users' outage probabilities. Optimum descriptions are given by sets of efficient outage probability tuples. We first derive a closed-form expression for a user's outage probability in the presence of multi-user interference. Next, the set of efficient outage probability tuples under a simplified SDMA transmit strategy is derived. We show how a good approximate description of the efficient set is found by equidistant sampling. Finally, the performance of the proposed transmit strategy is compared with an orthogonal multiple access scheme, demonstrating that optimum mode selection at the physical layer can lead to significant performance gains at the application layer	approximation algorithm;downtime;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;sampling (signal processing);standard database management analysis;system analysis	Christian Guthy;Johannes Brehmer;Wolfgang Utschick	2005	2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2005.1651830	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;top-down and bottom-up design;probability;interference;physical layer;statistics	Mobile	38.22818457937594	82.71086006644357	87528

The MBMS technique eases the load of the network and therefore allows network to serve more subscribers. The very aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of Release 6 MBMS and its performance enhancements in WCDMA networks. Special attention will be focused on macro and receive diversity which are considered in addition to time diversity provided by long interleaving as enhancements on MBMS performance. 3GPP Release 6 specifications for MBMS introduce two macro diversity schemes: soft and selective combining. The effect of those combining scheme concepts together with and without receive diversity provided by multiple receive antennas are examined. Also, a concept closely related to the receive diversity called Rx-switching i.e., turning the another receive antenna off in good channel situations for power saving purposes is studied. The system level performance of MBMS point-to-multipoint (p-t-m) mode is evaluated with dynamic system level tool in which e.g., mobility of users and interactions of the radio resource management functionalities are explicitly taken into account. Our studies indicate that macro diversity brings significant gains to the MBMS performance. Receive diversity together with macro diversity schemes improves the performance even more and therefore enhances the cell throughput that MBMS can offer. Furthermore, based on the findings of this study it seems that 2Rx Rake receiver can operate with a single antenna significant amount of time without sacrificing desired coverage and thus provide clear power saving opportunities.	multimedia broadcast multicast service	Kari Aho;Janne Kurjenniemi;Ville Haikola;Christopher Callender;Tapani Ristaniemi	2008	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-007-9413-x	telecommunications;computer science;resource management;dynamical system;w-cdma;multimedia broadcast multicast service;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	30.609537429615457	82.80682344387651	87752

NOMA distinguishes multiple users in power domain by computationally-heavy successive interference cancellation (SIC) method. Recently, outsourcing baseband computations to graphics processing units (GPUs) have become an attractive solution for some wireless communication applications, particularly for the ones include parallel processing. Although SIC is a sequential operation, when user clustering is deployed, multiple SIC operations are required and GPU based computation becomes a natural solution to alleviate the high computation demand of SIC receivers. In this work, we implemented GPU based SIC implementation for uplink NOMA systems with user clustering and our results reveal a significant speedup when compared to that of using central processing unit based computations.	graphics processing unit;interference (communication);telecommunications link	Talgat Manglayev;Refik Çaglar Kizilirmak;Yau Hee Kho;Nor Asilah Wati Abdul Hamid	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-018-5915-y	single antenna interference cancellation;throughput;real-time computing;computer science;telecommunications link;speedup;cuda;cluster analysis;central processing unit;baseband	Mobile	29.76057948138461	88.47113799827481	87854

An approximate expression for the SER of an N relay network with M-ary phase-shift-keying (M-PSK) signalling is derived at high enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The approximation hinges on ignoring terms in the SER which are of order higher than (N+1) in the SNR. The validity of the derived approximate SER is justified through computer simulations for networks with different numbers of relays. The simulation results show that the approximation is tight at high SNR and that the cooperation protocol can achieve full diversity order equal to the number of cooperating terminals.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;key (cryptography);pre-shared key;profiling (computer programming);relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Ahmed K.

A femto Access Point, also known as femto AP, is utilized to solve the problem. Generally, the femto AP is deployed in a home to support indoor users. Since there might be a small number of users in the home, it could be expected that the traffic load of the femto AP is lower than its wireless channel capacity. Though the femto AP could support indoor users, it also causes interference problems. In this paper, we proposed a power control algorithm for the femto AP that will help reduce the interference. The proposed scheme reduces the transmission power when the traffic density of the femto AP is low, so that the femto AP could avoid any throughput loss. In order to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme, we use an finite state markov chain (FSMC) model. Then, we show some numerical results of the proposed scheme.	algorithm;channel capacity;interference (communication);markov chain;nl (complexity);numerical analysis;performance;telecommunications link;throughput	Seyoung Yun;Dong-Ho Cho	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671999	service provider;throughput;mobile telephony;telecommunications;power control;computer science;telecommunications service;base station;interference;markov process;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	27.02016585060385	86.29643602479152	88306
ff8e063e85c397507014893dd70f9ce53a4861d0	precise outage analysis of mixed rf/unified-fso df relaying with hd and 2 im-dd channel models		This paper derives and analyzes the outage probability of mixed radio frequency (RF)/unified free space optical (FSO) dual-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying scheme, where heterodyne detection (HD) and intensity modulation-direct detection (IM-DD) are considered for FSO detection. In doing that, we correctly utilize, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a precise channel capacity result for the IM-DD channel. Moreover, this is the first time that not only the (IM-DD input-independent) but also the (IM-DD cost-dependent) AWGN channel is considered in such system analysis. This work assumes that the first hop (RF link) follows Naka-gami-m fading, while the second hop (FSO link) follows Málaga (M) turbulence with pointing error. These fading and turbulence models include other ones (such as Rayleigh fading and Gamma-Gamma turbulence) as special cases, so our analysis can be considered as a generalized one from both RF and FSO fading models point of view. Additionally, the system outage probability is investigated asymptotically in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, where a new non-reported diversity order and coding gain analysis are shown. Interestingly, we find that in the FSO hop, based on SNR, the HD or IM-DD cost-dependent results in a same diversity order which is twice the one of IM-DD input-independent. However, based on transmitted power all these FSO detectors result in a same diversity order. Furthermore, we offer simulation results which confirm the derived exact and asymptotic expressions.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;coding gain;direction finding;downtime;heterodyne;modulation;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;system analysis;turbulence modeling	Omer Mahmoud S.

bc9cda4d8ab832f23bf341ee858174965cd02607	computational modeling of transmission capacity with outage constraints in ad-hoc networks	ad hoc network;computer model	This paper proposes a transmission capacity model with an overlaid regime that models the cognitive radio technology. We study a case of two coexisting wireless networks (the primary (PR) network and the secondary (SR) network) operating in the same geographical region and sharing the same spectrum and define the transmission capacity as a product of three signal propagation parameters: the density of transmission, the transmission rate and successful transmission probability ) 1 ( y probabilit outage − . The PR network has a higher priority to access the spectrum, regardless of the SR network, while the SR network limits its interference on the PR network by carefully controlling the density of its transmitters. Using the C++ programming toolkit, we simulate the transmission capacity for both networks and study their tradeoffs in the presence of two propagation constraints: the outage probability and transmission density. Simulation results show that the proposed model minimizes mutual interference by significantly increasing the network spectrum efficiency per unit area as well as the transmission capacity.	c++;cognitive radio;computation;computer simulation;downtime;interference (communication);propagation constant;software propagation;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Moses Ekpenyong;Joseph Isabona	2010	Computer and Information Science		computer simulation;wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	29.358709055476233	84.79181514591573	88361

MIMO can be seen from two different perspectives: if increased data rates are targeted, for a given value of SNR, one gets improved data transmission; however, from an energy efficiency viewpoint, lower values of SNR are needed for the same reference data rate, therefore, allowing the reduction of the transmitted power, while providing the same data rate as the one for SISO. In this paper, a framework for evaluating the possible benefit of using MIMO instead of SISO, from the expected SNR improvement viewpoint is proposed, and results for different environments are presented and discussed. The proposed evaluation methodology allows one to properly assess the expected benefits of MIMO, therefore, providing guidelines to enable a proper SISO/MIMO mode selection according to the required service data rate. The analysis being presented is based on existing 3GPP models for data rate versus SNR in LTE. Simulation results for the ETU70 3GPP channel model are provided. It is observed that, for given reference data rates, significant SNR improvements can be obtained. Maximum values of 7.1, 15.7 and 18.0 dB SNR reduction are obtained for 2×2, 4×4 and 8×8 MIMO configurations, compared to the SISO case, therefore, allowing a significant reduction of the transmitted power, while providing the same target data rate as the one for SISO.	channel (communications);compaq lte;data rate units;mimo;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;uncompressed video	Filipe D.

Based on the geometrical model, a parametric reference model for short-range sub-THz multipath fading channels is developed. From the reference model, the corresponding frequency correlation function and the power delay profile (PDP) are derived and compared with the measured data. The results show good agreement between the measured and theoretical PDPs. Finally, a new sum-of-sinusoids-based simulation model for wideband sub-THz channels is proposed. The statistics of the reference model are verified by simulation.

Theoretical and emulation results generated from a hybrid hardware/software test bed indicate that when packet erasures are considered, 4 × 4 MIMO architectures with precoding can offer significant energy efficiency gains relative to nonprecoded MIMO systems. In the lower signal-to-noise ratio regime, we find that operating points exist for the different MIMO architectures that provide near maximum spectral efficiency while operating at a local minimum in energy consumption. At these operating points, transceiver operating times are determined for a range of battery capacities.	binary erasure channel;emulator;mimo;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multiplexing;network packet;operating point;polarization (waves);robotics;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;software testing;spectral efficiency;testbed;transceiver	Jun Chen;Thomas G.

In the past several years, many synchronization protocols have been investigated for ad-hoc network system. However, it is difficult to apply them to D2D system directly because of some difficulties. In D2D system, these protocols have some structural limitations and might show inefficient performance, because cellular base station can be employed to D2D network to enhance performance and reduce resources. Also, D2D network should be able to support a variable number of devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new timing synchronization method for D2D system. In the proposed method, synchronization can be achieved in different ways according to the existence of available cellular base station. In the proposed method, we first consider cellular-assisted (CA) method based on random access process in cellular uplink procedure. On the other hand, when cellular base station is not available, user equipment performs stand-alone (SA) method. In SA-D2D, three step synchronization process and a new reference clock decision rule are proposed. We verify that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy synchronization in a short period.	hoc (programming language);random access;standalone program;synchronization (computer science);telecommunications link	Kyung-Hoon Lee;Kyung Hoon Won;Hyung-Jin Choi	2013		10.1145/2448556.2448661	clock synchronization;embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;data synchronization;synchronization	Metrics	25.145544650587123	86.42182026099005	88874

In order to accomplish this compression, time division or frequency division multiplexing may be used. Implementing an FDMbased modem for a multichannel application, requires a bandwidth allocation strategy. That is, one must decide how to allocate total bandwidth to individual channels such that a) the desired aggregate rate can be achieved and b) the desired individual channel bit rates can be achieved. It is our goal to determine an optimal strategy for bandwidth allocation. This document will make use of the multitone channel result to specify a scheme to allocate four separate channels (extension beyond four is straightforward using similar procedures). The allocation strategy assigns each subchannel an equalsized constellation to that of an equivalent single band modem operating at the aggregate rate. In this manner, bandwidth is allocated proportional to the desired bit rate on a particular subchannel. Power allocation will be done to maintain a constant probability of error between all channels. Thus, the technique outlined in this document will allow the user to split total bandwidth to meet error performance objectives provided that the desired aggregate rate does not exceed the maximum bit rate allowed by channel conditions.	aggregate data;bandwidth (signal processing);digital subchannel;emoticon;finite difference method;frequency divider;modem;multiplexing	Robert L.

In order to describe and thus assess the mobile radio channel in the vehicle, simulations are required. For low frequencies, full wave simulations using the Method of Moments are weU suited. For higher frequencies, these models get inadequate concerning the computational effort. This paper discusses the demands €or models that can describe the radio channel inside vehicles at high frequencies and presents an appropriate Ray Tracing approach.

Recently heterogeneous networks (HetNet) have been proposed as an attractive approach to cope with this problem, by enabling cell splitting gain via deployment of an additional layer of pico-cells. While low power and small antenna height of pico-cell base stations simplify search of the site location, the efficiency of cell splitting gain in HetNet is typically limited by small coverage area of pico-cells. To address the issue of HetNet performance in LTE-A Rel-11, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) traffic management schemes were considered. In particular a combination of dynamic point selection (DPS) with dynamic point blanking (DPB) was identified as a promising mechanism to provide cell load balancing and interference mitigation in HetNet. Dynamicity of CoMP schemes is expected to provide performance benefits in various scenarios including non-full buffer traffic models, where scheduling decisions of DPS/DPB can be based on the instantaneous cell's loading conditions. In this paper we provide detailed system level performance analysis for DPS/DPB CoMP scheme in HetNet scenario with non-full buffer FTP traffic model. The performance results are conducted for different traffic loadings of the cells and DPS/DPB scheduling decision granularities.	compaq lte;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multipoint ground;performance evaluation;pictbridge;scheduling (computing);semantic network;software deployment;throughput	Gregory Morozov;Alexei Davydov;Ilya Bolotin	2012	2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459792	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Metrics	25.736398840631363	88.10760485232473	89075
f35c72a7e35809ddd63abf43e170d36d3e59f1c2	relaying protocols for buffer-aided energy harvesting wireless cooperative networks		Here, the authors study a buffer-aided relay system, in which the source node and the relay node are energy harvesting nodes, and the source node transmits the information to the destination node via the relay node. Both the source node and relay node are assumed to equipped with an energy buffer and can temporarily store the harvested energy; in addition, the relay node possesses a data buffer to store the received information temporarily. Particularly, the authors propose two buffer-aided energy harvesting relay protocols, namely the harvest-then-transmit (HtT) protocol and the joint link selection and power allocation (JLSPA) protocol. For the HtT protocol, the expressions of the average achievable throughput and the optimal power splitting factor are obtained in close form. For the JLSPA protocol, based on the channel state information and buffer state information, a JLSPA protocol which maximises the average achievable throughput is presented. Furthermore, for the JLSPA protocol, the bounds on average achievable rate, average data buffer size, and average delay are analysed and the throughput-delay trade-off is revealed. The simulation results show that the proposed buffer-aided relaying scheme could improve the throughput performance of energy harvesting relay system significantly.

25e1d48ff607179977ba17dd9880fa3c1f362488	performance analysis of dense small cell networks with practical antenna heights under rician fading		In this paper, we examine the combined impacts of distance-dependent Rician fading channel model and the absolute difference between the heights of base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) antennas on the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency in an interference-limited ultra-dense (UD) small cell network (SCN). Exploiting distance dependent models for both path loss and multi-path fading, we show that in interference-limited UD-SCNs, Rician fading with variant Rician  $K$  factor aggravates the performance loss caused by the difference between the heights of the BS and UE antennas in comparison to Rayleigh fading. In particular, we demonstrate that due to presence of the specular line-of-sight component in the Rician fading, both the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency experience a steeper decline towards zero as the BS density increases. Our performance analysis has a prominent impact on the deployment of UD-SCNs in the 5th-generation of mobile networks, as it indicates that the right modeling of multi-path fading makes a significant difference when assessing the performance of UD-SCNs with non-identical UE-BS antenna heights.	channel (communications);interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;software deployment;spectral efficiency;urban dictionary	Amir H.

By using transmit power scaling laws at the user nodes, the asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions are derived when the antenna counts at the relay and destination are allowed to grow unbound, and thereby, the asymptotic sum rate expressions are obtained. Notably, these asymptotic SINRs and sum rates are independent of the fast fading component of the wireless channel, and consequently, yield a low-complexity medium access control layer and reduced latency in the air interface. Further, the detrimental impact of practical transmission impairments, including (i) imperfect channel state information (CSI), (ii) co-channel interference (CCI), and (iii) pilot contamination is studied by deriving the corresponding asymptotic SINRs and sum rates. For the perfect CSI case, the transmit power at each user node can be scaled down inversely proportional to the antenna count at the relay without degrading the system performance. However, for the imperfect CSI case, the transmit powers of the user nodes can only be scaled down inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of relay antennas. Interestingly, for the perfect CSI case, the presence of CCI neither affects these transmit power scaling laws nor degrades the asymptotic SINR. However, pilot contamination significantly limits the system performance.	access control;channel state information;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;pilot ace;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Gayan Amarasuriya;H.

The source broadcasts the data to the relays, some or all of which cooperatively beamform to forward the data to the destination. We generalize the standard approaches for cooperative communications in two key respects: (i) we explicitly model and factor in the cost of acquiring channel state information (CSI), and (ii) we consider more general selection rules for the relays and compute the optimal one among them. In particular, we consider simple relay selection and outage criteria that exploit the inherent diversity of relay networks and satisfy a mandated outage constraint. These criteria include as special cases several relay selection criteria proposed in the literature. We obtain expressions for the total energy consumption for general relay selection and outage criteria for the non-homogeneous case, in which different relay links have different mean channel power gains, and the homogeneous case, in which the relay links statistics are identical. We characterize the structure of the optimal transmission scheme. Numerical results show that the cost of training and feedback of CSI is significant. The optimal strategy is to use a varying subset (and number) of relay nodes to cooperatively beamform at any given time. Depending on the relative location of the relays, the source, and the destination, numerical computations show energy savings of about 16% when an optimal relay selection rule is used. We also study the impact of shadowing correlation on the energy consumption for a cooperative relay network.	channel state information;computation;cooperative mimo;downtime;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;numerical method;overhead (computing);polynomial-time approximation scheme;real-time clock;relay;selection rule	Ritesh Madan;Neelesh B.

In spite of their widespread use, the workings of 2D channels are still very much unknown. In this work, we try to explore their properties from the perspective of estimation theory and information theory. At the heart of our approach is a mapping of a 2D channel to an undirected graphical model, and inferring its a posteriori probabilities (APPs) using generalized belief propagation (GBP). The derived probabilities are shown to be practically accurate, thus enabling optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the transmitted symbols. Also, the Shannon-theoretic information rates are deduced either via the vector-wise Shannon-McMillan-Breiman (SMB) theorem, or via the recently derived symbol-wise Guo-Shamai-Verdu (GSV) theorem. Our approach is also described from the perspective of statistical mechanics, as the graphical model and inference algorithm have their analogues in physics. Our experimental study, based on common channel settings taken from cellular networks and magnetic recording devices, demonstrates that under nontrivial memory conditions, the performance of this fully tractable GBP estimator is almost identical to the performance of the optimal MAP estimator. It also enables a practically accurate simulation-based estimate of the information rate. Rationalization of this excellent performance of GBP in the 2-D Gaussian channel setting is addressed.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;belief propagation;cobham's thesis;estimation theory;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);graphical model;information theory;magnetic storage;sergio verdú;shannon (unit);simulation;software propagation;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Ori Shental;Noam Shental;Shlomo Shamai;Ido Kanter;Anthony J.

For long-haul systems, mode division multiplexing using one mode per channel in a few-mode fiber requires coherent detection in conjunction with digital multiple input multiple output (MIMO) processing for signal separation. In the following we focus on spatial multiplexing using mode groups rather than spatial modes in standard graded-index multimode fibers. In combination with on-off keying (OOK) modulation and direct detection, these systems might be advantageous for access- and connection-related applications, e.g., for super computer interconnects or in the near metro region at link lengths shorter than about 10 km. In this paper we study the potential of mode groups for mode group division multiplexing (MGDM). Single-mode group transmission experiments at 10 Gb/s per mode group, experimental mode group launching by phase mask, and concepts for passive optical mode demultiplexers are discussed.	carrier recovery;coherence (physics);electrical connection;experiment;gigabyte;key (cryptography);mimo;modulation;on-off keying;spatial multiplexing;supercomputer	Bernd Franz;Henning Buelow	2013	Bell Labs Technical Journal	10.1002/bltj.21632	nonlinear optics;orbital angular momentum multiplexing;mode scrambler;statistical time division multiplexing;electronic engineering;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;optical add-drop multiplexer;adaptive optics;optical performance monitoring;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;mimo	Graphics	30.237853703488536	79.82447806429889	89374

d1e096c9b3e7c0699546cbe61ffd4c3aca880fa8	information-centric offloading in cellular networks with coordinated device-to-device communication		In this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical framework for cache enabled cellular networks overlaid with coordinated device-to-device (D2D) communication. We follow an approach similar to LTE Direct, where the base station (BS) is responsible for establishing D2D links. We consider that an arbitrary requesting user is offloaded to D2D mode to communicate with one of its ‘k’ closest D2D helpers within the macrocell subject to content availability and helper selection scheme. We consider two different D2D helper selection schemes: 1) uniform selection (US), where the D2D helper is selected uniformly and 2) nearest selection (NS), where the nearest helper possessing the content is selected. Employing tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of BSs and D2D helpers using independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs). We characterize the D2D mode probability of an arbitrary user for both the NS and US schemes. The distribution of the distance between an arbitrary user and its ith neighboring D2D helper within the macrocell is derived using disk approximation for the Voronoi cell, which is shown to be reasonably accurate. We fully characterize the overall coverage probability and the average ergodic rate of an arbitrary user requesting a particular content. We show that significant performance gains can be achieved compared to conventional cellular communication under both the NS and US schemes when popular contents are requested and NS scheme always outperforms the US scheme. Our analysis reveals an interesting trade off between the performance metrics and the number of candidate D2D helpers ‘k’. We conclude that enhancing D2D opportunities for the users does not always result in better performance and the network parameters have to be carefully tuned to harness maximum gains.

037526561f1b714fe7f33155b823cd6711721d70	cross-layer network lifetime maximization in interference-limited wsns	networks;fading;wireless sensor networks fading interference receivers optimization network topology batteries;nodes networks;sensors;wireless communication systems;interference;receivers;network topology;qa75 electronic computers computer science;batteries;design;optimization;wireless sensor networks	In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the network lifetime (NL) is a crucial metric since the sensor nodes usually rely on limited energy supply. In this paper, we consider the joint optimal design of the physical, medium access control (MAC), and network layers to maximize the NL of the energy-constrained WSN. The problem of NL maximization can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem encompassing the routing flow, link scheduling, transmission rate, and power allocation operations for all active time slots (TSs). The resultant nonconvex rate constraint is relaxed by employing an approximation of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which transforms the problem to a convex one. Hence, the resultant dual problem may be solved to obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem with a zero duality gap. Therefore, the problem is formulated in its Lagrangian form, and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions are employed for deriving analytical expressions of the globally optimal transmission rate and power allocation variables for the network topology considered. The nonlinear Gauss–Seidel algorithm is adopted for iteratively updating the rate and power allocation variables using these expressions until convergence is attained. Furthermore, the gradient method is applied for updating the dual variables in each iteration. Using this approach, the maximum NL, the energy dissipation per node, the average transmission power per link, and the lifetime of all nodes in the network are evaluated for a given source rate and fixed link schedule under different channel conditions.	access control;approximation;augmented lagrangian method;duality (optimization);duality gap;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;gauss–seidel method;gradient method;interference (communication);iteration;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nl (complexity);network topology;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal design;optimization problem;resultant;routing;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;tucker decomposition	Halil Yetgin;Kent Tsz Kan Cheung;Mohammed El-Hajjar;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2360361	design;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;fading;network topology;computer network	Mobile	34.181347042104385	88.14753491112944	89569

The model can be used to test Global Positioning System phase tracking loops for scintillation robustness because it captures the scintillation properties that affect such loops. In the model, scintillation amplitude is assumed to follow a Rice distribution, and the spectrum of the rapidly-varying component of complex scintillation is assumed to follow that of a low-pass second-order Butterworth filter. These assumptions are justified, and the model validated, by comparison with phase-screen-generated and empirical scintillation data in realistic tracking loop tests. The model can be mechanized as a scintillation simulator that expects only two input parameters: the scintillation index S 4 and the decorrelation time tau0. Hardware-in-the-loop tests show how the model can be used to test the scintillation robustness of any compatible GPS receiver.	autocorrelation;butterworth filter;decorrelation;frequency response;gps navigation device;gps signals;global positioning system;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;low-pass filter;numerical integration;radio wave	Todd E.

We consider a system in which two base stations apply linear precoding to minimize the interference at the relay station and the mobile stations and formulate the optimization problem to maximize the system capacity and design the multiuser precoding vector for each base station. We quantify the ergodic rate performance of the proposed multiuser precoding scheme through statistical analysis. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can effectively cancel the interference and improve the sum rate performance for cell edge users.	broadcast relay station;channel capacity;ergodic theory;ergodicity;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;multiuser dos;optimization problem;overlap zone;performance evaluation;simulation	Jae-Woo Kwon;Ki-Hong Park;Young-Chai Ko;Hong-Chuan Yang	2011	2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference	10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982811	optimization problem;single antenna interference cancellation;index term;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;base station;zero-forcing precoding;interference;mobile station;signal-to-noise ratio;time division multiple access;precoding	Mobile	38.290657202039775	85.4425093137683	89835

The shadow fading parameter is shown to have a longer decorrelation distance than the angle spread at both the BS and at the MS. Furthermore, we observe variations in the shadow fading that depend on the direction of the MS movement due to street canyons. The same dependence is not observed in the angle spreads. These results indicate that the origin of the angle spread is local to the transmitter and receiver, while the shadow fading depends on the intermediate environment.	autocorrelation;decorrelation;time complexity;transmitter	Niklas Jalden;Per Zetterberg;Björn E.

Our objective is to obtain rate and power allocation policies that maximize a general concave utility function of average transmission rates on the information-theoretic capacity region of the MAC without using queue-length information. First, we address the utility maximization problem in a nonfading channel and present a gradient projection algorithm with approximate projections. By exploiting the polymatroid structure of the capacity region, we show that the approximate projection can be implemented in time polynomial in the number of users. Second, we present optimal rate and power allocation policies in a fading channel where channel statistics are known. For the case that channel statistics are unknown and the transmission power is fixed, we propose a greedy rate allocation policy and characterize the performance difference of this policy and the optimal policy in terms of channel variations and structure of the utility function. The numerical results demonstrate superior convergence rate performance for the greedy policy compared to queue-length-based policies. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the greedy policy, we present approximate rate allocation policies which track the greedy policy within a certain neighborhood.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;concave function;entropy maximization;gradient;greedy algorithm;information theory;numerical analysis;polymatroid;polynomial;rate of convergence;utility	Ali ParandehGheibi;Atilla Eryilmaz;Asuman E.

In this paper, we show that choosing a proper transmission scheme given the channel and network conditions can ensure a high energy performance in different transmission environments. Based on the energy models we established for both cooperative and non-cooperative communications, the efficiency in terms of energy consumption per bit for different transmission schemes is investigated. It is shown that cooperative transmission schemescan outperform non-cooperative schemes in energy efficiency in severe channel conditions and when the source-destination distance is in a medium or long range. But the latter is more energy efficient than the former for short-range transmission. For cooperative transmission schemes, the number of transmission branches and the number of relays per branch can also be properly selected to adapt to the variations of the transmission environment, so that the total energy consumption can be minimized.	performance;relay;transmission (bittorrent client)	Radwa Ahmed Osman;Xiao-Hong Peng;Zuoyin Tang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing	10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.163	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;cooperative diversity;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.26738374848651	84.71261727709066	90249

feec1ac05c914b2433455c1b19180f3ba9f2abe7	the zero-error capacity of a collision channel with successive interference cancellation		The collision channel without feedback (CCw/oFB) model depicts a scenario in which multiple users share a communication channel with random relative time offsets among their clocks. This paper considers an extension of this model, which allows the receiver to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) to iteratively cancel the interference caused by those collided packets that have been decoded by the receiver. We derive the zero-error capacity region of this channel in the slot-synchronous case, and present a zero-error capacity achieving scheme by joint protocol sequences and channel coding design. It is shown that the negative impact on the zero-error capacity due to a lack of time synchronization can be removed by SIC.	bell laboratories layered space-time;channel (communications);channel capacity;forward error correction;interference (communication);multi-user;open research;simplified instructional computer	Yijin Zhang;Yi Chen;Yuan-Hsun Lo;Wing Shing Wong	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006810	single antenna interference cancellation;collision;channel code;computer science;synchronization;time division multiple access;real-time computing;network packet;interference (wave propagation);communication channel	Embedded	33.41456857509109	75.97220505425535	90307
4fb5d13f4f278a042ee82827a32230f5a0fdc39c	asymptotic outage probability analysis for general fixed-gain amplify-and-forward multihop relay systems		In this paper, we present an analysis of the outage probabili ty for fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) multihop relay links operating in the high SNR regime. O ur analysis exploits properties of Mellin transforms to derive an asymptotic approximation that is ac curate even when the per-hop channel gains adhere to completely different fading models. The main resu lt contained in the paper is a general expression for the outage probability, which is a functiona l of the Mellin transforms of the per-hop channel gains. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the as ymptotic outage probability for four different systems, whereby in each system the per-hop channels adhere to either a Nakagamim, Weibull, Rician, or Hoyt fading profile, but where the distributional paramet ers may differ from hop to hop. This analysis leads to our second main result, which is a semi-general clos ed-form formula for the outage probability of general fixed-gain AF multihop systems. We exploit this fo rmula to analyze an example scenario for a four-hop system where the per-hop channels follow the f our aforementioned fading models, i.e., the first channel is Nakagamim fading, the second is Weibull fading, and so on. Finally, we p rovide simulation results to corroborate our analysis. Index Terms Amplify-and-forward relaying, semi-blind relaying, fadi ng, outage, Mellin transforms.

Existing research focuses on the optimal design of the hopping pattern, which implicitly assumes that the strategy of the attacker is fixed. In practice, the attacker might adjust its strategy to maximize its damage on the communication system. In this paper, we study the design of optimal hopping pattern (the defense strategy) as long as the optimal jamming pattern (the attack strategy). In particular, we model the dynamic between the legitimate users and the attacker as a zero sum game, and study the property of this game. We show that when the legitimate users and the jammer can access only one channel at any time, the game has a unique Nash equilibrium. In the Nash equilibrium, the legitimate users and Eve will access or jam only a subset of channels that have good channel quality. Furthermore, the better the channel, the larger the probability that Eve will jam the channel and the smaller the probability the legitimate users will access this channel. We further extend the study to multiple access multiple jamming case and characterize the Nash equilibrium. We also give numerical results to illustrate the analytical results derived in this paper.	eve;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;jam;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;optimal design;radio jamming	Bingwen Zhang;Lifeng Lai	2013	2013 47th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2013.6552328	game theory;simulation;telecommunications;spread spectrum;computer security	ECom	34.944436094401816	83.00240445362917	90481

Techniques that provide increased spectral efficiency for broadcast services such as single frequency network operation by OFDM based transmission from multiple synchronized base stations are getting acceptance in wireless standards. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel point-to- multipoint broadcast and point-to-point unicast traffic multiplexing and transmission approach based on broadcast traffic superposition and interference cancellation. The proposed approach superimposes the broadcast signal over the unicast traffic and cancels the broadcast signal before unicast demodulation and decoding. Using this approach, the broadcast interference to unicast traffic from own cell and neighboring cells can be eliminated thus improving the overall system capacity and efficiency by making full system bandwidth available to both unicast and broadcast traffic.	broadcasting (networking);catastrophic interference;channel capacity;gps signals;interference (communication);multicast;multiplexing;multipoint ground;point-to-point protocol;point-to-multipoint communication;point-to-point (telecommunications);simulation;single-frequency network;spectral efficiency;unicast	Faroo Khan	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.180	broadcast domain;broadcast radiation;single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;atomic broadcast;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;channel code;telecommunications;point-to-point;computer science;base station;multimedia broadcast multicast service;channel capacity;spectral efficiency;computer network;unicast	Mobile	25.535541955970157	86.4427127753054	90559

Superposition Modulation Cooperation (SMC) is a new kind of UC mode exploiting higher order modulation constellation to allow relay node (RN) transmitting his own local data together with the relay data from source node (SN). The throughput outperforms Amplify-and-Forward (AF), Decode-and-Forward (DF) and coded cooperation (CC) when channel state is good. Power allocation (PA) between the local signal and relay signal is crucial for the performance of SMC. An Adaptive Orthogonal Superposition Modulation Cooperation (OSMC) Scheme is designed based on the bit-level Mutual Information (MI) model to minimize the average outage probability of the three-node cooperation system. Moreover, Irregular Repeat Accumulate (IRA) code is introduced to further improve the performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the adaptive OSMC scheme improves the power efficiency significantly.	anisotropic filtering;bit-level parallelism;delta-sigma modulation;direction finding;downtime;information model;internet relay chat;list of software based on kodi and xbmc;mutual information;performance per watt;quantum superposition;simulation;throughput;transmitter;uc browser	Xiang Chen;Mingxiang Xie;Jing Huang	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382271	telecommunications;computer science	ML	34.489343142321125	76.50572168961217	90778

The provided expressions are in computable integral forms that accommodate generic channel fading conditions. We develop these expressions by modelling the cellular interference using stochastic geometry analysis, then we employ them for comparing the coverage resulting from various channel fading conditions namely Rayleigh and Rician fading, in addition to the fading-less channel. Furthermore, we expand the work to accommodate the effects of random frequency reuse on the cellular coverage and rate. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis, where the results show a very close match.	computable function;data rate units;interference (communication);monte carlo method;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;stochastic process;telecommunications link	Akram Al-Hourani;Kandeepan Sithamparanathan	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1114-x	telecommunications;computer science;statistics;stochastic geometry;computer network	Mobile	28.594801215620834	84.79762927519353	90861

The proposed selection scheme aims at avoiding unnecessary feedback load processing, in cases where a target threshold, in the received instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio, is exceeded. Assuming that perfect channel state information is available, closed-form lower bound expressions are derived for the cumulative distribution function of the output signal to interference plus noise ratio. Moreover, the impact of outdated channel state information on the system's performance is also investigated. In addition, under the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio conditions, simplified approximated expressions are also provided for the cumulative distribution functions of the output signal to interference plus noise ratio, which are employed to study the outage probability and bit error probability performance of the system. It is shown that with the proposed approach, a significant reduction in feedback load processing is achieved, with only a slight loss in performance. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

08d8d101b2f7f57fe0fbbdceac97018988a3f5c6	performance analysis of dual-hop ofdm relay system with subcarrier mapping in nakagami-m fading		Subcarrier mapping (SCM) is considered to be crucial for capacity-maximization in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) relaying networks and has been investigated extensively. However, no study has examined its exact or approximate close-form analysis under Nakagami-m fading. This paper considers the ordered subcarrier pairing schemes, i.e., worst-to-best (WTB) SCM and best-to-best (BTB) SCM, for the analysis of bit error rate (BER) and capacity of a dual-hop OFDM amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system. The system-analysis is presented for Nakagami-m fading with emphasis on two special cases: onesided Gaussian fading (m = 2 ) and Rayleigh fading (m = 1). Close-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and moment generating function (MGF) of end-to-end SNR are derived while considering fixed gain AF relays. The classical MGF and PDF based approaches are used to compare the BER performance of the system with WTB SCM and BTB SCM schemes. Close-form expressions for the upper bound on ergodic capacity are derived by analyzing Jensen’s inequality. Accurate analysis is presented for integer m while the non-integer m values allow the derivations of approximate expressions. The accuracy of the suggested approximation is verified analytically as well as numerically. The simulation results validate the analysis in Nakagami-m fading channel. key words: OFDM, SCM, Nakagami-m, dual-hop	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;best practice;bit error rate;end-to-end principle;ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;hop;jensen's inequality;multiplexing;numerical analysis;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;social inequality;subcarrier;train communication network;x.690	Raza Ali Shah;R.

Although propagation characteristics in line-of-sight (LOS) microcellular systems are well known, so far, only a few papers have investigated its effect on system performance in a comprehensive manner. In this paper, the impact of both system parameters (i.e., cell size, antenna height, operating frequency, and reuse factor) and propagation loss parameters (i.e., breakpoint distance, path loss exponents, standard deviation of the shadowing component, signals correlation, and effective road height) on the performance of both time-division multiple access (TDMA)- and code-division multiple access (CDMA)-based LOS microcellular networks is studied. Performance is evaluated in terms of outage probability in TDMA-based systems and in terms of the other-cell interference factor in CDMA-based systems. This paper includes substantial numerical results and new insights into the behavior of wireless system performance. For instance, novel insights into the impact of both distance-dependent shadowing and the effective road height on system performance are provided. In particular, nontypical fluctuational and discontinuous behavior on performance metrics are observed, and at microwave frequencies, the spectral efficiency is greater for heavy vehicular traffic conditions (i.e., during daytime) than for light vehicular traffic conditions (i.e., during nighttime). Such an understanding of interference engineering issues is vital for the planning, designing, dimensioning, and the optimization of mobile LOS microcellular networks for present and future wireless systems beyond third generation.	breakpoint;clock rate;downtime;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mathematical optimization;microwave;numerical analysis;propagation constant;software propagation;spectral efficiency	Genaro Hernández-Valdez;Felipe A.

The proposed technique takes into account the effect of channel errors in different packets of the bit-stream in order to optimally protect the coded data. For a given transmission bandwidth and multi-layered JPEG2000 bit-stream, the proposed technique adaptively selects the best protection scheme according to the channel conditions. The robustness of the proposed technique is evaluated over a Rayleigh fading channel with a concatenation of a cyclic redundancy check code and a rate-compatible convolutional code. Comparisons are made with the case of equal channel protection and unequal channel protection when the protection is designed for the worst channel conditions. Simulation results show a significant improvement of the PSNR of the received images.	bitstream;concatenation;convolutional code;cyclic redundancy check;emi (protocol);error detection and correction;ieee 1284;jpeg 2000;most significant bit;peak signal-to-noise ratio;rayleigh fading;simulation	Victor F.

This fading model represents many practical communication systems in which phase noise is a major concern, such as OFDM communications and line-of-sight microwave communications. We consider the case in which the relay receives transmissions from only one of the two transmitters, but the transmission of the relay is received at both destinations. We present conditions on the channel coefficients under which the sum-rate capacity of the phase fading Z-ICR is achieved by treating interference as noise at each receiver, and derive the corresponding sum-rate capacity. Our results show the benefits of relaying in the presence of interference when interference is weak and relay power is finite.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;intelligent character recognition;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);microwave;phase noise;relay;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Daniel Zahavi;Ron Dabora	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620659	fading distribution;telecommunications;channel state information;relay channel;fading;computer network	Arch	38.60004505487905	78.12172877467708	91790
7857448612ee3cfed1ce653b0ef0337655cfe62f	optimized error probability for weighted collaborative spectrum sensing in time- and energy-limited cognitive radio networks		In this paper, a collaborative energy-harvesting cognitive radio (CR) network is considered such that the transmitter of the secondary user (SU) is allowed to harvest signal energy of the primary user (PU) when the presence of the PU is detected. The harvested energy is converted to electrical power in order to supply the sensing and transmission energy of SUs. The time frame (time slot) is divided into two phases allocated to sensing (divided into two durations: spectrum sensing and results reporting) and transmission, respectively. The time spanned by the results reporting duration depends on the number of collaborative sensing users, while the time spent on spectrum sensing duration controls the number of sensing samples. A constrained convex optimization problem of the overall probability of error is formulated incorporating constraints on time and energy resources along with PU interference protection presented as a threshold on probability of collision. We use a soft decision rule scheme while considering two energy harvesting scenarios namely, energy surplus and energy deficit. In each scenario, the convexity of the optimization problem is established analytically and the global optimal solution is obtained. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the impact of the different parameters on the overall system performance as well as to verify the deduced analytical results.	catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;convex function;convex optimization;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;transmitter	Abbas Taherpour;Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh;Tamer M.

Unlike existing research work, we consider a multi-beam directional modulation (MBDM) scenario with imperfect desired direction knowledge. In such a setting, a robust synthesis scheme is proposed for MBDM in broadcasting systems. In order to implement the secure transmission of a confidential message, the beamforming vector of the confidential message is designed to preserve its power as possible in the desired directions by minimizing its leakage to the eavesdropper directions while the projection matrix of artificial noise (AN) is to minimize the effect on the desired directions and force AN to the eavesdropper directions by maximizing the average receive signal-to-artificial-noise ratio at desired receivers. Simulation results show that compared with conventional methods, the proposed robust scheme achieves much better bit error rate performance along desired directions for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). From the secrecy-rate aspect, the proposed scheme performs better than conventional methods for almost all SNR regions. In particular, in the medium and high SNR regions, the rate improvement of the proposed scheme over conventional methods is significant.	beamforming;bit error rate;confidentiality;delta-sigma modulation;secure transmission;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral leakage	Feng Shu;Xiaomin Wu;Jun Li;Riqing Chen;Branka Vucetic	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2614825	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;noise measurement;network security;signal-to-noise ratio;broadcasting;wireless;robustness;computer network;modulation	Mobile	36.36655584962385	83.33034996267284	92295

These parameters include the sensing period and channels allocated for each user. Our simulation results show that FSS successfully improves the sensing accuracy while maintaining a low power profile. Additionally, we show that the sensing accuracy performance gap between FSS and other traditional schemes increases by optimizing decision engine.	cognitive radio;decision support system;detailed balance;flying-spot scanner;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;smart card	Ahmed M.

The next generation cellular communication would aim to develop utilization on higher frequency bands to fully utilize the spectrum assets on all frequency bands between 300MHz to 100GHz, with primary bands below 6GHz and complimentary bands above 6GHz. Time Division Duplex (TDD) is promising for spectrum assets above 3GHz due to no requirement for paired frequency band, channel reciprocity for Multiple-Input-Multiple- Output (MIMO) and cost-effectiveness. TDD will play an important role in the next generation cellular communication. In this paper, we provide views on the next generation TDD cellular communication. SOR (Service Oriented Radio), an enhanced air interface is developed, which can adapt to diverse requirements with high resource efficiency. TDD-U (TDD-Universal) frame structure, an enhanced TDD frame structure is developed, which can enable fast Sounding Reference Signal transmission and fast channel state information feedback for Massive MIMO, enable better utilization of dynamic TDD, enable short HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) RTT (Round Trip Time) and uniform HARQ timing, and enable low E2E latency. Moreover, MBC (Massive Beamforming for Control) is developed for control channel and common signals to improve the coverage.	automatic sounding;beamforming;channel state information;compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;hybrid automatic repeat request;mbc-55x;mimo;mobile phone;next-generation network;requirement;test-driven development	Lixia Xue;Yan Cheng;Yongxing Zhou;Bingyu Qu	2015	2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421296	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	24.722320638071263	87.84661233955023	92767

Firstly, the intercept probability for radar network systems is derived. Then, an adaptive resource management scheme based on LPI is proposed, in which a novel objective function for LPI performance is defined and minimized by optimizing the revisit interval, dwell time, and transmit power in radar networks to guarantee a specific target tracking accuracy with passive time difference of arrival and frequency difference of arrival cooperation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adaptive resource management scheme over other methods via Monte Carlo simulations.

The cluster is illuminated with different gain antennas (emulated beamforming gains). The analysis reveal that the measured channel impulse response (CIR) is approximately circular (or circularly symmetric) with correlated inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. These properties correspond to the sparse multipath channels and are different from the Rayleigh/Rician fading channels which assume that the I and Q components are mutually uncorrelated colored Gaussian variates. These differences prevent the application of the Rayleigh/Rice fading models in the intra-cluster multipath modeling.		Naveed Iqbal;Jian Luo;Diego A.

Because these devices might be always connected in wireless to the internet, the demands for wireless access is extremely increased according to the rapidly increasing the number of smart devices. To satisfy the request for the wireless connectivity and enhance the average throughput in a cell, IEEE 802.11ac standard released the multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) technique to transmit simultaneously to the multiple stations (STAs) from an access point (AP). However, we can expect the interference problem between basic service set (BSS) with MU-MIMO is getting worse by haphazard installation of the wireless APs. There exist various interference management schemes in these days, however, interference alignment (IA) has received much attention as making the concurrent transmission possible without causing any interferences in the multi-user interference channels. In previous IA approach method for MU-MIMO interference broadcasting channels (IBC), there are some drawbacks such as necessity of the cooperation between APs, requirement for the number of antenna to operate the algorithms and so on. In this paper, we propose a simple IA transceiver design to adopt in IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO network and solve the problem of the existing works. And we also show the performance analysis by simulation comparisons.	algorithm;information-based complexity;interference (communication);laptop;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);simulation;smart device;smartphone;tablet computer;throughput;transceiver;wireless access point	Jinhyung Oh;Jaeick Choi;Myungsun Song;Hyung-Do Choi	2014	2014 14th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2014.7011866	electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;engineering;radio resource management;co-channel interference;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	29.51847624176801	88.34437606937202	93334

Nonetheless, Baum et al. (2004) have shown that phase noise of the transmitter and receiver local oscillators, when it is assumed to be a white Gaussian random process, can cause up to around 100 % errors of the estimated channel capacity of a low-rank MIMO channel when using the standard channel matrix estimator. Experimental evidence shows that consecutive phase noise samples affecting measurement samples collected with real TDM-MIMO channel sounders are correlated. In addition the spatio-temporal aperture induced by the selected switching schemes has an impact on the ordering of the phase noise samples in the estimation of the channel matrix estimate. This paper investigates how both effects affect the channel capacity estimator based on the standard channel matrix estimator. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations that by using an experimentally obtained ARMA model of phase noise the predicted error of the ergodic capacity estimate is reduced compared to the case where phase noise is white and Gaussian. We also show that the estimated ergodic capacity is highly influenced by the choice of the spatio-temporal aperture.	automatic sounding;baum–welch algorithm;channel capacity;ergodicity;experiment;gaussian process;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;monte carlo method;multiplexing;phase noise;reduced cost;simulation;stochastic process;toad data modeler;transmitter	Troels Pedersen;Xuefeng Yin;Bernard Henri Fleury	2008	2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.635	stochastic process;telecommunications;mathematics;precoding;channel capacity;statistics;monte carlo method	Mobile	38.51107548661206	75.93234185620948	93425

However, for non-Gaussian channels the FDD is up to now an unsolved problem and closed form general solutions are still unknown. In this paper we use an orthogonal series expansion to analyze the FDD for the rather general case of Nakagami fading channels. Our results show that the fade duration distribution, for both asymptotic and no-asymptotic threshold levels, can be approximated by a simple closed form function: the Gamma distribution. This approximation is validated by means of several statistical goodness of fit tests. We show that the parameters of the approximated Gamma distribution can be computed a priori through the fade duration statistics, namely the average and variance.

The Short Data Service (SDS) of TETRA in the Direct Mode Operation (DMO) allows an infrastructure-less exchange of traffic relevant information between vehicles in range of the communication. The propagation channel in case of such a direct (base station free) communication between railway vehicles underlies specific effects, which are not equivalent to other well known terrestrial mobile scenarios. We will present measurements covering urban, suburban and rural environments along a regional railway network in the south of Bavaria. Beside different operational conditions such as front, rear, and flank approaches of trains, we investigated several topological scenarios on both, single and double track sections along the line. We will also discuss the observed characteristic changes in narrow band signal attenuation and Doppler spectra for passages through forests, hilly areas, stations and a tunnel. We determined statistics for the transmission delay of messages and the message erasure rates for single and multi user access on a single common carrier for different transmission intervals. Finally, the quality of service for the envisaged safety applications is assessed.	a-train;device driver;direct mode;directx;experiment;hoc (programming language);multi-user;multipath propagation;pulse-doppler radar;quality of service;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications network;terrestrial television;ultra high frequency	Andreas Lehner;Cristina Rico Garcia;Thomas Strang	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0656-9	vehicular ad hoc network;direct method;web service;active traffic management;mobile ad hoc network;systems modeling;numeral prefix;telecommunications;computer science;path loss;ultra high frequency;wireless network;empirical research;mobile computing;computer security;measurement;computer network;channel	Mobile	26.583607227613328	76.16579293222782	93657

In OFDM, several consecutive subcarriers are grouped as a frequency subband. Each subband in a frame can be reused by several users with smart antennas. In this paper, based on the best-fit algorithm proposed for TDMA and the physical features of OFDM, a new packet scheduler is proposed to allocate different BER-classified traffics into the frame. Adaptive modulation is also applied in the scheduler. When compared with existing schedulers, our scheduler achieves higher system capacity with much reduced complexity. The use of adaptive modulation further enhances the system capacity. Simulation results demonstrate that as the traffic load increases, the new scheduler has much better performance in system throughput, average delay, and packet loss rate	adaptive filter;algorithm;channel capacity;complexity;curve fitting;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;network packet;network scheduler;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;smart antenna;subcarrier;throughput;x.690	Zhifeng Diao;Dongxu Shen;Victor O.

fff2b51d0cffa4fcbec3c1c802b3d55e13637456	robust trajectory planning for robotic communications under fading channels		We consider a new problem of robust trajectory planning for robots that have a physical destination and a communication constraint. Specifically, the robot or automatic vehicle must move from a given starting point to a target point while uploading/downloading a given amount of data within a given time, while accounting for the energy cost and the time taken to download. However, this trajectory is assumed to be planned in advance (e.g., because online computation cannot be performed). Due to wireless channel fluctuations, it is essential for the planned trajectory to be robust to packet losses and meet the communication target with a sufficiently high probability. This optimization problem contrasts with the classical mobile communications paradigm in which communication aspects are assumed to be independent from the motion aspects. This setup is formalized here and leads us to determining non-trivial trajectories for the mobile, which are highlighted in the numerical result.		Daniel Bonilla Licea;Vineeth S.

Instead of the traditional collision model, a more realistic physical layer model is considered in our work. Based on this model, an Incremental Redundancy Automatic Repeat reQuest (IR-ARQ) scheme, tailored to jointly combat the effects of collisions, multi-path fading, and additive noise, is developed. The Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay tradeoff (DMDT) of the proposed scheme is analyzed for fully-loaded queues, and compared with that of Gallager tree algorithm for collision resolution and the network-assisted diversity multiple access (NDMA) protocol of Tsatsanis et al.. The fully-loaded queue model is then replaced by one with random arrivals, under which these protocols are compared in terms of the stability region, average delay and diversity gain. Overall, our analytical and numerical results establish the superiority of the proposed IR-ARQ scheme and reveal some important insights. For example, it turns out that the performance is optimized, for a given total throughput, by maximizing the probability that a certain user will send a new packet and minimizing the transmission rate employed by each user.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;hash table;hybrid automatic repeat request;list of algorithms;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;network packet;numerical analysis;random access;throughput;utility functions on indivisible goods	Young-Han Nam;Praveen Kumar Gopala;Hesham El Gamal	2006	CoRR		telecommunications;information theory;computer science;distributed computing;automatic repeat request;physical layer;random access;statistics;computer network	Metrics	34.249260755039685	78.5988665167631	93863

The secondary transmitter steers its transmission into the direction of its intended destination in order to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio. Under this beam-forming strategy, the power allocation is optimized to achieve the ergodic capacity under the constraint that the long-term interference, caused at the primary receiver, will not exceed a predefined threshold. Assuming line-of-sight communication (Rician fading) for the secondary link and Rayleigh fading for the secondary-to-primary link channel, we derive the exact closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity.

Hence, how to protect the secrecy data transmitted through the wireless environment has been an assignable problem. In our research, the problem we try to solve in this paper is to find an algorithm to enhance the system security by beamforming. We assume that the channel matrices are fixed and known to the sender and legal receiver, but the eavesdropper could not get the precise channel matrices. On the basis of the above assumptions, two wiretap channel models in different users conditions are proposed and algorithms under the models are researched. Numerical results of secrecy capacity and secrecy sum rate under the two models are also provided.	algorithm;beamforming;numerical analysis;performance;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;smartphone	Ciyuan Gao;Shuai Han;Xuedong Wang;Weixiao Meng;Fang Gao	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450291	computer network;secrecy;physical layer;wireless;distributed computing;beamforming;communication source;matrix (mathematics);algorithm;communication channel;signal-to-noise ratio;computer science	Mobile	34.93450192221027	82.76705479596828	94249

The mmWave parameters are directly compared to the microwave channel present in LTE-A. Cellular deployment in both bands is then simulated for a 500 m by 500 m regqasion of central Bristol. The impact of different antenna geometries is also studied. Due to the trade-offs between the number of required BSs and the cost of network deployment, we propose a converged mmWave/microwave network for improved user experience.	angularjs;compaq lte;gigabit;k-factor (cisco);microwave;ray tracing (graphics);software deployment;throughput;user experience	Nor Fadzilah Abdullah;Djamal E.

In NLOS case, the frequency dependent factor (FDF) is observed as 32.1 by fitting the PL model of 2.35 GHz and 4.90 GHz. Moreover, a larger rms DS in urban microcell and AS at both base station (BS) and mobile subscriber (MS) are found for the denser and higher buildings in the cities of China. As the frequency varying from 580 MHz to 4.90 GHz, the median rms DS is decreased from 330 ns to 130 ns for NLOS case.	angularjs;audio power;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;mean squared error;offset binary;portable document format;qualitative comparative analysis;software propagation	Jianhua Zhang;Di Dong;Yanping Liang;Xin Nie;Xinying Gao;Yu Zhang;Chen Huang;Guangyi Liu	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699932	qualitative comparative analysis;root mean square;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;non-line-of-sight propagation;path loss;base station;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	26.05942249669455	78.38977168102163	94637

The particularity of our approach is to rely on non-binary LDPC codes at the source, coupled with non-binary repetition codes at the relays. A simple joint decoding strategy is used at the receiver end, so that the decoding complexity is not increased compared to a system without relays, while preserving the coding gain brought by re-encoding the signal at the relays. We show by simulations that the proposed scheme allows maintaining a constant gap to the outage probability of the cooperative system, irrespective of the number of relays.	coding gain;consensus dynamics;cooperative mimo;downtime;low-density parity-check code;naive bayes classifier;qr code;relay;simulation	Valentin Savin;David Declercq;Stephan Pfletschinger	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		list decoding;concatenated error correction code;electronic engineering;telecommunications;sequential decoding;mathematics;communication;error floor	HPC	35.29963481697671	75.91660128548403	94652

However, averaging the generalized Marcum-Q function over fading statistics often results in complicated special functions and/or infinite series based expressions. Motivated by the need for simple expressions without compromising the accuracy, we propose a new representation for the probability density function (PDF) of the fading channel gain. This representation is then used to derive simple, unified expression for asymptotic miss-detection probability in closed-form. The derived expression is evaluated for several fading channels and antenna diversity schemes. Numerical results reveal its high accuracy over a wide range of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) (as low as 0 dB) unlike the existing asymptotic expression which is accurate only for high SNR regime (say, SNR ≥ 20 dB).	portable document format;signal-to-noise ratio	Vesh Raj S.

Based on the bi-level optimization method, the proposed optimization problem is divided into two single-variable convex optimization sub-problems: the upper level for threshold optimization and the lower level for power optimization. The simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization can achieve desirable improvement on the throughput with different sub-channel gains.

The objective of the new feedback design is to adaptively control the feedback rate of each user, depending on the individual channel status, while the overall sum feedback rate is kept the same. The proposed channel feedback scheme is composed of two stages: 1) the common channel feedback stage of all users and 2) the user-specific channel feedback stage of the selected users. We present a low-complexity algorithm to determine the individual feedback rates of users, which utilizes convex optimization, followed by iterative steepest descent direction searching. Numerical results show that zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), combined with the proposed channel feedback scheme, considerably outperforms ZFBF with conventional channel feedback schemes.	algorithm;beamforming;codebook;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;descent direction;feedback;gradient descent;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;numerical method;overhead (computing);telecommunications link	Illsoo Sohn;Chang Soon Park;Kwang Bok Lee	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2184807	zero forcing equalizer;gradient descent;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;convex optimization;quantization;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio;mimo	Mobile	39.07611834482617	85.95359899491545	94849

A new simulation model for generating signal fading due to a swaying tree has been developed by utilizing a multiple mass-spring system to represent a tree and a turbulent wind model. The model is validated in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF), autocorrelation function (ACF), level crossing rate (LCR), and average fade duration (AFD) using measurements. The agreements found between the measured and simulated firstand second-order statistics of the received signals through vegetation are satisfactory. In addition, Ricean K-factors for different wind speeds are estimated from measurements. Generally, the new model has similar dynamical and statistical characteristics as those observed in measurements and can thus be used for synthesizing signal fading due to a swaying tree. The synthesized fading can be used for simulating different capacity enhancing techniques such as adaptive coding and modulation and other fade mitigation techniques.

Unlike existing models, the distributed jammers also have data to send to their respective destinations and are allowed to access Alice's channel if it can transmit sufficient jamming power, which is referred to as collaborative jamming in this paper. For the power used to deliver its own signal, the jammer should pay Alice. The price of the jammers' signal power is set by Alice and provides a tradeoff between the signal and the jamming power. This paper presents, in closed-form, an optimal price that maximizes Alice's benefit and the corresponding optimal power allocation from a jammers' perspective by assuming that the network-wide channel knowledge is shared by Alice and jammers. For a multiple-jammer scenario where Alice hardly has the channel knowledge, this paper provides a distributed and interactive price-searching procedure that geometrically converges to an optimal price and shows that Alice by a greedy selection policy achieves certain diversity gain, which increases log-linearly as the number of (potential) jammers grows. Various numerical examples are presented to illustrate the behavior of the proposed model.	alice in wonderland syndrome;allocation;channel state information;data dredging;greedy algorithm;hearing loss, high-frequency;in-system programming;interference (communication);iteration;maxillary right central incisor abutment;node - plant part;numerical analysis;radio jamming;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;simulation	Dae-Kyo Jeong;Insook Kim;Dongwoo Kim	2017		10.3390/s17112697	wireless sensor network;simulation;engineering;electronic engineering;stackelberg competition;jamming;diversity gain;distributed computing;communication channel	Mobile	34.38457250683381	85.42330258133943	95293

We propose new protocols that use the available feedback bits not only to request a retransmission, but also to inform the transmitter about the channel quality. We give an explicit protocol construction for any number of retransmissions and any number of feedback bits. We show remarkable throughput improvements, especially at low and moderate SNR, where our protocols can perform power control thanks to the partial channel state obtained through feedback. For the case of a single retransmission and a single feedback bit, we show that the repetition is not needed at low SNR and that the throughput improvement is due to power control only. On the other hand, at high SNR the repetition is useful and the performance comes form a combination of power control and ability to resend.	acknowledgement (data networks);ergodicity;hybrid automatic repeat request;numerical analysis;requests;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;transmitter	Jean Perret;Daniela Tuninetti	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.252	block code;communications protocol;telecommunications;power control;computer science;fading;statistics;computer network	Robotics	33.81146967160715	75.67262502072826	95319

Based on the statistics of the harvested energy and dynamics of energy flow at each sensor, we propose a provably efficient online energy allocation policy for distributed estimation with sensor collaboration. The proposed online policy relies on solving an offline non-convex optimization problem, in which the estimation distortion is minimized subject to energy and network topology constraints. We employ semidefinite programming to find the globally-optimal solution of the non-convex problem. We show that the proposed online policy is asymptotically consistent and provide mean square error of the optimal offline solution over an infinite time horizon.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;convex optimization;distortion;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;network topology;numerical method;online and offline;optimization problem;semidefinite programming;sensor	Sijia Liu;Vinod Sharma;Pramod K.

Firstly, we reduce the feedback information of requests for data retransmission by employing the recently developed incremental redundancy channel code, namely rateless code, for the data transmission of secondary users. Then by jointly considering the effects of multi-user cooperative sensing and multi-user MISO beamforming to the system performances, we propose a feedback bit allocation method for both the spectrum sensing results and the quantized channel state information under a sum feedback amount constraint, so as to maximize the throughput of cognitive radio network while protecting primary user from interference. Finally, simulation results are shown to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	beamforming;channel state information;codebook;coding theory;cognitive network;cognitive radio;feedback;hybrid automatic repeat request;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;performance;quantization (image processing);retransmission (data networks);simulation;spectral efficiency;system analysis;throughput	Shaolei Chen;Zhaoyang Zhang;Xiaoming Chen	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362716	cognitive radio;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;feedback;computer network	Mobile	37.552843170318134	87.3554812184541	95594

In this paper, we investigate the Nakagami-m fading channel capacity with full CSI, and show that the capacity of this channel scales essentially as Ω/m SNR log (1/SNR), where m is the Nakagami-m fading parameter and where Ω is the channel mean-square. We also show that one-bit CSI at the transmitter is enough to achieve this asymptotic capacity using an On-Off power control scheme. Our framework may be seen as a generalization of previous works as it captures the Rayleigh fading channel as a special case by taking m = 1.	channel capacity;channel state information;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Zouheir Rezki;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2012	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2012.041012.120127	fading distribution;transmitter;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;channel state information;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;computer network	Mobile	38.18645433161367	75.14139590056048	96014

Terrestrial systems are unable to satisfy these demands in all geographical areas and thus broadband access by satellite is a key service provision platform. Considering the traffic demands, the raw capacity should approach a Terabit/s by 2020 to meet these demands. The satellite communications network will be a star-based topology, where User Terminals (UT) from multiple beams communicate via central Gateway Earth Stations (GES). The return link from UT to satellite will use DVB-RCS2 Multi-Frequency Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA) transmission scheme in Ka band (30GHz), while the return feeder link from satellite to GES in Q band (40 GHz). Due to generation of large number of narrow user beams, the interference starts becoming a limiting factor in the system's dimensioning. Herein, interference coordination schemes, borrowed from terrestrial cellular systems, are examined in terms of applicability and C/I performance. In addition, an algorithm for dynamic interference coordination is proposed to schedule the transmissions of the users in time-frequency domain of the return link, aiming to improve the C/I. The performance of these schemes and the proposed algorithm is assessed over a 302 user beams satellite system with practical antenna radiation patterns.	a* search algorithm;color;communications satellite;data compression;digital video broadcasting;future internet;gateway (telecommunications);high-throughput satellite;interference (communication);internet access;ka band;modulation;q band;return channel;scheduling (computing);telecommunications network;terabit;terrestrial television;time–frequency analysis;zelda ii: the adventure of link	Ui Yi Ng;Argyrios Kyrgiazos;Barry G.

8a90d6c35957cc9396a05f9ea1237bf4654222ef	secrecy outage performance of multi-antenna wiretap channels with diversity combinings over correlated rayleigh fading channels		This paper presents a detailed secrecy outage performance analysis of correlated multi-antenna wiretap channels with three popular diversity combining schemes, namely maximal ratio combining, selection combining, and equal gain combining at the legitimate receiver. For single input multiple output wiretap channels, both exact and asymptotic expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of these systems. The findings suggest that, compared with the scenario where all the channels are independent, correlation of the main channels alone increases the SOP by a factor of 1/det(U), where det(U) is the determinant of correlation matrix U . In contrast, in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime at the legitimate receiver, correlation between the main channels and the eavesdropper channels has a positive effect on SOP. Moreover, for multiple input and multiple output wiretap channels, the SOP of two transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes are analyzed for the considered correlated channel model. The SOP relationship of the both TAS schemes is quantified by the secrecy array gain. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate the analytical results.	channel (communications);computer simulation;downtime;maximal set;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage;thermal-assisted switching	Jiangbo Si;Yuquan Li;Julian Cheng;Caijun Zhong	2018	CoRR		real-time computing;channel state information;mathematics;covariance matrix;expression (mathematics);topology;signal-to-noise ratio;rayleigh fading;maximal-ratio combining;diversity combining;communication channel	HCI	38.39802946522755	77.22115906437212	96390

We first present exact expressions for the marginal ordered eigenvalue distributions of the channel Gram matrix when multichannel beamforming is employed, from which we obtain exact results on the outage probability on each eigenmode. Our results are applicable to an extensive class of multichannel systems with generic system configurations. For particular scenarios of single-input multiple-output, keyhole, and multiple-input single-output channels, simplified closed-form expressions for the asymptotic distributions of the non-zero eigenvalue of the channel Gram matrix are derived. These results indicate that the diversity order is only determined by the second largest value among the number of transmit antennas, scatterers, and receive antennas. For these scenarios, we also derive concise closed-form expressions for the moments of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, from which an explicit relationship to the moments in Rayleigh fading channels is revealed. These results are also used to investigate the impact of the number of channel scatterers on the bandwidth requirements for a given transmission rate and power, at low signal-to-noise ratios.	beamforming;downtime;gramian matrix;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;mimo;marginal model;normal mode;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;surround sound	Yongpeng Wu;Shi Jin;Xiqi Gao;Chengshan Xiao;Matthew R.

We propose to exploit one kind of benefit available in cloud base-station, called scale effects, for MIMO detection by employing the scale effects oriented MIMO detector (SEOD). From this study, it can be found that SEOD is a feasible scheme being able to exploit two types of scale effects. The first type, called scale effect on diversity order, denotes the feature that the worst-case complexity per user of MIMO detection could decrease as the number of users increases while bringing no loss of diversity order; the second one, called scale effect on detecting outage, is the feature that the probability of detecting outage owing to the run-time limit is equal to or is asymptotic to a monotonic decreasing function of the number of users when fixing the worst-case complexity per user for MIMO detection. By using the large deviation principle (LDP), this work presents the proof of the existence of scale effect on detecting outage in SEOD which has not been obtained in literatures. Provided SEOD as a representative case, we also state the universal significance of exploiting scale effects for cloud base-station.	best, worst and average case;centralized computing;downtime;mimo;sensor;sun outage;worst-case complexity	Rongrong Qian;Yuan Qi;Tao Peng;Wenbo Wang;Ran Duan;Kuilin Chen	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477572	multi-user mimo;theoretical computer science;probability;communication complexity;mathematics;statistics;detection theory	Metrics	31.204327798970848	84.80927095873561	97409

The way the TACF and FCF are estimated depends on whether the measured channel is autocorrelation-ergodic with respect to time and/or frequency. In either case, it is shown that double averaging, i.e., averaging of measurement snapshots over time and frequency, improves the estimates of the TACF and FCF. We provide two examples of applying the iterative nonlinear least squares approximation (INLSA) algorithm to determine the parameters of measurement- based channel simulators from the estimated TACF and FCF. The presented examples correspond to real-world outdoor and indoor propagation environments. The distinctive feature of the designed channel simulators is that their temporal and frequency correlation characteristics are sufficiently close to those that have been estimated from the measurement data. For comparison reasons, we also show the corresponding results obtained by applying the well-known subspace-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm.	approximation;autocorrelation;bandwidth (signal processing);ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;non-linear least squares;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Dmitry Umansky;Matthias Pätzold	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.78	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;information engineering;autocorrelation;nonlinear system;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	27.029834874491815	77.39725769471448	97550

As the ever growing demand for data consumption necessitates higher rates and volumes, it is fairly common to observe more and more WLANs being deployed in close proximity to each other. As distances between WLAN installations diminish, the access points (APs) and stations (STAs) in these WLANs create a complex interference environment, which is also compounded by the indoor propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate the impact of two important parameters related to the deployment and operation of densely deployed wireless LANs on the aggregate throughput obtained by all the nodes in these WLANs. The first such operational parameter we investigate is access point and user station association; namely, whether STAs associate with a random """"strong"""" AP or the AP from which they obtain the strongest received power. The second operational parameter we consider is the way in which APs are placed in the indoor environment; namely, whether APs are deployed randomly or in a manner to reduce inter-AP interference. In order to account for the complex node interactions in the MAC layer, which is crucial for accurate performance estimation, we perform packet-level simulations using OPNET. Our results show that the type of node association used in densely deployed WLANs has a critical impact on the aggregate throughput. In comparison, the type of AP deployment used is not nearly as significant; varying from moderate to no impact at all."""	aggregate data;interaction;interference (communication);network packet;randomness;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;throughput;wireless access point;wireless router	Ali Ozyagci;Ki Won Sung;Jens Zander	2014	2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2014.7022839	attenuation;throughput;electronic engineering;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;computer science;engineering;interference;wireless lan controller;wi-fi array;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Mobile	25.421003553850234	84.23514657909817	97643

Distortion exponent (i.e., the SNR exponent of the average distortion) is taken to evaluate the system performance in the high SNR regime. We prove that the HD-NAF relay network with two-layered codes corresponds to a successive refinable diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) curve.With the identified property, a closed-form expression for an achievable upper bound of the system distortion exponent is derived, which can be achieved via properly allocated power and rate of each layer. Numerical evaluation is conducted to show performance advantages of the considered two-layered HD-NAF protocol against its counterparts.	anisotropic filtering;code;digital monetary trust;direction finding;distortion;duplex (telecommunications);intel hd and iris graphics;multiplexing;nato architecture framework;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Payam Padidar;Pin-Han Ho;James Ho	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555085	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;multiplexing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.99350682648582	75.9842607826591	97829

Through detailed simulations and testbed experiments, the impact of increasing density of highly-adaptive service provider APs on the performance of typical residential APs is measured in terms of their respective channel assignment schemes. Simulation results with dense deployment of up to 500 APs/sq.km. show the benefits of centralized channel assignments, even in the presence of independent APs. In addition, it is shown that for a fixed AP density, an increase in the percentage of AP under the centralized scheme results in an increase in the throughput of surrounding independent APs. The broader implications of the simulation findings are discussed in order to develop a better macro-level understanding of dense Wi-Fi networks.	centralized computing;experiment;simulation;software deployment;testbed;throughput;wireless access point	Akash Baid;Dipankar Raychaudhuri	2015	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2015.7010523	throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;computational model;measurement;computer network	Mobile	26.58163059087332	85.86543125173385	98071

Multiple-sector antenna arrays are known to be able to provide capacity enhancement by means of interference reduction through spatial filtering. In this paper, the performance of an eightelement circular array acting as an Access Point (AP) in indoor wireless LAN environments is analysed. Spatial-temporal channel data used within the analysis was obtained from physical measurements within numerous indoor environments using a state-of-the-art wideband vector signal analyser. Performance analysis of the array employing a switched-sector controller within Hiperlad2 standard is appraised in terms of carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratios. Results show that an isolation of up to 15dB can be achieved between the two polarisations by means of using an antenna array at the AP. It is shown that 54% of the time, 2 users per timeslot can be supported by the system.	array data structure;beamforming;channel capacity;frequency band;interference (communication);memory-mapped i/o;profiling (computer programming);system of measurement;vector signal analyzer	L.

9a62ee0552b04bcd480b257ecf412e6dd9022ccf	modeling and performance analysis of uav-assisted cellular networks in isolated regions		Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides a quick and feasible solution to urgent communications in isolated region, in which reliable wireless communication link is unavailable through conventional terrestrial base stations (BSs). In this paper, we model the UAV- assisted cellular network with isolated region as a homogeneous Poisson point process in the infinite 2D plane with a circular nulling area. Within the circular area, users are served by a UAV-mounted BS hovering at the center of this area. We apply a probabilistic multi-slope path-loss large-scale model as well as Nakagami-m small-scale model to characterize the air- to-ground channel. With mathematical tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the coverage probability of the users located within the isolated region. Based on the derived expression, we show the existence of the optimal UAV altitude to achieve the maximal coverage probability. We further investigate the impacts of isolated region size and ground BS density on the optimal UAV altitude and the achievable maximal coverage probability.	aerial photography;channel (communications);maximal set;point process;profiling (computer programming);telecommunications link;terrestrial television;unmanned aerial vehicle	Xianling Wang;Haijun Zhang;Victor C.

An exact analysis scheme on the decoding error probability of the proposed system is established and the constant target degrees are optimized so that the average throughput is maximized. Numerical results reveal that cooperation among BSs results in much higher throughput than the original frameless ALOHA and optimized target degree provides the further performance improvement. Also, we consider the use of multiple degrees with probability mass function, namely degree distribution, in frameless ALOHA and show that multiple target degrees does not provide large gain compared with the constant degree distribution.	aloha editor;bell laboratories layered space-time;degree distribution;interference (communication);network packet;throughput	Shun Ogata;Koji Ishibashi	2015	2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421078	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Metrics	33.90207917167299	76.30098395229382	98470

Impact of emission constraints on direct sequence (DS-) UWB communications that use arbitrary chip-duty is discussed in this letter. Depending on the communication pulse shape, a minimum chip-duty below which average emission cannot be increased with bandwidth, or in other words, permissible average emission limit cannot be reached due to the peak constraint is pointed. Effect of the emission constraints on the system capacity is also investigated and compared with the same with no constraint.

Our proposed approach minimizes the total distortion while satisfying the constraint of transmission power, which is achieved by optimal power allocation and transmission rate control with power-efficient assignment of scalable source to spatial subchannels. The performance of our proposed scheme is compared with the one using fixed transmission rate or power allocation.

49abf8bbe40e2f52240f58d63f24ed0bf0125015	a thresholding-based antenna switching in mimo cognitive radio networks with swipt-enabled secondary receiver		Simultaneous wireless power and information transfer (SWIPT) in a cognitive radio (CR) network is considered where a multiple antenna energy harvesting (EH) secondary receiver (SR) harvests the energy using the antenna switching (AS) technique. In fact, the AS technique selects a subset of the SR antennas to decode the information (namely the information decoding (ID) antennas) and the rest to harvest the energy (namely the EH antennas). In this context, we propose a thresholding-based antenna selection strategy, termed as the prioritizing data selection (PDS) scheme, which selects the ID antennas such that the received power from the secondary transmitter (ST) at these antennas is above a certain threshold. For this scheme, we derive the analytic expressions of the probability mass function (PMF) of the selected ID antennas, the average harvested energy, and the outage probability. In the simulation results, we illustrate the performance of the PDS scheme and we compare it to the prioritizing energy selection (PES) scheme which selects the EH antennas such that the received power from ST at these antennas is above a certain threshold. For both schemes, we show that there is a tradeoff between the outage probability and the average harvested energy.	cognitive radio;downtime;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;mimo;potential energy surface;simulation;sun outage;thresholding (image processing);transmitter	Fatma Benkhelifa;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996411	wireless;mimo;cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;transmitter;decoding methods;electronic engineering;thresholding;smart antenna;computer science;probability mass function	Mobile	34.98430652631524	85.69482842883284	99487

It is also found that two-branch antenna diversity reception at the base can improve the capacity by 2.2-2.3 times and the shadowing with a standard deviation of 10 dB decreases the capacity by 10-15% in comparison with that for 2 dB standard deviation.

8135e3ede0713ab1bb60c5e7344bd69773efd9aa	coordinated multiple-relays based physical-layer security improvement: a single-leader multiple-followers stackelberg game scheme		In this paper, a coordinated multiple-relays-based cooperative communication scheme is proposed to improve the physical-layer security. In order to benefit the relays in forwarding the signals for defending against the eavesdropping attacks, the interactions between the source and the multiple relays are modeled as a single-leader multiple-followers Stackelberg game. The source plays as the leader to coordinate the relays, including the phase of signals forwarded by the relays and the transmit power of the relays, for maximizing the secrecy capacity of the system. An algorithm is developed for the relays to find an optimal price allocation to achieve the fairness among the multiple relays based on the egalitarian welfare solution, and an approximate optimal strategy of source (i.e., phase coordinated vector and power allocation) is studied. The closed-form intercept probability of the proposed scheme is derived. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the utilities of both the source and multiple relays over that resulted from the Nash equilibrium scheme and rand scheme, which means that the relays are more willing to participate in the cooperative communication, and the source can achieve better secure transmission based on the proposed scheme. It is also shown that the proposed scheme performs much better in defending against the eavesdropping attacks than those existing schemes, for example, the single relay selection scheme, the opportunistic relay selection scheme, the optimal relay scheme, and cooperative jamming scheme.	approximation algorithm;austin model 1;convex function;convex optimization;cooperative multitasking;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;interaction;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pseudorandom number generator;radio jamming;rei toei;relay;secure transmission;visual intercept	He Fang;Li Xu;Xianbin Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2017.2746001	wireless network;computer science;transmitter power output;secure transmission;computer network;physical layer;stackelberg competition;relay;nash equilibrium;eavesdropping	Mobile	34.85831376400777	83.70203035165702	99758

This paper studies the influence of shadowing on the statistical properties of the channel capacity. The problem is addressed by using a Suzuki process as an appropriate statistical channel model for land mobile terrestrial channels. Using this model, exact solutions for the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), level-crossing rate (LCR), and average duration of fades (ADF) of the channel capacity are derived. The results are studied for different levels of shadowing, corresponding to different terrestrial environments. It is observed that the shadowing effect has a significant influence on the variance and the maximum value of the PDF and LCR of the channel capacity, but it has almost no impact on the mean capacity of the channel. The correctness of the theoretical results is confirmed by simulation using a stochastic channel simulator based on the sum-of-sinusoids principle.	channel (communications);channel capacity;correctness (computer science);portable document format;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;terrestrial television	Gulzaib Rafiq;Matthias Pätzold	2009	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-008-9545-7	statistical model;probability density function;peer review;telecommunications;cumulative distribution function;distribution function;log-normal distribution;estimation theory;channel capacity;statistics	Mobile	27.670004676784327	75.90314994113956	100255
ee857ed9dfb7350bbc917f9a22f846bbdf076aa5	tensor modelling of mimo communication systems with performance analysis and kronecker receivers		Abstract The purpose of this paper is manifold. In a first part, we present a new alternating least squares (ALS)-based method for estimating the matrix factors of a Kronecker product, the so-called Kronecker ALS (KALS) method. Four other methods are also briefly described. In a second part, we consider the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems using tensor modelling. Eight systems are presented in a unified way, and their theoretical performance is compared in terms of maximal diversity gain. Exploiting a Kronecker product of symbol and channel matrices, and applying the algorithms introduced in the first part, we propose three semi-blind and two supervised receivers, called Kronecker receivers, for jointly estimating the channel and the transmitted symbols. Necessary identifiability conditions are established. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to compare the performance of three tensor-based systems, on the one hand, and of the five proposed Kronecker receivers for the tensor space-time-frequency (TSTF) coding system, on the other hand.	mimo;profiling (computer programming)	Michele Nazareth da Costa;Gérard Favier;João Marcos Travassos Romano	2018	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.12.015	mathematical optimization;mimo;tensor;kronecker delta;kronecker product;monte carlo method;mathematics;identifiability;matrix (mathematics);least squares	Networks	39.08945668994916	79.36540631711236	100449

In most prior work, perfect error detection is assumed to prevent relays that receive in error from forwarding. Since error detection is often performed at the medium access control (MAC) layer, each relay in the network needs to pass the received signal from the physical layer to the MAC layer before making the forwarding decision, resulting in the overhead that may not be necessary. Selection relaying thus has been proposed to avoid the MAC overhead at relays. The required election phase in selection relaying, however, needs to last for a deterministic duration proportional to the number of relays in a coordinated manner, or a non-deterministic duration in the absence of coordination. In this paper, we propose a cooperative relaying scheme that achieves diversity gain with a constant delay that is insensitive to the network size. In the proposed scheme, relays perform threshold testing instead of error detection, and a fix duration is allocated for the election phase. We analyze the end-to-end bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme in closed-form expressions, and prove the achievable diversity order. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the direct retransmission and the well-known opportunistic relaying scheme in terms of the end-to-end BER, average delay and delay variance.	access control;bit error rate;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;mrc (file format);multi-user mimo;numerical method;overhead (computing);power dividers and directional couplers;relay;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-noise ratio;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690	Kuang-Hao Liu	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506148	error detection and correction;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;signal-to-noise ratio;transmit diversity;physical layer;computer network	Mobile	34.79528227840665	78.13111913143621	100564

Given the known benefits of using IGS in interference-limited networks, we propose to use IGS to relieve the inter-relay interference (IRI) impact on the AR system assuming no channel state information is available at the source. In this regard, we assume that the two relays use IGS and the source uses proper Gaussian signaling (PGS). Then, we optimize the degree of impropriety of the relays signal, measured by the circularity coefficient, to maximize the total achievable rate. Simulation results show that using IGS yields a significant performance improvement over PGS, especially when the first hop is a bottleneck due to weak source-relay channel gains and/or strong IRI.	bmc remedy action request system;bottleneck (engineering);channel state information;interference (communication);jaccard index;matthews correlation coefficient;relay channel;simulation	Mohamed Gaafar;Osama Amin;Aïssa Ikhlef;Anas Chaaban;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2577029	database index;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;interference;channel state information;statistics	Metrics	35.42512203559366	77.1645135745273	100842

Density evolution is applied for asymptotic performance analysis, and subsequently used in a linear-programming design framework for optimizing the degree distribution at the rel ay in terms of overhead. Moreover a buffer is introduced at the relay to enable efficient downlink transmission even if pack ets are lost during uplink transmission. Performance losses interms of delay and/or erasure rates caused by link erasures during uplink transmission are thus alleviated. The proposed DLT codes provide significant improvements in overhead and deco ded erasure rates. Numerical results for finite-length codes fo llow closely the asymptotic analysis.

135a5bdeb1e2f7b2d62aa898e3378179c43d9d1b	energy-harvesting cognitive radio systems cooperating for spectrum sensing and utilization		In this paper, we study an energy-harvesting cognitive radio (CR) system where each secondary user (SU) harvests energy to recharge its battery. Cooperative spectrum sensing is employed to enhance the sensing performance. In this energy- constrained scenario, the SUs, as per their energy-arrival rates, can cooperate to achieve higher opportunistic spectrum utilization and improved primary user (PU) detection. For a heterogeneous CR system with different sensing environment and energy-arrival process at each SU, the optimal probability of sensing is obtained for each SU to maximize the SU network throughput while satisfying the PU collision and energy- causality constraints. SOSTOOLS is employed to solve the polynomial optimization problem, and a suboptimal scheme which can be used for larger systems is proposed. Furthermore, under a homogeneous scenario, it is shown that with a minimum number of SUs cooperating, the CR throughput performance can overcome the energy- causality and PU collision constraints.	causality;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;mathematical optimization;one-class classification;optimization problem;polynomial;queueing theory;rechargeable battery;superuser;throughput	Pratibha;Kwok Hung Li;Kah Chan Teh	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417161	throughput;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;reliability;cascading style sheets;computer network	Mobile	32.90936078939249	87.33064534241753	101190

In this paper, we mainly investigate the impact of the primary user traffic on the bit error rate (BER) of the secondary transmission, when the secondary user adopts adaptive transmission with a partially selected relay. In addition, the average collision time and the average collision probability have been used to measure the interference level caused by the secondary transmission to the primary users. Based on some selected numerical results, we can see that the primary user traffic seriously degrades the average BER. The worse-link partial selection can perform almost as well as the global selection when the channel conditions of the source-relay links and the relay-destination links are quite different. Although the relay selection improves the spectral efficiency of the secondary transmission, numerical results show that it only has slight impact on the overall average BER, which implies that the robustness of the system will not be affected by the relay selection.	bit error rate;cognitive radio;frequency band;interference (communication);internet relay chat;numerical analysis;spectral efficiency;x.690	Anlei Rao;Hao Ma;Mohamed-Slim Alouini;Yunfei Chen	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.010413.120341	cognitive radio;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	34.85808683281359	80.83646169834279	101263

abad23d0a5087c0e692d172edc149d61acfac18c	mimo precoding in underlay cognitive radio systems with completely unknown primary csi		This paper studies a novel underlay MIMO cognitive radio (CR) system, where the instantaneous or statistical c hannel state information (CSI) of the interfering channels to the primary receivers (PRs) is completely unknown to the CR. For the sing le underlay receiver scenario, we assume a minimum informatio n rate must be guaranteed on the CR main channel whose CSI is known at the CR transmitter. We first show that low-rank CR interference is preferable for improving the throughput of the PRs compared with spreading less power over more transmit dimensions. Based on this observation, we then propose a ran k minimization CR transmission strategy assuming a minimum information rate must be guaranteed on the CR main channel. We propose a simple solution referred to as frugal waterfilli ng (FWF) that uses the least amount of power required to achieve the rate constraint with a minimum-rank transmit covarianc e matrix. We also present two heuristic approaches that have b een used in prior work to transform rank minimization problems into convex optimization problems. The proposed schemes ar e then generalized to an underlay MIMO CR downlink network with multiple receivers. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the interference temperature and leakage rate outage probabil ities at the PR is presented for Rayleigh fading channels. We demonst rate that the direct FWF solution leads to higher PR throughput even though it has higher interference “temperature (IT) compared with the heuristic methods and classic waterfilling, which calls into question the use of IT as a metric for CR interference.	catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;convex optimization;downtime;heuristic;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;rayleigh fading;spectral leakage;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Amitav Mukherjee;Minyan Pei;A.

10205ed0685602c8a27a2a64c8f17a447c3efd62	optimal power allocation and active interference mitigation for spatial multiplexed mimo cognitive systems		In this paper, the performance of an underlay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio system is analytically studied. In particular, the secondary transmitter operates in a spatial multiplexing transmission mode, while a zero-forcing detector is employed at the secondary receiver. Additionally, the secondary system is interfered by multiple randomly distributed single-antenna primary users (PUs). To enhance the performance of secondary transmission, optimal power allocation is performed at the secondary transmitter with a constraint on the interference temperature (IT) specified by the PUs. The outage probability of the secondary receiver is explicitly derived in an exact closed-form expression. Also, some special cases of practical interest, including colocated PUs and massive MIMO, are discussed. Further, to mitigate instantaneous excessive interference onto PUs caused by the time-average IT, an iterative antenna reduction algorithm is developed for the secondary transmitter and, accordingly, the average number of transmit antennas is analytically computed. Extensive numerical and simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our analysis.	algorithm;cognitive radio;colocation centre;downtime;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;numerical analysis;randomness;simulation;spatial multiplexing;transmitter	Nikolaos I.

Our scheme includes two parts. In part one, we model the wireless relay network and analyze the secure connectivity by exploiting the secrecy graph. Then, when the result of the analysis is inferior to the security demands, our developed cooperative jamming strategy is kicked in to further assist the secure communications, which plays the important role in secure communications. In the cooperative jamming strategy, the channels established by candidate nodes are modeled as finite-state Markov channels (FSMCs) owing to the property of time-varying, and the remaining energy of nodes is considered as well. In addition, a jammer selection policy using simple priority index is depicted, taking secrecy capacity (SC) and energy balance into account. The major superiority of this scheme is to reduce unnecessary energy costs and system complexity, while assuring the security and reliability. Finally, the obtained simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing ones especially in terms of secrecy capacity and system reward.	cooperative mimo;markov chain;national security operations center;provisioning;quality of service;radio jamming;relay;requirement;secure communication;simulation	Li Wang;Xi Zhang;Mei Song;Tenghui Ke	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503801	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	30.932339792925628	88.07911492065425	101822

However, their performance can be compromised by the cross-tier interference with existing macrocell infrastructure or between adjacent femtocells, especially in the case of co-channel deployment. One way to address this, is adjusting the transmit power of every femto base station with respect for overall performance. To this direction, we have implemented a framework that simulates femtocell overlays over LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) macrocellular systems. The framework allows power management over user-defined femtocell deployment, deciding their power levels according to three different power schemes. The resulting throughput is presented for every point of the macrocell in a user-friendly GUI. In this paper, we present the design of this framework and discuss the results.	compaq lte;graphical user interface;interference (communication);multitier architecture;power management;software deployment;throughput;usability	Christos Bouras;Georgios Diles;Vasileios Kokkinos;Andreas Papazois	2012	2012 IFIP Wireless Days	10.1109/WD.2012.6402825	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	26.33928049493452	88.33757577389605	101846
2e020ca6d0d387da77976f667e8813e73b38039f	on the performance of network-coded cooperative ofdma systems with subcarrier allocation		In a recently proposed network-coded cooperation scheme, denoted as NCC-OFDMA, the authors adopt the random bipartite graph theory to allocate subcarriers and achieve optimal frequency diversity, in a scenario where $M$ users transmit independent information to a common destination with the help of $R$ relays, in a frequency-selective channel with $L$ coherence blocks. However, the analysis of the aforementioned scheme assumes that the subcarrier allocation algorithm is capable of providing full frequency diversity to all the links in the network, which generally does not hold in practice since the allocation is optimal only from the perspective of a single destination. Therefore, in this letter, we reevaluate the performance of NCC-OFDMA in a more realistic scenario where only the messages addressed to the destination benefit from the full frequency diversity provided by the subcarrier allocation algorithm. Our analysis, which assumes Nakagami-m fading, shows that the diversity order of NCC-OFDMA is considerably smaller, being actually m(R+L) instead of mL(R+1).	algorithm;graph theory;neural correlates of consciousness;relay;shortest path problem;subcarrier	Thiago Henrique Ton;João Luiz Rebelatto;Richard Demo Souza	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491064	subcarrier;computer network;fading;diversity scheme;computer science;bipartite graph;coherence (physics);nakagami distribution;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;communication channel	Embedded	35.786459191540864	77.57365256823022	101912
be144fcb6f2c75e706003f03eb55428136def35a	relay-aided interference alignment in wireless networks	wireless networks;interference alignment;doctoral thesis;mimo;relay	Resource management in wireless networks is one of the key factors in maximizing the overall throughput. Contrary to popular belief, dividing the resources in a dense network does not yield the best results. A method that has been developed recently shares the spectrum amongst all the users in such a way that each node can potentially utilize about half of all the available resources. This new technique is often referred to as Interference Alignment and excels based on the fact that the amount of the network resources assigned to a user does not go to zero as the number of users in the network increases. Unfortunately it is still very difficult to implement the interference alignment concepts in practice. This thesis investigates some of the low-complexity solutions to integrate interference alignment ideas into the existing wireless networks. In the third and fourth chapters of this thesis, it is shown that introducing relays to a quasi-static wireless network can be very beneficial in terms of achieving higher degrees of freedom. The relays store the signals being communicated in the network and then send a linear combination of those signals. Using the proposed scheme, it is shown that although the relays cannot decode the original information, they can transform the equivalent channel in such a way that performing interference alignment becomes much easier. Investigating the required output power of the relays shows that it can scale either slower or faster than the output power of the main transmitters. This opens new doors for the applications that have constraints on the accessible output powers in the network nodes. The results are valid for both X Channel and Interference Channel network topologies. In Chapter Five, the similarities between full-duplex transmitters and relays are examined. The results suggest that the transmitters can play the relay roles for offering easier interference alignment. Similar to the relay-based alignment, in the presented scheme fullduplex transmitters listen to the signals from other transmitters and use this information during the subsequent transmission periods. Studying the functionality of the full-duplex transmitters from the receivers’ side shows the benefits of having a minimal cooperation between transmitters without even being able to decode the signals. It is also proved that the degrees of freedom for the N -user Interference Channel with full-duplex transmitters can be √ N 2 . The results offer an easy way to recover a portion of degrees of freedom with manageable complexity suited for practical systems. iii	duplex (telecommunications);goto;interference (communication);network topology;relay;throughput;transmitter	Behzad Nourani	2011			electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;radio resource management;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	29.624853365768338	86.955754866546	101949

Our MC/SM-NOMA scheme allows information to one user to be conveyed by multiple subcarrier channels, and each subcarrier channel to be shared by multiple (two or more) users. We consider two subcarrier-allocation schemes and the subcarrier-by-subcarrier optimum power-allocation. The performance of the MC/SM-NOMA systems employing the proposed subcarrier- and power-allocation schemes is investigated in terms of spectral-efficiency based on simulations. Our studies demonstrate that the MC/SM-NOMA scheme is beneficial to high-flexibility implementation of NOMA for various purposes. Furthermore, allowing more users to share one subcarrier channel is capable of significantly increasing the achievable spectral-efficiency.	algorithm;mass effect trilogy;memory management;simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Yinyou Mao;Xingcheng Liu;Lie-Liang Yang	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330515	computer network;subcarrier;telecommunications link;wireless;computer science;data transmission;diversity scheme;spectral efficiency;communication channel	Mobile	35.41527697697333	84.96708984885838	102102

In order to provide better quality of service, the 3GB (3rd generation and beyond) systems need to distribute calls equitably to different carriers on different base-stations accessible to the mobiles irrespective of the bands or carriers on which those mobiles initiated their calls. However, there is a risk of call failure when a call originated on a carrier in a band is migrated to another carrier in a different band, particularly because of the differences in the radio coverage of the base-stations operating in different bands. This paper presents a class of methods that offer equal robustness against call failures and varying degrees of call distribution effectiveness. For call distribution, these methods employ an enhanced carrier capacity measure (ECM) proposed in this paper. ECM augments the gross capacities of the carriers (to house calls) with pre-configured biases specific to the mobile users. We develop here an intuitively appealing distribution-effectiveness measure based on the ECM for comparing the methods. Relative performances of the proposed methods with respect to call failure rate and distribution effectiveness are established by means of simulation results for calls originating anywhere in the cell coverage area as well as calls originating exclusively near the cell boundaries. The latter results help to study the effect of mobility on the performances of the algorithms.	algorithm;automatic call distributor;best practice;bin packing problem;brute-force search;computation;curve fitting;fail-safe;failure rate;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;performance;quality of service;radial (radio);real-time computing;simulation;system call	Parthasarathy Guturu;Abdennaceur Lachtar	2006	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2006.1611088	telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;computer network	Mobile	26.219865624892645	88.06174505726679	102181

The networks have high applicability to various new communications. Especially sensor networks are one of the attractive applications of the multihop multi-route networks. When the signals are transmitted over multiple routes, a route diversity effect would be possible. The effect can help to prevent performance degradation caused by quality loss of every route. Forward error correction schemes and turbo coding can be expected to enhance the route diversity. As it would be well known, a turbo encoder generates one message stream and two parity streams and the message stream is more important than the parity streams for reliable communications. Thus by allocating the message stream to a reliable route, the performance degradation could be prevented. In this paper, we examine the effect of the route diversity on multi-hop networks using turbo codes. The diversity effect against the quality loss of the multiple routes is investigated. The results suggest that the multi-route transmissions have high diversity effect. They also suggest that large performance degradation can be prevented by appropriate route assignment of the streams even though the link quality of the multiple routes can not be guaranteed.	additive white gaussian noise;binary symmetric channel;bit error rate;channel capacity;elegant degradation;encoder;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hoc (programming language);norm (social);reliability (computer networking);streaming media;subject matter expert turing test;turbo code;u.s. route shield;while;x.690	Tadahiro Wada;Hiraku Okada;Abbas Jamalipour;Kouji Ohuchi;Masato Saito	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255629	wireless ad hoc network;turbo code;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	31.937022645185966	74.51734280697649	102246

Unlike the existing works, the proposed method employ a simple approach for the capacity and outage analysis for receiver diversity channels operating at different signal-to-noise ratios depicted in the diagonal elements of matrix . With x being the channel gain vector, random variable of the form Y(a) = a + x∗ x is considered. Novelty of the work resides in the fact that the distribution of Y(a) is accurately determined by employing Fourier representation of unit step function followed by complex integration in a straight forward way. The ergodic channel capacity is thus calculated by using the first-order moment, E[ log2(Y(1))], while the outage probability for a certain threshold γ0 is evaluated using ∫ γ0 0 fY(0)(y)dy. Extensive experiments have been conducted demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed approach.	channel capacity;downtime;ergodicity;experiment;first-order predicate;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage	Muhammad Moinuddin;Imran Naseem	2013	EURASIP J.

The improved energy detector compares an arbitrary positive power p of the amplitude of the received samples of the signals of a primary user (PU)with a threshold to make a decision. The binary decision of each CR is forwarded over an imperfect reporting channel to a fusion center which makes a final decision on the presence of the PU. We obtain an expression of the total error rate of detection of a spectrum hole for this cooperative set-up. The optimized values of the normalized threshold and $p$ in each CR and optimal number of CRs required for the decision are obtained by minimizing the total error rate.

In particular, we consider a fluid environment where one transmitter nano-machine and one receiver nano-machine are subjected to Brownian motion in addition to the diffusive motion of the information molecules used for communication. Due to the stochastic movements of the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the statistics of the channel impulse response change over time. We show that the time-variant behavior of the channel can be accurately captured by appropriately modifying the diffusion coefficient of the information molecules. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the considered system. The accuracy of the proposed analytical expression is verified via particle-based simulation of the Brownian motion.	brownian motion;coefficient;gnu nano;norm (social);particle filter;semantics (computer science);simulation;transmitter	Arman Ahmadzadeh;Vahid Jamali;Adam Noel;Robert Schober	2017	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2678467	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Mobile	37.0019511165573	77.26275900220699	102602
476e940a156728f3fdb83809e00d1de3c5fa285f	energy efficient scheduling for loss tolerant iot applications with uninformed transmitter		In this work we investigate energy efficient packet scheduling problem for the loss tolerant applications. We consider slow fading channel for a point to point connection with no channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT). In the absence of CSIT, the slow fading channel has an outage probability associated with every transmit power. As a function of data loss tolerance parameters and peak power constraints, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average transmit energy for the user equipment (UE). The optimization problem is not convex and we use stochastic optimization technique to solve the problem. The numerical results quantify the effect of different system parameters on average transmit power and show significant power savings for the loss tolerant applications.	channel state information;combinatorial optimization;downtime;mathematical optimization;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;packet analyzer;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;stochastic optimization;transmitter	M.

This is the case of bandwidth constrained wireless communications where the overhead introduced by error control coding often turns out inefficient systems. On the other hand, MUPA protects data which exhibit different sensitivity to channel errors by distributing different transmission power to the modulation symbols according to the individual bit error sensitivities. MUPA has been studied in case of AWGN channel. In this work we propose an optimal power allocation scheme for the transmission of sensible data over fading channels. As to the optimization we rely on genetic algorithms (GA) which guarantee fast approximate solution with reduced complexity. Performance is evaluated on the Gilbert-Elliot (GE) model, extensively used in literature to reproduce the memory associated with radio channels.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;error detection and correction;forward error correction;genetic algorithm;gilbert cell;mathematical optimization;modulation;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming)	Maurizio Murroni	2008	2008 14th European Wireless Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Embedded	35.3258401230142	87.01192041691218	103085

A highly reflective ceiling creates an elevated image of the access point, which delivers a strong and reliable multipath component to the mobile terminal. Measurement results show that a small area of metallic ceiling above the transmitter can provide significant enhancement to the received signal power across a large room. Experiments with human bodies obstructing the line-of-sight path were performed to further examine the effectiveness of such an architectural modification. The improvement can be as high as 6.5 dB in cases where the line-of-sight path is obstructed by a human body. Moreover, the effectiveness of the metallic ceiling does not diminish with the distance from the transmitter. A comparison of measured and simulated results shows that ray tracing simulation can adequately approximate the results observed by measurement at 5.8 GHz.	approximation algorithm;decibel;experiment;line-of-sight (missile);mobile phone;multipath propagation;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;transmitter;wireless access point	Derek C.

Two of the DFHD and one of the DFFD protocols are known. One new, much simpler, DFHD protocol, and one new DFFD protocol are proposed. The fairness in comparing the protocols in terms of energy cost is formulated, and the protocols are compared to each other in a power-fair regime. The two previously proposed DFHD protocols, one of which is superior to the other under the PPC, are found to have almost the same performances when compared power-fairly. The proposed protocols are built upon opportunistic communication and power optimization such that, although inferior to their predecessors in a PPC regime, they can slightly surpass them under the APC.	direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);fairness measure;mathematical optimization;performance;power optimization (eda);relay;theory;throughput	Reza Nikjah;Norman C.

A cognitive protocol on the general multipacket reception channel model is adopted [1], [2], where the primary transmission may succeed even in the presence of secondary transmission. Thus the cognitive user can increase its throughput through not only utilizing the idle periods of the primary user also randomly accessing the channel by some probability. We also propose two system models different from the one presented in [2] that first, the secondary transmitter harvests energy for transmission, and second, both primary user (PU) and secondary user are equipped with rechargeable batteries. Then the maximum stable throughput region for the two proposed models are studied.	channel (communications);cognition;ibm systems network architecture;randomness;rechargeable battery;throughput;transmitter	Ruifeng Duan;Mohammed S.

399fe1a68f5d5877649be24858b02f7a89af61b6	3d vs. 2d channel models: spatial correlation and channel capacity comparison and analysis		Results of recent measurement campaigns demonstrate a significant increase in the degrees of freedom introduced by the elevation domain, and consequently, a large capacity gap as predicted by 3D and 2D MIMO channel models. To gain further insight into the effects of the elevation domain on MIMO system performance, we derive new spatial correlation (SC) expressions for 3D and 2D channel models, given rectangular arrays of cross-polarized antennas. The main result relates 3D SC to the 2D counterpart, allowing us to quantify the effects of the elevation domain on SC. Furthermore, our result allows us to derive the following three simple relationships between 2D and 3D correlations. We show that for a small elevation angle spread, the difference between 2D and 3D SCs grows quadratically in both vertical separation and angle spread. For the case of small vertical spacings, we derive a bound on the above correlation gap. Furthermore, we show that the elevation effects on correlation can be accurately decoupled, allowing us to express the 3D SC matrix as a Hadamard product of a 2D SC matrix and an elevation component. Collectively, our results demonstrate the need for accurate channel modeling when evaluating the performance of 3D MIMO systems.	3d modeling;channel capacity;correlation gap;mimo;mimo-ofdm	Yawei Yu;Peter J.

Both primary and cognitive links are subject to delay-QoS constraints. The achievable throughput subject to a given delay-QoS constraint can be quantified as the effective capacity of a link. We consider a system in which the primary user transmits with a constant power and utilizes an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme subject to its required bit error rate (BER). A link (power and rate) adaptation scheme is proposed for the interfering cognitive radio to maximize its effective capacity, while a minimum required effective capacity for the primary user is provisioned. A BER performance requirement and a power constraint are also considered for the cognitive radio. The resulting problem is then cast as a nonlinear discrete optimization problem for which a fast and efficient suboptimum solution is presented. Comparisons with the scheduled (non-interfering) adaptive cognitive transmission demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed interfering transmission scheme.	advanced mezzanine card;bit error rate;cognition;cognitive radio;discrete optimization;frequency band;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modulation;nonlinear system;optimization problem;quality of service;throughput;transmitter;x.690	Mehrdad Taki;Farshad Lahouti	2010	2010 17th International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/ICTEL.2010.5478785	discrete optimization;electronic engineering;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.74888853970109	86.97754282859243	103567

Several CMIMO strategies have been propounded as major candidates for achieving green communications in wireless sensor networks. Compared to conventional MIMO, CMIMO provides significant gains in terms of flexibility. Recently, more advanced cooperation strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of CMIMO by using emerging techniques such as spatial modulation and coding. Although some breakthroughs have been made in this area, the problem of how to accurately adopt these emerging techniques to model CMIMO is far from being fully understood. This article surveys several state-of-the-art CMIMO models for different scenarios, including data aggregated, multihop-based, and clustered schemes. Moreover, it discusses the implementation of CMIMO techniques, which are expected to be candidate techniques for green communications in modern applications. In the implementation, the trade-offs between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, quality of service, fairness, and security are discussed. Several simulation results are given to show how emerging techniques in CMIMO design can lead to energy efficiency enhancement.

Then, two different deployment strategies for hierarchical systems with multiple micro-cells are proposed and compared. The analysis results show that the cell throughput can be maximized by co-locating micro and macro-cell site with different frequency band. On the other hand, it is shown that both the fairness of QoS and the cell throughput is improved by deploying micro-cell at the edges of macro-cell.	cell (microprocessor);channel capacity;embedded system;fairness measure;frequency band;quality of service;software deployment;throughput	Sangbum Kim;Daehyoung Hong;Jaeweon Cho	2002		10.1109/WCNC.2002.993453	code division multiple access;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;hierarchical control system;channel capacity;computer network	Mobile	27.377688530848427	87.07964950986856	103928

Multiple sensors share a wireless medium over which they transmit measurements to their respective controllers, and due to the shared medium, packet collisions occur if sensors transmit simultaneously. To alleviate this problem, we propose random access policies that satisfy a desired control performance on each control loop, while also satisfying the energy constraints imposed by the energy harvesting process. The optimal scheduling policy is shown to follow a simple thresholding operation. Moreover, we provide a stochastic dual method for their computation, which is shown to be decoupled across sensors.

However, in a TDD/code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system, asymmetric traffic may result in severe opposite-direction interference because downlink transmitted signals from neighboring base stations may interfere with the uplink received signals of the home cell. In this paper, we investigate the effect of four-antenna beamforming schemes from the perspective of suppressing the opposite-direction interference. We compare the uplink bit energy-to-interference density ratio of a traditional beam-steering technique (Scheme I) with that of the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) beamformer (Scheme II). Furthermore, Scheme III applies the conventional beam-steering technique for both downlink transmissions and the uplink reception. In Scheme IV, we implement beam-steering for downlink transmissions, while adopting the MVDR beamformer to process the uplink signals received at base stations. Our numerical results indicate that Scheme IV outperforms all the other three schemes, which can effectively suppress the strong opposite-direction interference in TDD/CDMA systems. While keeping low implementation costs in mind, employing the simpler Scheme III in a sectorized cellular system can also allow every cell to provide different rates of asymmetric traffic services.	beamforming;data recovery;duplex (telecommunications);futures studies;interference (communication);numerical analysis;synergy;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Chiung-Jang Chen;Li-Chun Wang	2004	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2004.830941	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;beamforming	Mobile	27.365887901280445	87.38685680515849	104098
428441d515d4ed159e505bb1ff194b64a4bfc02b	blind estimation of statistical properties of non-stationary random variables	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	To identify or equalize wireless transmission channels, or alternatively to evaluate the performance of many wireless communication algorithms, coefficients or statistical properties of the used transmission channels are often assumed to be known or can be estimated at the receiver end. For most of the proposed algorithms, the knowledge of transmission channel statistical properties is essential to detect signals and retrieve data. To the best of our knowledge, most proposed approaches assume that transmission channels are static and can be modeled by stationary random variables (uniform, Gaussian, exponential, Weilbul, Rayleigh, etc.). In the majority of sensor networks or cellular systems applications, transmitters and/or receivers are in motion. Therefore, the validity of static transmission channels and the underlying assumptions may not be valid. In this case, coefficients and statistical properties change and therefore the stationary model falls short of making an accurate representation. In order to estimate the statistical properties (represented by the high-order statistics and probability density function, PDF) of dynamic channels, we firstly assume that the dynamic channels can be modeled by short-term stationary but long-term non-stationary random variable (RV), i.e., the RVs are stationary within unknown successive periods but they may suddenly change their statistical properties between two successive periods. Therefore, this manuscript proposes an algorithm to detect the transition phases of non-stationary random variables and introduces an indicator based on high-order statistics for non-stationary transmission which can be used to alter channel properties and initiate the estimation process. Additionally, PDF estimators based on kernel functions are also developed. The first part of the manuscript provides a brief introduction for unbiased estimators of the second and fourth-order cumulants. Then, the non-stationary indicators are formulated. Finally, simulation results are presented and conclusions are derived.	algorithm;channel (communications);coefficient;portable document format;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;stationary process;time complexity;transmitter	Ali Mansour;Raed Mesleh;Hadi M.

While the conventional half-duplex relay receives the signal from the source and forwards the re-encoded signal to the destination in two separated time slots, the full-duplex relay (FDR) performs the transmission and reception at the same time, which can ideally double the secrecy capacity. However, because of the simultaneous transmission and reception, each FDR suffers from both its own self-interference and the interference from the other cooperative FDRs. When the conventional cooperative relaying schemes are used in full-duplex relaying, it is obviously expected that the self-interference signals cause severe degradation of the secrecy capacity. Here, we propose an iterative transmit power allocation and relay beamforming weight design scheme for cooperative FDRs to enhance the secrecy rate as well as suppress the self-interference signals. Numerical results present that the FDRs with the proposed scheme significantly improve the secrecy rate compared with the conventional half-duplex relays.

Spectrum sharing, i.e., usage by the same frequency band by multiple operators, can improve the efficiency of the allocation. We analyze a scenario where two mobile operators managing neighboring cells also share a fraction of their available spectrum and quantify the performance gain. To this end, we propose a framework based on the definition of the Interference Suppression Ratio, which models effects such as beamforming or directional antennas. Depending on its value, mutual interference among the operators is reduced and sharing gains can be achieved. We implemented this framework in the well known open-source simulator ns-3 and we ran a parametric analysis of the impacting factors, including noise and cell radius. Simulation results confirm that significant gains can be achieved in terms of network capacity and throughput, provided that the Interference Suppression Ratio is above a given value.	beamforming;catastrophic interference;compaq lte;exclusive or;frequency allocation;frequency band;information systems research;interference (communication);numerical method;open-source software;performance evaluation;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;statistical interference;telecommunications network;throughput;whole earth 'lectronic link;zero suppression	Leonardo Badia;Riccardo Del Re;Francesco Guidolin;Antonino Orsino;Michele Zorzi	2013	"""2013 IEEE 14th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583414	cognitive radio;telecommunications;radio resource management;co-channel interference;computer network	Mobile	26.70434775752896	88.25840809786821	104359

Unlike the conventional automatic repeat request schemes, the proposed schemes do not require the use of cyclic-redundancy-check bits for error detection. The first scheme is based on choosing one or more predefined packet segments for retransmission. In the second scheme, random permutations are exploited to locate the bits for retransmission in the predefined window within the packet. The complexity-performance tradeoffs of the proposed schemes are investigated by computer simulations. For the same forward transmission rate, the bit error rate performance of the second scheme is found to be superior to the first scheme, and depending on the particular implementation, the second scheme may require less feedback bits.	automatic repeat request;bit error rate;computer simulation;cyclic redundancy check;error detection and correction;network packet;parity bit;retransmission (data networks);telecommunications link	Mohamed A.

ddab7554861e5aa8f3f2c0c30dec1a6a62779df8	coded unicast downstream traffic in a wireless network: analysis and wifi implementation	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	In this article, we design, analyze and implement a network coding based scheme for the problem of transmitting multiple unicast streams from a single access point to multiple receivers. In particular, we consider the scenario in which an access point has access to infinite streams of data to be distributed to their intended receivers. After each time slot, the access point receives acknowledgments on previous transmissions. Based on the acknowledgements, it decides on the structure of a coded or uncoded packet to be broadcast to all receivers in the next slot. The goal of the access point is to maximize the cumulative throughput or discounted cumulative throughput in the system. We first rigorously model the relevant coding problem and the information available to the access point and the receivers. We then formulate the problem using a Markov decision process with an infinite horizon, analyze the value function under the uncoded and coded policies and, despite the exponential number of states, devise greedy and semi-greedy policies with a running time which is polynomial with high probability. We then analyze the two users case in more detail and show the optimality of the semi-greedy policy in that case. Finally, we describe a simple implementation of the suggested concepts within a WiFi open-source driver. The implementation performs the network coding such that the enhanced WiFi architecture is transparent above the MAC layer.	bellman equation;downstream (software development);greedy algorithm;linear network coding;markov chain;markov decision process;network packet;open-source software;polynomial;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;single-access key;throughput;time complexity;transmitter;unicast;wireless access point;with high probability	Asaf Cohen;Erez Biton;Dor-Joseph Kampeas;Omer Gurewitz	2013	EURASIP J.

A model of five microcells is used to analyze the uplink. The capacity and the interference statistics of the microcell are studied for different antenna sidelobe levels and different sector ranges. In the study, imperfect power control and limited transmitted power are assumed. The effect of the power assigned to the uplink pilot is taken into account. It is shown that, the sector capacity depends on the train’s position. The uplink sector capacity limits (upper and lower) are presented. The lower capacity limit is given as a function of the sector range and the sidelobe level of the directive antenna used in each sector.	acoustic lobing;best, worst and average case;directive (programming);downtime;interference (communication);software propagation;telecommunications link;via c3	Bazil Taha Ahmed;Miguel Calvo-Ramón	2007	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-007-9277-0	telecommunications;computer science;w-cdma	Mobile	30.086433536457882	83.22396278356594	104777

Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground tunnels and trains move at high speeds, building a train-ground wireless communication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel channels is very important in designing the wireless networks and evaluating the performance of CBTC systems. Most existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique characteristics of CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic moving direction, and accurate train-location information. In this paper, we develop a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model for tunnel channels in CBTC systems. The proposed FSMC model is based on real field CBTC channel measurements obtained from a business-operating subway line. Unlike most existing channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the proposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more accurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver is divided into intervals and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results generated from the model and the real field measurement results.	channel (communications);control system;markov chain;simulation;transmitter	Hongwei Wang;Fei Richard Yu;Li Zhu;Tao Tang;Bin Ning	2014	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2014.2298038	markov chain;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;mathematics;markov process;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	25.90898166063323	78.73197553238563	104843

The performance metrics used are the probability that all nodes in a network can achieve a connection and the total cell capacity. Coverage probability and cell capacity are solved numerically and the results presented. Further it is shown that the strength of turbulence affects the maximum data rate supported by a cell as well as the coverage probability. In a NOMA cell however the number of users is shown to be a bigger limiting factor than turbulence.	cell (microprocessor);interference (communication);numerical analysis;optical wireless;turbulence;uncompressed video	Callum Geldard;John S.

While introducing electromagnetic vector sensor (EVS), the closed-form expression of spatial fading correlation (SFC) was derived. The SFC was expressed in terms of azimuth and elevation angles of arrival and the geometry of an antenna array. The developed SFC can be used to determine the covariance matrixes at both transmitter and receiver hence the capacity can be calculated in a specific channel state. This paper studied on the performance of azimuth and elevation angles of arrival, azimuth spread and elevation spread on the SFC and the capacity of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. The performance comparison between antenna arrays while introducing EVS and the traditional scalar sensor array (SSA), as a uniform Y-shaped array and a uniform circular array (UCA), were made. Simulation results showed that comparing to SSA, the antenna array which introducing EVS had a significant advantage and, UCA and UYA both had its own superiorities.

The objective is to evaluate the ergodic sum-capacity of this decentralized model, under identical average powers and channel statistics across users. While an optimal water-filling solution can be found for centralized MACs with full CSI at all terminals, such an explicit solution is not considered feasible in distributed CSI models. Our main contribution is an upper-bound on the ergodic sum-capacity when each transmitter is aware only of its own fading coefficients. Interestingly, our techniques also suggest an appropriate lower bound. These bounds are shown to be very close to each other, suggesting the tight nature of the results.	additive white gaussian noise;centralized computing;coefficient;decentralised system;ergodic theory;ergodicity;transmitter	Nitish Mital;Kamal Singh;Sibi Raj B.

In the first, we propose a new concept of delayed M-FDR relaying (M-D-FDR) scheme being able to achieve the full spatial diversity. At this time, we consider each delayed FDR receives a signal from source, adjacent relays and its delayed loop interference signal from its transmit antenna. In the second, we propose an efficient iterative successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at destination that gradually cancels a delayed signal in order to fully obtain link diversity generated from M-D-FDR. Then, we investigate the various properties of the proposed M-D-FDR network by analyzing the pairwise-error-probability (PEP) analysis, especially in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) between source to relays and source to destination links, respectively. Finally, we accomplish the performance evaluations to verify the analysis results and to compare with a non-delayed M-FDR (M-N-FDR) network.	bell laboratories layered space-time;consensus dynamics;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);iterative method;pairwise error probability;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer	Jae-Shin Han;JongSeob Baek;Sungho Jeon;Jong-Soo Seo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.030314.131068	antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	38.61439098204302	84.86975715946787	105938

In particular, industrial appli-cations, that deploy wireless machine-to-machine communication and process automation, demand energy-efficient communication in order to prolong battery lifetime and reduce inter-node interference, while maintaining a predefined probabilistic delay bound. In this work, we propose an algorithm that minimizes the transmit power in a WirelessHART network under statistical delay constraints. We achieve this by utilizing a recently developed network calculus approach for wireless networks performance analysis. The evaluation of the algorithm shows that it reaches quasi-minimal power settings within a few iterations.	algorithm;binary search algorithm;computation;convex function;dataflow;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);iteration;lookup table;loop variant;machine to machine;network calculus;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);signal-to-noise ratio;uninterruptible power supply	Neda Petreska;Hussein Al-Zubaidy;James Gross	2014	2014 26th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC)	10.1109/ITC.2014.6932953	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;quality of service;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;communications system;wireless;computer network	EDA	31.50132842447281	86.93086519023765	105986

We consider a network where packets are distributed in finite space according to a 2-D PPP, while packets arrive in time according to a 1-D PPP. Each transmitter communicates with its own receiver a fixed distance away using either the ALOHA or CSMA protocol. The metric used for analysis is outage probability, which is the probability that the measured SINR falls below a predefined threshold for the duration of a packet. Approximate analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability of the different MAC protocols assuming a fading channel. Compared to unbounded regions, ALOHA and CSMA are shown to yield lower outage probabilities in finite regions, since the boundedness can be regarded as spatial filtering. Furthermore, the benefit seems to be greater for small outage probabilities, i.e., in the region of practical interest.	downtime;network packet;petri net;point-to-point protocol;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	Flavio Fabbri;Mariam Kaynia;Roberto Verdone	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5501958	fading distribution;wireless ad hoc network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Robotics	35.00600207327164	79.56371108858784	106021

Introducing cognition into the FAPs through the spectrum sensing (or carrier sensing) capability helps them avoiding severe interference from the macro BSs and enhance their performance. In this paper, we use stochastic geometry to model and analyze performance of HetNets composed of macro BSs and cognitive FAPs in a multichannel environment. The proposed model explicitly accounts for the spatial distribution of the macro BSs, FAPs, and users in a Rayleigh fading environment. We quantify the performance gain in outage probability obtained by introducing cognition into the femto-tier, provide design guidelines, and show the existence of an optimal spectrum sensing threshold for the cognitive FAPs, which depends on the HetNet parameters. We also show that looking into the overall performance of the HetNets is quite misleading in the scenarios where the majority of users are served by the macro BSs. Therefore, the performance of femto-tier needs to be explicitly accounted for and optimized.	coexist (image);cognition;downtime;elegant degradation;interference (communication);multitier architecture;rayleigh fading;telecommunications link;wireless access point	Hesham Elsawy;Ekram Hossain	2014	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2013.36	cognitive radio;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;probability;interference;computational model;femtocell;statistics;stochastic geometry;detection theory;computer network	Mobile	28.0073531002626	85.93572307786324	106110

We derive the closed-form expression of the effective bandwidth of arbitrarily random data arrivals. In addition, the explicit expressions of outage probability and effective capacity, respectively, are acquired. Correspondingly, we derive the QoS guaranteed throughput region by combining the concepts of effective bandwidth and effective capacity. Specifically, we point out that both the first- and the second-order statistics of the random data arrivals should be incorporated into the QoS guaranteed throughput region, while the first-order statistic is sufficient to characterize the throughput region when the system can tolerate an arbitrarily long queueing delay. Finally, simulation results corroborate the theoretical analysis.	direction finding;downtime;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;principle of good enough;quality of service;queuing delay;randomness;relay;requirement;simulation;throughput	Jian Yang;Qinghai Yang;Kyung Sup Kwak;Ramesh R.

One such strategy is opportunistic forwarding, which exploits relay diversity by opportunistically selecting an overhearing relay as a forwarder. Prior work has studied the performance of opportunistic forwarding for the simplified scenario of uncorrelated wireless channels. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario of temporally correlated wireless channels; the wireless channel is modeled as a Rayleigh fading channel and its temporal correlation as a modified Bessel function of the first kind and zeroth order. We use these models to develop a simple Markovian model to analyze the performance of opportunistic forwarding for correlated wireless channels for the case of linear networks. We then demonstrate via numerical evaluation the diminishing performance of opportunistic forwarding with increasing channel correlation.	bessel filter;greedy algorithm;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;relay;throughput	Anand Seetharam;James F.

In this work, we design RA for 802.11n NICs from an energy-efficiency perspective. We show that current MIMO RA algorithms are not energy efficient for NICs despite ensuring high throughput. The fundamental problem is that, the high-throughput setting is not equivalent to the energy-efficient one. Marginal throughput gain may be realized at high energy cost. We then propose EERA and EERA+, two energy-based RA schemes that trade off goodput for energy savings at NICs. EERA applies multidimensional ternary search and simultaneous pruning to speed up its runtime convergence in single-client operations, and uses fair airtime sharing to handle multiple-client operations. EERA+ further searches for multiple, staged rates to yield more energy savings over EERA. Our experiments have confirmed their effectiveness in various scenarios.	airtime;algorithm;experiment;goodput;high-throughput computing;mimo;marginal model;network interface controller;ternary search;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Chi-Yu Li;Chunyi Peng;Peng Cheng;Songwu Lu;Xinbing Wang;Fengyuan Ren;Tao Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2462814	real-time computing;telecommunications;efficient energy use;statistics;mimo	Mobile	30.547923028971486	87.1294648997322	106657
c04e74290a2626a9b2741d5056cb96c1d2cbbaf8	indoor mobile coverage problem using uavs		Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as aerial wireless base stations when cellular networks are not operational due to natural disasters. They can also be used to supplement the ground base station in order to provide better coverage and higher data rates for the users. Prior studies on UAV-based wireless coverage typically consider an air-to-ground path loss model, which assumes that the users are outdoor and located on a 2-D plane. In this paper, we propose using UAVs to provide wireless coverage for indoor users inside a high-rise building. First, we present realistic outdoor–indoor path loss models and describe the tradeoff introduced by these models. Then, we study the problem of efficient placement of a single UAV, where the objective is to minimize the total transmit power required to cover the entire high-rise building. The formulated problem is generally difficult to solve. To that end, we consider three cases of practical interest and provide efficient solutions to the formulated problem under these cases. Then, we study the problem of minimizing the number of UAVs required to provide wireless coverage to the high-rise building and prove that this problem is NP-complete. Due to the intractability of the problem, we use clustering to minimize the number of UAVs required to cover the indoor users. In our proposed algorithm, we check if the maximum transmit power of a UAV is sufficient to cover each cluster. If not, the number of clusters is incremented by one, and the problem is solved again. In the uniform split method, we split the building into  $k$ regular structures and utilize  $k$ UAVs to provide wireless coverage for indoor users regardless of user distribution. We demonstrate through simulations that the method that splits the building into regular structures requires 80% more number of UAVs relative to our proposed algorithm.	algorithm;cluster analysis;np-completeness;simulation;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Hazim Shakhatreh;Abdallah Khreishah;Issa M.

However, simulations' quality largely depends on the number of rays, providing sufficient angular resolution in the ray launching process. The computational cost of simulations in high definition (HD) prevents their use in complex environments and their low definition (LD) counterparts are used. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) to lessen the low quality problems of LD simulations. Such technique outperforms previous works in this field in terms of accuracy, precision and computational cost. Moreover, we show that our approach obtains results very similar to those of HD in much less time. Therefore, using combined deterministic-CF techniques allows the estimation of radio-planning tasks in large, complex medical scenarios with a potentially large amount of transceivers.	algorithmic efficiency;angularjs;collaborative filtering;computation;mathematical optimization;missing data;ray tracing (graphics);recommender system;robustness (computer science);simulation;smart city;software deployment;software propagation;transceiver;uniform theory of diffraction	Fran Casino;Leyre Azpilicueta;Peio López-Iturri;Erik Aguirre;Francisco Falcone;Agusti Solanas	2015	2015 6th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA)	10.1109/IISA.2015.7387993	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	HPC	25.22295092631955	78.18844870695837	106737

The proposed model is a mixture of the Inverse Gaussian and the Inverse Weibull distributions, both are two-parameter medium-to-heavy tail distributions. To estimate the parameters of the mixture model, we design an expectation maximization algorithm using both analytical moment matching and maximum likelihood estimation. Further, the information-theoretic metric relative entropy is used to measure the goodness of the model by capturing the distance from the modeled distribution to a reference one. The model is tested against simulation data obtained from a stochastic geometry based cellular network and demonstrates very good fit for a wide range of practical mmWave path loss and shadowing values. The mixture model is then used to analyze the capacity of a cellular network employing joint dominant mode beamforming and again confirms a good fit with simulation.	beamforming;emoticon;estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;iw engine;information theory;integrated circuit layout design protection;interference (communication);kullback–leibler divergence;lagrange multiplier;mimo;mixture model;simulation;software propagation;statistical interference	Hussain E.

The channel is affected by block fading, and the channel state is perfectly known to the receiver but unknown to the transmitters. To cope with multiaccess interference (MAI) and fading, the users employ retransmission of erroneously received packets. We consider unspread and randomly spread (code-division multiple-access (CDMA)) systems with decentralized (single-user) decoding and a system where the receiver employs joint multiuser decoding. The following conclusions can be drawn from our analysis: (a) unspread systems with packet retransmission outperforms CDMA systems with conventional detection, but are outperformed by CDMA with linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection. (b) For all systems based on single-user decoding (SUD), there exists a threshold value of (E/sub b//N/sub o/) below which the throughput is maximized by an infinite number of users per dimension transmitting at vanishing rate, and above which the throughput is maximized by a finite average number of users per dimension transmitting at nonvanishing rate. Moreover, as (E/sub b//N/sub o/) increases, the optimal average number of users per dimension tends to one. In this sense, we say that the optimized systems """"self-orthogonalize.""""

Typically, the primary network performs as a stand-alone network while the secondary one accesses the spectrum only if it does no harm to the primary receivers. In this paper, the configuration of the secondary network is of our interest and we explore its single-hop transport throughput (STT) with outage constraints imposed on both networks. STT is a new metric that inherits the merits of both the traditional transport capacity and transmission capacity, incorporating transmission distance and outage probability into a uniform framework. Given the settings of the primary network, we first evaluate the limit of the secondary STT, single-hop transport capacity (STC). Then, we investigate STT with secondary receivers randomly located in the field of interest. To provide a comprehensive view of achievable secondary network throughputs, three models regarding the selection of receivers are considered: optimally selected, randomly selected, and the nearest neighbors. Our theoretical analysis are well substantiated by numerical and simulation results.	downtime;hop;numerical analysis;randomness;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput	Chengzhi Li;Huaiyu Dai	2015	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2014.2363091	throughput;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer network	Metrics	30.115878013539078	85.10534629632144	107019

The structure increases the dimensionality at the transmitter, which allow for the cancellation of self-interference and forward beamforming to be jointly processed using precoding at the transmitter. The FD Precoding (FDP) structure allows for various joint precoding algorithms and different optimization objectives. We present separate and joint precoding designs for sum-rate maximization and a theoretical analysis of when the separate design is optimal. The joint designs make use of Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). Extensive simulation results using both channel models and measured data show that the FDP structure can provide very significant performance gains over existing techniques for both SU- and MU-MIMO systems. In particular, the FDP structure provides between 1.6 and 1.8 times the spectral efficiency of optimized half-duplex for many of the tested SU-MIMO scenarios.	beamforming;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multiplexing;simulation;spectral efficiency;transceiver;transmitter;zero-forcing precoding	Sean Huberman;Tho Le-Ngoc	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2382589	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;interference;spatial multiplexing;precoding;statistics;mimo	Visualization	39.00272793328689	88.32382309124239	107225

This paper proposes the use of an angular diversity model for characterizing the performance of mobile FSO over atmospheric turbulence, and transmitter–receiver misalignment switch-and-examine combining technique is suggested for a diversity combining under unbalanced multireceiving configuration. A laser beam is modeled as spatial Gaussian profile, and channel fading is modeled as a lognormal distribution with spatially uncorrelated samples. Analytical and statistical discussion on the resultant output is presented, and bit error performance and processing load are numerically evaluated and compared with those obtained using selection combining diversity schemes.

In this paper, we exploit the limited feedback applied to the two-source turbo coded cooperation scheme to define a particular cooperative HARQ protocol, called two-level HARQ, where the decision on retransmission at each node is conditioned by two levels: first by the feedback from the destination and second by the feedback from the partner node. To evaluate the performance improvement of this cooperative HARQ system over the original turbo coded cooperation system in terms of frame error probability, we define the system retransmission gain. This gain serves as a decision parameter to determine the conditions under which the cooperative HARQ protocol is useful. Finally, optimal time resource allocation is explored, offering sizable performance improvements.	computation;hybrid automatic repeat request;retransmission (data networks);throughput;transform, clipping, and lighting	Haifa Fares;Alexandre Graell i Amat;Charlotte Langlais;Marion Berbineau	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214405	turbo code;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.370899561281064	76.44616461124313	107660

To this aim, we have first formulated the DLT equation based on the outage probability for 2×1 MISO-HARQ channel. We show that exact analytical calculation of the outage probability is not tractable. Therefore, we approximate the outage probability using a log-normal approximation approach. Based on such approximation, optimal rate and power allocations are derived. Finally, using Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the approximation method provides results which are very close to the exact solution.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;dlt;downtime;hybrid automatic repeat request;monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;simulation;system analysis;throughput	Seyed Hamed Rastegar;Shahin Vakilinia;Babak Hossein Khalaj	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364609	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;probability;log-normal distribution;automatic repeat request;statistics;monte carlo method;approximation theory	Robotics	36.245479497694525	78.71247472449637	107687

0a986cf3bb3cbf4e62a76ba65746f8174a13e571	reinforcement learning for proactive caching of contents with different demand probabilities		A mobile user randomly accessing a dynamic content library over a wireless channel is considered. At each time instant, a random number of contents are added to the library and each content remains relevant to the user for a random period of time. Contents are classified into finitely many classes such that whenever the user accesses the system, he requests each content randomly with a class-specific demand probability. Contents are downloaded to the user equipment (UE) through a wireless link whose quality also varies randomly with time. The UE has a cache memory of finite capacity, which can be used to proactively store contents before they are requested by the user. Any time contents are downloaded, the system incurs a cost (energy, bandwidth, etc.) that depends on the channel state at the time of download, and scales linearly with the number of contents downloaded. Our goal is to minimize the expected long-term average cost. The problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, and the optimal policy is shown to exhibit a threshold structure; however, since finding the optimal policy is computationally infeasible, parametric approximations to the optimal policy are considered, whose parameters are optimized using the policy gradient method. Numerical simulations show that the performance gain of the resulting scheme over traditional reactive content delivery is significant, and increases with the cache capacity. Comparisons with two performance lower bounds, one computed based on infinite cache capacity and another based on non-casual knowledge of the user access times and content requests, demonstrate that our scheme can perform close to the theoretical optimum.	approximation;cpu cache;cache (computing);causal filter;computational complexity theory;digital distribution;download;dynamic web page;gradient method;markov chain;markov decision process;mobile device;numerical linear algebra;random number generation;randomness;reinforcement learning;simulation;value (ethics)	Samuel O.

The channel estimation error causes the interference among users, resulting in the sum-rate loss. A tight upper bound of this sum-rate loss based on zeroforcing beamforming is derived theoretically. This bound only depends on the channel estimation quality and transmit antenna number, but not on the user number. Based on this upper bound, we show this system maintains full multiuser diversity, and always benefits from the increasing transmit power.	channel state information;mimo	Yupeng Liu	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.3.955	telecommunications;control theory;upper and lower bounds;estimation theory;beamforming;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.39427784477852	74.79469608495744	108169

However, channel conditions in wireless networks can affect both throughput and reliability. Cooperative communication has the advantage of offering throughput enhancement and reliability in wireless networks by using several single-antenna nodes to form a virtual antenna array. The performance in cooperative communication depends on the relay selection scheme. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and evaluate a distributed relay-selection scheme based on the channel conditions of candidate relay nodes. Results show that our proposed-relay selection scheme increases the system throughput.	backoff;hoc (programming language);next-generation network;performance;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Muhammad Khalil Afzal;Byung-Seo Kim;Sung Won Kim	2014	2014 IEEE Intl Conf on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2014 IEEE 6th Intl Symp on Cyberspace Safety and Security, 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Embedded Software and Syst (HPCC,CSS,ICESS)	10.1109/HPCC.2014.192	wireless ad hoc network;throughput;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cooperative diversity;wi-fi array;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	28.284509884569932	87.27815413711753	108284

An interference alignment scheme using only partial channel state information is proposed. In particular, every node and the relay only knows the intra-subnetwork channel of the corresponding subnetwork, the network topology, and the side information from other subnetworks. The proposed scheme requires no additional relay antennas as compared to interference alignment using full channel state information. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be parallelized to reduce the delay in large networks.	channel state information;coefficient;interference (communication);network topology;parallel computing;relay;subnetwork	Xiang Li;Daniel Papsdorf;Anja Klein;Tobias Weber	2015	2015 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2015.7454417	telecommunications;mathematics;relay channel;computer network	Arch	32.83401387211422	76.4204921489916	108302

The outage occurs when either the transmitter or the receiver does not have enough energy, or the channel is in outage, where the transmitter only has the channel distribution information. Under infinite battery capacity and without retransmission, we prove that threshold-based power control policies are optimal. We thus propose disjoint/joint threshold-based policies with and without battery state sharing between the transmitter and receiver, respectively. We also analyze the impact of practical receiver detection and processing on the outage performance. When retransmission is considered, policy with linear power levels is adopted to adapt the power thresholds per retransmission. With finite battery capacity, a three dimensional finite state Markov chain is formulated to calculate the optimal parameters and corresponding performance of proposed policies. The energy arrival correlation between the transmitter and receiver is addressed for both finite and infinite battery cases. Numerical results show the impact of battery capacity, energy arrival correlation and detection cost on the outage performance of the proposed policies, as well as the tradeoff between the outage probability and the average transmission times.	downtime;markov chain;retransmission (data networks);sun outage;transmitter	Sheng Zhou;Tingjun Chen;Wei Chen;Zhisheng Niu	2015	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2015.2391951	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	32.54438485651312	85.71471992580861	108320

The locations of access points (APs) and mobile users are modeled as two 2-D, independent and homogeneous Poisson point processes at distinct heights. Using mathematical tools from stochastic geometry, we provide a new analytical framework to characterize the secrecy performance in multiuser VLC networks. Closed-form results for the outage probability and the ergodic secrecy rate are derived for networks without AP cooperation. Considering the cooperation among APs, we give tight lower and upper bounds on the secrecy outage probability and the ergodic secrecy rate. To further enhance the secrecy performance at the legitimate user, a disk-shaped secrecy protected zone is implemented in the vicinity of the transmit AP. Based on the obtained results, it is shown that cooperating neighboring APs in a multiuser VLC network can bring performance gains on the secrecy rate, but only to a limited extent. We also show that building an eavesdropper-free protected zone around the AP significantly improves the secrecy performance of legitimate users, which appears to be a promising solution for the design of multiuser VLC networks with high security requirements.

For the spatial indoor radio propagation channel, complex impulse-response recordings are used. These are obtained in wideband channel-sounder measurements in three different buildings at 5.3 GHz. Thus, no unrealistic assumptions about channel conditions are involved. The paper studies how the packet-error-rate performance for downlink (DL) is affected by time evolution of the radio channel that takes place after the uplink operation in which channel estimation is performed, and before DL operation in which the estimated channel information is utilized. Based on simulations two-user SDMA is possible with four-antenna elements under indoor propagation conditions and with six antennas three users can simultaneously be served. Delay spreads, coherence bandwidths, and correlation properties (in space, frequency, and polarization) of the radio channels obtained in the measurements are also discussed. The results suggest that indoor time-division-duplex systems with access-point-controlled scheduling are desirable communication systems which can benefit from SDMA.	bit error rate;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);monte carlo method;multi-user;polarization (waves);scheduling (computing);simulation;smart antenna;software propagation;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;wireless access point	Ari T.

This paper investigates the uplink capacity and coverage of relay-assisted UMTS network when multiuser detection techniques are employed at both macrocell base station (BS) and relay station (RS). A hierarchical geometric system model is used where the fixed relay stations are deployed within the macrocell. We are particularly interested in the cases where macro BSs and RSs have different capabilities in mitigating intracell and intercell interferences. Simulation results show that the capacity can be tripled and the cell range can be extended when MUD can be employed at base stations and relay stations. Furthermore, we studied the practical scenario where the users in the relay region are partially served by the relay station. This case is meaningful when there are not enough relay resources or users are restricted due to limited handover capability. We then proposed a partial relay system to enhance the cell range while maintaining a reasonable cell load.	broadcast relay station;code coverage;mud;multi-user;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;telecommunications link	Zhenning Shi;Ming Zhao;He Wang;Mark C.

For cooperative relaying communications, the outage probability and the expected rate (throughput) can be greatly improved when the superposition coding relaying (SC-relaying) strategy is employed. Under the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this work contributes to a comprehensive investigation on the outage probability and the throughput of cooperative relaying communications system with only two-level rate SC. Through strict mathematical process and deduction, the approximated close-form expressions of the outage probabilities and the throughput of system are obtained for the first time. Based on the results, the impact of power and channel allocation fractions on system performance is carried out.

As base station number is less, in order to reach all subscriber more powerful electromagnetic field is sent. At the same time, mobile phones emanates more powerful signal to communicate these base stations. Both of two cases affect the human health. Optimization of location of base station is required to use less number of base stations and less powerful base station. To accomplish this problem, 3D ray tracing algorithm has to be developed and used in electromagnetic wave propagation problems. In this study, 2D ray tracing technique is developed and it is used in slope UTD with convex hull model. Besides 3D ray tracing studies is started.	algorithm;convex hull;mobile phone;ray tracing (graphics);software propagation;uniform theory of diffraction	Mehmet Baris Tabakcioglu;Ahmet Zorlu	2016	2016 24th Signal Processing and Communication Application Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2016.7495708	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;optics	Mobile	24.976906126486725	78.96145917895007	108891

In the proposed protocol if the primary system (licensed user) is incapable of supporting its target transmission rate, then secondary system (cognitive user) helps the primary system via two phase cooperative Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) relaying. Secondary system acts as an Amplify & Forward (AF) relay by allocating some of its subcarriers to boost the performance of primary transmission whereas remaining subcarriers are used for secondary transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the outage probability with respect to primary transmit power for different sets of subcarriers in both direct & cooperation mode. Through simulation results it is proved that the primary outage probability with cooperation is less than outage probability with direct transmission. Results also demonstrate the outage probability for increasing distance between primary & secondary transmitter. As distance between primary & secondary transmitter increases outage probability increases.	anisotropic filtering;downtime;multiplexing;relay;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter	Naveen Gupta;Vivek Ashok Bohara	2014	2014 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968651	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	35.44545144967368	84.23043373306473	108995
e5865d34248048c9c164384cb1978d6a7c5279a6	pafd: phased array full-duplex		We present the design and implementation of PAFD, a design methodology that enables full-duplex (FD) in hybrid beamforming systems with constant amplitude phased array antennas. The key novelty in PAFD's design is construction of analog beamformers that maximize the beamforming gains in the desired directions while simultaneously reducing the self-interference (SI). PAFD is implemented on the WARP platform, and its performance is extensively evaluated in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our experimental results reveal that (i) PAFD sacrifices a few dB in beamfomring gain to provide large amounts of reduction in SI power; (ii) the reduction in SI is dependent on the number of phased array antennas and increases as the number of antennas increases; and (iii) finally, PAFD significantly outperforms half-duplex (HD) for small cells even in presence of high interference caused by uplink clients to the downlink clients. The gains increase with a larger array size or less multipath in the propagation environment.	beamforming;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;multipath propagation;phased array;semidefinite programming;software propagation;telecommunications link	Ehsan Aryafar;Alireza Keshavarz-Haddad	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486358	duplex (telecommunications);multipath propagation;telecommunications link;radio frequency;distributed computing;amplitude;electronic engineering;beamforming;interference (wave propagation);computer science;phased array	Visualization	26.504526995722472	81.66856036220294	109005

In conventional cellular systems, the inter face between the wired network and wireless medium is the base station antenna (or closely located antennas if there is microdiversity) placed at the geographic center of the cell area. With such a “ centralized” antenna, however , it is often impossible to maintain per fect power control (even if the power levels are adjusted in a precise and instantaneous manner) due to the fact that the required transmit power levels would occasionally (or often) be beyond practical limits; this is especially true for environments that yield high path losses. In this paper , we investigate the peak and median transmit power requirements in a CDMA system that employs power control with a distr ibuted antenna architecture. Computer simulations show that by using such an antenna architecture with only 4 antenna elements, the median and peak transmit power levels can be reduced by 13 dB and 20 dB, respectively. This may yield a substantial increase in system capacity, as well as a prolonged subscr iber battery usage that may be cr itical in high data rate applications.	centralized computing;channel capacity;data rate units;decibel;requirement;serial experiments lain;simulation;telecommunications link	Arif Obaid;Halim Yanikomeroglu	2000		10.1109/WCNC.2000.903922	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;base station;antenna noise temperature;computer network;antenna efficiency	Mobile	27.521072843006767	86.71070698320851	109055

In this paper, we extend it to the generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel, where m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 2 source nodes are contained in two groups, respectively. Based on signal space alignment, a new beamforming scheme is proposed to maximize the minimum effective signal to interference plus noise ratios (SINRs) among all data streams. The beamforming vectors are designed by an iterative algorithm in which a closed-form solution is obtained in each step. Moreover, we show that the power allocation problem given the shape of the beamformers can be transformed as a linear programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed beamforming scheme can achieve significantly better error performance than random beamforming schemes subject to signal space alignment only.	algorithm;beamforming;channel (communications);interference (communication);iterative method;linear programming;mimo;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Kangqi Liu;Zhengzheng Xiang;Meixia Tao;Xiaodong Wang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655430	mathematical optimization;3g mimo;linear programming;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;relay channel;precoding;mimo	Mobile	38.45698953180951	88.4854321884864	109122

The coverage probability of the practical HWCN is derived using stochastic geometry modeling. The derived expressions not only characterise the effects of building infrastructures and transmission environment on the coverage region in practice but also enable us to propose an optimal power allocation at cells in different tiers. Specifically, a heuristic algorithm is developed for the power allocation at the tiered cells within various propagation models to minimise the total power consumption. The proposed scheme is shown to achieve a lower total power consumption saving up to 45% for a given target coverage probability of a specific region when compared to the equal power allocation technique.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);lossy compression;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;software propagation;telecommunications link	Quoc-Tuan Vien;Tayo Akinbote;Huan Xuan Nguyen;Ramona Trestian;Orhan Gemikonakli	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249055	telecommunications;computer network	Robotics	30.854620619615748	86.86099649647227	109209

However, most of the existing power-loading schemes may not always be suitable for packet-access orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this paper, we propose a Lagrange multiplier power-loading (LMPL) algorithm for packet-access OFDM systems with fixed modulation and coding transmission. The proposed LMPL algorithm offers a closed-form solution for the power-loading optimization problem under a total transmit power constraint. As a closed-form solution may not be available for adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) transmission, we use a low-complexity joint LMPL algorithm to enhance the system throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed LMPL algorithms outperform the traditional channel inversion power-loading (CIPL) scheme. It is also shown that the theoretically derived throughput very well matches the simulation results.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;network packet;optimization problem;simulation;throughput	Lin Tang;Honglin Hu;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2026757	computer simulation;constrained optimization;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	36.777682059812044	87.44755979722092	109229

For Amplify and Forward (AF) fixed relaying scheme with adaptive modulation, it has been shown that the scheme can increase transmit diversity but with the expense of a reduction in the spectral efficiency. An efficient Generalized Switching Policy (GSP) for AF incremental relaying with adaptive modulation is proposed to maximize the average spectral efficiency while maintaining the target Bit Error Rate (BER). The performance of the GSP over independent nonidentical Rayleigh fading channels is derived in terms of average spectral efficiency, average BER, and outage probability, then verified by using Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that the GSP not only outperforms both the conventional direct transmission and the AF fixed relaying but also the Outage Switching Policy (OSP) of the AF incremental relaying proposed recently.	anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;carrier-to-noise ratio;downtime;guardian service processor;modulation;monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation;spectral efficiency;sun outage;telecommunications network;x.690	Essam Saleh Altubaishi;Xuemin Shen	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5501930	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	Robotics	36.21576229868946	78.07927791573904	109408

This can be achieved by exploiting the spatial subchannels between the multiple transmit and receive elements. The enhanced performance of MIMO technology makes it a strong candidate for ad hoc systems requiring very high throughput, such as high-definition multimedia streaming in the home. In this article we compare the performance of conventional and newly proposed MIMO architectures for such applications. Specifically designed antenna arrays are proposed as a solution to significantly reduced MIMO performance in line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. To help in the design of such systems, the criterion for achieving maximum MIMO capacity in LoS is presented as a function of the transmitter-to-receiver separation distance, the array orientation and the element spacings. The performance of the LoS-enhanced proposal and the conventional system is quantified in terms of the channel capacity, the packet error rate (PER) and the throughput by employing a MIMO-enabled WLAN physical layer simulator.

In addition to the total power constraint on all the relays, we introduce individual power constraint for each relay, which reflects the practical scenario where all relays are separated from one another. Considering the individual power constraint for the relay networks is the major difference from that in the traditional point-to-point communication systems where only a total power constraint exists for all colocated antennas. Two types of channel estimation are involved: maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). For ML channel estimation, the channels are assumed as deterministic and the optimal training results from an efficient multilevel waterfilling type solution that is derived from the majorization theory. For MMSE channel estimation, however, the second-order statistics of the channels are assumed known and the general optimization problem turns out to be nonconvex. We instead consider three special yet reasonable scenarios. The problem in the first scenario is convex and could be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art optimization tools. Closed-form waterfilling type solutions are found in the remaining two scenarios, of which the first one has an interesting physical interpretation as pouring water into caves.	channel state information;colocation centre;convex function;direction finding;fibre channel point-to-point;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;optimization problem;point-to-point (telecommunications);relay	Feifei Gao;Tao Cui;Arumugam Nallanathan	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.2005084	mathematical optimization;signal processing;mathematics;maximum likelihood;relay channel;communications system;statistics	Mobile	36.719496564532534	88.10517188273634	109521

Describing a channel model with one secondary transmitter and one secondary receiver with the potential presence of primary users, we present an interference power constraint that limits the transmission power of secondary users not only when a channel is sensed as busy but also when a channel is sensed as idle. Calling the existing transmission rate strategy Optimistic Policy, we introduce two other strategies, particularly Conservative Policy and Greedy Policy. Secondary users in Optimistic Policy set the instantaneous transmission rate to the instantaneous mutual information assuming the correctness of channel sensing results, whereas they set the instantaneous transmission rate to the instantaneous mutual information regarding possible transmission outages in Conservative Policy and disregarding possible transmission outages in Greedy Policy. We construct a state transition diagram and formulate the effective capacity employing these policies. We calculate the minimum energy-per-bit requirements and the high signal-to-noise ratio slope in order to explore performance variations in low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes, respectively. Correspondingly, we show that Optimistic Policy is, in general, more favorable in secondary users when the quality-of-service constraints are loose, the transmission blocks are shorter, and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. On the other hand, Conservative Policy is better when the quality-of-service constraints are strict, the transmission blocks are longer, and the signal-to-noise ratio is high.	channel (communications);cognitive radio;correctness (computer science);greedy algorithm;interference (communication);mutual information;quality of service;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;state diagram;state transition table;transmitter	Sami Akin;Markus Fidler	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2503272	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.470287129999974	84.97743992122608	109788

The relay selection is performed using the method of distributed timers, where all the relays use their timers to estimate own instantaneous channel gains and compete to access the wireless medium according to their own channel conditions. The performance of opportunistic beamforming scheme in terms of secure outage probability is analysed and the beamforming problem as a semidefinite programming problem with its optimisation framework is formulated. The results show that, in an opportunistic beamforming scheme, competition among cooperative relays offers diversity benefits in the direction of destination that enhances secrecy rate (i.e. minimises secure outage probability) and adhere to the ‘opportunistic’ cooperation rule giving priority to the ‘best’ available relay even when they are not chosen to transmit but rather chosen to cooperatively listen. Opportunistic beamforming scheme with DF strategy enhances secrecy rate than the beamforming with multiple DF relays while in the case of AF strategy, it provides significant improvement in the secrecy rate compared to the opportunistic relaying, the equal-power multiple-relay transmission and the single-relay transmission schemes.	beamforming;wireless security	Md.

For such system, we propose a location based channel reusing scheme in which the D2D users in the inner region have a chance to reuse the channel resources of cellular users in the outer region of neighboring cells, and the D2D users in the outer region could reuse the channel resources of particular cellular users in the inner region of the same cell. Two novel concepts are introduced, namely the accessible region and the reusable region. To protect the outage probabilities of both cellular links and D2D links, only the D2D users in the accessible region could reuse the channel resources of cellular users in the reusable region. We present a specific method to calculate the boundary of the accessible region, as well as the reusable region. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could effectively alleviate the interference between both users.	downtime;information exchange;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Pengcheng Bao;Guanding Yu;Rui Yin	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583607	frequency allocation;telecommunications;radio resource management;probability;co-channel interference;statistics;computer network	Mobile	30.0543164398437	88.24650457706257	109864

In this paper two widely used simulation environments are benchmarked against live network path gain measurements. Some parameter adjustments are done to fit the simulation environments to the measured path gain and cell isolation statistics. The need to modify base station antenna model parameters to match the intra-site cell isolation in real networks is identified and elaborated. In particular an increase of maximum attenuation to 35dB, introduction of mechanical tilt and reduction of vertical beam width are needed. In addition some adjustments are done to better represent the assumed traffic distribution with 80% indoor users and expected propagation losses resulting in a path gain level on par with the measured network.	acoustic lobing;beam tilt;benchmark (computing);cell (microprocessor);interference (communication);network performance;propagation constant;simulation;software propagation	Arne Simonsson;Martin N.

Different from traditional approach, using CW measured signal, this approach collects the combined pilot aggregate Ec signals of the on-air 3G radio network from different cells at different heights. The operating 3G radio network will not be disturbed while the experiments are taken. With the tuned propagation model, each cell could have its own propagation model depending on its antenna height, which is more optimal for its own propagation environment. These tuned 3G propagation models adapted for local clutter environment are extremely important in the network performance optimization process. The experiments were taking within the Banciao city.

Based on stochastic geometry, our tool is able to capture a static two-dimensional road geometry and the effect of interference due to node clustering in the vicinity of an intersection.

Parameterization of the quantity is based on system-dependent channel characterization, where the propagation channel captured by multipath delays, angles-of-arrival, and angles-of-departure is defined system-dependently. Starting with a simple single-cluster-single-bounce channel and perfect receiving conditions, the theoretical framework is then extended to more general situations such as channels with multiple reradiating processes and scattering clusters. Using this methodology, we show through numerical examples that the conventional diversity estimate for wideband directional systems may lead to systematic prediction error of the achievable diversity gains	clock rate;frequency band;mimo;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;nonlinear gameplay;numerical analysis;software propagation	Yifan Chen;Vimal K.

When spectrum holes exist, cognitive service is implemented employing overlay approach. While there is no idle spectrum available, primary transmission mode information (PTMI) and inter-system interference channel information are utilized. And cognitive service is implemented using spectrum underlay. The method exploits both spatial correlation and eigenmode transmission gain in evaluation the quality of spatial resource. Consequently, selection diversity of both authorized channel and cognitive eigenmode is achieved. Moreover, PTMI based signal processing reduces the power loss of cognitive signal as well as antenna requirements for cognitive system. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy could achieve significant improvement of cognitive throughput on the premise that no interference is imposed on the primary.	artificial intelligence;authorization;cognitive radio;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;normal mode;requirement;signal processing;simulation;throughput;video overlay	Zhao Li	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6398874	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;telecommunications service;signal processing;antenna;computer network	Mobile	29.91966699336367	88.35225492098138	110271
f1a430b6b4f38944f6c984488dcccf57c7f99b46	security-reliability tradeoff for distributed antenna systems in heterogeneous cellular networks		In this paper, we investigate physical-layer security for a spectrum-sharing heterogeneous cellular network comprised of a macro cell and a small cell, where a passive eavesdropper is assumed to tap the transmissions of both the macro and small cells. In the macro cell, a macro base station (MBS) equipped with multiple distributed antennas sends its confidential information to a macro user (MU) through an opportunistic transmit antenna. Meanwhile, in the small cell, a small base station (SBS) transmits to a small user (SU) over the same spectrum used by MBS. We propose an interference-canceled opportunistic antenna selection (IC-OAS) scheme to enhance the physical-layer security for the heterogeneous network. To be specific, when MBS sends its confidential message to MU through an opportunistic distributed antenna, a special signal is artificially designed and emitted at the MBS to ensure that the received interference at MU from SBS is canceled out. For comparison, the conventional interference-limited opportunistic antenna selection (IL-OAS) is considered as a benchmark. We characterize the security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) for the proposed IC-OAS and conventional IL-OAS schemes in terms of deriving their closed-form expressions of intercept probability and outage probability. Numerical results show that compared with the conventional IL-OAS, the proposed IC-OAS scheme not only brings SRT benefits to the macro cell but also has the potential of improving the SRT of small cell by increasing the number of distributed antennas. Additionally, by jointly taking into account the macro cell and small cell, an overall SRT of the proposed IC-OAS scheme is shown to be significantly better than that of the conventional IL-OAS approach in terms of a sum intercept probability versus sum outage probability.

To protect cooperative networks from selfish misbehaviors and malicious forwarding, a security mechanism monitoring various abnormal behaviors during cooperation is necessary because of the constantly changing network topology and variability of cooperating nodes. In this paper, based on the orthogonal time division protocol commonly used in cooperation, a misbehavior detection scheme is proposed for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by introducing the time division duplexing (TDD) feature into the source node and exploiting the correlation properties between the transmitted and received signals. With the estimated amplification gain and noise power, two binary hypothesis tests are employed to detect power-reducing selfish behaviors and malicious jamming attacks respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in detecting different misbehaviors of cooperating nodes.	anisotropic filtering;cooperative mimo;cooperative multitasking;duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;heart rate variability;malware;multiplexing;network topology;noise power;radio jamming;relay channel;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;test-driven development	Weikun Hou;Xianbin Wang;Ahmed Refaey	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655437	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;time-division multiplexing;computer network	Robotics	35.39861620119263	83.74443939869623	110386

The problem is solved by applying relay to Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, which is defined as D2D communication with relay mode. In this communication mode, relay is selected from idle Cellular User Equipments (CeUEs), and both of two hops in it are D2D communication. In this paper, we provide the criteria of employing this communication mode. First we derive out the interference constrained precondition for applying the mode of D2D communication with relay based on outage probabilities analysis, and then the criterion of employing D2D communication with relay mode is proposed by comparing the sum-capacity of this mode with that of cellular communication mode on the basis of the optimal relay selection. By simulating, we compare the occurrence probabilities of the modes of D2D communication, cellular communication and D2D communication with relay. The numerical results also reveal the D2D communication with relay mode can improve the average sum-capacity in contrast with cellular communication mode based on the proposed criteria.	downtime;interference (communication);mobile phone;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;precondition;relay;simulation	Lefei Wang;Tao Peng;Yufeng Yang;Wenbo Wang	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692247	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;probability;mathematics;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Visualization	33.36298747145001	86.9069184813486	110387

Here, we extend our previous work of optimal power allocation of Slepian-Wolf relay system with constant source-relay error probability, to such that block Rayleigh fading is assumed for all transmission channel and lossy transmission is assumed in source-relay channel. Since data sequences transmitted from source and relay nodes are sent from one original source, they are correlated. At destination node, by exploiting the correlation knowledge between the two data sequences in joint decoding, the performance of the whole system can be significantly enhanced. This is because the network can be seen as a distributed Turbo code. A closed-form expression of the outage probability is derived at high signal-to-noisy ratios regime. It is shown that the outage curves calculated from the closed-form expression are sufficiently close to that obtained by the numerical calculation. Then, the optimum power allocation to the nodes for the system can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. Specifically, we minimize the outage probability while assuming the total transmit power is fixed, and also to minimize the total power under an given outage requirement. It is found that the system performance with the proposed optimum power allocation scheme outperform that with equal power allocation.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);convex optimization;distortion;downtime;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;rate–distortion theory;rayleigh fading;relay channel;requirement;scheme;sun outage;turbo code	Shen Qian;Meng Cheng;Tadashi Matsumoto	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247498	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mathematics;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;correlation;fading;statistics	HPC	34.526179047267874	74.6160500895853	110516

To fully utilize inter-RAT offloading advantages, a mobility-aware evaluation is needed, which takes into account the combined effects of mobility and MS and BS spatial distributions on the performance gains. This paper proposes a novel analytical model that accurately describes MS mobility dynamics in heterogeneous wireless networks, while conveying detailed information on its location. In addition, this paper derives an analytical expression for calculating the packet loss probability for orthogonal-frequency-division-multiple-access (OFDMA)-based networks. Taking users' mobility and spatial distribution into account, this paper develops a Markovian-based framework for evaluating inter-RAT offloading performance. The accuracy of the proposed mobility model and the efficacy of the proposed performance evaluation framework are validated. Results show that MS mobility and vertical handover (VHO) cost significantly affect inter-RAT offloading performance, and ignoring their effects could lead to an inaccurate evaluation. When the effects of MS mobility and VHO cost on the performance are ignored, utilizing inter-RAT offloading decreases the packet loss probability by 9% and saves energy by 6%. However, accounting for these effects results in a 32% increase in the packet loss probability evaluation and a 64% increase in the energy consumption evaluation.	aggregate data;approximation algorithm;dr. zeus inc.;frequency band;guided rat;interference (communication);linear equation;ms-dos;mobile device;network packet;noise power;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;point-to-point protocol;portable document format;power gain;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;sir dystic;system of linear equations;telecommunications link;variometer	Mohamed A.

Unlike the existing SWIPT schemes requiring the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) for coherent information delivery, we propose a noncoherent SWIPT framework for decode-and-forward (DF) relay systems bypassing the need for the instantaneous CSI and consequently saving energy in the network. The proposed SWIPT framework embraces both the power-splitting noncoherent DF (PS-NcDF) and timeswitching noncoherent DF (TS-NcDF) in a unified form, and supports arbitrary M-ary noncoherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) and differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). The exact (noncoherent) maximum-likelihood detectors (MLDs) for PS-NcDF and TS-NcDF are derived in a unified form, which involves integral evaluations yet serves as the optimum performance benchmark for noncoherent SWIPT. To reduce the computational cost of the exact MLDs, we also propose closed-form approximate MLDs achieving near-optimum performance, thus serving as a practical solution for noncoherent SWIPT. Numerical results demonstrate a performance tradeoff between the first and second hops through the adjustment of time switching or power splitting parameters, whose optimal values minimizing the symbol-error rate (SER) are strictly between 0 and 1. We demonstrate that M-FSK results in a significant energy saving over M-DPSK for M ≥ 8; thus M-FSK may be more suitable for EH relay systems.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);channel state information;coherence (physics);coherent information;differential phase;direction finding;exception handling;key (cryptography);modulation;ps-algol;relay;sensor	Peng Liu;Saeed Gazor;Il-Min Kim;Dong In Kim	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2458969	telecommunications;computer science;radio frequency;fading;wireless	Mobile	36.26323564468797	87.4124958626098	110690

The proposed protocol switches its strategies to support two traffic flows simultaneously or support only one traffic flow based on instantaneous channel conditions. An extremely tight lower bound of the outage probability is derived, which reveals that full diversity order two is achieved by the proposed protocol. It is demonstrated that the proposed protocol outperforms the existing protocols which also utilize the direct link in the two-way relaying systems in terms of both outage probability and sum-rate.

Here, we first present the exact closed-form results on order statistics of any arbitrary partial sums of gamma random variables with the closed-form results of core functions specialized for independent and identically distributed Nakagami- $m$  fading channels based on a moment generating function-based unified analytical framework. These both exact closed-form results have never been published in the literature. In addition, as a feasible application example in which our new offered derived closed-form results can be applied is presented. In particular, we analyze the outage performance of the finger replacement schemes over Nakagami fading channels as an application of our method. Note that these analysis results are directly applicable to several applications, such as millimeter-wave communication systems in which an antenna diversity scheme operates using a finger replacement schemes-like combining scheme, and other fading scenarios. Note also that the statistical results can provide potential solutions for ordered statistics in any other research topics based on gamma distributions or other advanced wireless communications research topics in the presence of Nakagami fading.	downtime;performance evaluation	Sung Sik Nam;Young-Chai Ko;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2717048	channel state information;gamma distribution;fading;statistics;order statistic;moment-generating function;fading distribution;mathematics;independent and identically distributed random variables;nakagami distribution	Metrics	38.86977417221365	76.88206223901442	110834

We assume that the receiver has perfect channel knowledge while the transmitter has only partial channel knowledge from limited feedback. We propose MSE-based optimal codebook design algorithm for MIMO-OFDM precoded spatial multiplexing systems under a specific average power constraint. The optimal precoder has the structure of a precoding and power allocation for each mode obtained by water-filling process. We derived the closed form solution for power allocation in the MSE- sense. Simulation results show that the MSE-based codebook construction algorithm with hybrid design of power allocation and precoding can achieve better performance than that of equal power allocattion based codebook in the previous works.	algorithm;channel state information;codebook;feedback;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;online and offline;simulation;spatial multiplexing;transmitter	Feng She;Wen Chen;Hanwen Luo;Xiaoting Yang	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.579	closed-form expression;telecommunications;control theory;channel state information;spatial multiplexing;precoding;statistics;mimo	EDA	39.12251190527837	84.56296621198042	110893

In this paper, performance analysis for LS-MIMO has been carried out for mobile-to-mobile (M2M) communication network over Ν-α-μ fading channels. The orthogonality condition for LS-MIMO over cascaded independent and identically distributed (iid) α-μ MIMO fading channels has been verified extensively. Using this property, we have analyzed for the first time LS-MIMO M2M communication over cascaded iid α-μ MIMO fading channels.

Assuming a single source and a single destination with multiple relay nodes, using binary modulation at the source, we present optimum receiver at the destination on frequency-flat Rayleigh fading channels by taking into account the effects of imperfect channel knowledge at the receivers. Since exact performance analysis of the optimal receiver is complicated due to the non-linear nature of the log-likelihood ratio contribution from the relay, upon using a standard technique in the literature, we present a simple approximate receiver and derive closed-form expression for the average bit error rate (BER) at the destination with a single relay node. We also present a simple analytical technique that allows us to numerically evaluate the average BER for an arbitrary number of relay nodes. Finally, with perfect channel estimation our proposed receiver subsumes the coherent receivers whereas with a minimum mean-square error channel estimation it reduces to the non-coherent receiver in the work of Chen and Laneman (2006).	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;camera serial interface;channel state information;coefficient;coherence (physics);entity–relationship model;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;relay;shortest path problem;x.690	Ramesh Annavajjala	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2009.2038416	receiver;telecommunications;likelihood-ratio test;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;relay channel;statistics	Mobile	37.23184973646817	77.70955099719905	112021
d44aa4681b430f08b5b1a476ccb9c3bebdca4b39	on intercept probability minimization under sparse random linear network coding		This paper considers a network where a node wishes to transmit a source message to a legitimate receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper. The transmitter secures its transmissions employing a sparse implementation of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC). A tight approximation to the probability of the eavesdropper recovering the source message is provided. The proposed approximation applies to both the cases where transmissions occur without feedback or where the reliability of the feedback channel is actively impaired – as it happens when an eavesdropper jams the feedback channel in an attempt to force the source node to keep transmitting after the legitimate receiver has recovered the message. An optimization framework for minimizing the intercept probability by optimizing the sparsity of the RLNC is also presented. Results validate the proposed approximation and quantify the gain provided by our optimization framework over solutions where non-sparse RLNC is used.	approximation;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;propagation constant;sparse matrix;transmitter;visual intercept	Andrea Tassi;Robert J.

The relay is assumed to operate in the decode-and-forward mode. The average symbol error rate (SER) performance for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is analyzed. To make the analysis mathematically tractable, two approximations are adopted to deal with the problem of correlations between the received SINRs of the relay and terminal and a tight approximate expression of the average SER is derived in closed-form. Moreover, it can be shown that the result can be simply applied in straightforward network coding protocol with co-channel interference. Based on the analytic results, we study the impacts of system parameters, such as interference power, number of interferers and relay placement, on the average SER performance. Finally, the correctness of our analytic results is validated through Monte Carlo simulations.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;correctness (computer science);interference (communication);key (cryptography);linear network coding;modulation;monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation	Youyun Xu;Xiaochen Xia;Kui Xu;Yande Chen	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666119	communications protocol;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;statistics;monte carlo method	Arch	36.85629908730331	79.15510155089684	112301

We analyze the performance of the relay assist dual-hop transmission, and derive a closed form outage probability (OP) solutions. To minimize the OP for relay position selection, we formulate the objective task as a minimization problem. This position is a function of the transmit power, path loss and height of the access point (AP), and it can be obtained numerically. In addition, we compare the performance for different transmission schemes, including optimal user relay node (URN) assisted transmission, dual-hop transmission assisted by a fixed relay node (FRN), and the single-hop direct transmission. The simulation results have demonstrated that the optimal relay position selection transmission can provide significant higher throughput than FRN assisted transmission as well as direct transmission, therefore it is very promising for the future 60 GHz wireless systems.	downtime;interference (communication);loss function;modulation;numerical analysis;optimization problem;profiling (computer programming);relay;simulation;subcarrier;throughput;ur, ur/web;wireless access point	Zhijun Liu;Xiaofeng Tao;Waheed ur Rehman;Zhou Xu;Xiaodong Xu	2013	2013 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6825008	throughput;link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;computer science;interference;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;computer network	Mobile	35.145008267966475	85.9380040997069	112328

The D2D communication takes place in the same spectrum as the cellular communication. In the two-way relaying based D2D mode, the relay uses physical layer network coding (PNC). The precoder-decoder design is based on minimizing mean square errors (MSE), which is useful to mitigate interference and to improve the performance of both D2D and cellular communications. Distributed and centralized algorithms are proposed considering bi-directional communication in both D2D and cellular communications. In the direct D2D mode, a similar MSE procedure is adopted, and exact solutions are derived for precoder-decoder matrices. In the numerical results, the optimality and convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Additionally, the system performances are investigated with interference thresholds and maximum available power at the nodes. Two transmit mode selection schemes are considered as dynamic and static selection schemes. Finally, these selection schemes are investigated over an XY grid by varying the position of a given device. The results reveal that the PNC two-way relaying based D2D mode extends the coverage area of D2D communication.	algorithm;bi-directional text;centralized computing;interference (communication);linear network coding;mimo;mean squared error;mobile phone;numerical analysis;performance;relay	Keeth Jayasinghe;Praneeth Jayasinghe;R.

A joint antenna selection scheme for all nodes is first proposed based on the maximizing the worse received signal to noise ratio (SNR) of two end users. Then, we derive the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received SNRs of both users. We also achieve the closed-form expressions of average bit error rate (BER) and outage probability of the relay system. Furthermore, we reveal the asymptotic behavior of our system when transmitting SNR or the number of antennas is large. Our analysis shows that the proposed DF antenna selection scheme achieves full diversity.

When the receivers are not only interested in their own signals but also in eavesdropping other users' signals, the cross talk becomes information leakage.We propose a novel and efficient secrecy rate enhancing relay strategy EFFIN for information leakage neutralization. The relay matrix is chosen such that the effective leakage channel (spectral and spatial) is zero. Thus, it ensures secrecy regardless of receive processing employed at eavesdroppers and does not rely on wiretaps codes to ensure secrecy, unlike other physical layer security techniques such as artificial noise. EFFIN achieves a higher sum secrecy rate over several state-of-the-art baseline methods.	baseline (configuration management);code;information leakage;interference (communication);relay;spectral leakage	Zuleita Ka Ming Ho;Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Sabrina Gerbracht	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638580	crosstalk;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;precoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.153702288444954	83.33086537935519	112646

We derive the asymptotic sum capacity of the independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) MIMO broadcast channel and the asymptotic sum rate of a linear multiuser beamforming system with respect to the number of receive antennas per user, where two users are served with a zero inter-user interference constraint. Based on this result, we show that linear multiuser beamforming with many receive antennas can asymptotically achieve the sum capacity of the two-user i.i.d. MIMO broadcast channel even without opportunistic scheduling gain. Numerical results confirm that as the number of receive antennas increases the sum rate of linear multiuser beamforming system converges to the sum capacity.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;beamforming;deferred procedure call;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;scheduling (computing)	Chan-Byoung Chae;Robert W.

All cells of interest are first divided into disjoint cell clusters with adequate geographical isolations. Cells within the same cluster would be allocated the same downlink/uplink configuration to avoid the cross-subframe co-channel interference. Transmission directions in cells belonging to different clusters could be different in a subframe by selecting different downlink/uplink configurations freely, in order to achieve the benefits of traffic adaptation. The central control units of the network optimize and reconfigure the downlink/uplink allocations on the basis of cell cluster. The optimization/reconfiguration accounts for both the traffic condition and the capability of cells, transmission directions and users in handling traffic demands. System level simulation results are provided, from which, the effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated in terms of the cell- average and cell-edge packet throughput performances in both downlink and uplink directions.	central processing unit;centralized computing;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network packet;performance;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput	Dalin Zhu;Ming Lei	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692477	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	26.635516996919115	88.3072442057558	113281

Cognitive full duplex relay networks (CogFRNs) offer the advantage not only of increasing spectral efficiency by spectrum sharing but also of extending coverage through the use of relays. Concurrent transmissions at the source and relay in CogFRNs can overcome a loss of resource efficiency in a way that conventional half duplex relay (HDR) systems cannot. However, in CogFRNs, the primary user experiences interference from the secondary source and relay simultaneously due to the effects of full duplexing. Satisfying the interference constraint by simply reducing transmission power results in performance degradation for the secondary user. What is therefore needed is a way to optimize the transmission powers at the secondary source and relay. To address this need, we propose an optimal power allocation scheme based on minimizing the outage probability in CogFRNs. We then analyze the outage probability of the secondary user in the noise-limited and interference-limited environments. In addition, we also propose an outage-constrained power allocation scheme which does not require the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) for the link between the primary and secondary users. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve performance improvement in terms of outage probability.	channel state information;cognitive radio;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;interference (communication);relay;secondary source;simulation;spectral efficiency	Hyungjong Kim;Sungmook Lim;Hano Wang;Daesik Hong	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.083112.120127	cognitive radio;strontium;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;probability;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.773148551721206	85.7845399903996	113468

The source-relay and relay-destination channels undergo Rayleigh and Rician fading respectively. The channel state information is only available at the destination, and the destination computes the optimal transmit and receive beamforming vectors to maximize the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination. The optimal transmit beamforming vector will be sent back to the transmitter via a dedicated feedback link. We derive closed-form expressions for the cumulative density function, probability density function, and moments to statistically characterize the properties of the instantaneous SNR. These statistical properties are used to analyze the performance of the system with outage probability, average bit error rate, and ergodic capacity. The results of the performance analysis reveal that Rician factor and number of antennas at the nodes improve the system performance, and the optimal single stream beamforming system provides better error performance than an orthogonal space-time block coded based AF MIMO system.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;bit error rate;channel state information;coherence (physics);downtime;ergodicity;mimo;mimo-ofdm;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Praneeth Jayasinghe;L.

For this setup, we explicitly characterize the optimal online energy management strategy for maximizing the long-term throughput under different assumptions on the availability of channel state information. We show that in the case of no fading, the amount of energy allocated to each channel use decreases exponentially with time since the last battery recharge and in the case of fading, the optimal solution has a discounted water-filling structure. Our results reveal that the structure of the optimal energy management strategy in the online case with finite battery is significantly different from the infinite battery and offline cases characterized in the literature.	bernoulli polynomials;channel state information;channel use;online and offline;rechargeable battery;throughput;transmitter	Abbas Kazerouni;Ayfer Özgür	2015	2015 13th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2015.7151078	wireless ad hoc network;transmitter;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;energy harvesting;fading;energy management	Embedded	32.73579711974001	85.7218911220945	113695

This paper investigates if, for a large number of users, simpler schemes can achieve the same performance. Specifically, we show that a zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) strategy, while generally suboptimal, can achieve the same asymptotic sum capacity as that of DPC, as the number of users goes to infinity. In proving this asymptotic result, we provide an algorithm for determining which users should be active under ZFBF. These users are semiorthogonal to one another and can be grouped for simultaneous transmission to enhance the throughput of scheduling algorithms. Based on the user grouping, we propose and compare two fair scheduling schemes in round-robin ZFBF and proportional-fair ZFBF. We provide numerical results to confirm the optimality of ZFBF and to compare the performance of ZFBF and proposed fair scheduling schemes with that of various MIMO BC strategies.	algorithm;beamforming;broadcast domain;deferred procedure call;fair-share scheduling;mimo;numerical analysis;proportionally fair;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);throughput	Taesang Yoo;Andrea J.

Subsequently, El Gamal, Caire, and Damen considered signaling across the same channel using an L -round automatic retransmission request (ARQ) protocol that assumes the presence of a noiseless feedback channel capable of conveying one bit of information per use of the feedback channel. They showed that given a fixed number L of ARQ rounds and no power control, there is a tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing gains, termed the diversity-multiplexing-delay (DMD) tradeoff. This tradeoff indicates that the diversity gain under the ARQ scheme for a particular information rate is considerably larger than that obtainable in the absence of feedback. In this paper, a set of sufficient conditions under which a space-time (ST) code will achieve the DMD tradeoff is presented. This is followed by two classes of explicit constructions of ST codes which meet these conditions. Constructions belonging to the first class achieve minimum delay and apply to a broad class of fading channels whenever nr ges nt and either L\nt or nt\L. The second class of constructions do not achieve minimum delay, but do achieve the DMD tradeoff of the fading channel for all statistical descriptions of the channel and for all values of the parameters nr, nt, L.	british undergraduate degree classification;calculus of constructions;code;first-class function;mimo;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;retransmission (data networks);spatial multiplexing	Sameer A.

The TF of each sub-channel consists of a number of multi-path components caused by propagation of a transmitted signal in random scattering media. The proposed CCF is expressed in terms of several environmental parameters (such as the moment generating function (MGF) of the delay profile (DP) and the pathloss exponent). It is a summation of two terms: the first term is due to the autocorrelation of multi-path components while the second term is due to the cross-correlation of multi-path components. Each term is a product of several correlation functions. Each of these correlation functions represents different dependencies of the wireless channel in terms of time, carrier frequency and the position of the antenna elements around both the transmitter and the receiver site. Interestingly, the last two terms of these functions are (n/2)-order (or n-order) integrations of the MGF of the DP, evaluated at two carrier frequencies (or the difference between carrier frequencies), where n is the pathloss exponent of the environment	autocorrelation;carrier frequency;carrier wave;cross-correlation;mimo;microsoft customer care framework;software propagation;transfer function;transmitter	Saeed Gazor;Hamidreza Saligheh Rad	2006	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2006.1687760	synchronization;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;cross-correlation;mathematics;transfer function;fading;statistics	Mobile	27.953836800384387	76.62314481599479	114218

c72cd4a849c11e1810cde34a7ecbd9b775fff6e4	a frame structure with precoding for bidirectional low latency applications		The advent of 5G will introduce new classes of services which demand different requirements compared to traditional radio systems. Of particular interest is the Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), which restricts the PHY layer to short deadlines for delivering the radio message. For OFDM based systems, the radio frame structure should be able to support large variations in data rates of any two given communicating nodes. Legacy radio frame structures did not take such restrictions into account. In this paper, we present a flexible radio frame structure where, under low latency constraints, large variations in the bi-directional data rates can be easily supported using time and frequency duplexing. As such, a fair subdivision of the radio resources which fit into the exact requested data rates becomes possible. To maintain high spectral efficiency, the bi-directional traffics are packed close to each other in frequency domain, which leads to considerable amount of cross talk. To suppress this interference, we introduce a novel precoder which mitigates the cross talk interference in baseband.	baseband;directional statistics;duplex (telecommunications);guard digit;interference (communication);interrupt latency;out-of-bag error;phy (chip);radio frequency;requirement;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;subdivision surface;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Mohamed Ibrahim;Wen Xu	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269138	frequency domain;real-time computing;duplex (telecommunications);computer network;physical layer;latency (engineering);computer science;precoding;baseband;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;spectral efficiency	Networks	25.11112005081191	87.6064685769996	114441

e5445c34182c087403aed5b1a785a637f037ac1f	on the regimes in millimeter wave networks: noise-limited or interference-limited?		Given the overcrowding in the 300 MHz-3 GHz spectrum, millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum is a promising candidate for the future generations of wireless networks. With the unique propagation characteristics at mmWave frequencies, one of the fundamental questions to address is whether mmWave networks are noise or interference-limited. The regime in which the network operates significantly impacts the MAC layer design, resource allocation procedure and also interference management techniques. In this paper, we first derive the statistical characteristic of the cumulative interference in finite-sized mmWave networks considering configuration randomness across spatial and spectral domains while including the effect of blockages. Subsequently, using the derived interference model we set up a likelihood ratio test (LRT) (that is dependent on various network parameters) in order to detect the regime of the network from an arbitrarily located user standpoint. Unlike traditional networks, in mmWave networks, different likelihood of experiencing an interference-limited regime can be observed at different locations.	approximation algorithm;binary classification;cobham's thesis;full-spectrum light;interference (communication);long-running transaction;principle of maximum entropy;radiation pattern;randomness;software deployment;software propagation;statistical interference;wireless access point	Solmaz Niknam;Balasubramaniam Natarajan	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403515	computer network;randomness;wireless network;overcrowding;likelihood-ratio test;random variable;extremely high frequency;interference (wave propagation);computer science;resource allocation	Mobile	28.173228730603864	84.41782648093051	114516

By exploiting the computation over multiple-access channel (CoMAC) method, this paper proposes a novel CoMAC-based CSS scheme that allows the cooperative SUs to encode their local statistics in transmit power and to transmit simultaneously the modulated symbols sequence carrying transmit power information to the fusion center. The fusion center then makes the final decision on the presence of primary users by recovering the overall test statistic of energy detection from the energy of the received signal. Performance metrics of the CoMAC-based CSS scheme, i.e., detection probability and false alarm probability, are further derived based on the central limit theorem. Finally, based on the derived detection and false alarm probabilities, both energy detection threshold and spectrum sensing time are optimized to improve the average throughput of the CRN. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of this work.	analog computer;computation	Meng Zheng;Chi Xu;Wei Liang;Haibin Yu;Lin Chen	2017	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2016.10.015	telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	34.00264796493506	84.77750940932634	114526

User fairness is also considered in the analysis.

This paper presents a new approach for estimating the velocity of a mobile station, or equivalently the maximum Doppler frequency shift, in a typical micro-cellular system with non-isotropic scattering. The proposed estimators use the instantaneous frequency of the received signal at the MS antenna. Unlike the existing velocity estimators, the proposed estimator is unbiased when the scattering distribution is non- isotropic and is robust to path-loss and shadowing. Index Terms—velocity estimation, non-isotropic scattering, in- stantaneous frequency, micro-cellular systems. for the velocity of an MS is proposed which is based on the 1 st order moment of the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the received signal. The proposed estimator is proven to outperform the other estimators in the presence of shadowing. All the aforementioned velocity estimators are derived with the assumption that the distribution of the scattering component of the received signal is isotropic. Also most of them are only valid when the variations in the received signal strength due to path-loss and shadowing can be assumed to be negligible. It follows from the fact that these assumptions are not generally true in a micro-cellular system (9, p. 49), those estimators will be significantly biased when being used to estimate the velocity of an MS moving in such environments. This paper presents a new velocity estimator which takes into account the distribution of the scattered component of the received signal and is also robust to path-loss and shadowing. The proposed estimator uses the statistics of the IF of the received signal to estimate the velocity. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the model and statistics of the received signal. In section III, using the derived statistics in section II, the proposed estimator is presented. A new estimator for the directivity parameter is also given in section III. Section IV evaluates the performance of the proposed estimators using computer simulations. Finally section V concludes the paper.	velocity	Ehsan Zandi;Ghasem Azemi	2009		10.1109/VETECF.2009.5379060	frequency modulation;efficient estimator;instantaneous phase;estimation;electronic engineering;estimator;mobile telephony;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;path loss;shadow mapping;mobile station;scattering;invariant estimator	Robotics	26.795477896442726	77.4675556756271	114860

Since the EE of a system is evaluated in a duration where the channel may vary, designing a transmission strategy to maximize instantaneous EE may lead to a loss in achievable EE of the system. To exploit the accumulative information of throughput and energy, accumulative EE (ACEE) can be used as the objective function, which is the ratio of the accumulated throughput divided by the overall energy consumed over the past time slots. By analyzing the solutions of three EE maximal problems to optimize rate allocation among multiple subcarriers in multiple time slots, we show when and why the ACEE can achieve high system EE. Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis. Our analysis show that the ACEE is beneficial for the systems with low circuit power consumption under time-varying channels when either the data rate requirement or signal to noise ratio is low, and either the number of antennas or subcarriers is small.	data rate units;java platform, enterprise edition;loss function;maximal set;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;throughput	Chuting Yao;Zhikun Xu;Tingting Liu;Chenyang Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6884203	real-time computing;telecommunications	Robotics	33.62955100651116	88.23908588160388	114899

The achieved data is computed according to an iterative algorithm, which determines the linear transmit and receive beamforming filters that maximize the sum-rate. This method allows us to design the transmit filter with a simple algorithm. The Channel State Information (CSI) of all channels is assumed to be known at the transmitters, and cooperation between (BSs) in sharing the CSI is considered. MIMO channels in different scenarios were measured in a typical propagation environment using two BSs and four handsets, similar to smartphones, held by different users. Users were located at different distances from each other, and at different orientations with respect to each other. We computed the received data rate for four different groups of handsets at a fixed SNR of 15 dB. Using the algorithm, we investigated how the experimental and theoretical capacity is influenced by cross-correlation between the individual user linkages arising from one antenna at the BS, and by imbalance in the power of the different linkages. The system performs best when the handsets are separated by at least 1 m. Furthermore, both in theory and in practice, the algorithm is more sensitive to power imbalance rather than cross-correlation.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;cooperative mimo;cross-correlation;data rate units;database normalization;download;iterative method;matlab;signal-to-noise ratio;smartphone;software propagation;transmitter;uncompressed video;whole earth 'lectronic link	Maryam Rahimi	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2880-6	telecommunications;control theory;correlation	Mobile	37.75016898331255	83.7919439733598	114932
8f5c76238d58e6cad1acd3dc6237fe4948beb559	on the impact of transmitter channel knowledge in energy-efficient machine-type communication		We address the problem of delivering a fixed data payload over a Rayleigh fading wireless channel, where the aim is to allocate resources to minimize the average total energy, given by the sum of the transmit energy and an overhead circuit energy. This scenario is well suited for uplink cellular machine-type communications in future 5G Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, where the focus is more on device energy efficiency than on throughput. We propose and describe the transmission policies to be used under three scenarios with different levels of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter: non-causal CSI, causal CSI, and average CSI. For typical uplink macrocellular links, we show 1) that the strategy for causal CSI has nearly the same energy efficiency as the unachievable non-causal CSI bound, and 2) that the energy difference between this bound and the average CSI energy is about a factor of 2 to 5.	causal filter;channel state information;energy minimization;entropy (information theory);internet of things;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Andrea Biral;Howard C.

A zero-forcing (ZF)-based relay transceiver design with semiblind gain control is presented, considering the problem of relay oscillation. The asymptotic expression of end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise power (SINR) is derived under the general power scaling scheme. The scaling behaviors of echo interference (EI) and effective channel estimation error are determined. Scaling results show that the deployment of very large antenna arrays at the relay has the potential to eliminate the effect of EI due to the full-duplex operation, if the power scaling scheme is selected properly. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis, a low-complexity power control scheme is proposed to optimize the spectral efficiency of AF-MM-FDR. Simulation results show that the proposed power control scheme improves the spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff of AF-MM-FDR significantly.	anisotropic filtering;binary prefix;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;noise power;qm/mm;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;transceiver;zero-forcing precoding	Xiaochen Xia;Youyun Xu;Kui Xu;Dongmei Zhang;Wenfeng Ma	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2467211	electronic engineering;automatic gain control;telecommunications;engineering;control theory;interference;oscillation;statistics;transceiver;mimo	Mobile	37.43197364819288	85.70836072769335	115675

In this paper, VSF-OFCDM is utilized for sub-carrier allocation with two dimensional spreading (2D) for femto users (FUEs) in small cells that are deployed within an OFDMA macro network. The performance of femto/macro hybrid network is investigated by deriving closed form expressions for the SINR for FUEs and macro users (MUEs) in uplinks, that are impacted by different types of interferers, 2D spreading factors and load conditions. We also evaluate the BER performance of FUEs and MUEs through Monte Carlo simulation in interference- and noise-limited scenarios for different parameters.	carrier frequency offset;embedded system;interference (communication);modulation;monte carlo method;network traffic control;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;x.690	Fatima Hussain;Alagan Anpalagan	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649419	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;spread spectrum;computer network;monte carlo method	Robotics	27.595875869058528	85.19465222620697	115937

By exploiting the PU channel (in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)) and the PU interference to SUs, two iterative power control algorithms are proposed to optimize the total throughput performance of CR systems, subject to the tolerable interference limits at the PUs. In the proposed Algorithm 1, we show that for optimal throughput performance, in addition to the channel gains from the SU transmitters to the PU and SU receivers (as commonly assumed in the literature), the SU transmitters also need to know the PU interference to the SU receivers, as well as the SINRs at the PU receivers. In the proposed Algorithm 2, the SU transmitters need to know only the PU interference to the SU receivers, in addition to the channel gains from the SU transmitters to the PU and SU receivers, but not require to know the PU channels.	algorithm;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iteration;modulation;need to know;one-class classification;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;superuser;throughput;transmitter	Chin Choy Chai	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493670	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	38.59698682096649	86.67112489204852	116005

To cope with the corner effect due to the loss of the line of sight (LOS), a fast HO decision algorithm is required which can guarantee the LTE seamless HO requirement and keep the quality of service (QoS) criteria. In this paper, a HO decision algorithm, the integrator algorithm, has been evaluated in the Manhattan scenario, and is compared with the traditional power budget (PBGT) handover. The study focuses on the LTE intra-frequency HO scenario and uses the reference symbol received power (RSRP) measurement as input. The results show that the integrator algorithm has the same performance as the PBGT algorithm based on the number of HOs per UE and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) evaluations for different UE speeds.	algorithm;compaq lte;interference (communication);network packet;packet switching;performance;quality of service;seamless3d;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;wilfried brauer	Naizheng Zheng;Jeroen Wigard	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.296	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;statistics;computer network	Mobile	26.13849030469468	87.57614995413532	116017

We assume the base station transmits multiple independent data streams to multiple legitimate users. During the transmission, however, there are multiple eavesdroppers with multiple antennas that have interests in the streams from the base station. In order to wiretap the desired streams, the eavesdroppers may collude or not, and maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the desired streams using receive beamforming. The optimal cooperative jammer is designed to keep the achieved SINR at eavesdroppers below a threshold to guarantee that the transmission from the base station to legitimate users is confidential. One main advantage of the proposed cooperative jamming scheme is that no modification is needed for the existing precoding schemes at the base station and decoding schemes at legitimate users. Thus, any existing practical precoding/decoding schemes for multiuser MIMO broadcast channel can be applied directly with the help of a friendly jammer using the proposed cooperative jamming.	beamforming;confidentiality;cooperative mimo;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;radio jamming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Jun Yang;Il-Min Kim;Dong In Kim	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.040413.120972	telecommunications;mathematics;precoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.32870009319815	83.45460673090585	116128

This paper studies the case of a relay channel, where the source's objective is to deliver a given number of data packets to a receiver with the aid of a relay. The source broadcasts to both the receiver and the relay using one frequency, while the relay uses another frequency for transmissions to the receiver, allowing for a full-duplex operation of the relay. We analyze the decoding complexity and delay performance of two types of relays: one that preserves the systematic structure of the code from the source; another that does not. A systematic relay forwards uncoded packets upon reception, but transmits coded packets to the receiver after receiving the first coded packet from the source. On the other hand, a non-systematic relay always transmits linear combinations of previously received packets. We compare the performance of these two alternatives by analytically characterizing the expected transmission completion time as well as the number of uncoded packets forwarded by the relay. Our numerical results show that, for a poor channel between the source and the receiver, preserving the systematic structure at the relay (i) allows a significant increase in the number of uncoded packets received by the receiver, thus reducing the decoding complexity, and (ii) preserves close to optimal delay performance.	duplex (telecommunications);linear network coding;network packet;numerical analysis;relay channel	Giuliano Giacaglia;Xiaomeng Shi;MinJi Kim;Daniel Enrique Lucani;Muriel Médard	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655057	linear network coding;link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.24552741315607	75.25190152564937	116202

In this context, this paper proposes a novel concept of an intelligent Amplify and Forward (AF) 5G repeater for enabling the densification of future cellular networks. The proposed repeater features a Spectrum Sensing (SS) intelligence capability and utilizes such intelligence in a complementary fashion in comparison to its existing counterpart (e.g., Cognitive Radio) by detecting the active channels within the assigned spectrum. This intelligence allows the proposed repeater to carry out selective amplification of the active channels in contrast to the full amplification in conventional AF repeaters. Furthermore, the performance of a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) based two hop cellular network utilizing the proposed repeater is evaluated in terms of the system throughput. Simulation results demonstrate up to 13 % increase when compared with the conventional repeaters. Moreover, the effect of SS errors on the system capacity is analyzed.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;channel capacity;cognitive radio;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);sensor;simulation;standard database management analysis;throughput	Shree Krishna Sharma;Mohammad N.

The radio frequency link operating in the 2.4/5.8 GHz ISM-band is considered as the transmission medium. First, the general concept of the system which is based on a decentralized/distributed topology is illustrated in detail. Then, the physical layer of the system which is based on a combination of TDMA and FDMA is examined. The system supports variable rate transmission and is flexible. As modulation both QPSK and 16-QAM are taken into account. The channel coding is based on a powerful Reed—Solomon code. The control signals, sent at the beginning of the TDMA frames, with carrier-sensing based on correlation are used to detect the free time-slots. An example of the access to the network is given. Furthermore, the simulation results with a link-budget evaluation are analyzed. It is shown that the maximum data rate at 2.4 GHz, using a 16-QAM modulation can be up to 26.8 Mbit/s.

The performance is assessed for the 3GPP generic simulation scenario and for two site-specific cases, with the aim of comparing the results coming from these different scenarios. The site-specific scenarios are based on detailed three-dimensional topography map data and advanced ray-tracing techniques. It is generally found that the first order statistics and overall conclusions are in good alignment for the considered environments. However, there are also a number of differences in the obtained performance results for the different cases, e.g. in terms of small cell time-of-stay statistics. The explicit modeling of streets and building topology, propagation in street canyons, etc., is found to have an important impact on the mobility performance. Especially the time-of-stay statistics and the location of handover failures differ between generic 3GPP case and the site-specific modeling scenarios. So in conclusion, trends and observations from simulations based on the 3GPP scenario are valuable, but should be supplemented by results from site-specific scenarios, as additional performance-determining effects are more accurately represented for such cases.	compaq lte;explicit modeling;gradient;interference (communication);ray tracing (graphics);simulation;software propagation;topography	Simone Barbera;Lucas Chavarria;Laura Luque Sanchez;Klaus I.

4e2575536bf52d0ec39eb50b2b42a782bdd72a60	non-orthogonal multiple access schemes in wireless powered communication networks		We characterize time and power allocations to optimize the sum-throughput of a Wireless Powered Communication Network (WPCN) with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). In our setup, an Energy Rich (ER) source broadcasts wireless energy to several devices, which use it to simultaneously transmit data to an Access Point (AP) on the uplink. Differently from most prior works, in this paper we consider a generic scenario, in which the ER and AP do not coincide, i.e., are two separate entities. We study two NOMA decoding schemes, namely Low Complexity Decoding (LCD) and Successive Interference Cancellation Decoding (SICD). For each scheme, we formulate a sum-throughput optimization problem over a finite horizon. Despite the complexity of the LCD optimization problem, due to its non-convexity, we recast it into a series of geometric programs. On the other hand, we establish the convexity of the SICD optimization problem and propose an algorithm to find its optimal solution. Our numerical results demonstrate the importance of using successive interference cancellation in WPCNs with NOMA, and show how the energy should be distributed as a function of the system parameters.	convex function;entity;erdős–rényi model;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network performance;numerical analysis;optimization problem;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput;wireless access point	Mohamed A.

Cooperative spectrum sensing is employed to improve the sensing performance. The spectrum sensing policy should maximize the probability of discovering and utilizing the spectrum opportunities while ensuring the specified primary user (PU) protection level. For a homogeneous scenario, the optimal sensing probability of each SU is obtained to maximize the CC throughput while satisfying the energy causality and PU collision constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal charging time τe. Numerical results depict that in an energy constrained scenario, we can benefit from the optimal cooperative spectrum sensing policy in terms of enhanced PU detection.	algorithm;causality;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;iterative method;one-class classification;power supply;radio frequency;superuser;throughput;vii	Huidong Liu;Jin Chen;Guoru Ding;Kaiqiang Yan;Li Cui	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341257	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	33.01838531645132	86.99220938290941	116880
bea7a688bd38f7f074d59563e7ba8c29e95704ab	application of frequency diversity for dimensioning a ka-band satellite system		The growth of the demand for telecommunication services is going to saturate the frequency bands usually used (C or KJ. For this reason the Ka-band is much considered and is going to be highly used. To meet the requirements of a more developed market a satellite system in KO-band with European coverage and better performance than those of common VSATs, especially in terms of capacity and of link availability, is proposed and characterized. The negative effect due to the high rain attenuation, that represents the main impairment using K,-band, can be mitigated using one or more fade countermeasures. Frequency diversity, which well suites the characteristics of the proposed systems, has been analysed and characterized in detail using a model developed at Politecnico di Milano. Its performances are shown as a function of different system parameters such as total number of stations, number of assisted stations, link availability and statistical dependence among stations. The aim of the paper is to introduce a design methodology and to show the advantages obtainable using frequency diversity for a Ka-band system with higher performances than common VSATs. The advantages achieved for rain margins are shown and system design parameters are then compared with those of an uncompensated system. Using this type of countermeasure, the dimensioning of the whole system (both payload and earthstation) is proved to be much less severe.	frequency band;ka band;performance;rain fade;requirement;systems design	Michele Luglio	1996	Int.

The fountain code is a channel code with good performance. In this paper, a cooperative relay scheme employing fountain codes and rotated constellations is presented. By this scheme, the SSD is achieved in the transmission process from the relay nodes to the destination node through the cooperation among the relay nodes, thus, improving the error rate. No interleaver is needed. The use of fountain codes leads to the improvement of the communication efficiency in the point-to-multipoint transmission from the source node to the relay nodes and the reduction of the transmission time from the relay nodes to the destination node. The performance of the scheme is analysed and simulated. The analytical and simulation results show that the scheme has a good performance.	fountain code;relay	Weijia Lei;Xianzhong Xie;Xiangming Li	2013	IJWMC	10.1504/IJWMC.2013.055762	fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;relay channel;cooperation;computer network	DB	34.23358712462569	77.17226571798703	117147
a5c133cb2e6474139ff968155c43c72dfa97d235	adaptive transmission policy for energy harvesting relaying systems		In this paper, we consider an energy harvesting (EH)-based relaying system where an EH-source node equipped with a rechargeable battery to store the energy harvested from the environment, communicates with a destination with the help of a relay node. The relay and destination both have an unlimited power supply, while the source relies solely on the harvested energy. A delay-limited transmission mode is assumed in this paper, in which if the source data cannot be transmitted within a delay deadline, it will be lost. Based on this model, an efficient adaptive source transmission policy is proposed. Markov chain analysis is considered to model the levels of the stored energy at the source node and the system performance is evaluated in terms of the transmission and success probabilities. The results reveal that the benefit of the proposed transmission strategy in delay-limited applications is highly dependent on the proper choice of the system design parameters and the harvested energy per packet.	exponential hierarchy;markov chain;network packet;power supply;rechargeable battery;relay;source data;systems design	Abdelhamid Salem;Leïla Musavian	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450273	computer network;source data;energy harvesting;network packet;relay;transmission (mechanics);markov chain;signal-to-noise ratio;markov process;computer science	Mobile	32.57381046871998	85.13774008000881	117258

Narrowband interference (NBI) is one of the crucial affecting factors of PLC systems and requires accurate modeling. In this paper, the narrowband interference for PLC is investigated using both measurement and modeling approaches. A novel three- dimensional (3D) Markov chain (MC) based statistical model is developed, to model the occurrence of NBI which is associated with the traffic of certain radio users. An intensive performance analysis on the impact of the NBI on PLC is provided. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by measured results. The 3D MC model can be used for optimizing future cognitive PLC networks, through simulation-based approaches.	catastrophic interference;computer simulation;interference (communication);internet;markov chain;power-line communication;profiling (computer programming);statistical interference;statistical model;throughput	Jun Yin;Xu Zhu;Yi Huang	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841485	simulation;telecommunications;noise measurement;interference;markov process;solid modeling;statistics	Metrics	29.36467842930811	81.28758943578164	117452

We derive a threshold adaptation scheme to reduce the effect of the feedback delay on bit error rate (BER). Numerical results reveal that MQAM with threshold adaptation is more reliable to the feedback delay than M-QAM with fixed thresholds. When we combine the proposed scheme with ARQ, the enhanced BER can lower the probability of packet loss and reduce the number of packet retransmissions.	automatic repeat request;bit error rate;feedback;modulation;network packet;non-negative matrix factorization;spectral efficiency;x.690	Sang-Do Lee;Young-Chai Ko	2010	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2010.02.092191	computer simulation;hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;automatic repeat request;fading;statistics	Mobile	34.98838128259282	78.45080875960893	117560
055201d03c1a7a71351135c7923a16a4b08b1650	optimization of multiband cooperative spectrum sensing with particle swarm optimization		In this paper, the multiband linear cooperative spectrum sensing optimization problem related to weight coefficient, decision threshold, and sensing time is investigated to maximize the aggregated opportunistic throughput under the constraints of the aggregate interference, the subband interference, and the subband utilization. Theoretical analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of the interference, the sensing time, and the decision threshold on the throughput. Due to the nonconvex characteristic of the optimization problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm integrated with the golden section search (GSS) method (PSO-GSS) is proposed. Simulation results show that the PSO-GSS has a powerful searching ability and yields a 16.0%, 15.8%, and 1.23% increase in the aggregate throughput when compared with artificial bee colony, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, respectively. Moreover, PSO-GSS has a rapid convergence with only 15 iterations in reaching the maximum aggregate throughput, which is much less than the 80 iterations required by PSO. Additionally, with the PSO-GSS, the optimal sensing time is around 6 ms, and it is almost insensitive to the number of subchannels. Due to these advantages, it can provide a benchmark function for the other existing methods when dealing with the cooperative spectrum sensing problem.	mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;program optimization	Yongqiang Hei;Ran Wei;Wentao Li;Xiaohui Li	2017	Trans.

96415d7e648184eac1cc391a4b0df3d4f6e15784	dynamic beam selection for beam-rsrp based direction finding in mmw 5g networks		This paper considers direction-finding in millimeter wave (mmW) fifth generation (5G) networks by means of beam-based downlink (DL) reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements and subsequent reporting. In particular, we propose two methods that allow user equipments (UEs) to select, in an independent and dynamic manner, the most-relevant beam-RSRP (BRSRP) measurements as a trade-off between angle-related information and load of the feedback channel. A likelihood ratio (LR)-test is derived in which the hypothesis for “noise-only” BRSRP measurement is compared to that of “reference signal (RS)-plus-noise” observations, under a given significance level. A power threshold based method is also proposed in which the BRSRP measurements are compared to a threshold proportional to the noise power. Such a noise variance is estimated at each UE independently. The performance of the proposed beam selection schemes is assessed by means of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) tracking the direction of departure (DoD) of the line-of-sight (LoS) path between base stations (BSs) and a UE. Extensive numerical results are provided on a realistic mmW 5G outdoor deployment scenario operating at 39 GHz and with a ray-tracing propagation model based on the METIS Madrid grid.	direction finding;extended kalman filter;fifth generation computer;lr parser;line-of-sight (missile);metis;noise power;numerical analysis;ray tracing (graphics);software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications link	Elizaveta Rastorgueva-Foi;M&#x00E1;rio Costa;Mike Koivisto;Kari Lepp&#x00E4;nen;Mikko Valkama	2018	2018 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2018.8533735		Robotics	25.947311740623398	84.23027217159932	117659

75139ea4e7a031e03a9b63ad7d663a2c396ff89b	optimization of collaborative spectrum sensing with limited time resource		In this paper, Cognitive Radios (CRs) collaborate in spectrum sensing to detect random signals corrupted by Gaussian noise. Our analysis is based on a limited time resource assumption. This implies that the time resource dedicated for cooperative spectrum sensing process is constrained and shared between spectrum sensing time and results reporting time, which depends on the number of sensing users. We use common weighted gain combining detector to detect presence or absence of Primary User (PU). In order to find optimum gains, number of users and detection threshold, we maximize the achievable throughput with two approaches so that the predefined constraints on detection and false alarm probabilities are satisfied to protect the cooperative network performance quality. Analytical results in addition to simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform similar traditional detectors.

The results show the need for small to no downtilt in coverage-limited scenarios, otherwise (for the case of close placement of cells), downtilt improves performance significantly. The most important conclusion of this study is that there is a large gain in downlink coverage and capacity due to down-tilting to the correct range of values; in fact, without the correct down tilt, all the gain due to the close placement of cells is lost. The simulations demonstrate that all in-building penetration advantage (up to 40 dB for the examples simulated in this paper) and significant data capacity can be lost if the tilts are off by 4° to 5° from the optimal for closely placed cells. In-building coverage is one of the challenges for current cellular systems, and it is shown that the same range of downtilt is optimal whether the users are in-building or on-street; hence the concern that downtilt will reduce in-building coverage is demonstrated as in-accurate for closely placed cells. Another question that this paper addresses is: Are the downtilts which have been optimized for 3G systems also optimal for the 4G system? It is shown that the tilts that are optimal for 3G and voice systems are very good (if not optimal, at least near optimal) for the 4G LTE system. The simulations show that optimal down tilts can reduce the number of basestations (and hence capital investment) needed from the point of view of capacity. Given the capacity constraints in 4G LTE systems, the study suggests that antenna design and downtilts must receive much more than nominal focus for urban areas.	compaq lte;decibel;simulation;telecommunications link	Asif D.

However, BPLC has restricted transmission power in the very high frequency (VHF) band in order to avoid harmful interference to existing wireless services. In this paper, a new hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is proposed between BPLC and TV white space (TVWS) channels to enhance the system capacity over BPLC in VHF. In order to satisfy the interference limit at the TV primary user (PU) receiver (Rx), an iterative precoding algorithm is proposed to enhance the overall ergodic capacity. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid system over the previous cognitive BPLC system.	algorithm;channel capacity;coupling loss;ergodicity;hybrid system;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;power-line communication;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications network;white spaces (radio)	Mohammad Heggo;Xu Zhu;Yi Huang;Sumei Sun	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880854	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;interference;precoding;wireless;statistics;computer network;mimo	EDA	31.930668388651956	81.67531555662256	117974
e3428f67e06f7caf3ce2b768223430c2d082b905	a nonisovelocity geometry-based underwater acoustic channel model		This paper proposes a new geometry-based shallow underwater acoustic (UWA) channel model allowing for nonisovelocity ocean conditions. The fact that the isovelocity assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios motivates the need for developing channel models for nonisovelocity UWA propagation environments. Starting from a geometrical model, we develop a stochastic channel model for a single-input single-output (SISO) vehicle-to-vehicle UWA channel assuming that the ocean surface and bottom are rough and that the speed of sound varies with depth. The effect of the nonisovelocity condition has been assessed regarding its influence on the temporal autocorrelation function, the frequency correlation function (FCF), and the power delay profile of the UWA channel model. The UWA channel model has also been validated by matching its FCF as well as the therefrom derived main characteristic quantities, such as the average delay, delay spread, and coherence bandwidth against measurement data. The proposed UWA channel model is very useful for the design and performance analysis of UWA communication systems under realistic propagation conditions.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autocorrelation;channel (communications);shallow parsing;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Meisam Naderi;Alenka G.

In a practical large scale antenna deployment, implementation of hybrid beamforming structures is very important as it provides high array gains to overcome the high path loss and achieve sufficient link margins. However, while implementing this we encounter the challenges such as complexity, cost and energy consumption. In this paper a power consumption model for the large scale antenna mmWave system is presented and analysed. From the power consumption model we maximize the energy efficiency of the overall system. Optimization of energy efficiency is a crucial factor in system optimization and design of the powerhungry devices. But with increasing energy efficiency, the spectral efficiency decreases. Thus analysis of the relation between energy and spectral efficiency becomes a critical task and we optimize energy efficiency at a fixed spectral efficiency. The results can then be utilized to guide the practical energy/spectrum efficiency trade-off for the LSAS design.	beamforming;complexity;mathematical optimization;microwave;program optimization;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency	Gaojian Wang;Andreas Bytyn;Dara Khajavi;Yanlu Wang;Renato Negra;Gerd Ascheid	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881173	electronic engineering;public records;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;antenna;baseband;radio frequency;antenna efficiency	EDA	35.53399534919282	86.37149650592909	118217

In this paper, we consider an incremental decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative diversity network which employs the Nth best relay when the best relay is unavailable due to issues such as scheduling or load balancing. The end-to-end performance of this cooperative network is analyzed over independent and identical Rayleigh fading channels. Closed form expressions for the bit error rate and channel capacity are derived, and results are presented to illustrate the performance of the network when the Nth best relay is employed.	bit error rate;channel capacity;direction finding;end-to-end principle;load balancing (computing);rayleigh fading;relay;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency	Hao Zhang;Xinjie Wang;Jingjing Wang;T.

The basic idea is to apply superposition coding at each transmitter in order to achieve the full diversity gain, where the linear zero-forcing detection is used at each relay to combat inter-relay interference. Compared to existing uplink cooperative protocols, the proposed scheme can exploit the cooperation involving both the relays and the sources. An achievable diversity-multiplexing trade-off is developed for the proposed transmission protocol. Even with strong inter-relay interference which has been ignored by many existing works, the proposed scheme can still approach the optimal multiple-input single-output upper bound. Numerical results have also been provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed protocol.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);multiplexing;numerical method;relay;telecommunications link;transmitter	Peng Xu;Zhiguo Ding;Xuchu Dai;Ioannis Krikidis;Athanasios V.

4231eb84aa7ab01033659eefcb1b0c8c16f8e157	channel training design in full-duplex wiretap channels to enhance physical layer security		In this work, we propose a new channel training (CT) scheme to enhance physical layer security in a full-duplex wiretap channel, where the multi-antenna and full-duplex receiver simultaneously receives the information signal and transmits artificial noise (AN). In order to suppress the self-interference caused by AN, the receiver has to estimate the self-interference channel prior to the data communication phase. In the proposed CT scheme, the receiver transmits limited pilot symbols which are known only to itself, which prevents the eavesdropper from estimating the jamming channel from the receiver to the eavesdropper, hence effectively degrades the eavesdropping capability. Compared with the traditional CT scheme that uses publicly known pilots, the newly proposed secret CT scheme offers significantly better performance when the number of antennas at the eavesdropper is larger than one, e.g., Ne > 1. The optimal power allocation between CT and data/AN transmission at the legitimate transmitter/receiver is determined for the proposed secret CT scheme.	ct scan;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);radio jamming;scheme;transmitter	Shihao Yan;Xiangyun Zhou;Nan Yang;Thushara Dheemantha Abhayapala;A.

It associates the advantages of existing models in that different receiving states are predicted using a deterministic approach, whereas the channel behavior is simulated using adapted statistical laws. Using a geosynchronous satellite transmitter working at 1.5 GHz and a land mobile receiver, the hybrid model is validated for LMS channel. It leads to a high-performance simulation, combining accuracy (global simulation error less than 1 dBW) and small computation time (gain of about 10,000 times compared to a full deterministic reference model).	channel (communications);communications satellite;computation;geosynchronous orbit;geosynchronous satellite;msat;performance prediction;reference model;simulation;software propagation;time complexity;transmitter	Xiang Li;Rodolphe Vauzelle;Yannis Pousset;Pierre Combeau	2012	EURASIP J.

The effects of replacing sinusoids in the proposed model by their approximate waveforms are also analyzed and tested. Performance evaluation and comparison are provided, using the quality measures of the mean-square-error of autocorrelation function and the second-order moment of power spectral density.	approximation algorithm;autocorrelation;mean squared error;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;requirement;simulation;spectral density	Yunxin Li;Xiaojing Huang	2002	IEEE Trans.

The CRs cooperate among themselves in detecting the beacons transmitted by the primary users, to ensure that they cause reduced interference at the primary users. A range of cooperative sensing schemes including the no (NC), partial (PC) and full cooperation (FC) scenarios are analyzed. Using the concepts of stochastic geometry, we assess the impact of the presence of the multiple primary users on the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at a given primary user, for each cooperation scheme. Further, we characterize the improvement in the spectrum usage due to the CR operation in the licensed frequency band in terms of the probability, denoted by rho, that a CR is able to operate within the k-dimensional space. Using our calculations of the SINR at the primary user and rho, it is shown that the PC scheme achieves enhanced spectrum usage vis-a-vis the FC scheme and an improved SINR as compared to the NC scheme. Moreover, the PC scheme can be tuned in such a way that any desired value for spectrum usage and SINR is achievable.	cognitive radio;frequency band;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;visual instruction set	Prasanna Madhusudhanan;Timothy X.

Road-side relays (or access points) implementing the decode-and-forward relaying protocol are employed and one of them is selected according to a predetermined policy to enable communication between vehicles. The performance of the considered cognitive cooperative system is investigated for Kth best partial and full relay selection (RS) as well as for two distinct fading scenarios. In the first scenario, all channels are double Rayleigh distributed. In the second scenario, only the secondary source to relay and relay to destination channels are considered to be subject to double Rayleigh fading whereas, channels between the secondary transmitters and the primary user are modelled by the Rayleigh distribution. Exact and approximate expressions for the outage probability performance for all considered RS policies and fading scenarios are presented. In addition to the analytical results, complementary computer simulated performance evaluation results have been obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The perfect match between these two sets of results has verified the accuracy of the proposed mathematical analysis.	downtime;rayleigh fading;relay	Tran Trung Duy;George C.

In this network, the secondary transmitter adopts the TAS scheme to choose the antenna with the maximal received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while the secondary receiver and the eavesdropper adopt the MRC scheme to combine the received signals. To thoroughly assess the secrecy performance achieved by the TAS/MRC scheme and the impact of outdated CSI on the secrecy performance, we derive a new closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability of dual-hop RaF cognitive MIMO wiretap networks. In order to achieve more insights on the application of TAS/MRC scheme, we further present tractable asymptotic secrecy outage probability at high SNR regimes under two distinct scenarios. From our analysis, several important concluding remarks are obtained as follows: 1) the RaF relaying strategy achieves better secrecy performance than that of the decode-and-forward relaying strategy for dual-hop cognitive MIMO wiretap networks; 2) outdated CSI decreases the secrecy diversity gain of the TAS/MRC scheme from NR min (NA, NB) to (NR, NB) ; and 3) although TAS/MRC scheme cannot attain full secrecy diversity gain for the considered system with outdated CSI, it still can achieve an extra secrecy coding gain compared with the random antenna selection/MRC scheme.

Cooperation is performed between the two users by partial decode-forward relaying over 3 time slots with variable duration. During the first two slots, each user alternatively transmits and partially decodes while during the last time slot, both users cooperate to forward information to the destination. We establish the achievable rate region of this scheme. Then using the Lagrangian method, we analyze the optimal power allocations and the optimal time duration that maximize its individual and sum rates for the symmetric channel. Results show a significant improvement of the rates compared to the classical multiple access channel (MAC) when the inter-user channel quality is better than that between each user and the destination.	additive white gaussian noise;duplex (telecommunications);mathematical optimization;parsing;throughput;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ahmad Abu Al Haija;Mai H.

Since the relays are multi-terminal and act as intermediaries between the source and the destination nodes,an optimal relay selection scheme is introduced to select the best relay that forwards the decoded information packets from the source to the destination nodes. Furthermore, the need to maintain better outage performance w.r.t the multi-terminal relay network scheme is demonstrated in the simulation works while an optimized Dinkelbach(DB)iterative algorithm is introduced to maintain minimal end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)for the multi-terminal relay links.	algorithm;channel state information;direction finding;downtime;end-to-end principle;exception handling;formal verification;real-time clock;real-time transcription;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;ultra-wideband	Williams Paul Nwadiugwu;Joel S Katoro;Dong-Seong Kim	2018		10.1145/3243046.3243052	computer network;verifiable secret sharing;iterative method;channel state information;computer science;wireless;relay;network packet	Mobile	36.08722776681872	84.86129598602986	119826

However, there lacks a unifying framework delineating the effects of different factors on resource optimization and its resultant benefit. In this paper, we investigate the relative effects of the optimization metric (error rate vs. outage probability), modulation type (coherent vs. differential) and the relaying protocol (amplify-and-forward (AF) vs. decodeand-forward (DF)). To facilitate such a unifying study, we provide a comprehensive set of system performance and optimization results for four commonly adopted cooperative systems: coherent amplify-and-forward (CAF), coherent decode-and-forward (CDF), differential amplify-and-forward (DAF), and differential decode-and-forward (DDF). Our analyses and simulations suggest that: i) The error rate and outage probability metrics yield similar optimization results; ii) The relaying protocol affects the optimization results more than the modulation type when the number of relays (L) is small; and iii) The CAF system is uniquely different from others when L is large.	anisotropic filtering;coherence (physics);consensus dynamics;delayed auditory feedback;direction finding;disk data format;distribution frame;downtime;mathematical optimization;modulation;relay;resultant;sap composite application framework;simulation	Rui Cao;Liuqing Yang	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4918022	communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;word error rate;resource allocation;computer science;computer performance;modulation	EDA	35.98419532517475	77.67312440312813	119891

The outage probability of secondary users employing a two-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relay protocol is investigated under an interference constraint inflicted by the secondary user-source and the secondary user-relay on a primary user (PU). Assuming channel-state-information (CSI) is available, the end-to-end signal-to-noise-ratio (e2e-SNR) is first derived, and then an analytical expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of this e2e-SNR is derived. Based on this derived CDF, analytical expressions for the exact outage probability, the approximate symbol error rate (SER), and approximate achievable rate can be obtained. In addition, to reveal further insights into the impact of channel lengths on the diversity and coding gains, the asymptotic outage probability and SER are provided. It is important to note that the performance of cognitive radio networks is degraded due to the limited power constraint inflicted on the primary network. As such, the optimal power allocation (OPA) is also derived to achieve a better asymptotic outage probability.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;downtime;end-to-end principle;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);opa;profiling (computer programming);relay;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage	Kyeong Jin Kim;Trung Quang Duong;H.

In addition, we studied the important issue of modeling uncertainty, where only limited knowledge of the underlying fading channel statistics is known. The moment space methodology was proposed to characterize the uncertainty range of the system performance. Since performance evaluation for wireless communication systems frequently involve Monte Carlo simulation, we introduce the Super-Efficient Monte Carlo simulation methodology and the concept of Approximate Super-Efficiency (ASE) to improve the convergence rate of Monte Carlo simulation. While conventional Monte Carlo simulation yields the convergence rate 1/N , our Super-Efficient Monte Carlo simulation has a superior convergence rate 1/N for integrands of the Super-Efficient type, and 1/N for ASE algorithm, where α ∈ [1, 2]. Finally, we studied the downlink throughput maximization problem in cellular networks. Inspired by the multi-armed bandit problem, we proposed several algorithms to solve the online throughput maximization problem, and provided convergence analysis. The proposed algorithms achieved up to 99% of the performance upper bound within 1000 time steps.	adaptive server enterprise;approximation algorithm;electrical engineering;entropy maximization;kung yao;monte carlo method;multi-armed bandit;performance evaluation;rate of convergence;simulation;stochastic process;telecommunications link;throughput;yang;yao graph	Cheng-An Yang	2015			rate of convergence;quantum monte carlo;monte carlo method;kinetic monte carlo;markov chain monte carlo;hybrid monte carlo;monte carlo integration;monte carlo molecular modeling;mathematical optimization;mathematics	Robotics	38.144895261231895	78.73108435060612	119916

The introduction of IS-2000 is intended to improve forward link performance and increase system capacity. However, the performance improvement provided by IS-2000 will vary with propagation environment. A technique for collecting forward channel impulse response measurements using IS-95 pilot signals is presented. This technique is used to characterize the forward channel in residential and urban regions in Calgary, Canada. The propagation data is then processed in a simulation in order to generate a comparison of IS-95 and IS-2000 performance that is specific to these environments. The results illustrate how propagation environment can affect the performance improvement provided by IS-2000.	channel capacity;performance evaluation;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications link	Geoffrey G.

The primary system comprises of a transmitter-receiver pair PT-PR, and the secondary system comprises of M transmitters STi, i ∈ {1, 2,..., M} and a common receiver SR. The secondary transmitter STp which achieves the request target rate for the primary system is selected to serve as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay for the primary system. With the cooperation of STp, the primary system is able to tolerate interference lower than a certain threshold in the relaying phase, without degrading its outage performance. The secondary transmitter STs, which satisfies this interference constraint and provides the optimal outage performance for the secondary system, is then selected to access the spectrum band simultaneously when STp is relaying the primary signal. Theoretical and simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed spectrum sharing protocol, and we show that both primary and secondary systems are able to achieve better outage performance with increasing M.	direction finding;downtime;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;relay;simulation;transmitter;two-phase commit protocol	Yang Han;See Ho Ting;Ashish Pandharipande	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.080210.091741	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	34.45827708089075	81.777153429669	120336

Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) further enables Access Points (APs) with multiple antennas to transmit multiple data streams concurrently to several clients. In MU-MIMO, clients need to estimate Channel State Information (CSI) and report it to APs in order to eliminate interference between them. We explore the vulnerability in clients' plaintext feedback of estimated CSI to the APs and propose two advanced attacks that malicious clients can mount by reporting forged CSI: (1) sniffing attack that enables concurrently transmitting malicious clients to eavesdrop other ongoing transmissions; (2) power attack that enables malicious clients to enhance their own capacity at the expense of others?. We have implemented and evaluated these two attacks in a WARP testbed. Based on our experimental results, we suggest a revision of the current CSI feedback scheme and propose a novel CSI feedback system, called the CSIsec, to prevent CSI forging without requiring any modification at the client side, thus facilitating its deployment.	channel state information;client-side;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;malware;multi-user mimo;plaintext;software deployment;testbed;transmitter	Yu-Chih Tung;Sihui Han;Dongyao Chen;Kang G.

a46779a0bf567b7ebf057190b68bad564cb2b577	performance analysis and power control of cell-free massive mimo systems with hardware impairments		As an interesting network architecture for future wireless communication systems, cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) distributes an excess number of access points (APs) with single or multiple antennas to cooperatively communicate with several user equipments (UEs). To realize CF massive MIMO in production, hardware impairments become a crucial problem since cheaper and low-quality antennas are needed to ensure economic and energy feasibility. In this paper, we propose a framework for performance analysis in the CF massive MIMO with classical hardware distortion models. For both uplink and downlink, closed-form spectral and energy efficiency expressions are derived, respectively. Based on these results, we provide significant insights into the practical impact of hardware impairments on CF massive MIMO. For example, the impact of hardware distortion at the APs asymptotically vanishes. Furthermore, in order to ensure uniformly good service to the users, we propose a max–min power control algorithm to maximize the minimum UE rate. Via analytical and numerical results, we prove that CF massive MIMO can tolerate hardware impairments without performance reduction.	algorithm;distortion;mimo;maxima and minima;network architecture;numerical analysis;offset binary;profiling (computer programming);telecommunications link;wireless access point	Jiayi Zhang;Yinghua Wei;Emil Bj&#x00F6;rnson;Yu Han;Shi Jin	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872715	computer hardware;computer network;mimo;power control;telecommunications link;efficient energy use;network architecture;wireless;expression (mathematics);distortion;computer science	Networks	36.8540904034633	86.45308597844344	120607

In particular, the focus here is on the case of an existing universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) network for which an FMC system is considered to provide a wireless connection between a remote base station not having the possibility of a wired connection to the core network and a base station having this possibility (a core network access point). This facility is of special interest in a dense urban environment or whenever a wired connection is prohibitive for service providers due to its implementation cost or lack of frequency spectrum. The mutual interference effects between the FMC systems and the existing UMTSs are investigated by focusing on typical application scenarios. A receiving scheme where interference signals are first detected and then canceled from the other received signals is proposed. The performance of the two interfering systems has been evaluated in terms of bit error rates (BERs) both by means of an analytical approach and computer simulations. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular, by allowing efficient bandwidth sharing between the FMC system and the existing UMTS network.	access network;bit error rate;computer simulation;flight management system;interconnection;interference (communication);microwave;network access point;performance evaluation;software deployment;spectral density;telecommunications network;wireless access point	Romano Fantacci;Dania Marabissi;Daniele Tarchi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.905394	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal processing;wireless;computer network	Mobile	27.15763193360401	81.34210536664821	120715

df4a70b0a912ae03e348d2ee3f267ed59dd20829	interference and outage in random d2d networks under millimeter wave channels		Millimeter wave communication is a promising concept for the fifth generation (5G) of cellular wireless networks due to the large available bandwidth while device to device (D2D) communication among nearby devices which saves network resources is also gaining attention. As such, D2D networks underlaying millimeter wave cellular systems hold massive potential. However, the performance of such a D2D network incorporating spatial randomness and power control has not yet been characterized. To fill this knowledge gap, we develop a comprehensive analysis of the performance of a D2D receiver. To this end, we model cellular transmitters and receivers as homogeneous Poisson point processes and the D2D network as a Matern cluster process, and incorporate blockages due to random objects, sectored antenna patterns, log-distance path loss, and Nakagami-m fading. Furthermore, we consider path loss and antenna gain inversion based power control, and peak power constraints for D2D devices along with distinct path loss exponents and fading severities for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. With the aid of stochastic geometry tools, we derive closed-form expressions of the moment generating function of the aggregate interference experienced by a D2D receiver and its outage probability. We finally show that the feasibility of millimeter wave D2D communication relies heavily on the D2D cluster radii, peak power thresholds, and node densities.	aggregate data;downtime;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);randomness;transmitter	Sachitha Kusaladharma;Chintha Tellambura	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996625	power control;stochastic geometry;fading;real-time computing;wireless network;antenna gain;path loss;computer science;point process;communication channel	Mobile	28.449875772739734	84.56744916336208	120812

We use direct sequence spread spectrum as a medium interface for cognitive links. We investigate performance of DUCHA algorithm in three spreading scenarios with regard to the bandwidth of the channel. Simulation results show that when there are 100 cognitive channel applicants and spreading factor is 100 the multi user DUCHA algorithm assigns the channel to an average 51.8 percent of channel applicants and in this case it achieves 22.57 bps/Hz spectral efficiency under high power interference from the primary base station of the cell. We show that in this condition the increased in-band and out of band interference temperatures are non-harmful and have values of respectively 22.48 dB and -0.99 dB.	algorithm;cognition;decibel;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);multi-user;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Shadi Ebrahimi Asl;Bahman Abolhassani	2009		10.1145/1641776.1641792	wireless ad hoc network;out-of-band management;spectrum;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;direct-sequence spread spectrum;spectral efficiency;computer network	Mobile	30.04170314000513	86.85200365725464	120908

The sources and relays are divided into individual clusters. The nodes within one cluster transmit non-orthogonally while the transmissions of different clusters span orthogonal channels. We provide the method to calculate the achievable DMT for each clustering strategy. The network DMT performance can thus be optimized by properly clustering the sources and the relays.	cluster analysis;code;digital monetary trust;direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);multi-source;multi-user;multiplexing;relay	Chao Wang;Ming Xiao;Mikael Skoglund	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963100	nickel;communications protocol;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;finite field;multiplexing;computer network	Visualization	35.282486608081605	75.78769417031623	121334

To clarify the feasibility of millimeter wave systems applications to intra-car multimedia communications, propagation characteristics inside a car have been extensively measured and analyzed. The proposed system sets a car navigator as the center of Intra-car multimedia communications with an Omni antenna and receivers are assumed at front seats, back seats and the luggage space behind the back seats in a typical SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle). The measured results show i. Front seat communications are no worry with simple single carrier (SC) modems without any equalizer, ii. Back seats communications may need beam forming capability for better receive signal power (an Omni antenna system still works with a simple SC modem with a simple rake receiver but without any equalizer. iii. “Luggage space communications may require a directive / beam forming antenna for better receive signal power. The maximum delay spread observed is 6 to 7 ns and no equalizer necessity has been found for Omni antenna receivers inside a car. Further advancement to beam forming antenna will have only 1 2 ns maximum delay spread inside a car. Thus, this paper has proved the feasibility of millimeter wave intra-car multimedia communications system by employing a simple single carrier modem without any equalizers but with simple rake receivers.	beamforming;bose wave system;data rate units;directive (programming);equalization (communications);modem;rake;software deployment;software propagation	Hirokazu Sawada;Tomohide Tomatsu;Gen Ozaki;Hiroyuki Nakase;Shuzo Kato;Katsuyoshi Sato;Hiroshi Harada	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073345	embedded system;transmission;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;extremely high frequency;radio receiver;communications system;rake receiver;low latency	Mobile	25.73465673020366	80.84396337466896	121662

To thoroughly investigate the effect of mobility on handover probability, we compare several handover schemes of CoMP coordinating set (CCS) handover and serving cell handover. From the perspective of CCS handover, three schemes are considered including ``best $n$', ``half best $n$'' and ``none of the best $n$''. Meanwhile, from the perspective of the serving cell handover, this paper discusses two schemes: ``not the best one'' and ``not any of the best $n$''. With stochastic geometry methods, theoretical expressions of CoMP handover probability with different schemes are derived. Further, simulation results illustrate that scheme ``best $n$'' provides an upper bound while scheme ``none of the best $n$'' exhibits as a lower bound of CoMP handover probability and other schemes lie between them. To sum up, such analysis may provide a good performance reference for the design of CoMP handover.	multipoint ground;psi comp 80;simulation;wireless access point	Mengting Liu;Yinglei Teng;Mei Song	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925677	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Vision	28.569837535989755	85.97522627718126	121699

However, according to 3GPP guidelines eNBs can independently decide on different backhaul subframe configurations to adapt to, e.g. traffic variations, which then implies a backhaul subframe misalignment in the system. This configuration results in a new type of interference, referred to as relay-to-relay interference. In general, uplink interference characteristics will be significantly different compared to conventional fully synchronized configuration since the transmissions of relays and user equipments will interfere with each other. Accordingly, uplink power control parameters should be properly adjusted. In this work, we evaluate the impact of backhaul subframe misalignment on the uplink system performance of relay deployments within the LTE-Advanced framework considering 4 and 10-relay urban and suburban deployments. Besides, we investigate different inter eNB coordination and subframe alignment scenarios. Comprehensive results show that a backhaul subframe misalignment can cause severe losses especially in cell coverage depending on the degree of coordination possible, and the availability of directional antennas at relays for backhauling. It is further shown that a proper power control optimization can cope with such performance degradations in urban deployments. As the cell-edge eNB-served user equipments are power limited in suburban deployments, the impact of power control optimization can be limited. Therefore, relay cell range extension is as well utilized in suburban deployments so that these user equipments are then served by relays. However, the performance degradation cannot be fully compensated by power control and cell range extension in suburban deployments, and thus a certain level of inter-eNB coordination is necessary.	backhaul (telecommunications);binary space partitioning;compaq lte;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;rain fade;relay;telecommunications link	Ömer Bulakci;Andrei S.

The major advantage of the new proposal is the multiple functionalities the overlay watermark provides, which includes a cross-layer signaling interface, a transceiver identification for position-aware cross-layer design, as well as its basic role as a training sequence for channel estimation. Location information of a mobile can be easily derived for efficient routing when a unique watermark is associated with each individual mobile transceiver. In addition, a new data pipe can be created by modulating the overlay watermarks for the transmission of cross-layer signaling and other interlayer interactive information. We also study the channel estimation and watermark removal techniques at the physical layer for the proposed overlay OFDM. Our channel estimator iteratively estimates the channel impulse response and the combined signal vector from the overlay OFDM signal. Cross-layer design that leads to low power consumption and more efficient routing are investigated.	algorithm;channel state information;frequency divider;geographic routing;interruption science;iterative method;multiplexing;simulation;spectral efficiency;tadao kasami;transceiver;transmitter	Xianbin Wang;Yiyan Wu;Paul K.

For given channel fading and network geometry, both channel selection diversity and network interference dynamically vary according to what and how the caching helpers cache at their finite storage space. We study probabilistic content placement (or caching placement) to desirably control cache-based channel selection diversity and network interference in a stochastic wireless caching helper network, with sophisticated considerations of wireless fading channels, interactions among multiple users, such as interference and loads at caching helpers, and arbitrary memory size. Using stochastic geometry, we derive optimal caching probabilities in the closed form to maximize the average success probability of content delivery and propose an efficient algorithm to find the solution in a noise-limited network. In an interference-limited network, based on a lower bound of the average success probability of content delivery, we find near-optimal caching probabilities in the closed form to control the channel selection diversity and the network interference. We numerically verify that the proposed content placement is superior to other comparable content placement strategies.	algorithm;cache (computing);digital distribution;interaction;interference (communication);multi-user;numerical analysis;placement (eda)	Seong Ho Chae;Wan Choi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2586841	stochastic process;cpu cache;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;interference;probabilistic logic;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	30.94011182521562	85.61808838939345	122209

Parameters for the femtocell simulations are selected based on 3G Partnership Project (3GPP) contributions to tie this work to on-going femtocell standardization work. Different interference scenarios are also discussed. Spectrum sensing based on Welch periodogram is presented, and two scenarios including a user equipment (UE) located indoor and outdoor are selected for further study.

Smart antennas used in code division multiple access (CDMA) systems can effectively maximize capacity, and improve reliability and coverage by directing beam patterns towards the desired signals, and null-patterns towards the interferers. In this work, with the use of different types of antennas arrays, one of the main issues related to smart antennas, viz., beam forming is studied. A modified constrained beam forming technique for planar arrays is proposed, and the BER performances of smart antennas with co-channel interference in uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA) are examined and compared.	array data structure;beamforming;classical xy model;coded aperture;direction of arrival;interference (communication);performance;smart antenna;unicode collation algorithm;viz: the computer game;x.690	Harsha Vardhan Myneni;Pradip Sircar	2012	2012 1st International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)	10.1109/RAIT.2012.6194524	reflective array antenna;electronic engineering;collinear antenna array;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;directional antenna;smart antenna	Robotics	27.994352408399138	81.63242480548128	122448
76eb8c40d2ef3742d62ac69ae2aadeb5b876f729	hierarchical beamforming scheme based on virtual cell cluster in ultra dense network		Considering virtual cell clusters formed by several overlapping virtual cells in ultra dense network (UDN), virtual cells which are in the same virtual cell cluster coordinate transmissions to reduce inter-virtual cell interference. However, general beamforming scheme design for channel state information (CSI) demand still remains large, and system overhead for high-dimensional channel training and channel state information feedback is explosively-increased. To solve this problem, this paper focuses on hierarchical beamforming scheme based on virtual cell cluster. Specifically, based on perfect intra-cluster CSI, beamforming direction vector is designed by optimizing the achievable rate of each cluster with Zero-Forming block diagonalization method. Based on the large-scale inter-cluster CSI, the strength of beamforming can be devised by solving the sum rate maximization problem and mitigating the residual co-channel interference among different clusters with an iterative power allocation algorithm via a generalized weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain and requires less CSI than traditional schemes.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;control system;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);iterative method;mean squared error;overhead (computing);simulation;virtual cell	Lu Chen;Hailun Xia;Zhimin Zeng	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330509	channel state information;residual;direction vector;real-time computing;computer science;minimum mean square error;interference (wave propagation);beamforming;algorithm;maximization;communication channel	Mobile	37.92118204872898	86.33248261713317	122524

While it is often assumed that the receiver (whether base station or mobile) needs to know the channel for accurate power control, scheduling, and data demodulation, it is now known that the transmitter (especially the base station) can also benefit greatly from this information. For example, recent results in multiantenna multiuser systems show that large throughput gains are possible when the base station uses multiple antennas and a known channel to transmit distinct messages simultaneously and selectively to many single-antenna users. In time-division duplex systems, where the base station and mobiles share the same frequency band for transmission, the base station can exploit reciprocity to obtain the forward channel from pilots received over the reverse channel. Frequency-division duplex systems are more difficult because the base station transmits and receives on different frequencies and therefore cannot use the received pilot to infer anything about the multiantenna transmit channel. Nevertheless, we show that the time occupied in frequency-duplex CSI transfer is generally less than one might expect and falls as the number of antennas increases. Thus, although the total amount of channel information increases with the number of antennas at the base station, the burden of learning this information at the base station paradoxically decreases. Thus, the advantages of having more antennas at the base station extend from having network gains to learning the channel information. We quantify our gains using linear analog modulation which avoids digitizing and coding the CSI and therefore can convey information very rapidly and can be readily analyzed. The old paradigm that it is not worth the effort to learn channel information at the transmitter should be revisited since the effort decreases and the gain increases with the number of antennas.	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;mimo;modulation;multi-user;programming paradigm;radio frequency;return channel;scheduling (computing);throughput;transmitter	Thomas L.

In DF relaying, a relay is allowed to forward the message from source only if the message is correctly decoded. The destination node combines both the direct signals from the source and the indirect signals from the relays using maximal-ratio diversity combining technique.

Ray methods have been particularly popular, and there are many papers in the literature describing the performance of various approaches to ray tracing. This paper will describe a powerful, recently developed, threedimensional (3-D) software suite for urban propagation modeling which, although based on 3-D ray tracing (using images), draws upon an ensemble of propagation tools including physical optics using the fast far-field approximation, the parabolic equation approximation for propagation over multiple buildings, and uniform theory of diffraction (UTD). Many ray-tracing methods determine ray paths between the transmitter and a single arbitrary receiver. This paper adopts an approach of a transmitter to a multiple receiver technique, resulting in greatly reduced computational times. The associated method can handle both indoor and outdoor propagation on both flat and undulating terrain. Terrain is represented as a set of triangular two-dimensional (2-D) patches, while buildings and clutter are represented using layers of polygons.	approximation;clutter;computation;database;parabolic antenna;patch (computing);ray tracing (graphics);software propagation;software suite;transmitter;uniform theory of diffraction;unit propagation	William M.

Resulting predictions agree with measurements of both path loss and single-user multiple-input-multiple-output link capacity. In particular, the model reproduces the observed reduction in normalized channel capacity with increasing range. This effect, occurring in a common indoor environment, can be beneficial. Interfering APs, which tend to be further away, occupy channel dimensions corresponding to low-order hallway modes, causing total interference to concentrate in a small subset of the channel dimensions, in a manner reminiscent of interference alignment. The channel for the desired signal has a greater number of effective degrees of freedom (EDOFs) due to a shorter distance from its serving AP. The disparity in the number of EDOFs between the signal and the interference leads to higher rates, which can be further increased through water filling applied individually to each link, with no interlink coordination. The resulting rates are on the order of 30% greater than would be anticipated in range-independent scattering models.	binocular disparity;catastrophic interference;channel capacity;interference (communication);multi-user;water filling algorithm;wireless access point	Dmitry Chizhik;Jonathan Ling;Reinaldo A.

In the considered system, the CR transmitter and receiver correlatively sense and dynamically exploit the spectrum pool via dynamic frequency hopping. Under imperfect spectrum sensing, false-alarm and miss-detection occur which cause impulsive interference emerged from collisions due to the simultaneous spectrum access of primary and cognitive users. That makes it very challenging to evaluate the achievable rates. By first examining the static link where the channel is assumed to be constant over time, they show that the achievable rate using a Gaussian input can be calculated accurately through a simple series representation. In the second part of this study, they extend the calculation of the achievable rate to wireless fading environments. To take into account the effect of fading, they introduce a piece-wise linear curve fittingbased method to approximate the instantaneous achievable rate curve as a combination of linear segments. It is then demonstrated that the ergodic achievable rate in fast fading and the outage probability in slow fading can be calculated to achieve any given accuracy level.	approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;downtime;ergodicity;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);transmitter	Anh D.

We derive the scaling laws for coverage probability and potential throughput for 3D case, and prove that if the path- loss exponent α0 for the region inside Rc (termed as close-in region) is less than 3, then the SINR eventually decays to zero. We also show that the potential (i.e. best case) aggregate throughput decays to zero for α0 <; 1.5. We also consider a case where user density is kept fixed and show that potential throughput saturates as BSs becomes ultradense in this case.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;image scaling;integrating adc;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;throughput	Abhishek K.

The distribution of mobiles is modeled as a spatial Poisson process, whose rate function quantizes mobiles concentration and which can be inferred with a Bayesian estimator based on network traffic. The time dynamics of the rate function is assumed to evolve according to mobiles mobility pattern and which is formulated using the influence model. With mobiles spatial distribution, the interference and thus the outage probability of different sector partitions of a cell can be computed. The adaptive sectoring problem is formulated as a shortest path problem, and the optimal path corresponds to the sector partition with the minimum outage probability	downtime;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);network traffic control;shortest path problem;smart antenna;sun outage;telecommunications link	Alex Wang;Vikram Krishnamurthy	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings	10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660953	cellular network;code division multiple access;poisson process;telecommunications;bayesian probability;computer science;smart antenna;mathematics;interference;spatial analysis;shortest path problem;spatial poisson process;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Robotics	28.006882252669175	85.89053715460084	123754

Beginning with a single carrier macrocell network on a 5 MHz FDD carrier in LTE band 25 (2 GHz), a 20 MHz TDD carrier in band 41 (2.6 GHz) is added to significantly increase capacity. An additional 5 MHz FDD carrier in band 26 (875 MHz) enhances coverage. The picocell deployment options include placing picocells in band 25, in band 41, or on a dedicated band 41 20 MHz TDD carrier. In addition, picocells may be split between the FDD carrier and the dedicated TDD carrier to simulate a phased rollout as spectrum becomes available. Since the band 41 carrier has a larger bandwidth, network capacity is higher when picocells are placed on this carrier (compared to band 25) even though the number of picocells required to maintain a constant network outage is similar. Dedicated band picocell deployment requires fewer picocells and has higher capacity due to reduced interference.	compaq lte;downtime;interference (communication);phased adoption;simulation;software deployment;test-driven development;user experience	William J.

We first propose a cooperative network coding protocol, which is called denoise-demodulate-and-forward (DDF), with the design of transmit beamforming and combining schemes to increase network throughput. More importantly, we formulate an optimization problem by using the newly derived bit error rate (BER) expression of adaptive M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). As the result, the modulation types for both time slots can be chosen to maximize the total throughput of the proposed system under the BER constraint. Performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the total throughput by comparing to the existing MIMO Y channel and the solution of the optimization problem is validated.	beamforming;bit error rate;distribution frame;linear network coding;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;noise reduction;optimization problem;relay;throughput;x.690	Keov Kolyan Teav;Zhendong Zhou;Branka Vucetic	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6239979	electronic engineering;linear network coding;quadrature amplitude modulation;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;demodulation;computer network;quadrature modulation	Mobile	38.41229424135146	82.99882406524307	123797

This distance-dependent route-selection problem is approached from the viewpoint of energy efficiency, where a route is selected with the objective of minimizing the transmission energy consumed while satisfying a target outage criterion at the final destination. Deterministic line networks and 2-D random networks are considered. It is shown that short-hop routing requires less energy than long-hop routing when (1) the number of hops traversed between the source and destination grows large, (2) the target success probability approaches one, or (3) the number of transmit and/or receive antennas grows large. It is also shown that if both routing strategies are subject to the same delay constraint, long-hop routing requires less energy than short-hop routing as the target success probability approaches one. In addition, a numerical analysis indicates that, given loose outage constraints, only a small number of transmit antennas are needed for short-hop routing to have its maximum advantage over long-hop routing, while given stringent outage constraints, the advantage of short-hop over long-hop routing always increases with additional transmit antennas.	downtime;flow network;hop;mimo;numerical analysis;routing;selection algorithm;spatial multiplexing;sun outage;transmitter	Caleb K.

The fusion problem of cooperative spectrum sensing, for a cognitive radio network equipped with multi-antennas at its base-station, is considered in this paper. The base-station equipped with multi-antennas act as a fusion center which can attain not only the soft information (average power) by its multi-antennas but also the soft or hard information from other cognitive radio users (CR users). We first discuss the soft fusion scheme in which soft information from CR users is sent to the base-station, and exhibit the necessity of deeper cooperation. Due to the limitation of control channel bandwidth, CR users have to send hard information to the base-station. To this end, we propose a hybrid fusion scheme in which both soft and hard information can be fused in the base-station. Furthermore, we present an optimal cooperative spectrum sensing scheme where the global detection probability can be maximized according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Extensive simulation results validate that, by using the hybrid fusion scheme, significant improvement on sensing performance can be achieved. 	1-bit architecture;cognitive radio;experiment;simulation	Yunxue Liu;Manman Guo;Wenqiang Fan;Zhen Wang	2013	JCM	10.12720/jcm.8.12.806-813	telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	34.0213991572942	84.34661079628414	123839

On one hand, classical work on decentralized detection does not consider practical wireless sensor networks. On the other hand, practical sensor network design approaches that treat the signal processing and communication aspects of the sensor network separately result in sub optimal detection performance because network resources are not allocated efficiently. In this work, we attempt to cross the gap between theoretical decentralized detection work and practical sensor network implementations. We consider a cross-layer approach, where the quality of information, channel state information, and residual energy information are included in the design process of tree-topology sensor networks. The design objective is to specify which sensors should contribute to a given detection task, and to calculate the relevant communication parameters. We compare two design schemes: (1) direct transmission, where raw data are transmitted to the fusion center without compression, and (2) in-network processing, where data is quantized before transmission. For both schemes, we design the optimal transmission control policy that coordinates the communication between sensor nodes and the fusion center. We show the performance improvement for the proposed design schemes over the classical decoupled and maximum throughput design approaches.	channel state information;mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;network planning and design;network processor;optimization problem;quantization (signal processing);relay;requirement;sensor;signal processing;systems design;telecommunications network	Ashraf Tantawy;Xenofon D.

In this work, clusters are formed based on the Mutually Nearest Neighbour relation, which defines which stations cooperate in pair and which do not. When node positions follow a Poisson Point Process (PPP) the performance of the original clustering model can be approximated by another one, formed by the superposition of two PPPs (one for the singles and one for the pairs) equipped with adequate marks. This allows to derive exact expressions for the network coverage probability under two user-cluster association rules. Numerical evaluation shows coverage gains from different signal cooperation schemes that can reach up to 15% compared to the standard non- cooperative network coverage. The analysis is general and can be applied to any type of cooperation or coordination between pairs of transmitting nodes.	approximation algorithm;association rule learning;cluster analysis;computer cluster;mimo;point process;transmitter	Luis David Alvarez Corrales;Anastasios Giovanidis;Philippe Martins	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841705	random variable;cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;measurement;statistics	Robotics	28.95684823719228	84.544838984941	124217
acb74dd1dd45230f4fc3f4ce5bac401a1fba3b80	tag spotting at the interference range		In wireless networks, the presence of interference among wireless links introduces dependencies among flows that do not share a single link or node. As a result, when designing a resource allocation scheme, be it a medium access scheduler or a flow rate controller, one needs to consider the interdependence among nodes within interference range of each other. Specifically, control plane information needs to reach nearby nodes which often lie outside the communication range, but within the interference range of a node of interest. But how can one communicate control plane information well beyond the existing communication range? To address this fundamental need we introduce tag spotting. Tag spotting refers to a communication system which allows reliable control data transmission at SNR values as low as 0 dB. It does this by employing a number of signal encoding techniques including adding redundancy to multitone modulation, shaping the spectrum to reduce inter-carrier interference, and the use of algebraic coding. Making use of a detection theory-based model we analyze the performance achievable by our modulation as well as the trade-off between the rate of the information transmitted and the likelihood of error. Using real-world experiments on an OFDM system built with software radios, we show that we can transmit data at the target SNR value of 0 dB with a 6% overhead; that is, 6% of our packet is used for our low-SNR decodable tags (which carry up to a couple of bytes of data in our testbed), while the remaining 94% is used for traditional header and payload data. We also demonstrate via simulations how tag spotting can be used in implementing fair and efficient rate control and scheduling schemes in the context of wireless multi-hop networks, while pointing out that the idea of tag spotting is useful in the context of any wireless network in which control-plane information must travel beyond the communication range of a node. ∗Corresponding author: Phone: +1 213 740 4413 Email addresses: hbalan@usc.edu (Horia Vlad Balan), kpsounis@usc.edu (Konstantinos Psounis) Preprint submitted to Elsevier May 2, 2014 Tag Spotting at the interference range Horia Vlad Balan, Konstantinos Psounis University of Southern California, 3740 McClintock Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA	algorithm;byte;communications protocol;control plane;detection theory;email;experiment;information needs;interdependence;interference (communication);like button;modulation;network packet;noise shaping;overhead (computing);payload (computing);scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;testbed	Horia Vlad Balan;Konstantinos Psounis	2012	CoRR		telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	32.87142535900597	78.77351604570964	124277
cd83d358ce61b463a9fd828b34dc3c0b2c86c950	optimization of antenna beamwidth under blockage impact in millimeter-wave bands		In this paper, beam expansion and optimization approach is proposed as a solution to alleviate blockage impact at millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency bands. Directional communication in mm-wave bands provides opportunities to combat with high-level propagation loss. However, initiating communication over a certain direction makes the link vulnerable against blockage impact. In this study, an investigation on antenna directionality is conducted through indoor measurements and statistical analysis to elaborate directional link performance under blockage effect. Measurements are conducted at 60 GHz frequency band by using 15° half power beamwidth (HPBW) antennas at transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). Beam expansion approach is evaluated by power azimuth spectrum (PAS) analysis. The proposed approach is also statistically analyzed using mm-wave channel simulator. It is shown that the beam optimization approach provides up to 13 dB gain (2 dB in average) on the received signal strength (RSS).

Hence, the signal from the interfering transmitter might be decoded, treating the desired signal as noise, and subtracted from the received signal. We propose an efficient method for finding the Pareto boundary of the corresponding achievable rate region. This method has a complexity which is constant in the number of transmit antennas.	beamforming;channel state information;code;complexity;computation;image noise;interference (communication);multi-user;pareto efficiency;system analysis;transmitter	Johannes Lindblom;Eleftherios Karipidis;Erik G.

Distributed self-configured femtocells can be realized to mitigate inter-tier interference between macro cells and femtocells without heavy operating costs by incorporating broadcasting mechanism of macro cell. With the aid of the macro cell, who provides critical global information, femtocells can configure related parameters to achieve interference mitigation. A tractable stochastic geometry-based analytical model is proposed to evaluate of proposed self-configured scheme in terms of coverage probability. We also conduct simulation experiments according to data from OpenCellID to prove the effectiveness of the proposed self-configured scheme in the realistic two-tier HCNs.	channel capacity;cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;display resolution;experiment;interference (communication);multitier architecture;numerical analysis;opencellid;performance evaluation;simulation;time-invariant system	Nien-Tsu Chou;Shih-Hao Lin;Shin-Ming Cheng;Shih-Hao Chang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.506	stochastic process;simulation;telecommunications;probability;statistics;computer network	Robotics	27.34541982407418	85.94958925755354	124431

A single-stream scenario is considered in which one or more primary receivers request nulls by providing limited feedback to the transmitter. Without receiver coordination, each primary receiver informs the transmitter of its best beamforming precoding vector. The transmitter then selects a zero-forcing precoding vector orthogonal to all of the beamforming precoding vectors. With receiver coordination, the primary receivers feed back the common precoding vector that minimizes the average interference. In both cases, secondary receivers in the network do not provide feedback and experience channels statistically equivalent to a single-antenna fading channel. Analytical results show that, for a system with K primary receivers and random codebooks with N=2B precoding vectors, the mean received power at the primary receivers is upper bounded by N-1/K = 2-B/K with or without receiver coordination. Exact results are also derived for the K=1 receiver case. Numerical results verify the scaling and also show that systems with receiver coordination outperform those without receiver coordination by a constant gap for large N in terms of average interference.	beamforming;channel state information;codebook;emoticon;error detection and correction;image scaling;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interference (communication);mimo;numerical method;overhead (computing);portable document format;transmitter;vector quantization;zero-forcing precoding	D.

The proposed expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm was used to jointly estimate both the coefficients of the channel between a relay and a base station and the data. EM algorithm is particularly suited to multicarrier code division multiple access systems because they have multi-carrier signal format. The considered network uses single-hop relaying technique to provide a higher quality transmission to the users with low quality channels. The base station (managing mechanism) gives them an opportunity to send their messages via the users with high quality channels in a time sharing mode. The performance of the proposed EM algorithm, with and without hopping and with cooperative communication technique, was analyzed by a computer simulation, and the results are presented.

By adaptively optimizing the blocklength, coding rate, power allocation, and maximum number of retransmissions according to the queue state, we algorithmically achieve the optimal energy-delay tradeoff. We also lower and upper bound the optimal energy-delay function in order to study its asymptotic behavior as the delay and buffer size go to infinity, showing consistency with existing result. That is: the energy per bit approaches the minimum of -1.59 dB as the delay goes to infinity and power approaches zero. We observe that the power increases very rapidly when delay moves away from infinity, meaning that it is very hard to achieve the -1.59 dB limit in practice.	algorithm;automatic repeat request;channel capacity;code;decibel;eb/n0;forward error correction;goto;iteration;iterative method;lossy compression;markov decision process;real-time clock;real-time computing	Lei Yu;Houqiang Li;Weiping Li;Zixiang Xiong;Anders Høst-Madsen	2015	2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - Fall (ITW)	10.1109/ITWF.2015.7360778	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;real-time computing;mathematics	Metrics	32.66003308190265	75.01465966832461	124727

By taking the end-to-end mean square error distortion (EED) as the performance metric, the problems of power allocation at the transmitter and relay are formulated. Due to nonlinearity of the formulations, a generalized programming algorithm is developed to obtain near optimal solutions. Case studies are conducted to verify the proposed formulations and solution approaches. The results show the advantages of using a relay assisted multiresolution approach.	algorithm;channel capacity;distortion;end-to-end principle;forward error correction;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;multicast;multiresolution analysis;nonlinear system;provisioning;relay;transmitter	Zhi Chen;Pin-Han Ho;James She;Sagar Naik;Payam Padidar	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564984	distortion;telecommunications;computer science;interference;source-specific multicast;wireless;computer network	Mobile	35.539312766846855	86.25236469668067	124842

We consider receivers with interference decoding capability (IDC) so that the interference signal can be decoded and subtracted from the received signal. On the MISO-IC with single user decoding, transmit beamforming vectors are designed to mitigate interference at the receivers. With IDC, receivers can potentially decode interference which yields a higher data rate. Yet, decoding interference pose a rate constraint on the interferer and in turn on the sum rate of the system. This brings some interesting questions: when should the Txs mitigate interference and when should Txs amplify interference? Under what situations should Txs change from mitigating interference to amplifying interference? We answer these questions in this paper.	beamforming;data center;data rate units;interference (communication);multi-user;system analysis;transmitter	Zuleita Ka Ming Ho;David Gesbert;Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Rami Mochaourab	2010	2010 Conference Record of the Forty Fourth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers		interference;adjacent-channel interference;electronic engineering;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;co-channel interference	Mobile	37.7596742433171	84.19618207916206	124883

We coin the ``masquerade"""" to indicate this kind of misbehavior. A masquerade relay can always pretend to be the best one to forward signals and, in consequence, deprive the others of the opportunities to cooperate. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of the masquerading behavior has not yet been fully investigated. Here, multiple masquerade relays with random masquerading behavior are taken into account. Also, the effects of the flat Rayleigh fading, log-normal shadowing and path loss are considered such that the geographical effects of the network topology can be captured. At last, the impacts of the masquerade relays are evaluated in terms of the outage probability and end-to-end capacity."""	channel (communications);downtime;end-to-end principle;internet relay chat;network topology;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;simulation;transmission curve	Wenson Chang	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925656	telecommunications;computer security	Visualization	34.76000323243309	81.74429620684785	125148

However, inter-network interference may degrade the performance of both networks. Therefore coordination is needed to further improve the network performance. In this paper, a link-specific coordination context (CC) concept is proposed. The CC here for one link represents a constraint that needs to be considered by the scheduler in each AN in a sense that certain transmissions are only scheduled on “allowed” radio resources. To determine CC for each link that suffer non-negligible interference from other networks, the coordination procedure and algorithm is designed in both centralized and distributed structure in this paper. Finally, the performance is evaluated for spectrum sharing of two networks in corridor scenario with realistic ray-tracing propagation channel and steering directional horn antenna models in 60GHz. The results show that high gain beamforming enables more aggressive resource reuse and CC scheme can bring coordination gain over both blind full re-use (i.e. without coordination) and fixed orthogonal re-use (no sharing).	algorithm;beamforming;centralized computing;frequency band;inter-process communication;interference (communication);network performance;ray tracing (graphics);scheduling (computing);scheme;software propagation;throughput	Gen Li;Tim Irnich;Cong Shi	2014	2014 9th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CROWNCOM)		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Mobile	25.521917019181352	87.69804071547553	125153

The achievable sum-rate of such network with the power splitting relay protocol is analyzed first. Then, the optimal design of the power allocated for energy harvesting and for information decoding in the sense of maximum achievable sum-rate is determined.

In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication systems, where fading is severe due to mobility of both transmitters and receivers, cooperative diversity is an acceptable technique to enhance the performance of high-rate communications. In this paper, we investigate a single-relay half-duplex system and deal with the performance of three time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) amplify-and-forward protocols over double-Rayleigh fading channels. In a mobile-to-mobile (M2M) communication system, the communication channel is often modeled as a cascaded Rayleigh fading channel. We determine pairwise error probability (PEP) for the studied protocols, then we investigate optimal power allocation for these cooperative protocols, where the optimality is determined in terms of minimizing the bit error rate (BER) of the system. Based on the relay position and modulation type, optimization of power allocated to source and relay results performance improvement up to 3dB for Protocols I and II, and up to 7dB for Protocol III.	bit error rate;channel (communications);consensus dynamics;duplex (telecommunications);hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;modulation;pairwise error probability;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation;transmitter;vehicle-to-vehicle;x.690	Zeinab Tirkan;Mehrdad Shirkhani;Abbas Taherpour;Murat Uysal	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542978	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;diversity scheme;channel state information;cooperative diversity;fading;computer network	Mobile	34.9873925374164	79.3585687274536	125506

In power on/off strategy, a beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e., power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and the formula for power efficiency factor.

In this paper, the forward-link throughput is simulated. The final throughput is based on field measured channels for different morphologies. On the reverse link capacity, the throughput is analyzed based on an analytical formula that considers pilot, DRC and data channels.	data system;telecommunications link	Ching-Yao Huang;Qi Bi;Asif D.

6a535e0aeb83f1c2e361c7b0c575f8bc0cc8aa34	huffman coding-based adaptive spatial modulation		Antenna switch enables multiple antennas to share a common RF chain. It also offers an additional spatial dimension, i.e., antenna index, that can be utilized for data transmission via both signal space and spatial dimension. In this paper, we propose a Huffman coding-based adaptive spatial modulation that generalizes both conventional spatial modulation and transmit antenna selection. Through the Huffman coding, i.e., designing variable length prefix codes, the transmit antennas can be activated with different probabilities. When the input signal is Gaussian distributed, the optimal antenna activation probability is derived through optimizing channel capacity. To make the optimization tractable, closed form upper bound and lower bound are derived as the effective approximations of channel capacity. When the input is discrete QAM signal, the optimal antenna activation probability is derived through minimizing symbol error rate. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive transmission offers considerable performance improvement over the conventional spatial modulation and transmit antenna selection.	approximation;channel capacity;cobham's thesis;huffman coding;mathematical optimization;modulation;prefix code;radio frequency	Wei Wang;Wei Vivian Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2017.2705679	modified huffman coding;tunstall coding	ML	34.74071030846507	75.14738928471337	125728

The fading envelopes associated with the desired and interfering users are assumed to follow independent but non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) Rayleigh fading models. Through the analysis, exact and approximate outage probability are derived based on which the diversity order and coding gain are obtained. Our findings suggest that the diversity order linearly increases with the number of relays and decreases with the order of the relay. Furthermore, results reveal that the system is still able to achieve full diversity gain in the presence of finite number of interferers with finite powers. The analytical results are supported and validated by Monte-Carlo simulations.	approximation algorithm;coding gain;direction finding;downtime;interference (communication);monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation	Anas M.

Recently, especial attention has been devoted to high-speed trains since this particular environment poses challenging problems in terms of performance simulation and measurement. In order to severely decrease the cost and complexity of high-speed measurement campaigns, we have proposed a technique to induce effects caused by highly-time varying channels on Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals while conducting measurements at low speeds. In this work, we employ this technique to evaluate LTE transmissions in a Time-Division Duplex (TDD) fashion, which is more convenient for the railway environment due to a number of reasons (e.g., better flexibility in frequency choice and the importance of the uplink transmissions for railway control communications). We assess the performance obtained in high- speed scenarios up to 500 km/h.	assistive technology;compaq lte;doppler effect;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;emulator;experiment;modulation;multiplexing;performance prediction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput;x.690	Dan Fei;José Rodríguez-Piñeiro;José Antonio García-Naya;Luis Castedo;Ke Guan;Lei Xiong	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504501	electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	26.32161665213937	82.95670542433787	126275

The considered system model uses millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless links along with ultra high frequency (UHF) links, which can provide high data rate transmission (targeted for 5G systems). Wireless links are considered to be independent but non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.), since Rician and Rayleigh distributions are preferred for mmWave and UHF links, respectively. In this work, closed-form expressions for the lower and upper bound of the outage probability are derived for the system under consideration.

The transceiver nodes can simultaneously transmit information and energy, and the relay nodes harvest the energy from the received signal and use the harvested energy to amplify and retransmit the received signal to the transceiver nodes. We consider a power splitting-based relaying (PSR) protocol as well as a time switching-based relaying (TSR) protocol to effect simultaneous extraction of information and harvesting of energy at the relay. We address the problem of sum-rate maximization under constraints on the total transmit power and the harvested energy in both scenarios. In order to solve this problem, we propose an optimal resource allocation and relay selection scheme.

In this paper, motivated by a feedback reduction, we introduce a transceiver that partially decouples the channel into parallel subchannels. From the analogy between multi-user and single-user channels, we propose a discrete rate iterative waterfilling procedure. It first relies on the classical iterative waterfilling, and then rounds continuous rates to discrete rates with an efficient use of residual power. Simulations show that a substantial enhancement of the discrete bit loading process is provided. We further investigate the trade-off feedback-performance of different waterfilling-based systems. Simulations point out that the proposed scheme outperforms the waterfilling with nearly 60% of feedback reduction in the moderate to high SNR region, while achieving nearly 90% of the sum discrete-rate waterfilling at low SNR.	computer simulation;discrete rate simulation;expectation–maximization algorithm;feedback;iterative method;mimo;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver;transmitter	Patricia Layec;Raphaël Visoz;Antoine O.

For all these reasons, Binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenhem (BCH) codes, which are very simple to implement, could constitute a good option to guarantee the required reliability of M2M transmissions. Nevertheless, existing delay and energy analyses of BCH decoders in the literature neither consider the channel statistics nor the first and second moments of the decoding delay. Therefore, they provide conservative codeword designs that lead to high delays and waste of energy. In this paper, we analyze the first and second moments of the delay and energy performance of Binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenhem (BCH) codes in realistic channel statistics to show that, if optimized, they can perform very efficiently for M2M transmissions. The results presented in this paper allow for the codeword length optimization for BCH codes given specific delay and energy constraints.	bch code;code word;downtime;machine to machine;mathematical optimization;network packet	Joan Bas;Francisco Vazquez Gallego;Ciprian Gavrincea;Jesus Alonso-Zarate	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666448	block code;binary code;real-time computing;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;maxeksat;bch code;statistics	Arch	31.87844312534816	75.68362778772632	126643

The present paper is an attempt to recast telecom systems in the language of complex systems. As a specific application of complex systems science to telecom systems, we tackle the problem of self-organizing frequency allocation. For this purpose, we model the problem of frequency assignment within the framework of cellular automata and we present an algorithm that reaches an interference-free allocation of the channels in a finite number of steps. By applying a measure of spatial structure and pattern to the two-dimensional lattice representing the frequency allocation, our study shows that autonomous networks assigning frequencies to their cells in a self-organized way, can be defined and therefore studied as complex systems. On the contrary, traditional networks based on centralized pre-planned frequency allocation cannot be considered as complex, according to the meaning given to the word by complex systems science.

With the increasing demand for wireless LANs, the robust provision of its services to users is becoming increasingly important. This paper examines the performance of spatial diversity in an OFDM based wireless LAN for various antenna topologies. It is shown that a circular array topology at the access point provides the best performance when operating in an indoor office environment compared with linear and semi-circular topologies. It is also shown that such a configuration improves the service provision by more than 10 dB compared to a single antenna system.	decibel;semiconductor industry;wireless access point	Ben Allen;Rodrigo Brito;Mischa Dohler;Hamid Aghvami	2004	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2004.1309403	electronic engineering;spatial correlation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;index term;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	25.10726813443991	82.66781924204014	126801

In order to ensure a maximum system capacity, the impact of this special kind of traffic on common Human-to-Human (H2H) communication needs to be analyzed. In this paper, a system model for performance evaluation of cellular networks like Long Term Evolution (LTE) in the presence of M2M communication and under different Quality of Service (QoS) constraints is presented. By means of a Markovian model, which is parameterized by laboratory measurements and ray tracing simulations, an estimation of the behavior of LTE for different traffic characteristics is shown. We present blocking probabilities for an LTE network with heterogeneous M2M and H2H traffic and compare different transmission strategies for M2M communication to minimize the impact on human users. The results show that particularly a large number of devices with a low data rate influences the utilization of an LTE cell very negatively.	blocking (computing);channel capacity;compaq lte;complex network;data rate units;erlang (unit);machine to machine;mobile phone;network topology;performance evaluation;quality of service;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;uncompressed video	Christoph Ide;Bjoern Dusza;Markus Putzke;Christian Hägerling;Christian Wietfeld	2012	Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012	10.1109/WTS.2012.6266084	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Metrics	27.40447728416362	85.63791361988156	126959

The three-node two-way relaying (TWR) model consists of two end nodes (sources) simultaneously communicating with each other over a relay node where each node is equipped with two antennas and uses Alamouti's STBC to provide diversity. We consider non-reciprocal channels where fading channel coefficients are independent for opposite directions of the same link. We first derive closed form expressions for the outage probability of the STBC-TWR system and uncoded TWRC assuming equal transmit power at each node and decode-and-forward (DF) strategy at the relay. We show that the STBC-TWR system significantly improves the uncoded TWRC outage performance. Then, to further improve the performance, we propose an optimal power allocation in TWR scheme employing Alamouti's STBC and PNC protocol. The optimal power allocation is obtained by maximizing the sum-rate under the total power constraint. We show that the optimal power allocation considerably improve the outage performance as well as the sum-rate compared to the equal-power case.	code;coefficient;direction finding;downtime;linear network coding;relay channel;simulation;sun outage;symmetrical double-sided two-way ranging	Menekse Yildiz;Ümit Aygölü	2012	2012 8th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2012.6292772	communications protocol;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;statistics;computer network	Embedded	34.95702100114419	76.05733760196776	127146

In this paper, we exactly quantify the cell capacity by focusing on not only the number of users but also the location of active users. To inspect the effect of multicell CDMA envir onments,we model thr ee cells divided by sector antennas and analyze the increasedinterfer ence when a user is added to the unit of cell. Basedon the capacity analysis, we proposea new call admission control schemethat uses the location information of users. Whenever a new user arri ves, our schemecheckswhether the admittance of that user can occur within the cell capacity. If the user is far away fr om the base station, it will have lesschance of acceptancebecause it createsmore interfer ence,resulting in reducedcapacity. Our schemeallows more users to enter the network if they generate lessinterfer ence.Therefore it has the effect of increasedsystem capacity without sacrificing the QoS of all the other active users. Thr ough simulations we show that the performance is impr oved by 10 to 20% in terms of the number of active users that can be accomodated.	channel capacity;quality of service;reflow soldering;simulation;statistical interference	Joonhwan Kim;Young-June Choi;Saewoong Bahk	2003		10.1109/WCNC.2003.1200592	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;base station;computer network	Mobile	27.24726190555977	86.91027044168389	127573

To measure the reflected self-interference channel in mmWave band, we transmit 18-bit PN sequence signal with more than 100 dB SNR using a transceiver with 27.925GHz center frequency. In the measurement results, we found the self-interference channel with long propagation delay caused by the reflection due to various nearby objects. This self-interference channel cannot be removed using conventional analog cancellation circuit which has limited analog delay. To overcome this limitation, it seems to be a good solution to apply opportunistic full-duplex scheme and a beam selection approach taking into account the residual self-interference.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);propagation delay;pseudorandom number generator;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;transceiver	Byunghwan Lee;Jong-Bu Lim;Chaehee Lim;Byungchul Kim;Ji-Yun Seol	2015	2015 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414127	ray tracing;telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;dipole antenna	Mobile	26.452811786995277	80.22397309417255	127588

In this mode, the primary and secondary users can share the same frequency band as long as the interference caused by the secondary network on the primary network is properly regulated. The optimal ergodic capacity of the secondary link that can be achieved is hence being investigated under the presence of the two practical limiting constraints: i) the average interference power affecting the capacity of the primary user and ii) the peak transmit power in the secondary transmitter. Analytical results for the CR link capacity are derived in the general case of full cross interference channel with Rayleigh fading. The results obtained allow evaluating the effects of the different constraints on the performance of the CR link and are validated with numerical simulations.	cognitive radio;computer simulation;ergodicity;frequency band;interference (communication);numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;throughput;transmitter	Maha Ghanem;Hiba Bawab;Oussama Bazzi;Youssef Nasser;Philippe Mary;Jean-François Hélard	2014	2014 6th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2014.7002146	transmitter;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;co-channel interference;fading;computer network	Metrics	35.823842765830726	81.18507088939383	127793

In this paper, the emphasis is placed on the validation of the simulated forward link system-level performance through comparison with field data. High spectrum efficiency observed both in simulations and in the field is explained by the salient features of 1xEV-DO that make it suitable for data communications in a cellular mobile environment. These features include, among others, the long-range channel estimation and rate prediction, incremental redundancy hybrid automatic request control (ARQ), turbo coding, and scheduling that exploits multi-user diversity in a fast fading environment. The paper also addresses the reverse link performance and the practical system constraints imposed by the signaling overhead necessary to support high throughput on the forward link.	aggregate data;channel state information;data rate units;data system;hybrid automatic repeat request;mobile phone;multi-user;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;turbo code	Qi Bi;Ronald R.

Artificial noise (AN) is used to provide masked beamforming for degrading the eavesdropper's channel. Existing works based on Gaussian input assumption may lead to substantial secrecy rate loss when considering practical finite-alphabet input. In order to maximize ergodic secrecy rate, a power allocation scheme between the information-bearing signal and AN is proposed. Despite the fact that there is no closed- form expression of mutual information under the constraint of finite-alphabet input, we exploit the relationship between mutual information and minimum mean square error (MMSE) to transform the original problem into a zero-searching problem, which can be solved via gradient search algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers a very good approximation to the optimal performance.	approximation;beamforming;ergodicity;gradient;mean squared error;monte carlo method;mutual information;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;search algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;system analysis	Xiaoran Liu;Dongtang Ma;Jun Xiong;Wei Li;Longwang Cheng	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881170	random variable;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;mathematics;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	EDA	36.662141498275204	83.30742761836416	127944

R can harvest energy from the light emitted by light emitting diodes (LEDs), which is used for the information transmission between R and the RF receiver which is close to the LED. It is assumed that E tries to eavesdrop the information delivered from R to the RF receiver and R is with finite energy storage. Considering the randomness of the locations of R and E, the statistical characteristics of the received signal-to-noise ratio at the RF receiver and E are characterized; then, we derive the analytical expressions for exact and asymptotic secrecy outage probability by using the stochastic geometry method.

e16d53a0439d6e9d1e580d5b58c1e18edfcea02f	a new lower bound on the ergodic capacity of optical mimo channels		In this paper, we present an analytical lower bound on the ergodic capacity of optical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. It turns out that the optical MIMO channel matrix which couples the mt inputs (modes/cores) into mr outputs (modes/cores) can be modeled as a sub-matrix of a m × m Haar-distributed unitary matrix where m > mt, mr. Using the fact that the probability density of the eigenvalues of a random matrix from unitary ensemble can be expressed in terms of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel. We provide a new analytical expression of the ergodic capacity as function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, we derive a closed-form lower-bound expression to the ergodic capacity. In addition, we also derive an approximation to the ergodic capacity in low-SNR regimes. Finally, we present numerical results supporting the expressions derived.	approximation;computation;ergodic hypothesis;ergodicity;haar wavelet;jacobi method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-core processor;numerical analysis;optical fiber;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;time complexity	Rémi Bonnefoi;Amor Nafkha	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996690	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;mathematics;mimo;ergodic theory;random matrix;probability density function;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;matrix (mathematics);upper and lower bounds;unitary matrix	Vision	38.62178830918496	79.06519310917801	128221

A central unit (CU) conveys data and channel information to multiple radio remote units (RRUs) via a capacity-limited backhaul. We provide a dual polarized (DP) antenna-based double side signal splitting method. Specifically, signals are split up into information decoding part [user equipment (UE) data transmitted from CU] and energy harvesting part (deterministic data created at RRUs), which are transmitted and received via vertical and horizontal polarizations of DP antennas, respectively. Normal beamformers (such as zero forcing and maximum ratio transmission) are used to reduce complexity. The problem is to maximize the sum rate satisfying per-UE received power, per-backhaul-link capacity, and per-RRU power transmission constraints. The results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;brute-force search;central processing unit;computation;computational complexity theory;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);multipoint ground;telecommunications link;tip (unix utility);zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Kai Liang;Liqiang Zhao;Zhiguo Ding;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2604309	telecommunications	Mobile	37.202012158356446	86.46626357449746	128261
7ac419d0d1144867f7d24dc02da6d35ffb9fcb1e	a new method of mimo-based non-orthogonal multiuser downlink transmission		In this paper, we propose a new method for nonorthogonal multiuser downlink transmission, referred to as multiple-input multiple-output lattice partition multiple access (MIMO-LPMA). The new method is based on the combination of user selection, zero forcing beamforming, and LPMA, and it uses N base station antennas to deliver information to N clusters of M users each. The method thus accommodates a total of N ·M users on a given time/frequency resource in a non- orthogonal fashion. The user selection algorithm ensures that all users in each cluster are sufficiently aligned with their respective transmission beam. Zero forcing beamforming controls the inter-cluster crosstalk, ensuring that beams transmitted to different clusters do not interfere to one another. LPMA encoding and decoding allows to superimpose and separate multiple messages on the same beam. Simulations show that the proposed MIMO-LPMA method outperforms the conventional approach based on non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) in terms of achievable rates. In particular, our results indicate that MIMO-LPMA guarantees a significantly larger 95%-likely rate.	beamforming;channel state information;complexity;computer simulation;crosstalk;image scaling;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multiplexing;selection algorithm;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Giovanni Geraci;Dong Fang;Holger Claussen	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108239	selection algorithm;mimo;electronic engineering;computer science;algorithm;telecommunications link;encoding (memory);interference (wave propagation);beamforming;decoding methods;base station	Visualization	39.135177526630514	85.40448763942646	128431
d99a73f4395deebd90fb7a863c1d0635ab1006f6	outage performance of a network coding aided multi-user cooperative secondary network		We evaluate the performance of a network-coded cooperative secondary network in a cognitive radio system under spectrum sharing constraints. The secondary network is composed of multiple sources that cooperate to transmit their own information to a common secondary destination. The outage probability is analysed under a given maximum interference constraint set by the primary network as well as to the maximum transmit power limit of the secondary sources. Moreover, we also obtain a closed-form equation for the ϵ-outage capacity, that is, the maximum information rate achieved by the secondary sources given a target outage probability. Also, we resort to the Dinkelbach algorithm in order to find the optimum number of parity packets that maximises the ϵ-outage capacity. The influence of the number of source nodes and another system parameters in the secondaryu0027s performance is also evaluated, and we show through theoretical and numerical results that cooperative communication with network coding can provide significant gains in terms of outage probability and diversity order when compared with non-cooperative or traditional cooperative.

Specifically, we derive a new procedure referred to as the equivalent uniform-density plane-entity (EUDPE) method for evaluating the other-cell interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our EUDPE method provides a universal and effective means to carry out the lower bound analysis of both the coverage probability and the average throughput for various base-station distribution models that can be found in practice, including the stochastic Poisson point process (PPP) model, a uniformly and randomly distributed model, and a deterministic grid-based model. The lower bounds of coverage probability and average throughput calculated by our proposed method agree with the simulated coverage probability and average throughput results and those obtained by the existing PPP-based analysis, if not better. Moreover, based on our new definition of cell edge boundary, we show that the cellular topology with randomly distributed base stations (BSs) only tends toward the Voronoi tessellation when the path-loss exponent is sufficiently high, which reveals the limitation of this popular network topology.	centroidal voronoi tessellation;cobham's thesis;interference (communication);limit analysis;network model;network topology;point process;randomness;simulation;stochastic process;throughput;voronoi diagram	Hui Zhang;Sheng Chen;Liang Feng;Yi Feng Xie;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2366597	stochastic process;throughput;combinatorics;computer science;connectivity;base station;theoretical computer science;probability;mathematical model;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	28.62366276467279	84.44510015041139	128534

Studies on RF propagation through human body indicate that the heterogeneous body tissues with different dielectric properties constitute a complicated and lossy environment for signal propagation. This environment also varies with different implant positions, individuals, body shapes and postures. As a result, there is a large variation in the path loss value of the in-body communication channel. In this paper, we first examine the energy efficiency of different digital modulation schemes in a basic wireless implant system. We point out that using a fixed type of modulation does not help to achieve the best energy efficiency in the implant system that has varying channel conditions. We then propose an adaptive communication system model which is suitable for wireless medical implant. Simulations results show that adopting adaptive modulation can provide a considerable amount of energy saving.	adaptive filter;body position;body tissue;channel (communications);communications media;computer simulation;implants;lossy compression;medical devices;modulation;over the air;rf modulator;radio frequency;software propagation	Yinyue Qiu;David Haley;Ying Chen	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943741	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	30.621903741606655	77.05555027281214	128561

The cognitive sensors (CSs) equipped with energy harvesting devices are assumed to operate in a harvesting-sensing-transmission mode and permitted to access the idle licensed frequency bands without causing any harmful jamming to the primary user. By identifying the time fractions of harvesting, sensing, and transmission, we can discuss some design considerations for the EH-CSN. In the meantime, considering the possibility that the primary user may reoccupy the idle channel during the CS's data transmission duration, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average throughput of EH-CSN under a collision constraint and an energy constraint. After deriving the lower and upper bounds of the time fraction for energy harvesting, the uniqueness and existence of the optimal time fraction set have been proved. Finally, our theoretical analysis is also verified through numerical simulations.	assumed;bands;cop9 signalosome;cascading style sheets;cell signaling;computer simulation;ehd1 gene;ehd3 gene;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;frequency band;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;programming paradigm;radio jamming;spectral efficiency;throughput;collision;sensor (device)	Hao Wu;Yong Chen	2018		10.3390/s18082540	throughput;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;engineering;computer network;energy harvesting;cognition	Mobile	32.27595615954651	86.65043807814077	128613

Discussion around such signal format are still on-going at the time of writing, anyway it is the most probable candidate signal that will be adopted by both GPS L1C and the Galileo E1 Open Service (OS) signals [( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/energy_transport/galileo/documents/doc/2004_06_21_summit_2004_en.pdf , 2004)] as modernization of the present BOC(1,1). In the context of the integration between wireless communication and satellite navigation, one of the major problems is that usually the GNSS receiver has to work in a critical environment characterized by a heavy presence of multipath or interference sources. Some examples are urban canyons or light indoor spaces. These are also typical situations for the usage of personal communications systems. The new MBOC modulation have been studied with the specific goal to create a signal more robust with respect to multipath, bringing the high performance of Galileo in situations in which the present BOC(1,1) shows limitations. In this sense, future Location Based Services (LBS) provided on the basis of the GNSS OS will benefits from this intrinsic robustness of the signal. Throughout the paper a review of the MBOC structure will be presented, specifying that in the Galileo framework such a structure has been proposed in a version named Composite BOC (CBOC). In particular, the paper presents the simulation of the CBOC behavior in presence of multipath showing the extreme improvement with respect to other BOC solutions.	galileo;modulation;multipath propagation	Maurizio Fantino;Paolo Mulassano;Fabio Dovis;Letizia Lo Presti	2008	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-007-9372-2	global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	26.029675632256776	74.93736726580059	128914

In effect, a new class of large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems has recently emerged and attracted both scientific and industrial attention. To analyze these systems in realistic scenarios one has to include such aspects as co-channel interference, multiple access and spatial correlation. In this paper, we study the properties of correlated MIMO multiple-access channels in the presence of external interference. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we derive the ergodic sum-rate of the communication for arbitrary signal constellations when the numbers of antennas at both ends of the channel grow large. Based on these asymptotic expressions, we also address the problem of sum-rate maximization using statistical channel state information and linear precoding. The numerical results demonstrate that when the interfering terminals use discrete constellations, the resulting interference becomes easier to handle compared to Gaussian signals. Thus, it may be possible to accommodate more interfering transmitter-receiver pairs within the same area as compared to the case of Gaussian signals. In addition, we demonstrate numerically for the Gaussian and QPSK signaling schemes that it is possible to design precoder matrices that significantly improve the achievable rates at low-to-mid range of signal-to-noise ratios when compared to isotropic precoding.	channel (communications);channel state information;ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;gaussian blur;interference (communication);mimo;numerical analysis;performance per watt;signal-to-noise ratio;system analysis;throughput;transmitter	Maksym A.

790933fe50482db8897c7fc4ccedea97623cd4dd	using system-level simulation to evaluate downlink throughput performance in lte-a networks with clustered user deployments	base stations;cellular networks;long term evolution;computational modeling;downlink;conferences;throughput	Downlink throughput performance in Long Term Evolution - Advanced (LTE-A) networks has been widely investigated by many simulation studies. However, these studies generally assume that users are uniformly distributed in regularly arranged hexagonal cells. Analytical models and methods of stochastic geometry have been applied to wireless networks to consider the effects of spatial configuration of nodes and base stations on network performance by abstracting away many details of the systems. As such, comprehensive studies of the effects of spatial factors on throughput performance using standard-compliant, open-source software that simulates many details of LTE-A networks are still scarce. In this paper, we use the Vienna LTE-A Downlink System Level Simulator to re-evaluate the validity of usual throughput performance metrics under various spatial deployment scenarios and employ statistical methods to determine the significance of performance observations. Our primary aim is to show that clustered user deployments around a base station exhibit significantly different throughput performance compared to the case of uniformly distributed users throughout the cell. This is important since in practice, base stations are deployed in areas of high user density. In addition, we show that the most widely used scheduling scheme in cellular networks, namely the proportional fair scheduling, may lose its performance advantage over round robin scheduling when users are clustered around the base station. These findings are expected to have implications on the design and deployment of next generation cellular networks.	cluster analysis;compaq lte;fair-share scheduling;interference (communication);network performance;next-generation network;open-source software;proportionally fair;queueing theory;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);semantic network;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation software;software deployment;spectral efficiency;system-level simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	John O.

The novel expressions for ακ-μ/Gamma and α-η-μ/Gamma fading channels have been derived to approximate by using the mixture gamma (MG) distribution under low instantaneous signal-to-noise (SNR) condition. On the basis of the deduced fading distributions, novel, exact and close-form detective models are derived to evaluate the sensing performance with different key fading parameters over generalized non-linear and shadowed composite fading channels.	approximation algorithm;line-of-sight (missile);mg (editor);mixture model;nonlinear system;performance evaluation;signal-to-noise ratio	He Huang	2017	CoRR		mathematics;gamma distribution;mathematical optimization;fading;nonlinear system;detector;expression (mathematics);communication channel;composite number;non-line-of-sight propagation	ML	38.97392184200468	77.39314539429024	128974

Multi-hop communication promises to reduce interference, hence increasing capacity. However, such capacity gains depend on the actual interference. The location of a call determines its interference effect on the network. In this paper, we study the effect of call distribution on the capacity of multi-hop CDMA cellular networks. The capacity of multi-hop case is compared to that of single hop case. The effect of non-uniform call distribution is studied. It is shown that in the multi-hop case call distribution in a cell affects the capacity of this cell but hardly the capacity of its neighboring cells. The case is reversed in the single-hop case. Call distribution in a cell has no effect on the capacity of this cell, but it can have a significant effect on the capacity of surrounding cells. It is shown that if calls tend to originate near the border of one cell, this can seriously degrade the capacity of the whole network. This scenario is alleviated in the multi-hop case due to the shorter distances signals have to travel, resulting in lower interference. This paper also highlights scenarios where multi-hop communication is deeply needed.	automatic call distributor;interference (communication)	Ayman Radwan;Hossam S.

It improves spectrum utilization, overall throughput, and energy efficiency while enabling new peer-to-peer and location-based applications and services. However, interference is the major challenge, since the same resources are shared by both systems. Therefore, interference management techniques are required to keep the interference under control. In this paper, in order to mitigate interference, we consider centralized and distributed power control algorithms in a one-cell random network model. Existing results on D2D underlay networks assume perfect channel state information (CSI). This assumption is usually unrealistic in practice due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels. Thus, it is of great interest to study and evaluate achievable performances under channel uncertainty. Differently from previous works, we are assuming that the CSI may be imperfect and include estimation errors. In the centralized approach, we derive the optimal powers that maximize the coverage probability and the rate of the cellular user while scheduling as many D2D links as possible. These powers are computed at the base station (BS) and then delivered to the users, and hence the name “centralized”. For the distributed method, the ON–OFF power control and the truncated channel inversion are proposed. Expressions of coverage probabilities are established in the function of D2D links intensity, pathloss exponent, and estimation error variance. Results show the important influence of CSI error on achievable performances and thus how crucial it is to consider it while designing networks and evaluating performances.	algorithm;centralized computing;channel state information;erdős–rényi model;hurst exponent;interference (communication);network model;peer-to-peer;performance;random graph;scheduling (computing);throughput	Amen Memmi;Zouheir Rezki;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2645210	cellular network;simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	29.24219672542194	84.81515757121838	129075
6de350cf028f15fd709f53df6454b87c4e943a76	performance analysis of millimeter wave noma networks with beam misalignment		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter wave (mmWave) are two key enabling technologies for the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a general performance analysis framework for mmWave-NOMA networks with spatially random users taking into account link blockage and directional beamforming. To facilitate NOMA transmission in mmWave networks, we propose an angle-based user pairing strategy. Specifically, the base station first randomly selects one user and then pairs it with the line-of-sight user that has the minimum relative angle difference. NOMA is enabled when the beamwidth of the main lobe created by directional beamforming is not smaller than the angle difference between the paired NOMA users. Tools from stochastic geometry are utilized to derive the coverage probability and the sum rate of the proposed NOMA scheme, where beam misalignment at both the base station and the users is taken into account. Simulations validate the performance analysis and show that the proposed NOMA scheme achieves a larger coverage probability and a higher sum rate than conventional NOMA with distance-based user pairing and orthogonal multiple access.	acoustic lobing;beamforming;computer simulation;fifth generation computer;line-of-sight (missile);profiling (computer programming);randomness	Yong Zhou;Vincent W.

In the large system limit, when the number of transmit and receive antennas goes to infinity at a finite fixed ratio, however, the eigenvalues of many random matrices become deterministic and analytical expressions for the sum rate can be derived in some cases. In this paper we will present large system expressions for the sum rate for three sub-optimum algorithms, namely the Successive Encoding Successive Allocation Method (SESAM), Block Diagonalization and Block Diagonalization with Dirty Paper Coding. In case the large system limit of the sum rate does not exist, we derive lower bounds. By simulation results it is shown that the asymptotic results serve as a good approximation of the system performance with finite system parameters of reasonable size.	algorithm;approximation;channel state information;mimo;sesam;simulation;system analysis;transmitter	Christian Guthy;Wolfgang Utschick;Michael L.

The relays in the proposed system have finite buffers and they are self-powered by harvesting energy from the primary signal. We adopt a buffer-aided relay selection strategy that reduces overhead for exchanging the channel state information between communication nodes. In particular, a combination of the partial relay selection and the conventional max-max relay selection is proposed to obtain the benefits of both those schemes while avoiding the cases where full/empty buffers are selected to receive/forward packets with limited buffer size. The time-switching relaying protocol is exploited to harvest energy at the relays. The use of energy harvesting in the relay selection process not only prolongs the lifetime of the cognitive wireless sensor network but also improves the outage performance. A tool from Markov chain theory is implemented to model the buffer states of the relay system, which are important in determining the state transition probability. The outage probability of the secondary wireless sensor network is derived, and numerical results are provided to verify the analysis. Different relaying schemes are also compared in terms of the outage probability and average packet delay.

This paper extends the index coding problem to cases when the source node can reach users through multihop communications. The new approach is called Modified Index Coding (MIC) which can be applied to both wireless and wired networks. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by applying MIC to Information-Centric Networks (ICN). We demonstrate that the combination of ICN and MIC requires a hybrid caching scheme that includes both central and distributed caching to support two different goals. The approach results in a combination of conventional caching in ICN and a new distributed caching scheme across nodes in the network. Our analysis demonstrates that capacity improvement can be achieved by the new architecture. Simulation results compare the capacity improvement to traditional ICN architecture.	application-oriented networking;cache (computing);code;distributed cache;icn gps;linear network coding;multi-user;nonlinear system;routing;simulation	Mohsen Karimzadeh Kiskani;Hamid R.

To inspect the achievable performance of parameter estimation, we derive all necessary derivatives of complex gradient matrix to compute the inherent accuracy limitation based on the Cramer-Rao bound.

As their functionality and capabilities increase, their energy consumption requirements also increase. Yet, these devices have to operate on limited batteries. In order to maximize the battery lifetime, it is necessary to optimize the use of energy at various components of such a device. In this paper, we consider a single portable device operating on a limited battery that transmits information over an interference-limited wireless channel. We seek to optimize the power consumption on the communication radio in this device, by controlling both the operation mode and the transmission power. We model the general problem using dynamic programming, obtain the optimal solutions for insightful special cases and explore various design tradeoffs.

To overcome this limitation, this paper considers an architecture based on the separation of control and data planes, in which retransmission control decisions are made at the edge of the network, that is, by the RRHs or user equipment (UE), while data decoding is carried out remotely at the BBUs. This solution enables low-latency local retransmission decisions to be made at the RRHs or UE, which are not subject to the fronthaul latency constraints, while, at the same time, leveraging the decoding capability of the BBUs. A system with a BBU Hoteling system is considered first in which each RRH has a dedicated BBU in the cloud. For this system, the control-data separation leverages low-latency local feedback from an RRH to drive the HARQ process of a given UE. The throughput and the probability of error of this solution are analyzed for the three standard HARQ modes of Type-I, chase combining, and incremental redundancy over a general fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) link. Then, novel user-centric low-latency feedback strategies are proposed and analyzed for the C-RAN architecture, with a single centralized BBU, based on limited “hard” or “soft” local feedback from the RRHs to the UE and on retransmission decisions taken at the UE. The analysis presented in this paper allows the optimization of the considered schemes, as well as the investigation of the impact of system parameters such as HARQ protocol type, blocklength, and number of antennas on the performance of low-latency local HARQ decisions in BBU Hoteling and C-RAN architectures.	baseband;c-ran;centralized computing;cloud computing;hybrid automatic repeat request;mimo;mathematical optimization;radio access network;remote radio head;retransmission (data networks);telecommunications link;throughput	Shahrouz Khalili;Osvaldo Simeone	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2604119	communications protocol;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;base station;process control;baseband;computer network	Mobile	30.361863920595177	87.92744965626133	130176
4451574202b66e4803f778e07aa5921003974dfb	optimal power allocation for joint cooperative beamforming and jamming assisted wireless networks		In this paper, we examine the physical layer security for cooperative wireless networks with multiple intermediate nodes, where the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol is considered. We propose a new joint cooperative beamforming and jamming (JCBJ) scheme to protect wireless communication against eavesdropping, where the intermediate nodes which successfully decode the source signal are selected as the relays for simultaneously forwarding the source signal by employing a weight vector, and meanwhile, the others are used to act as the friendly jammers for broadcasting artificial noise to disturb the eavesdropper. We further investigate the optimal power allocation among the source, relays and friendly jammers for maximizing the secrecy rate of the proposed JCBJ scheme and derive a closed-form sub-optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed JCBJ scheme achieves obviously higher secrecy rate than the conventional generalized singular-value-decomposition (GSVD) based beamforming and pure jamming schemes. Additionally, the proposed optimal power allocation scheme performs much better than the equal power allocation scheme in terms of secrecy rate.	beamforming;cooperative mimo;direction finding;radio jamming;relay;scheme;simulation;singular value decomposition	Haiyan Guo;Zhen Yang;Linghua Zhang;Jia Zhu;Yulong Zou	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997321	computer network;wireless;secrecy;wireless network;network security;computer science;jamming;physical layer;beamforming;artificial noise	Mobile	35.072041409287806	83.42445752515651	130179

Additionally, by taking into consideration the interfering effects coming from the multiple primary transmitters, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio statistic of the secondary nodes is investigated. The derived results include exact expressions as well as approximated ones for high values of the maximum allowed transmitted power at the cognitive network and/or the interference limited case.

This work can be regarded as a good reference to the research community, industry and regulators which are currently investigating spectrum requirements and technology options for 5G system. Considering the interference scenario between the return inter-orbit link of data relay satellite system and downlink of IMT-2020, we adopt realistic system parameters and radiation pattern, combined with very recent channel from the literature.

Instead of selecting a single cluster-head, we propose M cluster-heads in each cluster to obtain a diversity of order M. The cluster-heads gather data from all the sensor nodes within the cluster using same technique as LEACH. Cluster-heads transmit gathered data cooperatively towards the destination or higher order cluster-head. We propose a code combining based cooperative diversity protocol which is similar to coded cooperation that maximizes the performance of the proposed cooperative LEACH protocol. The implementation of the proposed cooperative strategy is analyzed. We develop the upper bounds on bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) for our proposal. Space time block codes (STBC) are also a suitable candidate for our proposal. In this paper, we argue that the STBC performs worse than the code combining cooperation.

This paper proposes a grouping-based interference alignment (GIA) with optimized IA-Cell assignment for the multiple cells interfering multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC) network under limited feedback. This work consists of three main parts: 1) an improved version (including some new improvements) of the GIA with respect to the degrees of freedom (DoF) and optimal linear transceiver design is provided, which allows for low-complexity and distributed implementation; 2) based on the GIA, the concept of IA-Cell assignment is introduced. Three IA-Cell assignment algorithms are proposed with different backhaul overhead and their DoF and rate performance is investigated; 3)the performance of the proposed GIA algorithms is studied under limited feedback of IA precoders. To enable efficient feedback, a dynamic feedback bit allocation (DBA) problem is formulated and solved in closed-form. The practical implementation, the backhaul overhead requirements, and the complexity of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms greatly outperform the traditional GIA under both unlimited and limited feedback.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);feedback;interference (communication);mimo;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);requirement;telecommunications network;transceiver	Pan Cao;Alessio Zappone;Eduard Axel Jorswieck	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2496356	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference;statistics;transceiver;mimo	Mobile	37.77162014648433	87.52745021214278	130573

Efficient spectrum sensing along with transmit power control can achieve this conflicting goal. In this paper, we propose a sensor network aided cognitive radio system which will reduce the missed detection and reduce the interference. We investigate the performance of various sensing and power allocation schemes for an OFDM-based cognitive radio system. We formulate an optimisation problem to design the optimal sensing time and transmit power. Mathematical analysis shows that interference between primary and secondary in OFDM-based system depends on spectral distance. Results show that distance dependent modified water filling DDMWF scheme can achieve the highest data rate for the cognitive radio based secondary user and then the optimal sensing time can be designed to maximise the throughput.	cognitive radio;mathematical optimization;throughput	Ishrat Maherin;Qilian Liang	2013	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2013.055586	embedded system;cognitive radio;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Vision	33.764013661655056	87.18167586292748	130779

This paper presents a comparative study on the asymptotic capacity of a downlink single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple BS antennas which are either co-located or grouped into uniformly distributed clusters. The analysis reveals that when the ratio L of the number of BS antennas to the number of user antennas is large, the average per-antenna capacities in both cases logarithmically increase with L, but in the orders of log2 L and α/2 log2 L for the co-located and distributed antenna layouts, respectively, where α>2 denotes the path-loss factor. A higher capacity is achieved by distributing the BS antennas thanks to the reduction of the minimum access distance.	asymptote;binary logarithm;image scaling;mimo;multi-user;telecommunications link	Zhiyang Liu;Lin Dai	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666337	3g mimo;spatial correlation;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;reconfigurable antenna;antenna;smart antenna;computer network	Arch	29.5907592646721	83.18582659344872	130980
3f0d6082cb7cc3f25316b3f1c8f44df93c9722f0	efficient relay selection scheme for delay-limited non-orthogonal hybrid-arq relay channels		We consider a half-duplex wireless relay network with hybri d-automatic retransmission request (HARQ) and Rayleigh fading channels. In this paper, we analy ze the outage probability of the multirelay delay-limited HARQ system with opportunistic relayi ng scheme in decode-and-forward mode, in which thebest relay is selected to transmit the source’s regenerated sign al. A simple and distributed relay selection strategy is proposed for multi-relay HARQ c hannels. Then, we utilize the non-orthogonal cooperative transmission between the source and selected r elay for retransmitting of the source data toward the destination if needed, using space-time codes or beamforming techniques. We analyze the performance of the system. We first derive the cumulative den sity function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the selected relay HARQ channels. Then, the CDF and PDF are used to determine the outage probability in the l-th round of HARQ. The outage probability is required to compute the throughput-delay performance of this half-dup lex opportunistic relaying protocol. The packet delay constraint is represented by L, the maximum number of HARQ rounds. An outage is declared if the packet is unsuccessful after L HARQ rounds. Furthermore, closed-form upper-bounds on outage probability are derived and subsequently are used to investigate the diversity order of the system. Based on the derived upper-bound expressions, it is shown that the proposed schemes achieve the full spatial diversity order of N + 1, whereN is the number of potential relays.

4f63639bd20e24b6ecfe41516a6f21bb5e065ab4	stochastic modeling and analysis of user-centric network mimo systems		This paper provides an analytical performance characterization of both the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) user-centric network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where a cooperating base station (BS) cluster is formed for each user individually and the clusters for different users may overlap. In this model, cooperating BSs (each equipped with multiple antennas) jointly perform zero-forcing beamforming to the set of single-antenna users associated with them. As compared with a baseline network MIMO system with disjoint BS clusters, the effect of user-centric clustering is that it improves signal strength in both the UL and DL, while reducing cluster-edge interference in the DL. This paper quantifies these effects by assuming that BSs and users form Poisson point processes and by further approximating both the signal and interference powers using Gamma distributions of appropriate parameters. We show that BS cooperation provides significant gain as compared to single-cell processing for both the UL and DL, but the advantage of user-centric clustering over the baseline disjoint clustering system is significant for the DL cluster-edge users only. Although the analytic results are derived with the assumption of perfect channel state information and infinite backhaul between the cooperating BSs, they nevertheless provide architectural insight into the design of the future cooperative cellular networks.

c3f730732052c3f4f2cfa8ec809dfbf5d0c6da22	aligning the light based on the network topology for visible light communications		Visible light communications (VLC) are considered as a key element of the future cellular network. However, the deployment of several optical access points (AP) involves to cope with the interference in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel. In this sense, adaptation of the transmit precoding (TPC) schemes typically proposed for radio-frequency (RF) systems have been considered. However, these TPC schemes are not flexible to the topology of the VLC scenarios, which are characterized by forming amorphous cells, i.e., clusters composed of several APs, from a user-centric perspective. In this work, we propose a Blind Interference Alignment (BIA) scheme based on a user-centric approach that only requires the knowledge of the network topology avoiding the need for Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) or cooperation among APs. Simulation results show that the proposed user-centric BIA results more suitable for VLC networks in comparison with other BIA or TPC schemes.	business continuity planning;channel state information;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;interference (communication);mimo;network topology;radio frequency;simulation;software deployment;statistical interference;transmitter;vlc media player;wireless access point	Ahmad Adnan-Quidan;Máximo Morales Céspedes;Ana García Armada	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403737	network topology;mimo;computer network;computer science;channel state information;precoding;transmitter;visible light communication;cellular network;communication channel	Mobile	25.611682928152554	88.47799971936304	131425

In the case of Z-channel, closed-form expressions for the achievable diversity gain regions (DGRs) with both single-user (SU) codes and multi-user (MU) codes are presented. The closed-form expression for the achievable DGR of the clustered FD DF relay-assisted Z-channel with SU codes is also presented. In the Z-channel, if the interference-free receiver is constrained to operate at optimal diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT), the SU codes are shown to achieve better DGR than MU codes. Furthermore, in the Z-channel, the SU codes achieve DGR outer bound at low multiplexing gain region, and MU codes can never achieve DGR outer bound. Also, we have shown that Z-channel with two co-located antennas at the interfering transmitter achieves better DGR compared to that of the clustered FD DF relay-assisted Z-channel with single antenna at the interfering transmitter.	catastrophic interference;interference (communication);relay	Rajendra Prasad Sirigina;A.

We studied in particular the broadcast mode where the relay node combines the bits received from the two users and retransmit the combined information to both users. Symmetric and asymmetric data rate transmissions are considered. We show that the performance of the JMR scheme that uses a higher order modulation is improved using asymmetric constellations. This was verified by calculation the capacity of the channel and by determining the bit error probability of an LDPC coded JMR scheme using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, increasing the degree of asymmetry will lead asymptotically to a lower order signal constellation as in a network coding scheme. Therefore, there's no need for a higher order modulation at the relay node in order to retransmit data but only to apply network coding and modulation using the constellation of the stronger link.	bit error rate;duplex (telecommunications);linear network coding;low-density parity-check code;modulation;monte carlo method;relay channel;simulation;uncompressed video	Hadi E.

Unlike conventional QKD protocols based on physical characteristics of quantum mechanics, the proposed QKD protocol can be implemented on standard FSO systems using subcarrier intensity modulation binary phase shift keying and direct detection with a dual-threshold receiver. Under security constraints, the design criteria for FSO transmitter and receiver, in particular, the modulation depth and the selection of dual-threshold detection, respectively, is analytically investigated. For the security analysis, quantum bit error rate, ergodic secret-key rate, and final key-creation rate are concisely derived in novel closed-form expressions in terms of finite power series, taking into account the channel loss, atmospheric turbulence-induced fading, and receiver noises. Furthermore, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify analytical results and the feasibility of the proposed QKD protocol.	bit error rate;ergodicity;key (cryptography);modulation;public-key cryptography;quantum key distribution;quantum mechanics;qubit;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter;turbulence	Phuc V.

The existing PNC solutions using the same modulation for signals transmitted from two source nodes may not be desirable for practical situations when traffic loads exchanged between the sources are unequal and channel conditions of source-relay links are heterogeneous. HePNC includes two stages: multiple access (MA) and broadcast (BC) stages. In the MA stage, the two source nodes transmit to the relay simultaneously with heterogeneous modulations selected according to the channel conditions and the ratio of traffic loads exchanged between the sources, and then the signals superimposed at the relay are mapped to a network-coded symbol by a mapping function adaptively; in the BC stage, the relay broadcasts the network-coded symbol back to both sources with a modulation selected according to the bottleneck link's channel condition. We present three HePNC designs, including QPSK-BPSK, 8PSK-BPSK and 16QAM-BPSK HePNC. How to design and optimize the mapping function is investigated and the error performance of QPSK-BPSK HePNC is analyzed. We further study the HePNC system performance, throughput upper bound and energy efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed HePNC can substantially enhance the throughput and energy efficiency compared with the existing PNC.	additive white gaussian noise;bottleneck (network);broadcasting (networking);channel capacity;end-to-end principle;forward error correction;linear network coding;modulation;one-to-many (data model);rayleigh fading;relay channel;simulation;throughput;unbalanced circuit;x.690	Haoyuan Zhang;Lei Zheng;Lin Cai	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2504471	synchronization;throughput;linear network coding;quadrature amplitude modulation;broadcast communication network;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;computer performance;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	35.38187717413383	77.0874323095633	131926

The analysis accounts for per user equipment (UE) power control as well as the maximum power limitations for UEs. More specifically, for interference mitigation and robust uplink communication, each UE is required to control its transmit power such that the average received signal power at its serving base station (BS) is equal to a certain threshold ρ<sub>o</sub>. Due to the limited transmit power, the UEs employ a truncated channel inversion power control policy with a cutoff threshold of ρ<sub>o</sub>. We show that there exists a transfer point in the uplink system performance that depends on the following tuple: BS intensity λ, maximum transmit power of UEs P<sub>u</sub>}, and ρ<sub>o</sub>. That is, when P<sub>u</sub> is a tight operational constraint with respect to (w.r.t.) λ and ρ<sub>o</sub>, the uplink outage probability and spectral efficiency highly depend on the values of λ and ρ<sub>o</sub>. In this case, there exists an optimal cutoff threshold ρ<sub>o</sub>*, which depends on the system parameters, that minimizes the outage probability. On the other hand, when P<sub>u</sub> is not a binding operational constraint w.r.t. λ and ρ<sub>o</sub>, the uplink outage probability and spectral efficiency become independent of λ and ρ<sub>o</sub>. We obtain approximate yet accurate simple expressions for outage probability and spectral efficiency, which reduce to closed forms in some special cases.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;downtime;interference (communication);maximum power transfer theorem;multitier architecture;programming paradigm;spectral efficiency;sun outage;telecommunications link	Hesham Elsawy;Ekram Hossain	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2316519	telecommunications;control theory	Mobile	28.959206839114373	85.2050932731608	131965

By applying superposition coding, each user will transmit a mixture containing its own information as well as the other users', which means that each user shares parts of its power with the others. The use of superposition coding in cooperative networks was first proposed in [E. G. Larsson and B. R. Vojcic, Cooperative transmit diversity based on superposition modulation, IEEE Commun. Lett., vol. 9, pp. 778 780, Sep. 2005. ] , which will be generalized to a multiple-user scenario in this paper. Since the proposed CMA system can be seen as a precoded point-to-point multiple-antenna system, its performance can be best evaluated using the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. By carefully categorizing the outage events, the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff can be obtained, which shows that the proposed cooperative strategy can achieve larger diversity/multiplexing gain than the compared transmission schemes at any diversity/multiplexing gain. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed strategy can achieve optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0 les tau les1 whereas the compared cooperative scheme is only optimal for 0 les tau les (1/N) . As discussed in the paper, such superiority of the proposed CMA system is due to the fact that the relaying transmission does not consume extra channel use and, hence, the deteriorating effect of cooperative communication on the data rate is effectively limited.	cma-es;categorization;centralized computing;channel use;data rate units;ieee 802.1aq;modulation;multiplexing;point-to-point (telecommunications);quantum superposition;scenario (computing);sun outage	Zhiguo Ding;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah;Colin Cowan	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2007.896276	communications protocol;telecommunications;gain;point-to-point;computer science;mathematics;coding;cooperative diversity;signal-to-noise ratio;antenna array;transmit diversity;channel capacity;multiplexing;encoding;spectral efficiency	Mobile	35.72420589457782	82.19958838088243	132047
002e8414fdde5878d1c573e4201589a326c9c28f	localizing noncooperative receiver through full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay		Localizing noncooperative transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) that belong to another system is important in many scenarios, e.g., interference management in cognitive radio systems and user behavior learning in ad hoc wireless networks. However, obtaining the locations of these nodes in particular in frequency-division duplex systems is challenging, since the localization network usually does not know the spectrum that the Rx uses for backward transmission. In this paper, we propose to use the full-duplex relay technique to localize a noncooperative Rx, which does not require the knowledge of the Rx’s backward transmission spectrum. In the proposed method, localization sensors alternatively act as a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay to trigger the power control of the Tx–Rx link. Then, by detecting the power adjustment of the Tx, each localization sensor can estimate the time difference of arrival between the direct and relay signals. Finally, the Rx location can be calculated from triangulation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively localize the Rx, which validates its potential for receiver-aware applications and services.

The relay forwards speech packets for active calls using a subset of the free time slots left available by users that are silent. No new channel resources are needed for cooperation and the system encounters no bandwidth losses. Because the resources allocated to the relay are not drawn from the pool of reused resources but from those potentially used for random channel access. Thus, the use of cooperation introduces a tradeoff between the amount of help offered to active calls and the probability of a successful contention for channel access. Such cooperation tradeoff is investigated and guidelines for the choice of protocol parameters are developed. The throughput and delay performance of the proposed protocol are characterized and compared to a similar non-cooperative packet speech protocol. Results demonstrate significant gains achieved by the proposed cooperative protocol. Moreover, the speech quality under the cooperative protocol was measured using a perceptual model, and results reveal significant improvement over the non-cooperative protocol especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.	channel capacity;cooperative mimo;markov chain;markov model;network packet;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;software deployment;throughput	Amr A.

We opt for eigenbeamforming in the frequency domain for spatial precoding and decoding. We show that eigenbeamforming leads to a simple yet effective maximization of the energy efficiency (EE) of the MIMO CP-SC link. Moreover, the associated power allocation relies on the combination of waterfilling among the spatial streams and a proper distribution of the per-stream allocated power among subcarriers. Numerical results show that, if we account for the efficiency of the high power amplifier (HPA) associated with the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), CP-SC can be more energy efficient than orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for moderate to high signal-to-noise (SNR) values.	audio power amplifier;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;iterative method;mimo;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Jeevan Shrestha;Ivan Stupia;Luc Vandendorpe	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7226991	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;engineering;control theory;spatial multiplexing	Mobile	37.718902807832585	86.9308368511703	132250

Taking uplink as an example, both simplified analysis and intensive computer simulations are presented to offer comparison among FRN enhanced systems with our proposed schemes, that with a known channel-borrowing based frequency planning scheme and the conventional cellular system without relaying.

Numerous algorithms and techniques exist that provide highresolution direction estimation under certain conditions and channel models; however, to our knowledge they all perform poorly at indoor environments. Here, we propose a technique that enables a receiver to achieve greater reliability in estimating source direction through some collaboration with the source. We assume that the receiver and the transmitter are synchronized and they are equipped with circular phased array antennas that have beamforming capability. If the transmitter-receiver pair always steer their main lobes into opposite directions, the spatial spectrum of the received power can be used as a mean for estimating the direction of the transmitting source. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of this methodology, and show the achieved improvement.	algorithm;beamforming;multipath propagation;phased array;software propagation;transmitter	Kamran Sayrafian-Pour;Dominik Kaspar	2006	Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2006.225	spectrum;phased array;ray tracing;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;multiple signal classification;maximum likelihood;shadow mapping	Visualization	26.258783594338983	79.44917608132332	132261

With the same setup as in [1], the influence of orthogonal and non-orthogonal pilot sequences on the system performance is analytically characterized when each BS has infinitely many antennas. Using stochastic geometric modeling of the BS and MS locations, closed-form expressions are derived for the distribution of signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) for both uplink and downlink. Moreover, they are shown to be equivalent for the orthogonal pilots case. Further, it is shown that the downlink SIR is greatly influenced by the correlations between the pilot sequences in the non-orthogonal pilots case. Finally, the mathematical tools can be used to study system performances with other general channel estimation methods and transmission-reception schemes.	channel state information;geometric modeling;interference (communication);mimo;many antennas;performance;telecommunications link;transmission (bittorrent client)	Prasanna Madhusudhanan;Xing Li;Youjian Eugene Liu;Timothy X.

These bounds are tight and approach exact values when the number of base station (BS) antennas is large. A problem of energy efficiency (EE) maximization is investigated by using a practical power consumption model. The effects of the system parameters and quality of channel estimation, including the number of BS antennas, transmit power, and training length on the performance metrics, are explicitly analyzed. Following that, an alternating optimization algorithm is employed to obtain the optimum EE. It has been shown that the proposed SLNR-PS performs better than the matched-filtering and zero-forcing schemes and a deployment of massive MIMO with the optimal transmit power and training length can achieve high EE.	channel state information;cobham's thesis;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo;mathematical optimization;software deployment;spectral efficiency;spectral leakage	Tuong Xuan Tran;Kah Chan Teh	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2819184	transmitter power output;channel state information;mimo;real-time computing;precoding;topology;mathematics;base station;maximization;spectral efficiency;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	37.370273864018905	86.33527884364713	132849

The proposed scheme shows better sum rate performance than random beamforming as well as an existing dual mode random beamforming scheme based on instantaneous channel information, while the number of feedback bits for beam index is reduced compared to random beamforming.	approximation;beamforming;program optimization	Yohan Kim;Hyukjin Chae;Janghoon Yang;Dong Ku Kim	2009	IEICE Transactions		mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;wsdma;mathematics;beamforming;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	38.31585366447112	86.48376489743755	133089

99ce79ce59807a55e5544ad10719411eb6364134	outage performance of dual hop full-duplex mimo relay networks with tas/mrc over rayleigh fading channels		In this paper, we investigate end-to-end (e2e) outage probability (OP) performance of dual hop full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network with transmit antenna selection (TAS) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) over independent identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. In the network, source and destination are equipped with multiple antennas, and communicate with each other via a single relay, which is equipped with one receive and one transmit antennas. We assume that the direct link between the source and destination is not available. For signal transmission, TAS is used at the source by neglecting residual self-interference (RSI) effect and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) technique is employed at the destination for combining received signals. In order to simplify the theoretical derivations, we also investigate the e2e OP in case that the RSI is non-fading. OP expression is derived in integral form for the Rayleigh faded RSI effect. Moreover, in case of non-fading RSI effect, OP expression is derived in closed form. The analytical results are verified by the Monte Carlo simulations.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;inline linking;interference (communication);mimo;mrc (file format);maximal set;monte carlo method;pattern matching;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;thermal-assisted switching;x86	Mesut Toka;Oguz Kucur	2016	2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600882	duplex (telecommunications);hop (networking);computer network;mimo;transmission (telecommunications);relay;topology;independent and identically distributed random variables;computer science;rayleigh fading;communication channel	Networks	37.12408638946141	78.74512972793377	133394
01dcde009f8d686279414690004d724ca1e9f834	power allocation study for non-orthogonal multiple access networks with multicast-unicast transmission		This paper considers a downlink single-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where the base station, which has multiple antennas, broadcasts the mixed multicast and unicast messages to multiple users with a single antenna. We propose two types of power allocation schemes for NOMA networks with multicast-unicast transmission to investigate the impact of performance, namely, cognitive radio inspired NOMA with dynamic quality of service (QoS) at multicast users (CR-NOMA-D-M), and CR-NOMA constrains the dynamic QoS at the unicast user (CR-NOMA-D-U). Based on the proposed schemes, we drive the exact/closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability, outage probability, as well as the approximate outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio to study the diversity gain. Compared with existing works, the derived analytical results show that both proposed schemes cannot only significantly improve the outage performance for multicast users, but also remarkably enhance the diversity gain and the secrecy outage probability for the unicast user.

These models are appropriate for rural or suburban areas but are not suitable for dense urban environments, where a large number of heterogeneous small cells are deployed to satisfy the rapid increase in mobile subscribers and communication service demands. In this paper, a new general 3-D model for heterogeneous cellular networks is proposed. The 3-D Poisson point process (PPP) is used to describe the positions of the picocells and femtocells in the network. We derive the average coverage probability expressions of downlink heterogeneous cellular networks for a given set of parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the analytical results and the advantage of the proposed 3-D model when compared to the traditional 2-D model. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed model which presents an efficient description and tractable model of dense small cells deployment in heterogeneous cellular networks.	3d modeling;cobham's thesis;computer simulation;monte carlo method;point process;profiling (computer programming);software deployment;telecommunications link	Aymen Omri;Mazen O.

However, most works available in literature either address the effect of correlated interfering signals or include interferer activity, but not both. Further, available literature has also addressed the effect of large-scale fading (shadowing and distance-dependent path loss) only, however, has fallen short of including the composite effect of the line of sight and non-line of sight small-scale fading. The correlation of desired signals with interfering signals due to shadowing has also not been considered in existing literature. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical signal to interference power ratio evaluation framework addressing all the above mentioned important components to the model in a holistic manner. In this analysis, we extend and apply the Moment Generating Function-matching method to such systems so that correlation and activity of lognormal random variables can be included with high accuracy. We compare the analytical results against realistic channel model based extensive Monte-Carlo simulation for mmWave and sub-6 GHz in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. the performance of the model is depicted in terms of mean, alpha-percentile outage spectral efficiency and Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance.	approximation;cell (microprocessor);channel (communications);decibel;emoticon;file shadowing;holism;ibm notes;interference (communication);kullback–leibler divergence;monte carlo method;multipath propagation;performance evaluation;shortest seek first;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;sun outage;usability;wireless access point	Aritra Chatterjee;Sandeep Mukherjee;Suvra Sekhar Das	2018	CoRR		wireless network;electronic engineering;fading;path loss;interference (wave propagation);log-normal distribution;spectral efficiency;communication channel;computer science;random variable	Mobile	28.029444133422473	84.0795242972192	133508

Based on the IR protocol, a novel protocol termed as fractional incremental relaying (FIR) is firstly presented in this paper to achieve higher spectral efficiency. When a packet of data needs to be transmitted by the relay node, symbols are transmitted a few at a time as needed instead of the entire packet. Then, analysis result shows that the proposed protocol makes more efficient use of channel freedom degrees than the traditional IR protocol does. Finally, numerical results under independent Rayleigh fading demonstrate the advantage of the proposed FIR protocol.	channel capacity;communications protocol;finite impulse response;forward error correction;network packet;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;relay;simulation;spectral efficiency	Hang Long;Kan Zheng;Wenbo Wang;Fangxiang Wang	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378702	communications protocol;electronic engineering;strontium;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;finite impulse response;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;spectral efficiency;computer network	Embedded	34.55994112937709	77.23273383500567	133512

In particular, AN in the training phase is used to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), whereas AN in the data transmission phase can be used to mask the transmission of confidential messages. By considering AN-assisted training and secrecy beamforming, we first derive bounds on the achievable secrecy rate and utilize them to obtain approximate secrecy rate expressions that are asymptotically tight at high SNR. By maximizing these expressions, power allocation policies between signal and AN in both training and data transmission phases are then proposed for conventional and AN-assisted training-based schemes, respectively. We show that the optimal AN power at high SNR should be non-vanishing with respect to the total power, and that AN usage can be more effective in the training phase than in the data transmission phase when the coherence time is large. However, at low SNR, we show that AN cannot be effectively utilized due to the lack of accurate CSI, and thus, one can often do better without. Numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical claims.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;confidentiality;numerical method;signal-to-noise ratio	Ta-Yuan Liu;Shih-Chun Lin;Yao-Win Peter Hong	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2016.2620281	coherence;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	36.28235437214664	83.39655538796112	133586

This is a multiple-access relay channel aided by a buffer. We devise a protocol in which the transmission mode is selected adaptively, using the buffer at the RS in order to maximize the average system throughput. We consider the general case in which the RS and the BS can have limits on the maximal number of transmitters that can be received over the multiple access channel. In each slot, there are three type possible actions: (A1) multiple UEs transmit at rates that enable BS to decode them; (A2) multiple UEs transmit, the BS can only decode the messages partially, while the RS completely; and (A3) RS forward the side information to BS about the partially decoded messages, which are going to be combined and decoded entirely at the BS, while simultaneously a number of UEs sends new messages to the BS. The results show that the adaptive selection of direct and buffer-aided relay transmissions leads to significant average throughput gains.	broadcast relay station;code;link relation;maximal set;multi-user;reed–solomon error correction;relay channel;streaming media;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Rongkuan Liu;Petar Popovski;Gang Wang	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2594795	communications protocol;transmitter;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	33.853310218182514	76.03506661924371	133598

Both the omnidirectional-antenna-based measurement and the horn-antenna-based measurement are performed with bandwidth up to 800 MHz. The standard deviation of shadow fading ($\sigma_{SF}$) is studied and is compared with that value in standard protocol. Unlike traditional method, the $\sigma_{SF}$ is calculated with data captured in each single route in this paper. It is found that in a specific environment, the standard model obtained by traditional method overestimate the $\sigma_{SF}$ of this frequency band to a large extent both in line of sight (LOS) environment and non line of sight (NLOS) environment. In addition, the 3-Dimensional angle information is estimated with the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. The angle spread of arrival (ASA) and the angle spread of departure (ASD) are investigated and the cluster characteristics at different rotation measurement sites are analysed. It is found that dimension of parameter space that used in clustering algorithm has a great impact on the clustering result of the recognizable multipaths.	cluster analysis;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency band;software propagation;urban computing	Yu Han;Lei Tian;Xinzhuang Zhang;Pan Tang;Zhixue Hu;Jianhua Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287909	parameter space;statistics;electronic engineering;fading;standard deviation;cluster analysis;computer science;frequency band;non-line-of-sight propagation;shadow;bandwidth (signal processing)	Visualization	26.428615203412576	78.0702995797064	133618

The optimal system with full feedback has already been studied when a modulo operation is employed for the PNC. In this case, phase and power of channels of two end nodes are adjusted to maximize the minimum distance. Based on this full feedback system, we design new quantization methods for the phase and the power. From the observation of the minimum distance, we present a codebook design. Especially, for the quantization of power in the system with 16-QAM, a novel power quantization scheme is proposed to maximize the worst minimum distance. Finally, the simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme outperforms conventional limited systems with reduced complexity.	codebook;feedback;linear network coding;modulo operation;relay;simulation	Young-Tae Kim;Youngil Jeon;Kwangwon Lee;Inkyu Lee	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364342	linear network coding;quadrature amplitude modulation;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Robotics	36.81734133768949	76.42134906505757	133761

We derive Fisher- informations and Cram\''{e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) in closed-form for terminals along the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the LIS for all three Cartesian dimensions. For terminals at positions other than the CPL, closed-form expressions for the Fisher-informations and CRLBs seem out of reach, and we alternatively provide approximations (in closed-form) which are shown to be very accurate. We also show that under mild conditions, the CRLBs in general decrease quadratically in the surface-area for both the $x$ and $y$ dimensions. For the $z$-dimension (distance from the LIS), the CRLB decreases linearly in the surface-area when terminals are along the CPL. However, when terminals move away from the CPL, the CRLB is dramatically increased and then also decreases quadratically in the surface-area. We also extensively discuss the impact of different deployments (centralized and distributed) of the LIS.	approximation;cpl;cartesian closed category;centralized computing;complex quadratic polynomial;exptime;emoticon;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;fisher information;formation matrix;mutual information	Sha Hu;Fredrik Rusek;Ove Edfors	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288263	electronic engineering;cartesian coordinate system;mathematics;perpendicular;wireless;cramér–rao bound;expression (mathematics);signal-to-noise ratio;quadratic growth	Visualization	37.723367346578826	75.14264328990916	133929

One of the main advantages of FIT-based channel modelling is that channel characteristics for a specific environment can be obtained simply by drawing the environment on the software and selecting proper parameters for simulations. FIT-simulators face the same problem as the other corresponding simulators: large memory and computational capacity is required in complex environments. However, these requirements can be reduced significantly especially by using FIT with a careful planning of meshing for the simulation model and by proper selection for the critical parameters. The first aim of this paper is to depict and visualize how FIT-simulations should be conducted in complex scenarios taken into account the meshing, accuracy of simulation results, complexity, and simulation time. Further, this paper shows how density of meshing influences remarkably on the simulated channel characteristics in time domain, whereas in frequency domain sparser mesh is sufficient to obtain realistic results. Finally, the aim is to verify that FIT is valid in complex environments by comparing the Ultra Wideband (UWB) channel characteristics obtained by FIT-simulations and channel measurements.	computational electromagnetics;frequency band;refinement (computing);requirement;simulation;software propagation;switch;ultra-wideband	Mariella Särestöniemi;Tommi Tuovinen;Matti Hämäläinen;Jari H.

UWB can be conveniently deployed in the design of wireless local and personal area networks, providing advanced integrated multimedia services to nomadic users within hot-spot areas. The very large bandwidth required by the UWB signals cannot be exclusively allocated; thus, UWB band overlaps with the bands allocated to many other narrow-band systems. Therefore, the assessment of the interference caused by UWB devices on already-existing systems is of primary importance to ensure coexistence and, therefore, to guarantee acceptance of UWB technology worldwide. We study the coexistence issues between an UWB-based system and universal mobile telecommunication systems, global positioning systems, DCS1800, and fixed wireless access systems and point-to-point (PP) links terminals. UWB interference is evaluated accounting for the UWB signal model, a realistic UWB master/slave system architecture with power-controlled terminals. Furthermore, we analyze the dependence of the UWB interference from the UWB signal parameters and demonstrate through computer simulation that, in all practical cases, a UWB system can coexist with the selected victim terminals without causing any dangerous interference.	coexist (image);computer simulation;global positioning system;hot spare;interference (communication);master/slave (technology);point-to-point (telecommunications);systems architecture;ultra-wideband	Romeo Giuliano;Franco Mazzenga	2005	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2004.838843	computer simulation;electronic engineering;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	27.0066258462253	81.32510156246107	134144

We propose a communicationaware motion-planning strategy, where each node considers the information gained through both its sensing and communication when deciding on its next move. More specifically, we show how each node can predict the information gained through its communications, by online learning of link quality measures such as received Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and correlation characteristics, and combine it with the information gained through its sensing in order to build objective functions for motion planning. We show that in the presence of path loss, our proposed strategy can improve the performance drastically. We furthermore show that while uncorrelated low-SNR fading channels can ruin the overall performance, the natural randomization of uncorrelated channels can potentially help the nodes leave deep fade spots with small movements. We finally show that highly correlated deep fades, on the other hand, can degrade the performance drastically for a long period of time. We then propose a randomizing motion-planning strategy that can help the nodes leave highly correlated deep fades.	apollonian network;information gain in decision trees;kullback–leibler divergence;motion planning;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Yasamin Mostofi	2009	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-009-9335-9	cellular network;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;path loss;motion planning;kullback–leibler divergence;signal-to-noise ratio;fading	Robotics	32.873947911224704	83.72772494554434	134263

Assuming that channels suffer from Rayleigh fading and shadowing, we derive a closed-form of interference avoidance criterion based on multi-frequency RTS/CTS scheme. Simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical formulation. Results show that with the interference avoidance criterion based on the multi-frequency RTS/CTS scheme, interference can be rationally avoided. Propagation impacts on the criterion are also discussed and the analysis indicates that the required transmit power of the primary receiver is affected heavily by propagation characteristics.	carpal tunnel syndrome;cognitive radio;computer simulation;interference (communication);one-class classification;rs-232;rayleigh fading;software propagation	Tian Tian;Hisato Iwai;Hideichi Sasaoka	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CROWNCOM)		electronic engineering;telecommunications;communication	Mobile	36.2446497852705	80.66757068788323	134350

UWB technology enables the development of advanced wireless local area networks providing integrated multimedia services to nomadic users over hot-spot areas. The assessment of the possible interference caused by UWB devices on already existing narrowband and wideband systems is fundamental to ensure not conflicting coexistence and, therefore, the acceptance of UWB technology worldwide. In this paper we analyze coexistence between an indoor UWB system and an outdoor Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) system operating in the 3.5 − 5.0 GHz band. We consider a realistic UWB master/slave system architecture using pulse amplitude modulated spread spectrum signals for multiple access and we evaluate the UWB system interfering power in the FWA band accounting for the UWB power spectrum shape. Both upstream and downstream communication directions are analyzed. We show through computer simulation, that in many practical cases UWB system can coexist with FWA without causing any dangerous interference.	aggregate data;coexist (image);computer simulation;downstream (software development);hot spare;interference (communication);master/slave (technology);modulation;network architecture;polarization (waves);simple features;sleep mode;software propagation;spectral density;systems architecture;wireless local loop	Romeo Giuliano;Gianluca Guidoni;Ibrahim W.

639e0e7483f6f29fd3f0cee550fe85b672e4181a	multiuser precoding in wireless communication systems: parameter and resource optimization via large system analysis	wireless communications;multiuser precoding;random matrix theory;regularized channel inversion;phd thesis	M ULTI-user Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) technologies have become an important feature of the physical layer in modern wireless communication systems, such as in wireless LAN 802.11 and 4G networks including LTE-Advanced and mobile-WiMax, that need throughput in the order of hundreds of megabits per second or more. MU-MIMO has become an important research area, particularly for downlink or broadcast transmissions. In that scenario, one transmitter or base station (BS) with multiple antennas sends different and independent messages to each user simultaneously. The resulting multi-user interference (MUI) can limit the maximum achievable sum rate. Designing a good precoder for the users’ data symbols at the transmitter can reduce MUI. In this thesis, we focus on finding the optimal design parameters that maximize the system performance, i.e., SINR or sum rate, in multiple-antenna broadcast channels (BC) employing a particular precoding strategy, called Regularization Channel Inversion. We investigate the system performance maximization under various scenarios. In single-cell BC, different forms of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter such as perfect CSI in independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and spatially correlated as well as partial CSI with uncertainties are considered. We present the optimal strategy for the regularization parameter of the RCI precoder to adapt in those scenarios. For some cases we also study how we choose the cell-loading, defined as the ratio between the number of users and the number of transmit antennas, to maximize the system performance. Considering clustered or grouped users where each group has different path-losses, we explore the optimal power allocation across the groups that maximizes the sum rate per antenna. In two-cell BC, we investigate CSI feedback optimization for different levels of base station cooperation. iii The analysis in this work is conducted in the large system limit where the number of single-antenna users and transmit antennas tend to infinity with their ratio being fixed. The mathematical tools are based on spectral theory of random matrices that explore the eigenvalues of large dimensional random matrices. Even though the analytical results are in the asymptotic regime, we show their validity for the finite size system design through numerical simulations.	broadcast domain;channel state information;compaq lte;computer simulation;concave function;data rate units;expanded memory;expectation–maximization algorithm;gnutella2;google+;interference (communication);line search;mimo-ofdm;magic user interface;mathematical optimization;megabit;multi-user mimo;multiuser dos;nethack;numerical analysis;optimal design;quasiconvex function;randomness;regular expression;rewrite (programming);search algorithm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;system analysis;systems design;telecommunications link;the matrix;throughput;transmitter	Rusdha Muharar	2012			electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;precoding	Mobile	36.94038408155364	81.50038865872983	134598

The model is an extension and modification of an existing T-junction model in the literature. Four propagation processes are considered: line-of-sight (LOS), single bounce reflections from side walls, double bounce reflections from side walls, and single bounce reflections from the corner of the building in front of the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). Each propagation process is linked to a cluster of scatterers, with a cluster size that varies with respect to the position of the TX and RX. The relations between angle-of-arrivals and angle-of-departures of all Multipath Components (MPCs) are derived depending on the different positions of the TX and RX. For the single bounce reflections from the corner a new method is being used where the scatterers are distributed randomly in a triangular plane, based on the assumption that corners of buildings typically have different scattering objects contributing to the reflection process. A complete expression for the time-variant transfer function is then derived by super positioning all contributions, including the LOS when this is available. The final results show that our model follows a realistic measurement based path-loss model, which subsequently makes the model a suitable candidate for analyzing MIMO V2V fading channels in cross-junction scattering environments.

In order to examine the radio-propagation characteristics in the IVC system, in the first stage of our investigation, we have carried out propagation tests between two vehicles communicating in a line-of-sight (LOS) situation at fixed positions on a smooth surface paved with asphalt, which is the normal communication condition. Furthermore, the non-LOS (NLOS) situation with up to three intermediate vehicles, which can cause an obstruction, has been conducted. To construct path-loss models in NLOS cases, the uniform theory of diffraction technique was applied to the calculation of waves propagating through the intermediate vehicles. The propagation path models were derived from the measured results. In the second stage, a path-loss prediction formula was derived by statistically processing the data that had been calculated using the propagation path model. The propagation tests between the vehicles in motion confirm that the path-loss prediction formula is very useful when the communicating vehicles are moving, and it is therefore suitable for designing the cells that form the IVC.	line-of-sight (missile);robertson–seymour theorem;software propagation;uniform theory of diffraction	Atsushi Yamamoto;Koichi Ogawa;Tetsuo Horimatsu;Akihito Kato;Masayuki Fujise	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.901890	electronic engineering;strategic planning;telecommunications;wave propagation;computer science;electrical engineering;radio propagation;predictive modelling	Visualization	25.957600304676305	76.38818419661484	134894

Given imperfect CSI caused by the limited feedback and channel delay, the expression of data rate per cell is derived. Moreover, compared to the rate with perfect CSI, a rate loss upper bound is obtained. A optimal feedback bits expression are derived to minimize the rate loss caused by limited feedback and channel delay. The numerical results show that the rate loss reduces when the number of feedback bits increases and the channel delay decreases. Meanwhile, the rate loss value reaches to a fixed value when feedback bits increase gradually. On the other hand, when the channel delay increases gradually, the rate loss can be improved little by the increasing of feedback bits. Lastly, as SNR increases, the system performance with the imperfect CSI improves more slowly than that with the perfect CSI.	channel state information;data rate units;feedback;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio	Junfeng Shi;Tiankui Zhang;Yiqing Zhou;Zhimin Zeng;Zhenglei Huang	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956610	electronic engineering;quantization;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;feedback;interference;computer performance;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	39.001282650635076	84.4688629833981	134895

An SBS is allowed to transmit simultaneously with the primary base station (PBS). They propose three cooperative jamming (CJ) schemes based on the available channel state information at the base stations and the relay. The proposed CJ schemes are designed to create additional interference in the direction of eavesdroppers without creating any interference to the PU-Rx and the SU-Rx. A combined approach of beamforming and zero-forcing precoding is developed at the PBS, the SBS and the relay to cancel out jamming interference at the PU-Rx and the SU-Rx. The secrecy rate of SU-Rx is calculated with the constraint of maintaining interference temperature at the PU-Rx under a certain threshold. Compared with the direct transmission schemes that are available in the literature, the authors’ results show that the approach which combined beamforming and CJ significantly improves the secrecy rate of the cognitive interference channel.	beamforming;channel state information;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);rx microcontroller family;radio jamming;relay;smart battery system;superuser;zero-forcing precoding	Weigang Liu;Md.

One strategy is to simply engage spatial modulation in the transmissions of the relay node, whereas the other is to develop transmit diversity with spatial modulation for further benefiting from the feature of two-way relaying. Neither of the strategies requires channel state information at the transmitter and, therefore, the assumption of channel reciprocity that is commonly used in two-way relay channels can be released herein. To evaluate the performance of both proposed strategies, their capacity behaviors are analyzed and numerical comparisons are established in the metrics of achievable rate region and sum-rate. Subsequently, the first strategy, simple spatial modulation, is generalized into the two-way relaying with multi-antenna source terminals to improve the flexibility in system design and demonstrate the tractability of spatial modulation. Illustrative discussions on bit error rate not only substantiate the validity of the proposed strategies but also provide useful tools for the two-way relaying layout without the restriction of channel reciprocity.	bit error rate;channel state information;modulation;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;relay;systems design;throughput;transmitter	Yuli Yang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2572179	throughput;electronic engineering;linear network coding;information exchange;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;antenna;relay channel;statistics;computer network;modulation	Mobile	35.25671173927843	76.66291310622717	135105

acacf530076ba51e06755af85522463709b11445	downlink goodput analysis for massive mimo networks with underlaid d2d		The performance of downlink massive multiple-input- multiple-output networks with co-channel device-to- device communications is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we consider a cellular network with sufficient number of antennas at the base station and typical cell coverage, where the cell users and device-to-device transmitters are randomly distributed. In the analysis, the asymptotic signal- to-interference ratios for both downlink and device- to-device links are first obtained, which depend on the pathloss and small-scale fading of the interference channels. Since these information may not be available at the service base station or device-to-device transmitter, there exists a chance of packet outage. Therefore, we continue to derive the closed-form approximation of the average goodput, which measures the average number of information bits successfully delivered to the receiver. As a result, the system design trade-off between downlink and co-channel device-to-device communications can be investigated analytically. Moreover, the performance region in which the co- channel device-to-device communications could lead to better overall spectral efficiency can be obtained. Finally, it is shown by simulations that the analytical results matches the actual performance very well.	approximation;downtime;goodput;interference (communication);mimo;network packet;randomness;simulation;spectral efficiency;systems design;telecommunications link;transmitter	Zezhong Zhang;Zehua Zhou;Rui Wang;Yang Li	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254882	mimo;fading;computer network;telecommunications link;goodput;transmitter;computer science;base station;cellular network;spectral efficiency	Mobile	30.079350252222103	84.6879796113874	135334

In our setting, the transmitter relies on energy harvested from nature to send its messages to the receiver, and is equipped with a finite-sized battery to store its energy. Energy packets are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over time slots, and are revealed causally to the transmitter. Only the average arrival rate is known a priori. We first characterize the optimal solution for the case of Bernoulli arrivals. Then, for general i.i.d. arrivals, we first show that fixed fraction policies [1] are within a constant multiplicative gap from the optimal solution for all energy arrivals and battery sizes. We then derive a set of sufficient conditions on the utility function to guarantee that fixed fraction policies are within a constant additive gap as well from the optimal solution.	bernoulli polynomials;concave function;multi-user;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ahmed Arafa;Abdulrahman Baknina;Sennur Ulukus	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006640	mathematical optimization;economics;microeconomics;welfare economics	Metrics	32.68827906846258	85.70737768393124	135373

CTDMA combines the idea of CDMA in the code domain and TDMA in the time domain. We consider suitable resource allocation strategies with our CTDMA scheme in the code domain and the time domain jointly. Under the total transmission-power minimization criterion, we propose a near optimal approach to allocate codes and transmission time to users appropriately, while the data rate of each user is guaranteed. To reduce the computational complexity, we also give some simplified suboptimal approaches for certain types of systems, namely, the one-to-one approach for the fully loaded system and the multiple-to-one approach for the nonfully loaded systems. To check the differences between our approaches and the optimal allocation strategy, we derive a pair of lower and upper bounds on the optimal resource allocation solution. Simulation results show that major improvement can be obtained by the near optimal approach, while the suboptimal approaches only cause minor performance degradation. We also show that our approaches will all converge to the lower bound as well as the optimal allocation solution, when the system size increases.	code;computational complexity theory;converge;data rate units;elegant degradation;mathematical optimization;norm (social);one-to-one (data model);simulation;telecommunications link	Yi Huang;Tat-Ming Lok	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.897214	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;upper and lower bounds	Embedded	36.07694781832606	87.92464113647179	135602

This expression simplifies the computation of the SFC, can be used in any 3D antenna array geometry, and avoids the need to generate separate expressions for specific antenna array geometries. We corroborate the accuracy of the closed-form expression through application to 2D and 3D antenna array geometries.

In this paper, we study how to increase the rate in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) broadcast channels using only bit and power loading, without requiring additional transmit power. To solve this challenging problem, our approach is to carry out a joint design of bit loading and power allocation over all streams, and meanwhile take user and stream selection into account. Specifically, we maximize the total number of bits per symbol (rather than the Shannon capacity) over all selected streams, under a target BER constraint for each stream and a constant total transmit power constraint. To enable flexible user and stream selection as well as achieving a high total rate, we consider OSDM (orthogonal space division multiplexing) rather than BD (block diagonalization) based MU-MIMO broadcast channels. Numerical results show that our proposed joint bit and power loading with OSDM user and stream selection is effective in increasing the total transmission rate without consuming additional resources.	bit error rate;blu-ray;channel capacity;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;numerical method;shannon capacity of a graph;x.690	Jingyi Liu;Bin Wu;Pin-Han Ho;Xiang Ling	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363966	real-time computing;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	EDA	38.10902100546413	86.64243212885178	136200

Recently, the use of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MIMO-OFDM) was proposed to multiply the spectral efficiency of the fixed wireless broadband access in rural areas by the factor corresponding to the number of space division multiple access (SDMA) users. Due to the complex nature of adaptive beam-forming, inherent in the MU-MIMO, coverage prediction of a MU-MIMO system may be difficult. We propose a simple conversion method where a MU-MIMO system is replaced with a single-transmitter-single-receiver system thereby allowing the use of conventional coverage prediction tools, such as Recommendation ITU-R P. 1546 propagation model. Coverage prediction by the proposed method and actual six-user MU-MIMO-OFDM uplink performance, demonstrated in a rural area in Tasmania, Australia, at a UHF band, have been found to correspond to each other well.	access network;array data structure;frequency divider;internet access;lambda calculus;microsoft band;multiplexing;radiation pattern;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;spectral efficiency;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;test case;transmitter;wireless local loop	Hajime Suzuki	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477537	multi-user mimo;channel access method;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;multi-frequency time division multiple access;spatial multiplexing;computer network	Mobile	27.622973030844886	81.82745029049075	136404

This transmission scheme is amazingly simple and achieves a diversity order of two for any number of relays. Motivated by its simplicity, this scheme is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the distributed space time code (DSTC) structure that admit its application in the proposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that the recently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTCs from precoded coordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended Clifford algebras satisfy these conditions. It is then shown how differential encoding at the source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at the destination node. Finally, four group decodable distributed differential space time codes applicable in this new transmission scheme for power of two number of relays are also provided.	code;frequency divider;multiplexing;power of two;relay	G.

Therefore, it is important to characterize the physical properties of the DSRC channel.In this work we propose that due to the complexity, unpredictability and wide variety of road environments a statistical parametric model should be used to describe the physical channel behavior, and its parameters should be inferred from empirical data.Based on this methodological approach we construct channel gain models for two different environments: an open space and a typical highway with moderate traffic. To model the distribution of channel gain amplitude we choose the well-known two-parameter Nakagami model and estimate the distance dependency of its parameters from empirical road data. Spatial correlation of the channel strength is also estimated for a few separation distances.The results obtained show that in both environments the Nakagami average power parameter O falls off as the inverse-square of the sender-receiver separation distance up to a crossover distance of about 160m and as the inverse-fourth of the distance thereafter. The Nakagami fading parameter m lies between 1 and 4 for the open area and between 0.5 and 1 for the highway. The spatial correlation coefficients lie between 0.4 and 0.75 for the open environment, but between 0.9 and 1 for the highway. These results provide valuable input to support the design of optimal modulation, coding, diversity and protocol schemes for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.	coefficient;hoc (programming language);modulation;parametric model;vehicle-to-vehicle;whole earth 'lectronic link	Vikas Taliwal;Daniel Jiang;Heiko Mangold;Chi Chen;Raja Sengupta	2004		10.1145/1023875.1023890	vehicular ad hoc network;spatial correlation;parametric model;telecommunications;vehicular communication systems;estimation theory;physical property;computer network	ML	26.440304527723427	78.25540508314623	136967

250c87dbb9dfacda9265f56e1686d55b8afe8dbc	precise error rate analysis of wireless relay networks	bit error rate;amplify-and-forward relay;signal-to-noise ratio	A new method to analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance of two-hop multiple relay networks is presented in this paper. For this work, a flat fading channel is considered for exchanging signals between two wireless users which communicate with each other through set of bidirectional relays that operate as repeaters (amplify-and-forward). Each user adopts a relay selection scheme to choose the relay with the highest signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The proposed method aims to reduce the analysis of the twohop relay network to the BER analysis of one-hop (direct link) and this allows to improve the asymptotic BER (ABER) performance of two-hop. Thereby, the ABER would be more suitable for wide SNR range. From this ABER analysis, the exact BER (EBER) can be obtained directly and this gives a standard BER analysis for bidirectional relay networks. The analytic expressions for both ABER and EBER are derived and then confirmed by simulation results. It is found that the proposal gives low disparity calculation errors between ABER and EBER. It hence provides an accurate BER analysis for a bidirectional relay networks.	align (company);binocular disparity;bit error rate;inline linking;marginal model;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications network;test automation;x.690	Muhammad I.

During 2010 three different trials were conducted in Brazil with DRM+ system in VHF band II (popularly called FM band). These trials were defined to have a big, medium and small coverage area for big, local and community broadcasters. For this purpose, different transmission powers were used. The transmission was done with only DRM signal in low power trial. In the high and medium power trials the transmission was done in “combined mode”, that is, the FM and DRM+ signals were transmitted in adjacent channels from the same transmission site. In this paper the results of these trials are explained and compared with theoretical values.	band ii;decibel;digital rights management;fm broadcast band;fm broadcasting;radio broadcasting;transmitter;watts humphrey	Jose Maria Matias;Flavio Ferreira Lima;Rodolfo Saboia L.

However, general base stations are making no effort to use frequency effectively, and cooperation among wireless system base stations is necessary for more effective frequency use. Base stations can cooperate more efficiently if they are able to use multiple channels of many wireless systems simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an autonomous adaptive base station (AABS) that adapts to various wireless systems the way software defined radio (SDR) base stations do. The AABS can autonomously select and use the most suitable wireless system based on user traffic and AABS's hardware resources.

In the former scheme, the relay node is chosen in accordance with the CSI of the individual channels between the source nodes and the relay node. By contrast, in the latter scheme, relay node selection is performed in accordance with the CSI of the cascaded channel between the two source nodes. For both estimation schemes, the effect of the CSI estimation error on the outage probability is examined by means of the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Moreover, in contrast to previous studies, the source nodes in the TWRN are assumed to have different estimation errors. The numerical results confirm the validity of the derived expressions and show that the presence of different estimation errors at the two source nodes has a significant effect on the performance of the TWRN.	channel state information;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);relay;sun outage	Jyun-Wei Pu;Tsang-Yi Wang;Sheng-Hung Li;Chih-Peng Li;Hsueh-Jyh Li	2015	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2015.2444352	sun microsystems;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	36.69956336507465	79.0580300728873	137711

The long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) system, commercialized as the 4th generation (4G) mobile communication system, is based on the following key features: the orthogonal frequency divisionmultiplexing (OFDM), the relay, themultiple input multiple outputs (MIMO), the carrier aggregation (CA), and the coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP). In this paper, the impact of these features on the existing positioning technology specified in the LTE-A standards is systematically investigated. Moreover, two approaches are proposed to take full advantage of these features in terms of positioning technologies and the key positioning parameters, including the reference signal time difference (RSTD) in the observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) technology and user equipment receiving time subtracting transmitting time (UE Rx-Tx) in the enhanced cell identity (E-CID) technology.

The spectrum efficiency (capacity per unit bandwidth) of a LMF channel for various adaptation policies is studied. We obtain the closed-form expressions for various adaptation policies such as (i) optimal power and rate adaptation (OPRA) policy, (ii) channel inversion with fixed rate (CIFR) policy, and (iii) truncated channel inversion with fixed rate (TIFR) policy with hybrid diversity combining techniques like hybrid maximal ratio combining (MRC)-equal gain combining (EGC), hybrid EGC-MRC, and hybrid MRC-selection combining (SC) diversity. Numerical results show that the use of hybrid diversity combining techniques improves the spectrum efficiency over stand-alone diversity combining techniques.

Also, the ability to analyze and accurately predict the impact of interference via the use of an interference model is an essential way to improve the average throughput (cell edge throughput). There have been several statistical models for aggregating the interference power yielding in results for homogeneous sources, but focus lies on various multicellular scenarios such as heterogeneous networks. Finally, the analytical conditions on the system model parameters are derived and the distributions are determined, on which the statistical properties of interference power can be accurately modeled. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of interference models for various multicellular scenarios emphasizing their domains of application, advantages and disadvantages illustrated with examples. In addition, it gives insights which can facilitate system performance analysis and interference management.	approximation;downtime;interference (communication);mixture model;portable document format;statistical model;throughput;time complexity	Mike Oluwatayo Ojo;Oluwatosin Oladayo Aramide	2015	2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information and Communication Technology and its Applications (DICTAP)	10.1109/DICTAP.2015.7113170	normal distribution;probability density function;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;interference;fading;statistics	Arch	28.31744019974933	85.03880652080954	138127

In the light of this challenge, this paper investigates the throughput performance of wireless systems under channel coding over finite transport blocks (TBs) with the channel state sequence available only at the receiver. We analyze the performance of a communication scheme with feedback, namely early decoding, where for each codeblock the receiver makes a single decoding attempt at a time determined based on the available channel state information. A finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) is introduced to model the TB-based wireless system where the parameters of the model are linked to the characteristics of the underlying physical channel. The FSMC model is then used to assess the maximum achievable throughput of the early decoding strategy. Numerical results suggest that despite its low computational complexity the proposed scheme significantly reduces the coding latency to achieve rates near the channel capacity.	channel capacity;channel state information;closure (computer programming);compaq lte;computational complexity theory;markov chain;modulation;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;terabyte;throughput	Cenk Sahin;Lingjia Liu;Erik S.

The algorithm is used to synthesize the radiation pattern of the directional UCAA to reduce the bit error rate (BER), to increase received energy and channel capacity in indoor UWB communication system. Using the impulse response of multipath channel, the BER of the synthesized antenna pattern on binary antipodalpulse amplitude modulation system can be calculated. Based on topography of the antenna and the shooting and bouncing ray/image techniques, the synthesized problem can be reformulated into a multi-objective optimization problem which would be solved by the GA.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Wei Chien;Chien-Ching Chiu;Yu-Ting Cheng;Shu-Han Liao;Horng-Shiou Yen	2017	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-016-0197-8	omnidirectional antenna;antenna factor;telecommunications;antenna measurement;computer science;directional antenna;antenna noise temperature;antenna;radiation pattern;dipole antenna;wireless;antenna efficiency	EDA	28.83611170398024	81.37561791149288	138264

In an ideal channel, interference temperature (IT) which is directly proportional to the interference power can be assumed to vary spatially with the frequency of the sub channel. We propose a scheme for approximating ITs over an extended C-band (licensed and unused television band) by fitting sub channel frequencies and corresponding ITs to a regression model. Using this model, IT of a random sub channel can be calculated by the base station (BS) for further analysis of the channel interference. Our proposed model based on readings reported by sensors helps in dynamic channel selection (S-DCS) in extended C-band for assignment to unlicensed secondary users. S-DCS maximizes channel utilization and proves to be economic from energy consumption point of view. It also exhibits substantial amount of accuracy with error bound within 6.8%. Again, users are assigned empty sub channels without actually probing them, incurring minimum delay in the process. Overall channel allocation efficiency is also maximized along with fairness to individual users	cognitive radio;fairness measure;frequency band;graphics device interface;interference (communication);mobile phone;sensor;throughput	Torsha Banerjee;Chittabrata Ghosh;Dharma P.

In general, the refinement layer suffers from insufficient protection for users experiencing poor channel conditions. Although cooperative transmission can improve the reception performance via diversity combining the signals from the source node and relay node, the refinement layer may still have unacceptable performance for users with very poor signal quality. To improve the overall performance of multiresolution services, we propose protection-level-exchanging HM for multiresolution services under decode-and-forward cooperative networks. At the relay node, it exchanges the protection levels of the decoded base bits and refinement bits, and remodulates the data based on a redesigned optimal HM constellation mapping for transmission. Hence, the overall bit error rate (BER) of the refinement bits is significantly improved at the destination node. We also propose the weighted combined BER (WCB) to fairly and reasonably evaluate the overall service performance. Based on the WCB, we investigate the optimization of the constellation priority parameters used at the source node and relay node to optimize system performance. According to the simulation results, our proposed scheme achieves better performance than other existing schemes.	bit error rate;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiresolution analysis;refinement (computing);relay;simulation;x.690	Hao-Yun Huang;Yuh-Ren Tsai	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2648883	bit error rate;modulation;computer network;real-time computing;computer science;relay;diversity combining;hierarchical modulation;communication channel	Mobile	32.53181455439292	76.46298758190304	138328

First, we derive the coverage probability for a traditional cellular network consisting only of macrocells and obtain the optimum tilt angle that maximizes the overall energy efficiency (EE). Gains of up to 400% in EE were found for a scenario (approximately) equivalent to a hexagonal cell deployment with cell radius of 200 m when the optimum tilt was selected. We then proceed to model the heterogeneous network (HetNet) scenario where femtocells are also deployed in the network's area. We observe that the macrousers performance is highly sensitive to the interference emanating from the femtocell tier. In order to circumvent this issue, interference coordination employing a guard zone for the macrocell user is proposed. Subsequently, we formulate a joint optimization problem where we derive both, the radius of a guard zone protecting the macrouser and the tilt angle that maximize the EE of the network.	interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;optimization problem;software deployment	Raul Hernandez-Aquino;Syed Ali Raza Zaidi;Desmond C.

In this paper, a radio channel measurement was conducted in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth. The channel sounder with the clock synchronization was used to measure in both line-of-sight (LoS) and none- line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are recorded with an omnidirectional antenna at TX and a horizontal-rotating horn antenna fixed at the same height at RX as references. The space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm was applied to extract the channel characteristics of multipath components (MPCs) from the synthesized CIRs, and then the direct synthesized CIRs and the CIRs constructed from SAGE results were compared in terms of power delay profiles (PDPs) and power angular spread (PAS). It is found that the reconstructed results closely approximate real results. In addition, the cluster numbers and the inner-cluster root mean square (RMS) angle spreads are drawn after the clustering analysis and they cohere with the changes of the corresponding surrounding environment of the point, regardless of LoS or NLoS. The wireless channel propagation at 28 GHz is heavily dependent on the environment because the linear and reflective propagation are the main mode of transmission.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);clock synchronization;cluster analysis;expectation–maximization algorithm;line-of-sight (missile);mean squared error;modulation;multipath propagation;next-generation network;software propagation	Xiaoxing Gao;Lei Tian;Pan Tang;Tao Jiang;Baoling Liu;Jianhua Zhang	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880929	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;wireless	Mobile	26.254709355661628	77.80713722664784	138700

9d5adf07b25c7ee0949c7d8983948006f6bd59a9	transceiver design for cognitive full-duplex two-way mimo relaying system		In this paper, we present the design of optimal precoders and receive filters for a full-duplex (FD) two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying system in a cognitive radio network. The secondary user (SU) or cognitive nodes share the spectrum with the licensed primary user (PU) nodes while keeping the interference to PU nodes below a threshold. The cognitive transceivers communicate with each other with the assistance of a cognitive AF relay. The precoders for the cognitive transceivers are designed so as to maximize the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the relay while limiting the interference to the PU node below a specified threshold. Due to FD mode of operation, all the nodes suffer from self-interference (SI). We assume the available channel state information (CSI) of loopback self-interference channels at relay and transceivers to be imperfect. We design the optimal relay precoder and transceiver receive filter, for suppressing the residual SI, by minimizing the sum of mean square error (SMSE) at the cognitive transceivers with constraint on transmit power at relay. The precoders and receive filters are updated at each time slot, taking into account the cumulative interference effect from all previous time slots, which enhances the performance of the system over time. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design in terms of the achievable sum-rate.	anisotropic filtering;block cipher mode of operation;channel state information;cognition;cognitive radio;computation;duplex (telecommunications);expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);internet relay chat;iterative method;loopback;mimo;mean squared error;optimal design;performance per watt;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transceiver	Nachiket Ayir;P.

Interference may arise due to dense spatial reuse of spectrum intended to increase user data rates, or from other devices emitting radiation in the same spectrum, or from electronic circuitry within the communication platform. For a multi-antenna receiver operating in an interference-limited channel, we evaluate four diversity combining algorithms in terms of outage probability in the low-outage regime. The contributions of this paper are (1) derivation of closed-form expressions for the output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) statistics of fixed weight, maximal ratio, selection and post-detection combining; (2) comparison of the relative outage performance of these algorithms; and (3) proposed diversity combining algorithms to reduce outage probability. Our results can be applied in analyzing the outage performance and throughput capacity of both centralized and decentralized interference-limited wireless networks.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;centralized computing;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;diplexer;downtime;electronic circuit;image noise;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;maximal set;power dividers and directional couplers;requirement;statistical interference;sun outage;throughput;triune continuum paradigm	Aditya Chopra;Brian L.

Our analysis focuses on a single unlicensed frequency band, where the locations for the Wi-Fi access points and LTE eNodeBs are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. Three LTE coexistence mechanisms are investigated: 1) LTE with continuous transmission and no protocol modifications; 2) LTE with discontinuous transmission; and 3) LTE with listen-before-talk and random back-off. For each scenario, we derive the medium access probability, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio coverage probability, the density of successful transmissions (DST), and the rate coverage probability for both Wi-Fi and LTE. Compared with the baseline scenario where one Wi-Fi network coexists with an additional Wi-Fi network, our results show that Wi-Fi performance is severely degraded when LTE transmits continuously. However, LTE is able to improve the DST and rate coverage probability of Wi-Fi while maintaining acceptable data rate performance when it adopts one or more of the following coexistence features: a shorter transmission duty cycle, lower channel access priority, or more sensitive clear channel assessment thresholds.	baseline (configuration management);coexist (image);compaq lte;discontinuous transmission;duty cycle;frequency band;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;uncompressed video;wireless access point	Yingzhe Li;François Baccelli;Jeffrey G.

The asymptotic expression of end-to-end SER in high SNR regi m is derived in a closed form, which indicates that the delay effect causes the loss of both codin g gain and diversity order, while the channel estimation error merely affects the coding gain. Finally, a nalytical results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations.

e7c9c3f52cc26ab02bf1b4f969d49f414af9099f	analysis of the cell association for decoupled wireless access in a two tier network		In this paper, we analyze the association of a user terminal in a two-tier network (i.e., macrocells and millimeter wave small cells). We assumed a decoupled wireless access where a user terminal has the liberty to choose different base stations (BSs) in uplink and downlink based on the received power and the channel quality. A practical blockage model where a human body is a blockage to millimeter wave (mmW) is considered. An in-depth simulation study is done to explore the effectiveness of decoupled wireless access in a crowded environment. In addition to that, a detailed analysis on the intuitiveness and the mathematical tractability of the blockage model used is also provided. In the end, few research questions on the efficacy of decoupled wireless access are raised in this paper.	biasing;coupling (computer programming);geometric analysis;load balancing (computing);multitier architecture;next-generation network;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development;wireless access point	Zeeshan Sattar;Joao V.

The channel source-relay is assumed fixed due to the short distance, while the channels source-destination and relay-destination are affected by block flat Rayleigh fading, where channel state information is known only to respective receivers. Oblivious cooperative protocols are addressed which improve performance when the relay is present and do not degrade it when the relay is absent-and all this while the source is uninformed of the actual topology. Using the expected throughput as a performance measure, several such protocols based on decode-and-forward and quantize-and-forward are proposed for this network. It turns out that block Markov decode-and-forward (BMDF) with appropriate decoding is in fact an oblivious cooperative protocol. The optimal correlation between the transmissions of the source and the relay in decode-and-forward and the corresponding optimum performance are characterized. Finally, quantize-and-forward is considered for rates which preclude the usage of decode-and-forward, and several schemes are proposed for incorporating partial side information in the relay's quantization.	channel state information;markov chain;quantization (signal processing);rayleigh fading;relay;source;throughput	Michael Katz;Shlomo Shamai	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2009.2030521	wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;mathematics;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.67287458157399	75.38423177152167	139693

However, the main challenge is to mitigate the harmful effects of the residual Self-Interference (SI) which depends on the SI mitigation capability of the employed technique. One way to mitigate this effect is to control the transmit power of the CR node, however, this power control over the entire frame duration results in a power- throughput tradeoff. In this context, we propose a novel Two-Phase Concurrent Sensing and Transmission (2P-CST) framework in which a CR performs concurrent sensing and transmission for a certain fraction of the frame duration by employing a power control mechanism and for the remaining fraction of the frame duration, the CR only transmits with the full power. The proposed framework allows the flexibility to optimize the sensing time and the transmit power in order to maximize the achievable throughput of the FD-CR system. Our results demonstrate that the proposed 2P-CST FD transmission strategy provides better performance in terms of the achievable throughput than the conventional Periodic Sensing and Transmission (PST) and CST techniques.	cst thor;cognitive radio;computer science tripos;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);planar separator theorem;throughput;two-phase commit protocol	Shree Krishna Sharma;Tadilo Endeshaw Bogale;Long Bao Le;Symeon Chatzinotas;Xianbin Wang;Björn E.

83fbff9e2c0f914efdb919f832dfd6088c41bd2e	an algorithmic solution for computing circle intersection areas and its applications to wireless communications	wireless networks;iterative algorithms;stochastic geometry	The computation of the intersection area of a large number of circles with known centers and radii is a challenging geometric problem. Nevertheless, its resolution finds several applications in the analysis and modeling of wireless networks. Prior literature discusses up to three circles and even in this case there are many possible geometric configurations, each leading to a different involved close-form expression for the intersection area. In this paper, we derive two novel geometric results, that allow the check of the existence and the computation of the area of the intersection regions generated by more than three circles by simple algebraic manipulations of the intersection areas of a smaller number of circles. Based on these results, we construct an iterative algorithm based on a trellis structure that efficiently computes the intersection areas of an arbitrary number of circles. As an example of practical application of our results, we derive the probability that a fixed number of mobiles can be reliably allocated to a set of base stations in code division multiple access-based cellular networks.	algorithm;computation;iterative method;linear algebra;trellis quantization	Federico Librino;Marco Levorato;Michele Zorzi	2009	2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks	10.1002/wcm.2305	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;statistics;stochastic geometry	Embedded	30.97519567814268	88.10707534922462	140277

The developed antenna realizes polarization diversity as a single small-sized antenna without decreasing the 3dB main beamwidth compared with the conventional antenna by applying a newly designed beam shaping method. Furthermore, side sub-reflectors are newly installed in the radome to reduce the antenna beam gain in the direction toward the edge region neighboring the other sectors of the horizontal antenna pattern. By adopting this type of reflector, the diameter of the radome can be minimized at 0.65λ, which is slightly longer than that of the conventional antenna. Both a computer simulation and a field measurement test based on an actual cellular network were conducted for the purpose of clarifying the validity of the shaped beam antenna. In the results, the CINR at the service area by the shaped beam antenna was 1dB and 3.5dB better than that of the conventional antenna at the median and 10% of CDF, respectively. The developed antenna will be expected to contribute to the enhancement of the quality of cellular radio systems in the future.	interference (communication)	Masayuki Nakano;Hiroyasu Ishikawa;Shinichi Nomoto	2010	IEICE Transactions	10.1587/transcom.E93.B.2586	beam waveguide antenna;antenna aperture;omnidirectional antenna;antenna factor;monopole antenna;antenna rotator;random wire antenna;periscope antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;computer science;directional antenna;base station;operating system;antenna noise temperature;patch antenna;antenna;antenna blind cone;radiation pattern;coaxial antenna;dipole antenna;antenna efficiency	Arch	26.674409072535518	82.27171232863658	140519

Due to the lossy nature of the in vivo medium, achieving high data rates with reliable performance will be a challenge, especially since the in vivo antenna performance is strongly affected by near-field coupling to the lossy medium and the signals levels will be limited by specified specific absorption rate (SAR) levels. We analyzed the bit error rate (BER) of a MIMO system with one pair of antennas placed in vivo and the second pair placed inside and outside the body at various distances from the in vivo antennas. The results were compared to SISO arrangements and showed that by using MIMO in vivo, significant performance gain can be achieved, and at least two times the data rate can be supported with SAR limited transmit power levels, making it possible to achieve target data rates in the 100 Mbps.	bit error rate;data rate units;hfss;lossy compression;mimo;simulation interoperability standards organization;the 100;uncompressed video;video-in video-out;x.690	Chao He;Yang Liu;Thomas Ketterl;Gabriel E.

Downlink radio resource allocation schemes are then proposed for such system. Simulation results indicate that using the proposed scheme, we can significantly increase the sum rate compared to conventional uncoded OFDMA schemes with only a moderate increase in system complexity. It is also shown that in cases where the secondary network is unable to achieve higher rates by increasing the total power and/or interference threshold, utilizing TCM-OFDMA acts as a smart alternative.	csi-dos;computer cooling;discrete rate simulation;elegant degradation;interference (communication);modulation;telecommunications link;trellis quantization	Nader Mokari;Keivan Navaie;Hamid Saeedi	2012	2012 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2012.6249396	cognitive radio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;trellis modulation;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	36.66339704123899	85.90119514759797	140663

The feedback conveyed by each user to the base station consists of channel direction information (CDI) based on a predetermined codebook and a scalar metric with channel quality information (CQI) used to perform user scheduling. In this paper, we present a design framework for scalar feedback in MIMO broadcast channels with limited feedback. An approximation on the sum rate is provided for the proposed family of metrics, which is validated through simulations. For a given number of active users and average SNR conditions, the base station is able to update certain transmission parameters in order to maximize the sum-rate function. On the other hand, the proposed sum-rate function provides a means of simple comparison between transmission schemes and scalar feedback techniques. Particularly, the sum rate of SDMA and time division multiple access (TDMA) is compared in the following extreme regimes: large number of users, high SNR, and low SNR. Simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of various scalar feedback techniques based on the proposed design framework.	approximation;beamforming;codebook;computer simulation;feedback;mimo;propagation constant;scalar processor;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;standard database management analysis;transmitter	Ruben de Francisco;Dirk T.

We consider the general fading scenario of Nakagami-m fading with distinct m fading parameters in the source-to-relay and the relay-to-destination links. We present new analytical expressions for the statistics of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, we derive exact expressions and first order expansions for the cumulative distribution function and moment generating function of the end-to-end SNR. Based on these, we derive new closed-form expressions for the asymptotic SER under M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM).

In the proposed test bed, two USRPs are interconnected by MIMO cable and communicate with a single USRP receiver. The two transmitters are used to emulate two spatially separated OFDM transmitters by varying their relative transmit gain configurations. The starting transmission times of the two OFDM transmitters are also varied in order to model the relative delay between two DAS antenna signals due to variation in propagation delays over the feeding network. Measurement results for numerous emulated DAS configurations reveal that the difference in propagation distance between DAS antenna over the feeding network can have significant impact on BER performance even with the employment of the standardized cyclic prefix.	etsi satellite digital radio;emulator;labview;mimo;performance evaluation;propagation delay;software propagation;testbed;transmitter;universal software radio peripheral;x.690	Kareem Tarek;Tallal Elshabrawy;Mohamed Ashour;Hany F.

This is slightly different from the traditional interference channel problem which assumes that transmitters cooperate in their respective coding strategies, and that interference cancellation can be performed at the receivers. In this noncooperative setup, greedy capacity optimization by individual transmitters through various algorithms leads to simultaneous water filling fixed points where the spectrum of the transmit covariance matrix of one user water fills over the spectrum of its corresponding interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, and in our paper we study the properties of these fixed points. We show that at a simultaneous water filling point the eigenvectors of transmit covariance matrices at each receiver are aligned, and identify three regimes which correspond to simultaneous water filling that depend on the interference gains: a) complete spectral overlap, b) partial spectral overlap, and c) spectral segregation. These imply that the transmit covariance matrices will be white in regions of both overlap and segregation, but not necessarily white overall. We also consider performance as a function of interference gain and show that complete spectral overlap is a strongly suboptimal solution over a wide range of gains. Overall, our results suggest that for strong mutual interference, an effort should be made to do joint decoding over receivers since such collaboration can provide large capacity increases. For moderate interference, distributed and/or centralized conflict resolution algorithms would be most effective since more complex collaborative methods do not afford much improvement and strictly greedy methods such as water filling perform poorly, while for weak interference a laissez faire approach seems reasonable	capacity optimization;centralized computing;emoticon;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;transmitter	Otilia Popescu;Dimitrie C.

The secondary transmitter adjusts the spatial spectrum of its transmission in order to maximize its own information rate while generating acceptable interference to the primary receivers. This paper investigates the rate maximization problem of parallel sub-channel transmission for cognitive radios. The sub-channels are along the spatial directions of the projected channel matrix that nullifies the dominant directions toward the primary receiver, and the power allocation on these sub-channels follows a multi-level water-filling solution. Simulation and experimental results show that, when the number of dimensions of the projected channel matrix is appropriately chosen, this practical transmission method can reach a maximum information rate that is close to the rate of the computationally expensive optimal transmission.	cognitive radio	Liang Dong;Yanqing Liu	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-1974-x	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	37.58456295895969	86.91158338448422	141789

Specifically, a spatio-temporally correlated Rician channel is considered for a V2V scenario. We derive the capacity of NOMA-SM and a pair of analytical capacity upper bounds in closed form. A power allocation optimization scheme is formulated accordingly and the optimal solution is demonstrated to be achievable with the aid of our proposed algorithm. By investigating the bit error ratio (BER) performance of NOMA with different multiple-antenna techniques and the bandwidth efficiency of SM combined with distinct multiple access methods, NOMA and SM are shown to cooperatively improve V2V transmissions.	algorithm;bit error rate;mathematical optimization;modulation;spectral efficiency;vehicle-to-vehicle;x.690	Yingyang Chen;Li Wang;Yutong Ai;Bingli Jiao;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269083	real-time computing;bit error rate;robustness (computer science);access method;computer network;rician fading;modulation;computer science;communication channel;spectral efficiency	Mobile	35.688547476656815	80.49667107262624	141834

It promises to offer significant gain for system capacity or coverage depending on the deployment prioritization. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of relay node deployments in terms of system throughput and cell coverage area extension as compared to pico node deployments and traditional homogeneous single-hop macro cells. Relay backhaul link overhead is taken into consideration as a limiting factor in a relay deployment; nevertheless, results show that its effect on coverage extension is in most cases negligible. While the effect of relay backhaul overhead is small in coverage limited scenarios, the limitations on throughput due to relaying are evident, in particular, for 500m ISD scenarios. This study also demonstrates that both relay and pico node deployments outperform clearly traditional macro cell deployment in terms of coverage and network capacity.	backhaul (telecommunications);channel capacity;compaq lte;interference (communication);overhead (computing);pico;relay;scheduling (computing);software deployment;throughput	Abdallah Bou Saleh;Simone Redana;Jyri Hämäläinen;Bernhard Raaf	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378828	throughput;electronic engineering;limiting factor;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;lte advanced;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;computer network	Mobile	25.424509564985094	88.24973296597595	141867

We consider a scenario consisting of a primary and a secondary system. In the simplest case, each system is represented by a pair of transmitter and receiver. We assume a secrecy constraint on the transmission in the sense that the message of the primary transmitter has to be concealed from the secondary user. Both situations where the secondary transmitter is aware and unaware of the primary message are investigated and compared. Furthermore, we extend our results to the scenario where the secondary system comprises multiple users. For each case we sketch the derivation of the rates that are achievable from an information theoretic perspective. We then investigate the findings by numerical simulations. Our main result is that, in spite of the secrecy constraint, cooperation is beneficial in terms of the achievable rates. The secondary transmitter has the two contradicting tasks of helping the primary system and transmitting its own message. Our results show that both tasks can be accomplished simultaneously, improving both systems' performance. In particular, the secondary system can achieve a significant rate without decreasing the primary rate below the benchmark rate achievable without the help of the secondary transmitter. In the case of multiple secondary users, the rate region reduces, which results in a lower individual rate. However, the linear increase in sumrate counterbalances this effect.	benchmark (computing);cognitive radio;computer performance;computer simulation;confidentiality;image noise;information theory;jam;multi-user;numerical analysis;transmitter	Frederic Gabry;Nan Li;Nicolas Schrammar;Maksym A.

8566dac90378bbc9dddb5ca41254e76724f8adaf	resource allocation for downlink of 5g systems with ofdma under secrecy outage constraints		We consider a fifth generation (5G) cellular system where a base station (BS) aims at sending confidential messages to a number of mobile terminals (MTs), making sure that no information on the messages is leaked to an external eavesdropper. The system uses an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme and we aim at maximizing the weighted sum rate of the messages under constraints on the average transmit power and the secrecy outage probability. The secret messages are separately encoded over each OFDMA sub- channel. We consider a time-sharing approach where each sub- channel can be used by many MTs for different fractions of time. We obtain a convex optimization problem and we are able to establish that in the optimal solution each sub-channel is assigned to a single user for the whole time. Then, we derive a closed-form expression for the allocated power, according to a modified waterfilling algorithm.	algorithm;confidentiality;convex optimization;downtime;fifth generation computer;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;telecommunications link;time-sharing;weight function	Ahmed Benfarah;Nicola Laurenti;Stefano Tomasin	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849024	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Metrics	36.36209582843602	86.15145677019282	142126

For this setup, we propose a novel joint-noisy network-coded (J-NNC)-decode-and-forward (DF) cooperation scheme that employs NNC relaying with opportunistic DF. The proposed scheme utilizes the DF cooperation when messages from all users are successfully decoded at the relay and the NNC when the relay is unable to decode any one of the users. In the scenario when the relay decodes only a subset of users, the proposed scheme utilizes joint DF and NNC encoding. We derive the information theoretic conditions required for successful message recovery and show that the J-NNC-DF has a strictly better outage performance than the conventional DF-only, NNC-only, or DF-or-NNC schemes. For the two-user case, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage performance under Rayleigh fading while assuming access only to the local channel state information at the relay. For these expressions, let us choose the NNC quantization parameter so as to attain optimum outage performance. The simulation results validate the theoretical findings and show that the J-NNC-DF achieves a performance gain of 0.75, 1.7, and 2.1 dB compared with the DF-or-NNC, DF-only and NNC-only strategies, respectively.

On the apex of that, satellite communication industry has to keep promptness with terrestrial communication technology, which has shown strong and fast development. In this view, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology is a promising candidate. Multiple Input Multiple Outputs along with multicarrier modulation technique can be a good solution to mitigate frequency selective fading. Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) has shown robustness to multipath fading and has got the same characteristics as that of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The main advantage of Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access is that it has low Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Due to low Peak to Average Power Ratio, Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access is used in uplink for Land Mobile Satellite (LMS) systems. The link level performance of Land Mobile Satellite systems is diminished by rapid amplitude variations of the received signal due to shadowing. In this paper we have investigated, Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access performance for Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) diversity over correlated shadowed Rice Land Mobile Satellite channel, where the Line Of Sight (LOS) follows Nakagami-m distribution.	apex (geometry);carrier frequency;communications satellite;delta-sigma modulation;mimo;msat;maximal set;multipath propagation;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;telecommunications link;terrestrial television;uncompressed video	J.

a5268004488a9698ae86d85adcbc524c68c0123b	random caching in backhaul-limited multi-antenna networks: analysis and area spectrum efficiency optimization		Caching at base stations is a promising technology to satisfy the increasing capacity requirements and reduce the backhaul loads in future wireless networks. Careful design of random caching can fully exploit the file popularity and achieve good performance. However, previous works on random caching scheme usually assumed single antenna at BSs and users, which is not the case in practical multi-antenna networks. In this paper, we consider the analysis and optimization in the cache-enabled multi-antenna networks with limited backhaul. We first derive a closed-form expression and a simple tight upper bound of the successful transmission probability, using tools from stochastic geometry and a gamma approximation. Based on the analytic results, we then consider the area spectrum efficiency maximization by optimizing design parameters, which is a complicated mixed-integer optimization problem. After analyzing the optimal properties, we obtain a local optimal solution with lower complexity. To further simplify the optimization, we then solve an asymptotic optimization problem in the high user density region, using the upper bound as the objective function. Numerical simulations show that the asymptotic optimal caching scheme achieves better performance over existing caching schemes. The analysis and optimization results provide insightful design guidelines for random caching in practical networks.	approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);cache (computing);expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency	Sufeng Kuang;Nan Liu	2017	CoRR		wireless network;mathematical optimization;stochastic geometry;backhaul (telecommunications);maximization;spectral efficiency;optimization problem;base station;distributed computing;computer science;upper and lower bounds	Metrics	30.777634448405678	85.77942808802909	142841

We consider orthogonal relaying and study conventional cooperative systems where all relays participate in the relaying phase as well as opportunistic cooperative systems where only the best relay participates in the relaying phase. An expression for the approximate probability density function (PDF) of the total instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination is derived. Subsequently, expression for the asymptotic average error rate is presented. The results provided are fairly simple and general for arbitrary values of the fading severity parameters. It is shown that opportunistic relaying does not necessarily outperform the conventional approach in terms of coding gain under equal energy allocation as in the Rayleigh fading case. Simulation results verify the tightness of the proposed analytical expressions in the high SNR region.	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;cobham's thesis;coding gain;consensus dynamics;direction finding;modulation;portable document format;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Salama S.

A typical receiver is a arbitrarily located user in the room and may not necessarily be at the center and hence sees an asymmetric transmitter location process and interference at itself. We first derive the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability for a typical user. We then present a framework to model the impact of wall reflections and extend the analysis to study the performance of VLC network in the presence of wall reflections. We show that the impact of user’s location and reflections is significant on the performance of the user.		Abhishek K.

Moreover, we investigate on the beamforming capabilities of the millimetre-wave (MMW) MIMO system. For both aforementioned architectures, that is, regular MMW MIMO and MMW MIMO with beamforming, the Shanon capacity criterion is used to evaluate the performance in terms of data transmission rate. The results reveal that we have a remarkable data rate gain due to MIMO transmission and even more when this MIMO is equipped with beamforming capabilities.

We first consider the superior selective reporting (SSR) scheme proposed earlier in the literature, and derive the achievable throughput, energy consumption and energy efficiency (EE) of the SSR scheme. We propose the maximization of EE for the SSR scheme as a multiple variable-based, non-convex optimization problem and provide approximations to reduce it to a quasi-convex optimization. We highlight that the errors due to these approximations are negligible. The SSR scheme is designed to optimize the energy consumption, which enhances the EE. Alternatively, EE can be improved by increasing the achievable throughput. Towards this end, we propose a novel variation on the SSR scheme called the opportunistic SSR (OSSR) scheme, and carry out its EE analysis. We study the tradeoff between performances of the SSR and OSSR schemes – the implicit tradeoff between achievable throughput and energy consumption, and discuss the regimes where OSSR is preferred over SSR and vice-versa, in terms of the EE. Also, through an extensive numerical study, we show that both schemes outperform the conventional schemes that employ the OR and AND fusion rules, in terms of energy efficiency.	approximation;cognitive radio;convex optimization;entropy maximization;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance;profiling (computer programming);selection bias;server message block;throughput	Rajalekshmi Kishore;C.

Two methods (beam angle and beam power adaptation) are introduced to the design of OW multibeam systems to effectively mitigate the mobility based performance degradation in the presence of ambient light noise and multipath propagation. Simulation results indicate that in an angle diversity spot-diffusing system, the SNR is independent of the transmitter position and can be maximized at all receiver locations when our new methods are implemented. A multibeam power and angle adaptive system (MBPAAS) offers a significant SNR improvement of 29 dB over the traditional line strip multibeam system (LSMS) at a transmitter-receiver separation of 6 m, when both systems employ an angle diversity receiver and operate at 50 Mbit/s. This SNR improvement can be useful in transmit power reduction. Furthermore, an increase in the channel bandwidth from 647 MHz (LSMS) to 5.57 GHz can be achieved when the new MBPAAS is employed. The increase in channel bandwidth and SNR can enable the OW system to achieve higher data rates and a 2.5 Gbit/s mobile OW system was shown to be feasible.	adaptive system;algorithm;brewster's angle;elegant degradation;gigabit;megabit;multipath propagation;optical wireless;requirement;shortest path problem;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;transmitter	Fuad E.

We compare the performance of half-duplex and full-duplex modes in terms of achievable sum rate under finite Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), while utilizing a realistic, experimentally characterized residual self-interference (SI) model for full-duplex operation. In our comparisons, for considering different perspectives for radio resource exploitation, we evaluate the antenna conserved and RF chain conserved full-duplex implementations, while investigating the effect of the number of antennas, different SI cancellation levels and transmission power. Our results indicate that antenna conserved full-duplex is only slightly better than half-duplex transmission, even when SI is completely canceled. RF chain conserved full-duplex, on the other hand, can double the half-duplex performance when SI is perfectly canceled, and still significantly higher capacity over half-duplex is achieved by realistic SI cancellation. Specifically, the capacity gain of RF chain conserved full-duplex over half-duplex is highly dependent on the transmission power levels, but not dependent at all on the number of antennas. Lastly, it is also deduced that individual transmission power of nodes is also important in determining the sum rate, especially for full-duplex implementations with poor SI cancellation.	duplex (telecommunications);experiment;interference (communication);maximum power transfer theorem;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Kudret Akcapinar;Özgür Gürbüz	2015	2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)	10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231219	niobium;electronic engineering;telecommunications;gain;engineering;electrical engineering;silicon;signal-to-noise ratio;radio frequency;physics	HPC	37.61274431566674	83.7654164045722	143983

1631b45d47690f6388cb6a922e71487304119ed7	capacity analysis of orbital angular momentum wireless channels		The orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology is able to provide a new degree of freedom for wireless communication systems. The energy of OAM waves is focused within a circle region surrounding the beam axis, which makes the propagation gains inside and outside the circle region different. However, in the existing literature, the propagation gains inside and outside the circle region are assumed to be the same. Therefore, the impact of OAM waves’ spatial energy distribution on the capacity of OAM wireless communication systems has not been fully investigated. Considering the spatial energy distribution characteristics of OAM waves, in this paper, an OAM wireless channel model is proposed. Based on the proposed OAM wireless channel model, the capacity of OAM-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system is analytically derived. Simulation results indicate that the capacity of OAM-based MIMO system outperforms the capacity of conventional MIMO system when the transmission distance is larger than a specific threshold. Our results provide a basic capacity model for OAM-based MIMO communication systems.	angular momentum operator;angularjs;channel (communications);mimo;molecular orbital;object access method;optic axis of a crystal;simulation;software propagation;the circle (file system)	Liang Wang;Xiaohu Ge;Ran Zi;Cheng-Xiang Wang	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2763679	mimo;computer network;communications system;wireless;angular momentum;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	29.215239013858955	83.17538890136218	144070
fd9456e0b01b8343dd7e4fa853f7289d45d7e202	a three-dimensional time-varying channel model for 5g indoor dual-mobility channels		This paper presents a time-varying channel model in three- dimensional environments for the 5G wireless system. Using the continuous-time Markov chain, the proposed model captures the statistical movement of the transceiver, the transition between line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation scenarios, and the dynamic variation of propagation parameters. Moreover, a novel frequency- dependent factor that describes the dynamic path behavior is described in this model. According to the simulation results based on ray-tracing techniques and field measurements from the literature, the proposed time- varying channel model is validated at 5.2, 10, and 60 GHz. Furthermore, under realistic 5G device-to-device communication scenario, the simulation results and time- varying channel characteristics are highlighted, including the number of paths, path gain, delay spread, delay variation, Rician K-factor, and coherence bandwidth.	channel (communications);channel state information;frequency band;high-level programming language;k-factor (cisco);line-of-sight (missile);markov chain;microwave;propagation constant;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;software propagation;transceiver	Shuai Nie;Chong Han;Ian F.

The focus is on applying this framework to the single-link problem with an energy harvesting transmitter and an energy harvesting receiver. For the general utility maximization problem, it is shown that if the utility of a network can be expressed instantaneously as a function of the powers of the nodes, then the maximum utility achieving power policy for each node can be found using a water-filling approach for each user. This is achieved by expressing the general utility maximization problem as a pair of nested problems focusing on energy efficiency and adapting to energy harvests separately. The framework extends the previous results on offline optimization of energy harvesting transmitters to networks with all energy harvesting nodes including receivers and relays as well as any network utility, provided that the achieved utility is instantaneous and additive in time. The implications of the energy efficiency problem on the energy harvesting problem are demonstrated over an energy harvesting transmitter-receiver pair, and simulation results are presented to exhibit the performance of the optimal policy along with some alternatives for a range of storage capacities.	coupling (computer programming);entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;network packet;network topology;network utility;numerical analysis;online and offline;optimization problem;relay;simulation;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Kaya Tutuncuoglu;Aylin Yener	2012	2012 Information Theory and Applications Workshop	10.1109/ITA.2012.6181795	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	33.44827227809962	85.97986510008577	144362

On the other hand, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system becomes a hot topic for it can achieve significant increases in overall system performance. This paper gives a detailed analysis of downlink performance of MIMO relaying networks, in which different channel models and classic MIMO cellular system model with fixed relay are considered. Our results in single cell scenario show that when meeting effective relay system efficiency of 100%, the required relay SNR gain of 2-antenna system can be reduced to less than half of that with only one transceiver antenna. We also observe that MIMO is more tolerant to interference compared with the one-transceiver antenna system. After that, multi-hop architecture is researched and statistics figures out the tolerable number of hops which is supported in wireless communication with a view to real application. In addition, multi-cell scenario is also studied. Statistics results show that there is more 8 dB average spectral efficiency gain in a two-hop fixed relay 4 × 4 MIMO system than that in a SISO system. These results present significant indications in deployment and optimization of relay-based MIMO networks.	algorithm;heuristic;inline linking;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transceiver	Ping Wang;Lijun Zu;Fuqiang Liu;Jing Han;Qing Ai;Ngoc Van Nguyen;Yiling Wang	2012	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-011-0404-6	3g mimo;flow network;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;control theory;relay channel;spatial multiplexing	Mobile	36.531032857275314	81.37678132414112	144367

This article introduces planning methodologies that allow to minimize interference overhead while maintaining the established network coverage. Our main contribution is the first practicable approach for comparing interference to lower bounds and benchmarks.

a215c9af2b2f372ff692bbdeabebe788a8afd5b3	directional reference signal design for 5g millimeter wave cellular systems		Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands offer a new frontier for cellular wireless systems to enable multigigabit communication. However, the availability and reliability of mmWave links are significantly limited due to its propagation characteristics. To mitigate the impact of such links and provide uninterrupted network services, the study of changing link condition is important. This paper proposes a reference signal (RS) transmission scheme for a mmWave cellular system using highly directional antenna beams. The aim of RS is to estimate the channel condition, which can be used for various purposes, e.g., initial access, beam alignment, and channel state information measurement. In particular, the objective of our proposed scheme is to enable efficient RS transmission in terms of angular coverage while ensuring a fair number of RS reception at all UEs within cell coverage. In addition, we provide a framework for studying the tradeoff between RS transmission overhead and RS measurement accuracy. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that the proposed scheme achieves higher efficiency, especially in a small-cell scenario with smaller number of UE presence.	angularjs;channel state information;frequency band;overhead (computing);reed–solomon error correction;simulation;software propagation	Chung-Wei Weng;Biswa P.

Under long term power constraints, the optimal power control strategies of each player for both maxmin and minimax problems are obtained. Numerical results demonstrate a sharp difference between the resulting outage probabilities of the minimax and maxmin solutions, which thus implies the non-existence of Nash equilibria.	downtime;expectation–maximization algorithm;loss function;minimax;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;radio jamming;transmitter	George T.

It is found that a Rayleigh distribution is a reasonable approximation assuming all multipath components below a -10 dB threshold with respect to the peak power path are neglected. The number of arrival paths in a small time interval (used to define a bin in a RAKE receiver) is found to follow an exponential distribution and the corresponding parameters are given for different time bin sizes. It is pointed that when the bin size (equivalent to the time resolution of the receiver) is greater than 2 ns, the possibility of more than one path arriving in a particular bin is greater than 50%. These are important considerations in both receiver design and MIMO channel models.

246cecc2d5a2bd90dc73caaca7a67a828a7e3c6c	optimizing joint data and power transfer in energy harvesting multiuser wireless networks		Energy harvesting emerges as a potential solution for prolonging the lifetime of the energy-constrained mobile wireless devices. In this paper, we focus on radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting for multiuser multicarrier mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we propose joint data and energy transfer optimization frameworks for powering mobile wireless devices through RF energy harvesting. We introduce a power utility that captures the power consumption cost at the base station (BS) and the used power from the users’ batteries, and determine optimal power resource allocations that meet data rate requirements of downlink and uplink communications. Two types of harvesting capabilities are considered at each user: harvesting only from dedicated RF signals and hybrid harvesting from both dedicated and ambient RF signals. The developed frameworks increase the end users’ battery lifetime at the cost of a slight increase in the BS power consumption. Several evaluation studies are conducted in order to validate our proposed frameworks.	data rate units;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multi-user;optimizing compiler;radio frequency;requirement;telecommunications link	Bassem Khalfi;Bechir Hamdaoui;Mahdi Ben Ghorbel;Mohsen Guizani;Xi Zhang;Nizar Zorba	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2718561	wireless network;wireless sensor network;radio frequency;computer network;electronic engineering;wireless;computer science;energy harvesting;telecommunications link;base station;resource allocation	Mobile	31.42485495033938	86.98908217308175	144734
d1f0d4dd8e375935d2862351efe8dcf8156fa7f9	on bit error probability and power optimization in multihop millimeter wave relay systems		5G networks are expected to provide gigabit data rate to users via the millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication technology. One of the major problems faced by mmWaves is that they cannot penetrate buildings. In this paper, we utilize multihop relaying to overcome the signal blockage problem in an mmWave band. The multihop relay network comprises a source device, several relay devices, and a destination device and uses device-to-device communication. Relay devices redirect the source signal to avoid the obstacles existing in the propagation environment. Each device amplifies and forwards the signal to the next device, such that a multihop link ensures the connectivity between the source device and the destination device. We consider that the relay devices and the destination device are affected by external interference and investigate the bit error probability (BEP) of this multihop mmWave system. Note that the study of the BEP allows quantifying the quality of communication and identifying the impact of different parameters on the system reliability. In this way, the system parameters, such as the powers allocated to different devices, can be tuned to maximize the link reliability. We derive exact expressions for the BEP of  $M$ -ary quadrature amplitude modulation and  $M$ -ary phase-shift keying in terms of multivariate Meijer’s G-function. Due to the complicated expression of the exact BEP, a tight lower bound expression for the BEP is derived using a novel Mellin-approach. Moreover, an asymptotic expression for the BEP at high SIR regime is derived and used to determine the diversity and the coding gain of the system. In addition, we optimize the power allocation at different devices subject to a sum power constraint such that the BEP is minimized. Our analysis reveals that optimal power allocation allows achieving more than 3-dB gain compared with the equal power allocation. This paper can serve as a framework for designing and optimizing mmWave multihop relaying systems to ensure link reliability.

This scheme provides situational awareness to each communication subscriber by considering channel variations (predicted offline and estimated in real time from relay signals), data traffic and energy consumption (subject to energy constraints for battery-operated units). The optimal decision on when and at what rate to transmit is made individually by each subscriber to maximize the expected throughput. Both cases of uplink communications (from subscriber to the relay) and relay communications (from a subscriber to the relay and back to another subscriber) are considered. For a given airborne relay orbit/trajectory, a high fidelity channel model is built (using real terrain information) to predict future channel conditions. These predicted channels are combined with instantaneous channel estimation from received signals to calculate signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and link rate (using analytical waveform models). By using different relay orbits, the optimal transmission decision is compared with SNR threshold-based and channel-independent random transmission schemes, and significant performance gains are demonstrated in terms of sustained data rates for communication subscribers.	airborne ranger;benchmark (computing);channel (communications);channel state information;online and offline;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;throughput;waveform	Yalin Evren Sagduyu;Yi Shi;Satya Prakash Ponnaluri;Sohraab Soltani;Jason H.

Nodes in a multi-hop WSN need to transmit their own information and to relay each other's information to a base station (BS), and there are usually multiple available paths between a node and the BS. The optimum MHTS derived in this paper answers three questions: 1) how should a node divide its limited energy between the transmission of the self-information and the relay-information? 2) whether a single path or a combination of multiple paths should be used to route the information from a node to the BS? and 3) if multi-path routing is used, how should a single data stream be divided among the multiple paths? The answers to these questions are obtained by minimizing the energy per bit, or equivalently, by maximizing the amount of information delivered to the BS under certain energy constraints. Two different scheduling strategies are considered, the fair equal information strategy that requires all the nodes deliver the same amount of information to the BS, and the unfair maximum information strategy that maximizes the total amount of information delivered to the BS. The optimum MHTS for these two strategies are derived, with either convex optimization or analytical expressions, under a per node energy constraint and a total energy constraint, respectively.	binary prefix;convex optimization;eb/n0;mathematical optimization;multipath routing;relay;scheduling (computing);self-information	Jingxian Wu;Yahong Rosa Zheng	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364354	mathematical optimization;convex optimization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	33.52892409386691	87.06953015637751	144892

The results we show in the paper have been achieved by means of an integrated approach taking both the system and link level aspects into account. Since the accuracy of the simulation results depends strongly on the mobility model considered, we propose a methodology to assign a given class of mobility to the cells. Finally, to validate the simulation tool we have compared the results with those obtained in a realistic network The results show that the agreement between simulation and the measured values is very good.	simulation	Luca Zuliani;Alberto Zanella;Alessandro Marazzi;Roberto Moretti;Ettore Agrati;Roberto Verdone;Oreste Andrisano	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

In our design, the relaying UE has own traffic to transmit and receive to/from the cellular base station (BS) and can operate either in amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) modes and can make use of either digital or analogue (PHY layer) network coding. In this rather general setting, we propose mode selection, resource allocation and power control schemes and study their performance by means of system simulations. We find that the performance of the DF scheme with network coding is superior both to the traditional cellular and the AF based relaying schemes, including AF with two-slot or three-slot PHY layer network coding.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;direction finding;fairness measure;heuristic (computer science);linear network coding;memory management;multiplexing;phy (chip);performance per watt;relay;simulation	Andrea Abrardo;Gábor Fodor;Besmir Tola	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227122	electronic engineering;linear network coding;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	27.887575330125205	88.39332129689657	145156

In a mobile network scenario, this issue becomes more challenging than that associated with the traditional case (i.e., stationary scenario), since in addition to the temporal PU activity, the spatial effects due to the relative mobility between the PUs and CUs have to be also taken into account. In fact, the mobility can deeply influence the percentage of discovered spectral opportunities (that is, the spectrum holes that the CUs can exploit) and also affect the transmission throughput achievable by the CU. To account for the PU temporal activity as well as the mobility effects, optimization is performed jointly in temporal and spatial domains, namely, by considering the impact of sensing accuracy on the actual transmission throughput achievable by a CU. More specifically, a theoretical analysis is carried out for an arbitrary network mobility model to prove the existence of a single optimal sensing time that maximizes the mobility-aware sensing-enabled throughput achievable by a CU. Then, the theoretical analysis is validated through extensive simulations carried out by considering two widely adopted mobility models. The theoretical analysis together with the numerical analysis provide the guidelines for the spectrum sensing design, by showing how the optimal sensing time depends on the parameters characterizing the adopted mobility model, the PU temporal activity, and radio environments.	cuda;catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;convex function;exptime;emoticon;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;one-class classification;optimal design;pf (firewall);parameter (computer programming);proxy mobile ipv6;simulation;stationary process;throughput;tip (unix utility);transmitter	Francesco Marino;Luigi Paura;Roberto Savoia	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2505087	throughput;cognitive radio;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;interference;electromagnetic spectrum;measurement	Mobile	29.66480827292867	85.49675700224843	145874

In addition we investigate the impact of channel-state information errors and low-complexity implementations on the performance of Vectoring. We find that Vectoring yields large energy savings in terms of line-driver power consumption even under high channel estimation errors.	channel state information;computation;digital subscriber line;interference (communication);line driver;local loop;multi-user;multistage interconnection networks;network topology	Giuseppe Marrocco;Martin Wolkerstorfer;Tomas Nordström;Driton Statovci	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134369	real-time computing;digital subscriber line;telecommunications;computer science	Vision	37.69673595660794	86.28781309361416	146064

Adopting the minimum mean squared error as optimality criterion, the optimal frequency-domain linear equalization (LE) and decision-feedback equalization (DFE) receivers are derived and corresponding objective functions for relay BF matrix optimization are specified. For a sum relay power constraint, we obtain the structure of the optimal relay BF matrices in closed form. While the structure of the optimal relay BF matrices is identical for LE and DFE as well as for an idealized matched filter receiver, the solution of the remaining power allocation problem depends on the adopted receiver. The power allocation problem is shown to be convex for all considered receivers and an efficient numerical algorithm for finding the optimal power allocation is provided. Furthermore, to reduce complexity, two suboptimal power allocation schemes assigning identical powers to all relays and/or frequencies are proposed and shown to lead to only a small loss in performance and a remarkable robustness against imperfect channel state information.	adobe framemaker;algorithm;beamforming;brainfuck;carrier frequency;channel state information;convex function;cooperative mimo;matched filter;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;opa;optimality criterion;optimization problem;relay;rewrite (programming);semidefinite programming;trellis quantization	Peiran Wu;Robert Schober	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.032712.111437	telecommunications;computer science;resource management;control theory;mathematics;matched filter;statistics	Mobile	38.025946653205565	88.21711148977393	146143

We derive an approximate expression for the FEP in the presence of channel estimation error and use this expression for minimizing the FEP in allocating the transmission energy.

It is difficult to ensure the connectivity of the secondary network. However, since there may exist multiple heterogeneous secondary networks with different radio access technologies, such secondary networks may be treated as one secondary network via proper cooperation, to improve connectivity. In this paper, we investigate the connectivity of such a cooperative secondary network from a percolation-based perspective, in which each secondary network's user may have other secondary networks' users acting as relays. The connectivity of this cooperative secondary network is characterized in terms of percolation threshold, from which the benefit of cooperation is justified. For example, while a noncooperative secondary network does not percolate, percolation may occur in the cooperative secondary network; or when a noncooperative secondary network percolates, less power would be required to sustain the same level of connectivity in the cooperative secondary network.	cognitive radio;degree distribution;interference (communication);percolation theory;percolation threshold;relay;superuser	Weng-Chon Ao;Shin-Ming Cheng;Kwang-Cheng Chen	2012	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2012.120204	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	28.8625276013684	87.18409409608212	146752
67b174734fd9ea897a2b34c2d495e73e67f2cbfe	a novel spectrum sensing scheme with sensing time optimization for energy-efficient crsns		The cognitive radio technology enables secondary users (SUs) to occupy licensed bands when primary users (PUs) are not occupy them. Spectrum sensing is a key technology for SUs to detect PUs, and the sensing time is a critical parameter for spectrum sensing performance. Optimum sensing time tradeoffs between the spectrum sensing performance and the secondary throughput. This paper proposes a novel spectrum sensing scheme that performs spectrum sensing for either one period or two periods based on the previous sensing result. Due to the energy constraint in cognitive radio sensor networks, the energy efficiency is maximized by optimizing spectrum sensing time. In order to seek the optimal sensing time, the objective function is proven to be a concave function and the Golden Section Search method is employed. Our simulation study verifies that the proposed scheme improves the network energy efficiency, especially when PUs are more active.

A secure relay selection strategy is proposed for a wireless network, where multiple source nodes send messages to their destination nodes via several relay nodes, which have different processing and transmission capabilities as well as security properties. The relay selection utilizes a learning-based algorithm for the source nodes to reach their best responses in the Chinese restaurant game. In particular, the relay selection takes into account the negative externality of relay sharing among the source nodes, which learn the capabilities and security properties of relay nodes according to the current signals and the signal history. Simulation results show that this strategy improves the user utility and the overall security performance in wireless networks. In addition, the relay strategy is robust against the signal errors and deviations of some user from the desired actions.	algorithm;relay;simulation	Caidan Zhao;Liang Xiao;Shan Kang;Guiquan Chen;Yunzhou Li;Lianfen Huang	2013	EURASIP J.

9e44686c647b31665a822dedfb5d51c51f4d21ce	5g uniform linear arrays with beamforming and spatial multiplexing at 28, 37, 64, and 71 ghz for outdoor urban communication: a two-level approach		Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing and beamforming are regarded as key technology enablers for the fifth-generation (5G) millimeter wave (mmWave) mobile radio services. Spatial multiplexing requires sufficiently separated and incoherent antenna array elements, while in the case of beamforming, the antenna array elements need to be coherent and closely spaced. Extensive 28-, 60-, and 73-GHz ultra-wideband propagation measurements in cities of New York City and Austin have indicated formation of two or more spatial lobes for the angles-of-departure and angles-of-arrival even for line-of-sight (LOS) transmission, which is an advantageous feature of mmWave channels, indicating that the transmitting and receiving array antenna elements can be co-located, thus enabling a single architecture for both spatial multiplexing and beamforming. In this paper, a two-level beamforming architecture for uniform linear arrays is proposed that leverages the formation of these spatial lobes. The antenna array is composed of sub-arrays, and the impact of sub-array spacing on the spectral efficiency is investigated through simulations using a channel simulator named NYUSIM developed based on extensive measured data at mmWave frequencies. Simulation results indicate spectral efficiencies of 18.5–28.1 bits/s/Hz with a sub-array spacing of 16 wavelengths for an outdoor mmWave urban LOS channel. The spectral efficiencies obtained are for single-user (SU) MIMO transmission at the recently allocated 5G carrier frequencies in July 2016. The method and results in this paper are useful for designing antenna array architectures for 5G wireless systems.	beamforming;carrier wave;coherence (physics);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;multi-user;simulation;software propagation;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Jaswinder Lota;Shu Sun;Theodore S.

In this paper, we will particularly focus on the mixed deployment of macro and pico cells. Co-channel deployment is typically assumed for heterogenous network to make the best use of spectrum resource; therefore, a critical issue for heterogenous network is co-channel interference between macro and pico cells, which, if not properly addressed, may significantly degrade the performance of heterogenous network. Furthermore, other deployment options, e.g., the number and the positions of pi co nodes will also affect system performance greatly. In this paper, we will carry out extensive simulation campaigns to evaluate the downlink and uplink performance of co-channel macro-pico heterogeneous network. Results show that huge performance benefit can be obtained if heterogenous network is well designed and parameterized.	compaq lte;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;pico;relay;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link	Na Lu;Xuetian Zhu;Zheng Jiang;X J David Lu;Fengyi Yang;Qi Bi	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554622	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.20637173478905	88.48340716209458	147205

When a BS operates with time division duplex mode (TDD), synchronization of the transmission time at the BS is important to avoid inter-slot interference with adjacent BSs. Because femto BSs are generally located indoor, they may not receive the global positioning system (GPS) signal which is used to synchronize the wireless cellular network. We propose a multi-hop based network synchronization scheme for femtocell systems. In the femtocell system, synchronization can be achieved by aligning its frame start point with the neighbor cell's preamble signal hop-by-hop. We evaluate the performance of the multi-hop synchronization and compare it to the single-hop synchronization.	algorithm;autonomous robot;cable internet access;digital subscriber line;duplex (telecommunications);global positioning system;hop-by-hop transport;interference (communication);simulation;synchronization (computer science);test-driven development	Jangho Yoon;Jaeki Lee;Hwang Soo Lee	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449937	spectrum;synchronization;mobile telephony;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;base station;interference;spread spectrum;femtocell;computer network	Embedded	25.313767746341714	86.67527359213283	147419

However, the throughput achieved by cognitive radios is limited by the interference constraint imposing on the SU. Multiple input single output antenna techniques and antenna selection (AS) techniques are exploited to combat the interference constraint and improve the achievable average throughput of the SU. The optimal power allocation strategy is proposed to maximise the achievable average throughput. Performance analyses for the achievable average throughputs are performed under the maximum channel gain AS strategy, the minimum interference channel gain AS strategy and the ratio AS strategy. It is proved that the optimal transmitted AS strategy is the ratio AS strategy when the optimal power allocation strategy is used. The optimal sensing parameters are designed to further improve the maximum average throughput. Extensive simulation results are conducted to verify this analysis.	cognitive radio	Fuhui Zhou;Yuquan Li;Jiangbo Si;Boyang Liu;Haiyan Huang	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0939	mathematical optimization;telecommunications	HCI	34.59237248373179	86.78640602379191	147910

Practical vehicular LED headlamp and street lamp that consider the lighting regulation for transportation are used to design the ITS scenarios based on VLC. We modeled two usage scenarios, crossroad and metropolitan street, using the CATIA V5 tool. Measurements for the VLC channel delay profile evaluation were then gathered by using a ray-tracing scheme employing commercial LightTools software under the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication links. From the obtained channel impulse responses from both scenarios, we derived the VLC channel delay profiles. From them, we found that the common property of the delay profile was composed of dominant multiple line of sight (LOS) links and a less number of non-LOS delay taps. However, the channel delay profile for the V2I link and metropolitan scenario show more dispersive channel characteristics due to the reflection and diffusion of the visible light.	catia;channel (communications);dispersive partial differential equation;ray tracing (graphics);vlc media player;vehicle-to-vehicle	SeokJu Lee;Jae Kyun Kwon;Sung-Yoon Jung;Young-Hoon Kwon	2012	EURASIP J.

To overcome this limitation, it has been proposed that the RRHs make local feedback decisions without waiting to be notified about the decoding o utc me at the BBU by relying only on estimated channel state information. This letter analyses throughput and probability of error of this solution for the three standard HARQ modes of Type-I, Chase C ombining and Incremental Redundancy over a MIMO link with coding blocks (packets) of arbitrary fin ite length. Unlike the existing literature, the analysis allows the investigation of the impact of syste m parameters such as HARQ protocol type, blocklength and number of antennas on the performance loss e ntailed by local RRH decisions.

Exact closed-form expressions for outage probability and average symbol error rate (SER) are first presented. To provide more insights, their closed-form asymptotic expressions are then obtained. It is shown that the presence of channel estimation error causes outage probability and average SER maintain a fixed level even when a noiseless channel is adopted. These results are applied further to study the optimal power allocation problem for each node. From the perspective of service quality, rather than minimise the outage probability as much as possible, the goal is to use the minimum energy consumed to satisfy the traffic requirements and thereby conserve the energy resource. Furthermore, based on the optimal solutions to power allocation, the optimal relay location is investigated, which indicates that the system has higher energy efficiency with the relay located around the middle point of the two end nodes for any asymmetric traffic requirement. The simulation results verify that the derived outage probability and average SER expressions are accurate and highlight the effect of power allocation under various traffic requirements and channel estimation errors.	channel state information;downtime;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;relay;requirement;simulation;sun outage	Chensi Zhang;Jianhua Ge;Jing Li;Xiaoye Shi	2012	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2012.0032	telecommunications;efficient energy use;relay channel;service quality	Metrics	32.262751444203566	84.63681446455061	148445

With aid of order statistics, new unified expressions of moments of the SNR are derived in closed-form for three SP cases, i.e., ordered subchannel pairing (OSP), reversely ordered subchannel pairing (ROSP) and non-subchannel pairing (NSP). More specifically, we obtain moments of the SNR in a decode-and-forward (DF) relay system for three power allocation schemes: uniform power distribution, water-filling power assignment and power adaptation with truncated channel inversion policy. Due to mathematical tractability, we only cope with SNR moments in an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system for uniform power allocation scheme.

The approach is based on CIR measurements taken at the same place where the signal is transmitted (generated), commonly known as self-to-self CIR. Another novelty is the receiver antenna design which consists of eight sectorized antennas with 45° aperture in the horizontal plane, whose total coverage corresponds to the isotropic one. The dimensions of a rectangular room are reconstructed directly from radio impulse responses by extracting the information regarding features like round trip time, received signal strength and reverberation time. Using radar approach the estimation of walls and corners positions are derived. Additionally, the analysis of the absorption coefficient of the test environment is conducted and a typical coefficient for office room with furniture is proposed. Its accuracy is confirmed through the results of volume estimation. Tests using measured data were performed, and the simulation results confirm the feasibility of the approach.	coefficient;committed information rate;deployment environment;duplex (telecommunications);radar;simulation;transceiver	Igor Arambasic;Francisco Javier Casajús-Quirós;Ivana Raos	2012	2012 5th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing	10.1109/ISCCSP.2012.6217844	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Embedded	25.50272040776129	77.53540468326604	148722

Wireless hotspots also better to be enhanced to support both these services. Simultaneous subcarrier multiplexed transmission of both WLAN and cellular radio signals over a single radio-over-fiber (ROF) link is possible for hotspot enhancement. However, link design in this multi-system scenario is a complex task. There are number of quality measures such as signal to noise, distortion and interference ratios involved both in the optical link and in the air interface. These are functions of several parameters such as the fiber length, system bandwidth, modulation depth, radio cell size and relative RF power. The scenario is quite challenging when two RF systems are involved.

The design of such aerial networks is however different compared to cellular 2D networks, as antennas from the drones are looking down, and the channel model becomes height-dependent. In this paper, we study the effect of antenna patterns and height-dependent shadowing. We consider a random network topology to capture the effect of dynamic changes of the flying base stations. First we characterize the aggregate interference imposed by the co-channel neighboring drones. Then we derive the link coverage probability between a ground user and its associated drone base station. The result is used to obtain the optimum system parameters in terms of drones antenna beamwidth, density and altitude. We also derive the average LoS probability of the associated drone and show that it is a good approximation and simplification of the coverage probability in low altitudes up to 500 m according to the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).	aerial photography;aggregate data;approximation;channel (communications);expectation–maximization algorithm;file shadowing;interference (communication);level of detail;network topology;random graph;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Mohammad Mahdi Azari;Yuri Murillo;Osama Amin;Fernando Rosas;Mohamed-Slim Alouini;Sofie Pollin	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292753	real-time computing;wireless;computer science;coverage probability;poisson distribution;beamwidth;drone;random graph;communication channel;base station	Mobile	28.187182753569612	84.74696691213323	149027

The capability value is adaptable and is a function of the bandwidth efficiency, the data rate, the energy-per-bit to noise spectral density power ratio and reflects how effectively the node can receive, process and transmit data. To evaluate the capability expression a generalized connectivity metric is used which integrates the node capability values along with their connections scaled by the length of the routes (including their directionality) in order to measure the maximum information exchange rate (characteristic tempo) of the network. Simulation results are shown for a prototype four-node dynamic scenario to numerically evaluate the node capability values and the resulting network characteristic tempo.	data rate units;information exchange;information flow (information theory);noise spectral density;numerical analysis;prototype;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications network	Marcelo Magalhaes;Terry E.

As a desirable side effect, high-gain antennas offer interference isolation, providing an opportunity to incorporate self-backhauling, i.e., BSs backhauling among themselves in a mesh architecture without significant loss in the throughput, to enable the requisite large BS densities. The use of directional antennas and resource sharing between access and backhaul links leads to coverage and rate trends that significantly differ from conventional UHF cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a general and tractable mmWave cellular model capturing these key trends and characterize the associated rate distribution. The developed model and analysis are validated using actual building locations from dense urban settings and empirically derived path loss models. The analysis shows that, in sharp contrast to the interference-limited nature of UHF cellular networks, the spectral efficiency of mmWave networks (besides the total rate) also increases with the BS density, particularly at the cell edge. Increasing the system bandwidth does not significantly influence the cell edge rate, although it boosts the median and peak rates. With self-backhauling, different combinations of the wired backhaul fraction (i.e., the fraction of BSs with a wired connection) and the BS density are shown to guarantee the same median rate (QoS).	backhaul (telecommunications);cellular model;cobham's thesis;interference (communication);serial experiments lain;spectral efficiency;throughput;ultra high frequency	Sarabjot Singh;Mandar N.

Specifically, in the proposed EB-aided EH systems, EH nodes could borrow energy from the power grid, and is requested to return the borrowed energy back with additional energy interest. A joint optimization of both EB policy and power scheduling for maximizing the system throughput is formulated, and the numerical solutions are developed. Simulation results, which are exemplified with real solar data records, show that the proposed EB-aided EH system provides considerable throughput gain compared with conventional EH systems while achieving extra energy interest for the power grid.	computer-aided design;eb-eye;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;mathematical optimization;network packet;numerical analysis;power supply;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Zhaojie Sun;Lilin Dan;Yue Xiao;Ping Yang;Shaoqian Li	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2586041	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	31.376533192639133	86.35580139696452	149749
074b9ac82582768ba176e08ba0322c516f493f18	achieving full secrecy rate with energy-efficient transmission control		Due to the dynamic arrival of data packets and time-varying channel states, secure transmission opportunities will be wasted when there is no confidential message to transmit, and data packet transmission can be delayed while waiting for the next available secure transmission opportunity. In order to seize every precious secure transmission opportunity and reduce the data packet waiting time, we propose a secure transmission protocol in which the under-utilized secure transmission opportunities can be exploited to transmit key packets, and these key packets will encrypt the confidential messages in the subsequent transmissions. Following the above-mentioned principle, we first apply this protocol to a single-input single-output network, and optimally allocate the secure transmission opportunities for the key and data transmissions, such that the secrecy rate is maximized under the constraints of the minimum energy efficiency and queue stability requirements. In addition, the packet delay for the proposed protocol is investigated using a generating function approach and a closed-form expression of the packet delay is derived. Then, we extend our work to the multiple-input single-output network and utilize the key queue as well as the artificial noise to protect the confidential messages. Similarly, we also optimally allocate the transmission opportunities for the key and data transmissions to maximize the secrecy rate and study the data packet delay performance. Since all secrecy transmission opportunities are utilized in the proposed protocol, the full secrecy rate is achieved. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify the performance superiority of the proposed protocols when compared with the other key encrypted schemes in terms of the data packet delay and the secrecy rate.	confidentiality;dynamic data;exptime;encryption;network packet;portable document format;requirement;secure transmission;simulation interoperability standards organization;system analysis	Dawei Wang;Pinyi Ren;Julian Cheng;Yichen Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2748119	cryptography;transmission delay;secure transmission;encryption;processing delay;computer science;computer network;queue;network packet;communication channel	Mobile	33.946072912235074	80.6676791895443	150011

The advantage of using XPD cross-polarised antennas in cellular MIMO-OFDM systems is that XPD antennas save costs and space achieved by a more compact antenna design. The throughput performance is generally considered to be similar to co-polarised antennas with pre-coding. In this paper we show the achievable gains of using cross-polarised antennas as compared to co-polarised antennas at the base station. These cross-polarised antennas are used for adaptive MIMO transmission for typical outdoor scenarios. Our results are based on real-time multiuser (MU) multi-antenna capacity measurements taken with a MIMO-OFDMA system with parameters close to the current 3G-Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) standard. Downlink transmission is considered in a single-cell outdoor scenario. We demonstrate the significant effect of polarisation on the overall system performance, especially on user sum rates when fairness scheduling in OFDMA is applied.	compaq lte;fairness measure;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;polarization (waves);real-time clock;scheduling (computing);software propagation;spatial multiplexing gain;telecommunications link;throughput	Thomas Wirth;Volker Jungnickel;Andreas Forck;Sander Wahls;V.

Different from conventionally cognitive radio network, where spectrum sensing and signal transmission are performed separately, the proposed framework integrates spectrum sensing into signal transmission by assigning different signal types to primary user and cognitive users, i.e., sinusoidal signal and chirp signals for primary user and cognitive users, respectively. Thanks to the energy concentration property of chirp signals in the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain, the separation of primary user and cognitive users can be realized easily. In this proposed framework, interference to primary user can be reduced because of the simplified time slot structure, and channel capacity can also be improved by removing the separate spectrum sensing process. Moreover, by using the energy accumulation of the primary user in the signal transmission process, the detection probability of the proposed framework can also be improved even with channel estimation error and signal separation error.	channel capacity;channel state information;chirp;cognitive radio;error detection and correction;fractional fourier transform;interference (communication);relay;tree accumulation	Xuanli Wu;Nannan Fu;Fabrice Labeau	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2381216	cognitive radio;speech recognition;information processing;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;cooperative diversity;chirp;channel capacity;computer network	Mobile	34.614247197070235	85.67330500541448	150123

One of the SUs acts as a relay for the PUs and gains spectrum sharing as long as he respects outage probability constraints of the primary system. Moreover, we consider that the relaying node performs an optimal power allocation scheme that minimizes the outage performance of the secondary receiver. Closed form expressions for the outage probability are derived for the cases of Decode-and-Forward (DF), Amplify-and-Forward (AF), and adaptive relaying.

It is assumed that channels are quasi-static fading with additive white Gaussian noise and that all nodes are equipped with a single antenna. The channel state information (CSI) of each hop is available only at the corresponding receiver and relay is not capable of data buffering over multiple coding blocks. One commonly used design criterion in such configurations is the maximization of the average received rate at the destination. Considering infinite-layer coding at both the source and the relay, in conjunction with decode and forward strategy at the relay, we present a procedure to optimally distribute the available source and relay powers to different layers of their corresponding codes. Next, we demonstrate how this transmission technique can be generalized to a multihop setting. Assuming Rayleigh fading, the performance of the proposed coding scheme is evaluated for a two-hop network and compared with the performance of previously known strategies.	additive white gaussian noise;channel state information;code;expectation–maximization algorithm;rayleigh fading;relay;utility functions on indivisible goods	Vahid Pourahmadi;Alireza Bayesteh;Amir K.

To estimate these rare event probabilities, we propose in this paper an importance sampling approach which is based on the exponential twisting technique to offer fast and accurate results. In fact, we consider a variety of turbulence regimes, and we investigate the outage probability of FSO communication systems, under a generalized pointing error model based on the Beckmann distribution, for both single and multihop scenarios.

Whenever a new small cell is switched on, a spectrum reassignment of already-deployed small cells can be used to avoid high interference and enable coexistence. However, as users may turn on and off their small cells at times, these reassignments may lead to frequent reconfigurations of already-deployed small cells. For this reason, a solution named small-cell dynamic deployment (SCDD) is designed to reassign TVWS channels only to the small cells in the neighborhood of the new cell. A channel allocation is proposed for SCDD formulated as an exact potential game. Its exact potential function is the sum of the average capacity of the small cells considered in the game. Results show that SCDD requires a few channel reconfigurations of already-deployed small cells because the channel assignment outside the neighborhood of the new cell remains unchanged. However, SCDD performs similarly to the case in which the allocation may modify the channels of all small cells already deployed.	coexist (image);interference (communication);software deployment;white spaces (radio)	Pablo Ameigeiras;David Manuel Gutiérrez Estévez;Jorge Navarro-Ortiz	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2361457	games;vehicle dynamics;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;transmission;computer science;engineering;white spaces;interference;computer network;channel	Mobile	26.551098248217926	87.66719317907148	150812

The expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the destination is derived, where the transmissions are affected by multipath fading, path loss and interference. The analysis involves finding the ratio distribution of two random variables, representing the desired signal and the intra-region interference, respectively. The expression for CDF helps in ascertaining the outage probability at the destination. Hence, given a desired outage probability, a limit on the number of simultaneously active D2D links in a circular region can be determined, thereby allowing interference avoidance. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical model. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test is applied to further characterize the matching between simulation and analytical model. Moreover, the results also help in identifying the minimum transmit power that ensures the desired quality-of-service (QoS), providing efficient transmission in energy constrained environments.	downtime	Rafay Iqbal Ansari;Syed Ali Hassan;Sajid Ali;Chrysostomos Chrysostomou;Marios Lestas	2017	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2017.09.006	multipath propagation;cumulative distribution function;real-time computing;ratio distribution;mathematical optimization;transmitter power output;path loss;computer science;statistics;coverage probability;interference (wave propagation);random variable	Theory	29.465476037395238	84.9027115794489	150976

It is assumed that both source and relay use equal allocated time in transmission. Depending on the quality of the source-relay channel, the relay may choose either Decode-and-Forward (DF), Amplify-and-Forward (AF), or Direct-Transmission (DT) to forward signals. It turns out that in terms of outage probability, two selection relaying schemes are better than others: selecting between DF and AF protocols (DF-AF) or selecting between DF and DT protocols (DF-DT). It is shown that with an equal power allocation, both of the DF-AF and DF-DT selection relaying protocols have the same asymptotic outage probability. However, with an optimum power allocation strategy, the DF-AF selection scheme is in general better than the DF-DT selection scheme. Note that the optimum power allocations depend on channel variances, not on instantaneous channel gains. When the quality of the relay-destination link is much better than that of the source-relay link, observed from simulation, the outage probability of the DF-AF selection protocol with its optimum power allocation is 1.5 dB better than that of the DF-DT selection with its own optimum power allocation. Extensive simulations are presented to validate the analytical results.	anisotropic filtering;direction finding;downtime;relay channel;simulation	Weifeng Su;Xin Liu	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.060691	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;wireless network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.25776990211228	79.05694555732575	150994

In this system, the secrecy performance may deteriorate as the number of users increases, since the number of eavesdroppers also increases. To address this issue, we consider a multiuser relay scheme with cooperative jamming (MUCJ). In this scheme, the desired user sends a jamming signal to the relay while the source sends its message to the relay, and then the relay amplifies and forwards the received signal to the desired user. Since the jamming can be subtracted only at the desired user, it acts as interference to prevent the eavesdroppers from intercepting the source message. We propose an optimal user selection scheme for the MUCJ, which is optimal in the sense of maximizing the secrecy rate. For the existing multiuser relay scheme (MURS) without cooperative jamming and the MUCJ, we derive the ergodic secrecy rates and analyze the asymptotic secrecy rate gains. We reveal that the ergodic secrecy rate can be increased as the number of users grows and much higher secrecy rate can be achieved by the MUCJ.	encapsulated postscript;ergodic hypothesis;ergodicity;eve;expanded memory;interference (communication);multi-user;portable document format;radio jamming;relay;secure transmission;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality;x86 instruction listings	Sung-Il Kim;Il-Min Kim;Jun Heo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2410776	telecommunications;computer science;information security;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;wireless;computer network	Security	35.22814309166445	83.28783688481259	151016
bffc5db7d178c70cb285ebed78e3cfecd5c0dcaf	simulation modelling of fair channel allocation scheme in urban city		Cellular users are frequently affected by unfair channel allocation by the base station. A cluster, which typically has 3, 7, 19, or 21 cells can accommodate many User Equipments (UEs). The demarcation boundary between adjacent cells is ambiguous and as such, a radio transmission in a cell from a particular eNode Base Station (eNBs) may leak into neighbouring cell leading to interference. In addition, the geographical position of eNBs may be also affected by obstacles e.g tall buildings. Such impediments can severely affect the line of sight, contributing to the increase of radio propagation loss. Consequently, the transmitted signal strength from the transmitter deteriorates, impacting the existing Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) technique. Despite the existing mechanism for fair channel, some users located on the cell edge are inherently affected by unfairness, which is due to poor received signal power. The empirical data collected by using a Cell Tracker between two cities have shown that some area may not be receiving optimal LTE service. As such, this paper proposes a fair approach for channel allocation in clustered LTE network. Basically, the scheme is quantified by using simulation modelling. In the proposed scheme, the static clustering is combined with the dynamic clustering, which can improve the channel assignment. Additionally, the results show the inter-cell interference is substantially reduced, leading to optimal cellular network performance.	cell (microprocessor);cell signaling;cluster analysis;compaq lte;demarcation point;formal concept analysis;interference (communication);network performance;population;quantifier (logic);simulation;software propagation;stellar classification;transmitter	Mohd T.

It allows operators to provide larger operational bandwidths without the need of having a contiguous, large piece of spectrum. However, an increased bandwidth also needs a larger channel sounding to obtain channel state information (CSI), required for frequency domain scheduling and link adaptation. This constitutes a serious challenge for the uplink since wideband sounding reference signals cannot be transmitted by cell edge (power limited) users and hopped sounding requires a long time to sweep the entire transmission band, thus leading to outdated and less reliable CSI. Also, average interference and its variation in time can seriously jeopardize the CSI at the eNodeB. In this paper, we present an integration of inter cell interference coordination with CSI reporting by reducing the interference variability through controlled allocations. Results show that the entire CSI accuracy can be improved and so does the overall cell performance.	automatic sounding;bandwidth (signal processing);channel state information;compaq lte;frequency divider;heart rate variability;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spatial variability;telecommunications link;throughput	Maria A.

The basic idea is to reduce intercellular interference and improve the capture probability by an a priori assignment of power levels of channels used in different cells. We formulate and solve an optimal channel-selection problem for our scheme. We find that the optimal policy is in a form of bang-bang control. We illustrate our channel-selection solution by a case study with uniform fairness constraint. We evaluate, via numerical analysis and simulation, both throughput and delay of the new scheme, and compare them with other schemes. We find that our scheme can achieve significant performance improvements, in terms of both the maximum throughput and throughput-delay tradeoff, over a wide range of capture ratio values.	network packet	Junyi Li;Ness B.

To overcome these constraints Cooperative communication and Network coding have been demonstrated to be effective. Consequently in this paper, we consider a two-way relaying network in which orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is employed for the source 1-to-source 2, the source 1-to-relay and the relay-to-source 2 links where the relay node performs Amplify and Forward (AF) protocol. We consider a conventional bi directional relaying schema (AF-PLC) and we compare it to a schema in which we include Physical Network Coding (AF-PNC-PLC) for different number of time slots dedicated to exchange data messages between two source nodes S1 and S2 with the assistance of the relay node R. We also evaluate the channel capacity for OFDM-based two-way relaying AF-PLC and AF-PNC-PLC systems without/with cooperative diversity. Moreover, we provide a solution based on sub-carrier pairing technique to further improve the channel capacity.	anisotropic filtering;bi-directional text;channel capacity;frequency divider;linear network coding;multiplexing;numerical method;power-line communication;relay;source;subcarrier	Sana Ezzine;Fatma Abdelkefi;Ammar Bouallègue;Jean-Pierre Cances;Vahid Meghdadi	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577058	linear network coding;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;frequency-division multiplexing;channel capacity;computer network	HPC	34.13996385543328	81.07426064110126	151506

In regular cooperative diversity networks, relays forward the source signal to the destination every time regardless of the channel conditions which limits the system throughput. In this paper, we propose an incremental relaying protocol based on decode and forward transmission in conjunction with DSTC to save the channel resources. If the destination requests the help from the relays, they cooperate with each other and decode and forward an Alamouti coded version of their signals. The average bit error probability (BEP) is derived in a closed form expression. Simulations are performed to confirm our theoretical analysis. The effect of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) threshold and the position of relays on the bit error probability are discussed. Moreover, our results show that the proposed scheme offers better performance than incremental-selective DF relaying when the relays are near the source.	bit error rate;consensus dynamics;direction finding;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation preorder;throughput	Ons Mabrouk;Hatem Boujemaa	2012	2012 5th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing	10.1109/ISCCSP.2012.6217802	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;communication	Arch	34.57363399761423	76.70560123574501	151533

We study the forward link capacity of a FWA system based on IS-2000 technology for voice traffic with and without space-time spreading (STS) transmit diversity. The study indicates that an Urban IS2000 FWA system using STS can carry about 10-12% more traffic than an Urban IS2000 FWA system not implementing transmit diversity. In Suburban environments the gain from STS is on the order of 50%. FWA systems using IS2000 without transmit diversity can carry about 23% more traffic per sector in the suburban environments than the urban environments. In all these cases we have assumed that sufficient Walsh codes exist to support the carried traffic. In practice, the finite number of Walsh codes may l i t the capacity of many FWA systems.	fast forward;hadamard code;next-generation network;telecommunications link;wireless access point;wireless local loop	Mehmet Yavuz;Ashvin H.

In theory, it can double the throughput of the communication system as it can transmit and receive at the same time. However, due to the influence of self interference, full duplex radio is often short of the ideal throughput, even lower than half duplex. In order to improve the total throughput of full duplex wireless MIMO network, we design Full Duplex Rate Adaptation algorithm which adaptively chooses the optimal joint scheme of Rate, MIMO mode and the Work mode. we employ MAB (Multi-Armed Bandit) Model and use the softmax selection strategy achieving nearly oracle throughput in stationary environment and the average throughput is higher than both full duplex and half duplex without adaptation in different non-stationary environment.	algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;multi-armed bandit;simulation;softmax function;stationary process;throughput	Longliang Chen;Jian Chen;Wenyu Zhang;Lei Huan;Wangdong Qi	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7497974	duplex;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;duplex mismatch	Mobile	35.7257779135474	77.0219978480661	151807

In the analysis, an arbitrary number of independent and identically distributed Nakagami-m interferers will be considered. Closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the upper bounded end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the destination is given. The obtained CDF is then considered to study the average bit error probability (ABEP). Furthermore, an approximate expression for the CDF of the instantaneous end-to-end SINR is derived, based on which simple and general asymptotic expression for the error probability is presented and discussed. The derived asymptotic equation is shown to reduce to the already published equation in Rayleigh fading, which corroborate the exactness of the derived analysis. Besides, analytical comparison between amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward multi-hop systems in terms of ABEP is provided. Optimisation of the power allocation at the network's transmit nodes and the positioning of the relays are studied as well. It is shown that optimum power allocation achieves only coding gain, whereas optimising relay locations yields diversity gains as well as coding gain.	interference (communication)	Raed Mesleh;Salama S.

Integrating MPT with wireless communications to support simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) allows the same spectrum to be used for dual purposes without compromising the quality of service. A novel approach is presented in this paper for realizing SWIPT in a broadband system where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and transmit beamforming are deployed to create a set of parallel sub-channels for SWIPT, which simplifies resource allocation. Based on a proposed reconfigurable mobile architecture, different system configurations are considered by combining single-user/multi-user systems, downlink/uplink information transfer, and variable/fixed coding rates. Optimizing the power control for these configurations results in a new class of multi-user power-control problems featuring the circuit-power constraints, specifying that the transferred power must be sufficiently large to support the operation of the receiver circuitry. Solving these problems gives a set of power-control algorithms that exploit channel diversity in frequency for simultaneously enhancing the throughput and the MPT efficiency. For the system configurations with variable coding rates, the algorithms are variants of water-filling that account for the circuit-power constraints. The optimal algorithms for those configurations with fixed coding rates are shown to sequentially allocate mobiles their required power for decoding in ascending order until the entire budgeted power is spent. The required power for a mobile is derived as simple functions of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio for correct decoding, the circuit power and sub-channel gains.	algorithm;beamforming;electronic circuit;frequency divider;microwave;mobile device;modern portfolio theory;multi-user;multiplexing;optimizing compiler;quality of service;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sorting;telecommunications link;throughput	Kaibin Huang;Erik G.

The statistical but predefined nature of the constellation dynamics as well as the influence of the propagation channel in the handover mechanism enables the assessment of different levels of power and time hysteresis for different satellites within the network. Based on the above, two handover algorithms are proposed for different modes of handover operation and compared with existing handover schemes by means of case studies in suburban environments for a LEO and a MEO satellite constellation. The analysis includes the simulation of the constellations and the elevation dependent satellite channel.	msat	Maria Gkizeli;Rahim Tafazolli;Barry G.

a700a2b1ef074b2689036ced20896c20edb216af	caching-aided physical layer security in wireless cache-enabled heterogeneous networks		Caching popular contents is a promising way to offload the mobile data traffic in wireless networks, but so far the potential advantage of caching in improving physical layer security (PLS) is rarely considered. In this paper, we contribute to the design and theoretical understanding of exploiting the caching ability to improve the transmission security in a wireless heterogeneous network. Two transmission schemes, namely Symbol-level scheme and Bit-level scheme, are considered in such network to improve PLS by utilizing the content property of cached files. In Symbol-level scheme, the base station (BS) ensures the secrecy of communication by transmitting the requested file along with a pre-cached file of the user such that the eavesdropper’s channel is degraded. In Bit-level scheme, the BS encodes the requested file with a pre-cached file to fully resist the overhearing of eavesdroppers in bit level, e.g., network coding. Accordingly, the node locations of BSs, users and eavesdroppers are first modeled as mutually independent Poisson point processes and the corresponding file access protocol is developed. We consider two scenarios where each scheme is employed respectively, and then derive analytical expressions of two secrecy metrics in terms of average secrecy rate and secrecy coverage probability. Numerical results are provided to show the significant security advantages of the proposed schemes and to characterize the impacts of the cache ability and network resources on the security performance.

In this paper, we consider a cooperative adhoc network consisting of a source node, two relay nodes and a destination node. The source intends to transmit it's data through relays to the destination with the help of decode and forward relaying technique. We employ the weighted selection combining at the destination which chooses either the weighted source-to-relay1-to-relay2-to-destination (S-R1-R2-D) link or source-to-destination (S-D) link depending upon the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. We have derived the conditional symbol error probability (SEP) of S-D and S-R1-R2-D links with binary phase-shift keying for a flat, slow Rayleigh fading channels. Further, we develop an algorithm to investigate the performance of this cooperative adhoc networks in terms of SEP. Results show that the cooperation among the nodes improves the performance of adhoc networks when compared to point-to-point links.	algorithm;apollonian network;cooperative multitasking;key (cryptography);modulation;point-to-point (telecommunications);rayleigh fading;relay;semantic network;signal-to-noise ratio;symantec endpoint protection	Chinnamuthu Annadurai;Velmurugan Nagarajan	2014	2014 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2015.01.006	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;machine learning;cooperative diversity	Mobile	34.43069608714601	77.87952101946524	152160

MIMO channel matrices have been computed with a 3D ray-tracing based software at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz in two different tunnel environments: 1) a 1-track empty tunnel with a square cross section, 2) a 1-track tunnel with a square cross section in which a train is parked between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, two different strategies are investigated to model the MIMO channel using the Kronecker and the Weichselberger correlation based channel models. The first one is to model the MIMO channel using a single model over the total tunnel length. The second one takes into account the correlation at the receiving side according to the transmitter-receiver distance. In the latter solution, it is possible to isolate specific areas in the tunnel with specific correlation properties and model them in an independent way to take them into account in a system simulation. In this paper, these two modeling strategies are compared in terms of channel capacity.	channel capacity;cross section (geometry);mimo;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;transmitter;underground	Yann Cocheril;Marion Berbineau;Pierre Combeau;Yannis Pousset	2009	JCM	10.4304/jcm.4.4.224-231	kronecker delta;ray tracing;index term;telecommunications;computer science;cross section;correlation;precoding;channel capacity;mimo	Mobile	27.071162031862563	78.39875203854311	152314

As RAUs (remote antenna unit) deployed in long tunnels, according to different coverage strategies, the number of RAUs is different, this will lead various handover mechanisms. Based on the channel modeling of simulator in this paper, coverage efficiency (power consumption of unit distance in tunnel) handover trigger probability and outage probability are adopted to compare the performance of these two coverage strategies. It can be concluded that when using directional antenna radiating same direction, due to the longer radiate distance R, it has better coverage efficiency, and the trigger probability almost reached 100% once entered the overlapping area, and the handover outage probability is clearly lower than using intercross base station antenna network, even if the train is fast.	downtime;futures studies;quality of service;radiate;radio over fiber;real life;sun outage	Tianluan Shuo;Ke Zhao;Hao Wu	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504534	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;directional antenna;base station;handover;operating system;computer network	Mobile	25.47426671104356	87.21758800122088	152331

The proposed method utilizes an iterative water-filling (IWF) algorithm with signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) rather than conventional signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which enables us to considerably reduce the overhead. Computer simulation results show that the proposed IWF based on SLNR with 1-shot 1-bit feedback per subcarrier can achieve very close sum-rate performance to the conventional IWF based on SINR, while only replacing SINR to SLNR in the IWF algorithm results in poor performance.	1-bit architecture;algorithm;computer simulation;interference (communication);iterative method;overhead (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Kazunori Hayashi;Megumi Kaneko;Takeshi Fujii;Hideaki Sakai;Yoji Okada	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947118	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;frequency response;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	EDA	39.02221206369159	86.80155666705465	152993

In a practical wireless network, co-channel interference may exist due to multiple access or frequency reuse. Such interference often follows a symmetric alpha stable (S    $\alpha$  S) distribution that may not have a finite mean. As a result, the conventional Gaussian detector performs very poorly when both impulsive interference and Gaussian noise are considered. In this paper, novel suboptimum detectors for signals corrupted by S    $\alpha$  S interference and Gaussian noise are proposed for AF relaying. Numerical results are presented to show that the new suboptimum detectors have performance gains on the order of tens of decibels in effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the conventional Gaussian detector under the same conditions.	anisotropic filtering;interference (communication);sensor	Yunfei Chen	2015	IEEE Trans.
