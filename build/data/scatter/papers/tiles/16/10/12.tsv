Unlike traditional Cooperative Data Exchange (CDE), in our proposed relay-based model, clients can only cooperate via a relay. The data exchange is completed over two phases, namely Uploading Phase and Downloading Phase. In the Uploading Phase, the clients will encode the original packets and transmit the coded packets to the relay. In the Downloading Phase, the relay will reencode the received packets and multicast the reencoded packets, each to a subgroup of clients. The coded packets in the two phases are carefully selected so that each client can retrieve all original packets with minimum total transmission delay, based on its initial side information and on the coded packets it receives from the relay. In addition, we assume that the bandwidths between the relay and different clients are different, and that the upload/download bandwidths between the relay and the same client are also different. We establish a coding scheme that has the minimum total delay and show that it can be found in polynomial time, for sufficiently large underlying fields. We also design a heuristic algorithm that has a low complexity with binary field size. Our simulations show that the performance of the binary solution is very close to that of the optimal solution. All coding schemes considered in this work are scalar.	algorithm;download;encode;heuristic (computer science);linear network coding;multicast;network packet;relay;simulation;time complexity;upload	Zheng Dong;Xiumin Wang;Son Hoang Dau;Chau Yuen	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/TNET.2014.2342739	linear network coding;real-time computing;multicast;telecommunications;computer science;transmission delay;relay channel;bandwidth;wireless;encoding;computer network	Metrics	32.52624882596462	74.02510381382407	50772
f95904800c558e6adb0708fe8692078b61705fd8	linear transmission of a mixture of gaussian measurements over a fading channel under delay constraints		Delay constrained linear transmission (LT) strategies are considered for the transmission of a mixture of Gaussian measurements over an additive white Gaussian no ise fading channel under an average power constraint. If the channel state information (CSI) is known by both the encoder and decoder, the optimal LT scheme in terms of the average mean-square error distorti on is characterized under a strict delay constraint, and a graphical interpretation of the optimal p ower allocation strategy is presented. Then, for general delay constraints, two achievable LT strategies ar proposed based on the solution to a particular multiple measurements-parallel channels scenario. It is s hown that the distortion decreases as the delay constraint is relaxed, and when the delay constraint is comp letely removed, both strategies achieve the optimal performance under certain matching conditions. If the CSI is known only by the decoder, the optimal LT strategy is derived under a strict delay constrai n . The extension for general delay constraints is shown to be hard. As a first step towards understanding this case, it is argued that for the multiple measurements-parallel channels scenario, any LT scheme th at uses only a one-to-one linear mapping between measurements and channels is suboptimal in general .

Each relay node has access to a subset of the sources, and is connected to the destination by a unit capacity link. Arbitrary errors may be introduced by up to z of the relay nodes. We propose an efficient distributed error correction coding scheme, where the relay nodes encode independently such that the overall codewords received at the destination are codewords from a single Reed-Solomon code. We show that it achieves the full capacity region for up to three sources.	access network;code word;encode;error detection and correction;folded reed–solomon code;forward error correction;reed–solomon error correction;relay	Wael Halbawi;Tracey Ho;Hongyi Yao;Iwan M.

A limited feedback beamforming technique is proposed for dual-polarized MIMO channels where the receiver has perfect channel knowledge but the transmitter only receives partial information regarding the channel instantiation. The system employs an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distortion minimizing codebook to convey channel state information (CSI) in the form of beamforming direction. By investigating the average SNR performance of this system, an upper bound on the average SNR distortion is found as a weighted sum of two beamforming distortion metrics. The distortion minimization problem is solved by designing a concatenated codebook. Finally, we propose a codebook switching scheme exploiting the cross-polar discrimination (XPD) statistics. Simulations show that the proposed codebook switching scheme with an XPD dependent concatenated codebook has the ability to adapt to dual-polarized channels.	beamforming;channel state information;codebook;computer simulation;concatenation;distortion;mimo;polarization (waves);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;universal instantiation;weight function	Taejoon Kim;Bruno Clerckx;David James Love;Sungjin Kim	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.09.090754	transmitter;telecommunications;antenna;control theory;mathematics;precoding;statistics	Mobile	37.02276499802871	74.45074950940511	52039

Sensors communicate with the receiver over an additive Gaussian multiple access channel. The aim of the receiver is to reconstruct the underlying source with minimum mean squared error. The scenario of interest here is one where some of the sensors act as adversary (jammer): they strive to maximize distortion. We show that the ability of transmitter sensors to secretly agree on a random event, that is “coordination”, plays a key role in the analysis. Depending on the coordination capability of sensors and the receiver, we consider two problem settings. The first setting involves transmitters with “coordination” capabilities in the sense that all transmitters can use identical realization of randomized encoding for each transmission. In this case, the optimal strategy for the adversary sensors also requires coordination, where they all generate the same realization of independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise. In the second setting, the transmitter sensors are restricted to use fixed, deterministic encoders and this setting, which corresponds to a Stackelberg game, does not admit a saddle-point solution. We show that the the optimal strategy for all sensors is uncoded communications where encoding functions of adversaries and transmitters are in opposite directions. For both settings, digital compression and communication is strictly suboptimal.	adversary (cryptography);character encoding;distortion;encoder;mean squared error;network model;randomized algorithm;sensor;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Emrah Akyol;Kenneth Rose;Tamer Basar	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620284	gaussian noise;telecommunications;mathematics;radio receiver	Theory	34.66225253089227	67.3541989492232	52194

It is explained how efficient extractors can be used to define efficient coding schemes and reciprocally, a new deterministic extractor based on a polar coding scheme is proposed. Since the source model used in extractors for computer science (cryptography) do not assume i.i.d. or known distributions, a generalized polarization phenomenon for sources with block memory and unknown distributions is developed. It is shown that in this setting, the min-entropy (as usual in extractors) rather than Shannon entropy can be efficiently extracted. The derived polar coding results also apply to compound channels with memory.	computer science;cryptography;data compression;entropy (information theory);maxima and minima;open-source software;polarization (waves);randomness extractor;shannon (unit)	Emmanuel Abbe	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033870	arithmetic coding;shannon–fano coding;telecommunications;information theory;variable-length code;computer science;entropy encoding;theoretical computer science;context-adaptive variable-length coding;tunstall coding;context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding;error exponent;statistics;huffman coding;source code	Theory	37.68566354857373	64.78986334598133	52426

In this work, we introduce nested lattice codes into vector perturbation sy stems, resulting in a strategy which we deem matrix perturbation. We propose design criteria for the nested lattice codes, and show empirically that lattices satisfying these design cri teria can improve the performance of vector perturbation systems. The resulting design criteria are the same as those recently pro posed for the Compute-and-Forward protocol.	code;transmitter	David A. Karpuk;Amaro Barreal;Oliver W.

Transmitter and receiver design techniques that explicitly deal with this interference have been shown to improve substantially the performance of communication systems over radio-frequency and other """"classical"""" channels. Quantum multiple-access communication channels, on the other hand, have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, an input-output model for multiple-access quantum channels relevant to optical communications is proposed. The model accounts for multiaccess interference, signal attenuation, and random noise, and can be used in the analysis and design of communication systems. Using a result from optimization, a perturbation method is developed to find the minimum achievable error probability in small-interference channels. It is shown that the quantum measurement that minimizes the error probability in a no-interference channel is robust in the presence of small multiaccess interference. The results are illustrated with numerical examples, which show that optimal quantum detectors can significantly outperform conventional detectors even for moderate levels of crosstalk."""	channel capacity;crosstalk;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;measurement in quantum mechanics;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;quantum channel;radio frequency;sensor;transmitter	J.

In our setup, the encoder observes one source frame every M time slots, but is required to transmit a channel packet in each time slot. The decoder is required to reconstruct each source frame within a playback delay of T source frames. The collection of M transmitted channel packets between successive source frames is called a (channel) macro-packet. For a certain class of burst-erasure channels, we characterize the associated capacity and develop explicit codes that attain the capacity. We recover as a special case, the capacity when M = 1, studied in earlier works. Our proposed code constructions involve splitting each source frame into two groups of sub-symbols, applying unequal error protection and carefully allocating source and parity-check sub-symbols within each macro-packet. Our constructions are a non-trivial extension of the previously proposed codes for M = 1. Simulation results indicate significant gains over baseline error correction codes for the Gilbert model for burst erasures.	baseline (configuration management);binary erasure channel;burst error;code;ecc memory;encoder;error detection and correction;forward error correction;network packet;parity bit;simulation	Pratik Patil;Ahmed Badr;Ashish Khisti;Wai-tian Tan	2013	2013 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2013.6810676	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;online codes;fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;linear code;luby transform code;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction	Arch	35.54402679973156	67.25418242199689	53370

It was shown that the redundancy decays exponentially with the delay constraint and that the redundancy-delay exponent is lower bounded by log(1/alpha) where alpha is the probability of the most likely source symbol. In this work, we prove a corresponding upper bound for the redundancy-delay exponent, C - log 1/beta where beta is the probability of the least likely source symbol. This bound is valid for almost all memoryless sources and for all arithmetic-type (possibly time-varying, memory dependent) lossless delay-constrained encoders. We also shed some light on the difference between our exponential bounds and the polynomial O(d-5'3) upper bound on the redundancy with an average delay constraint d, derived in an elegant paper by Bugeaud, Drmota and Szpankowski for another class of variable-to-variable encoders, and show that the difference is due to the precision needed to memorize the encoder's state.	encoder;lossless compression;polynomial;time complexity	Eado Meron;Ofer Shayevitz;Meir Feder;Ram Zamir	2008	Data Compression Conference (dcc 2008)	10.1109/DCC.2008.84	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics;source code	EDA	37.10801394178284	62.29033508058904	53559

With classical communication, on the other hand, both the correlations entanglement leads to as well as quantum channels can be reproduced in principle. Here, crucial questions are whether the required communications is finite; if so, then its exact amount is related to the “degree of non-classicality” of the quantum primitive. We apply information-theoretic results such as the reverse Shannon theorem for determining the required communication in the asymptotic limit. The communication complexity of a quantum channel is the minimal amount of classical communication required for classically simulating the process of preparation, transmission through the channel, and subsequent measurement of a quantum state. At present, only little is known about this quantity. Our generic procedure allows for systematically evaluating the communication complexity of channels in any general probabilistic theory, in particular quantum theory. The procedure is constructive and provides the most efficient classical protocols. We illustrate it by evaluating the communication complexity of sending single qubits over a noiseless quantum channel with some finite sets of quantum states and measurements. As a second application, we determine the classical-communication rate required for the simulation of the behavior under measurements of entangled states. Here, the communication cost can be directly interpreted as the “non-classicality” of the correlation. A particular example is the simulation of non-maximally entangled pure qubit pairs, where we find the required communication rate to behave monotonically with the strength of the entanglement. For different measures of non-locality, such as the number of required non-local (PR) boxes, another behavior had been reported for the single-shot scenario.	asymptote;communication complexity;information theory;introduction to quantum mechanics;locality of reference;physical information;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum state;qubit;shannon (unit);shannon–hartley theorem;simulation	Alberto Montina;Marcel Pfaffhauser;Stefan Wolf	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620325	quantum operation;no-teleportation theorem;discrete mathematics;quantum information;quantum information science;quantum teleportation;information theory;no-communication theorem;amplitude damping channel;theoretical computer science;quantum network;quantum discord;quantum capacity;open quantum system;quantum pseudo-telepathy;probability;communication complexity;mathematics;quantum convolutional code;quantum sensor;quantum channel;classical capacity;quantum entanglement;quantum process;quantum algorithm;statistics;quantum error correction	Theory	31.134560904840114	64.86710699711568	53607

We show that there is an optimal antenna configuration yielding the highest capacity which depends strongly on the array length and the transmission wavelength, but does not depend strongly on the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, we show that ignoring the effect of mutual coupling gives misleading results, yielding unbounded capacity growth. As another key finding, we demonstrate the surprising result that if the optimal antenna configuration is employed, then further optimizing the transmission based on the channel statistics gives very little benefit over simple equal-power spatial multiplexing. By deriving an expression for the capacity at low SNR, we provide a straightforward method for estimating the optimal number of antennas.	mimo;many antennas;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;transmitter	Shuo Shen;Matthew R.

f2c60b228b1147ea23eb72b75e649f32a3020c0d	tuple decoders for traitor tracing schemes	algorithms	In the field of collusion-resistant traitor tracing, Oosterwijk et al. recently determined the optimal suspicion function for simple decoders. Earlier, Moulin also considered another type of decoder: the generic joint decoder that compares all possible coalitions, and showed that usually the generic joint decoder outperforms the simple decoder. Both Amiri and Tardos, and Meerwald and Furon described constructions that assign suspicion levels to c-tuples, where c is the number of colluders. We investigate a novel idea: the tuple decoder, assigning a suspicion level to tuples of a fixed size. In contrast to earlier work, we use this in a novel accusation algorithm to decide for each distinct user whether or not to accuse him. We expect such a scheme to outperform simple decoders while not being as computationally intensive as the generic joint decoder. In this paper we generalize the optimal suspicion functions to tuples, and describe a family of accusation algorithms in this setting that accuses individual users using this tuple-based information.	algorithm;binary decoder;traitor tracing	Jan-Jaap Oosterwijk;Jeroen Doumen;Thijs Laarhoven	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1117/12.2037659	real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;physics;algorithm	Crypto	33.13537706724299	66.42949272764461	53917

This criterion is used because it provides a graceful degradation in the coding performance when the channel temporarily becomes less reliable. Unambiguous encoding is employed, and the channel is assumed to obey a realistic additive property. An optimum pair of symbol encoding and decoding functions are derived, and it is shown that the optimum symbol encoding can be performed in a linear fashion. The related decoding role is the conditional mean estimator. Fourier transforms are central to the optimal design of both rules. The optimum symbol rules tire identical with the properly isolated parts of the optimum mean-square error rules when the code is used to carry the k Information digits considered as a single complete numerical entity, The same channel coding design is therefore optimum for a wide variety of Information configurations. Techniques for implementing the optimum symbol decoders are examined with special emphasis on memoryless channels where the storage requirements for the necessary weighting coefficients are drastically reduced.	channel capacity;forward error correction;mean squared error	G.

It is shown that the effect of correlation among measurements for the segmented CS can be characterized by a penalty term in the corresponding bounds on the measurement rate. Moreover, this penalty term is vanishing as the signal dimension increases. It means that the performance degradation due to the fixed correlation among measurements obtained by the segmented CS (as compared to the standard CS with equivalent size measurement matrix) is negligible for a high-dimensional signal. In combination with the fact that the signal reconstruction quality improves with additional measurements obtained by the segmented CS (as compared to the standard CS without additional measurements), the fact that the additional correlated measurements also provide new information about a signal is a strong argument for the segmented CS.	compressed sensing;elegant degradation;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction	Hao Fang;Sergiy A.

The optimal protocol for such transformation is obtained. This result leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact purification of n copies of a two-qubit state. Quantum entanglement is regarded as one of the basic resources in the field of quantum information theory. It is the essential ingredient for tasks as quantum dense coding [1] and quantum teleportation [2]. In general these tasks require maximally entangled states, among which the Bell state |Ψ − = 1 √ 2 (|01 − |10) (1) is a frequent choice. However, in practical situations decoherence makes pure states evolve into mixed states and reduces its entanglement. Therefore, in the last years much work has been devoted to understand under which conditions the entanglement that has been lost can be recovered using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In general there are two frameworks under which the problem of concentrating the entan-glement is studied. On the one hand, there are cases in which a large amount of copies of a given state are available. That is, two parties, A and B, are given a very large number of copies, n, of a bipartite state, ρ ⊗n AB , and they have to make operations on their subsystems in order to concentrate the entanglement so that they end up with m copies of the state |Ψ −. In general the problem is stated in the asymptotic limit (n → ∞), and the final state after the local operations has a fidelity with the state |Ψ − Ψ − | ⊗m going to 1 as n goes to infinity, keeping m n finite. If the process of concentrating the entanglement is optimal, the ratio m n is called the Entanglement of Distillation [3] of ρ AB. On the other hand, sometimes only one or a few copies of the state ρ AB are given to the parties. In this case there are different strategies one may follow. For instance, if we are given a state of two qubits we can consider the LOCC protocol that achieves the state maximizing the fidelity with the state |Ψ − with a finite probability [4, 5, 7]. This procedure ensures the state has the maximal probability of behaving as a maximally …	asymptote;bell state;fidelity of quantum states;information theory;locc;maximal set;purification of quantum state;quantum decoherence;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum teleportation;qubit;superdense coding	Enric Jané	2002	Quantum Information & Computation		peres–horodecki criterion;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;locc;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	34.713986091389344	65.47653448309707	54293

For high rates (l ow distortion) and uniform distribution the performance of a multidimensional lattice depends mainly on the normali zed second moment (NSM) of the lattice. For relatively low rates (high distortions) and non-uniform distribution s the lattice-based quantization can be non-optimal in term s of achieving the Shannon rate-distortion function H(D). In this paper we analyze the rate-distortion function R(D) achievable using linear codes over GF (q), where q is a prime number. We show that even for q = 2 the NSM of code-based quantizers is close to the minimum achievable limit. If q → ∞, then NSM→ 1/(2πe) which is the NSM of the infinite dimension sphere. By exhaustive search over q-ary time-invariant convolutional codes with memory ν ≤ 8, the NSM-optimum codes for q = 2, 3, 5 were found. For low rates (high distortions) we use a non-lattice quanti zer obtained from a lattice quantizer by extending the “zero zone”. Furthermore, we modify the encoding by a pro pe ly assigned metric to approximation values. Due to such modifications for a wide class of probability distrib ut ons and a wide range of bit rates we obtained up to 1 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement compared to current ly known results.	approximation;brute-force search;computational complexity theory;convolutional code;distortion;grammatical framework;limbo;linear code;quantization (signal processing);rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;time-invariant system;vector quantization	Boris D.

Inner and outer bounds on the rate-distortion region are derived. The achievable region is tight when both source components are reconstructed losslessly at the non-breakdown scenario and partially tight when the distortion measures are degraded and deterministic.

cb983139b4e8c8520407a9ca94ae5df7957da498	on codes achieving zero error capacities in limited magnitude error channels		Shannon in his 1956 seminal paper introduced the concept of the zero error capacity,  $C_{0}$ , of a noisy channel. This is defined as the least upper bound of rates, at which, it is possible to transmit information with zero probability of error. At present not many codes are known to achieve the zero error capacity. In this paper, some codes which achieve zero error capacities in limited magnitude error channels are described. The code lengths of these zero error capacity achieving codes can be of any finite length  $n=1,2,\ldots$ , in contrast to the long lengths required for the known regular capacity achieving codes, such as turbo codes, LDPC codes, and polar codes. Both wrap around and non-wrap around limited magnitude error models are considered in this paper. For non-wrap around error model, the exact value of zero error capacities is derived, and optimal non-systematic and systematic codes are designed. The non-systematic codes achieve the zero error capacity with any finite length. The optimal systematic codes achieve the systematic zero error capacity of the channel, which is defined as the zero error capacity with the additional requirements that the communication must be carried out with a systematic code. It is also shown that the rates of the proposed systematic codes are equal to or approximately equal to the zero error capacity of the channel. For the wrap around model bounds are derived for the zero error capacity and in many cases the bounds give the exact value. In addition, optimal wrap around non-systematic and systematic codes are developed which either achieve or are close to achieving the zero error capacity with finite length.	approximation;low-density parity-check code;noisy-channel coding theorem;polar code (coding theory);requirement;shannon (unit);systematic code;turbo code	Bella Bose;Noha Elarief;Luca G.

Each pair of source samples is transmitted using a linear transmission scheme in a finite number of channel uses. We investigate three linear transmission schemes: A scheme based on the Ozarow–Leung (OL) code, a scheme based on the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) code of Ardestanizadeh et al., and a novel scheme derived in this paper using a dynamic programming (DP) approach. For the OL and LQG schemes we present lower and upper bounds on the minimal number of channel uses needed to achieve a target mean-square error (MSE) pair. For the LQG scheme in the symmetric setting, we identify the optimal scaling of the sources, which results in a significant improvement of its finite horizon performance, and, in addition, characterize the (exact) minimal number of channel uses required to achieve a target MSE. Finally, for the symmetric setting, we show that for any fixed and finite number of channel uses, the DP scheme achieves an MSE lower than the MSE achieved by either the LQG or the OL schemes.	approximation algorithm;channel capacity;coefficient;computational complexity theory;dynamic programming;encode;efficient coding hypothesis;forward error correction;html element;horizon effect;image scaling;mean squared error;modulation;multi-user;recursion;scheme;signal-to-noise ratio;steady state;time-invariant system	Yonathan Murin;Yonatan Kaspi;Ron Dabora;Deniz G&#x00FC;nd&#x00FC;z	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2678988	distortion;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;noise measurement;control theory;mathematics	Crypto	37.398033968890694	66.98736958723032	54861

For such systems, we focus on block-type-decodable encoders, comprising three classes known as block, block-decodable, and deterministic encoders. Franaszek gives a sufficient condition which guarantees the equality of the optimal rates of block-decodable and deterministic encoders for the same block length. In this paper, we introduce another sufficient condition, called the straight-line condition, which yields the same result. Run-length limited RLL( ) and maximum transition run MTR( ) constraints are shown to satisfy both conditions. In general, block-type-decodable encoders are constructed by choosing a subset of states of the graph to be used as encoder states. Such a subset is known as a set of principal states. For each type of encoder and each block length, a natural problem is to find a set of principal states which maximizes the code rate. We show how to compute the asymptotically optimal sets of principal states for deterministic encoders and how they are related to the case of large but finite block lengths. We give optimal sets of principal states for MTR( )-block-type-decodable encoders for all codeword lengths. Finally we compare the code rate of nonreturn to zero inverted (NRZI) encoders to that of corresponding nonreturn to zero (NRZ) and signed NRZI encoders.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;block code;code rate;code word;encoder;graph labeling;mtr;run-length encoding	Panu Chaichanavong;Brian H.

We investigate the impact that different medium access, transmission schemes and channel conditions have on the information exchange among all nodes. We analyze such impact in terms of reception delay and robustness with respect to malicious interference generated by adversary nodes. In order to do so, we model the process of data broadcasting as a coupon collector's problem. We derive the average delay required to retrieve partial and complete information by all nodes in the network, and quantify the gains obtained when using a multi channel system. We take into account the presence of different types of adversaries and find the optimum number of channels that nodes have to access in order to minimize the data reception delay.	adversary (cryptography);datacasting;elegant degradation;information exchange;interference (communication);linear network coding	Alfred Asterjadhi;Raju Kumar;Thomas F.

We use Shannon’s treatment for channels with side information at the transmitter as a framework to derive “optimal precoding” and “channel code design criterion” for the channel with known interference at the transmitter. Communication over Shannon’s state-dependent discrete memoryless channel where the state sequence is known causally at the transmitter requires encoding over the so-called associated channel which has exponential input alphabet cardinality with respect to the number of states. We show that by using at most linearly many input symbols of the associated channel, the capacity is achievable. In particular, we consider M -ary signal transmission over the AWGN channel with additive Q-ary interference where the sequence of i.i.d. interference symbols is known causally at the transmitter. We investigate the problem of maximization of the transmission rate under the uniformity constraint, where the channel input given any current interference symbol is uniformly distributed over the channel input alphabet. For this setting, we propose the general structure of a communication system with optimal precoding. We also investigate the extension of the proposed precoding scheme to continuous channel input alphabet. We also consider the problem of channel code design with causal side information at the encoder. We derive the code design criterion at high SNR by defining a new distance measure between the input symbols of the Shannon’s associated channel. For the case of the binary-input channel, i.e., M = 2, we show that it is sufficient	additive white gaussian noise;causal filter;channel (communications);channel capacity;circuit complexity;encoder;entropy maximization;interference (communication);shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;time complexity;transmitter;universal quantification;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hamidreza Farmanbar	2007			electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;zero-forcing precoding;communication;precoding	Crypto	36.14220373038273	69.71718884094572	56041

The first code, a homogeneous spherical code, is generated by the linear dynamical system s/spl dot/=As, with A a square skew-symmetric matrix. The second code is generated by the shift map s/sub n/=b/sub n/s/sub n-1/(mod 1). The performance of each of these codes is determined by the geometry of its locus or signal set, specifically, its arc length and minimum distance, suitably defined. We show that the performance analyses for these systems are closely related, and derive exact expressions and bounds for relevant geometric parameters. We also observe that the lattice /spl Zopf//sup N/ underlies both modulation systems and we develop a fast decoding algorithm that relies on this observation. Analytic results show that for fixed bandwidth expansion, good scaling behavior of the mean squared error is obtained relative to the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Particularly interesting is the resulting observation that sampled, exponentially chirped modulation codes are good bandwidth expansion codes.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bandwidth expansion;dynamical system;error detection and correction;image scaling;locus;mean squared error;modulation;regular expression;signal-to-noise ratio;spherical code;transmitter	Vinay A.

The number of retransmissions to achieve the necessary diversity level equals the collision multiplicity, whose proper detection is essential for good performance. The so-named network-assisted diversity multiple access (NDMA) resolves the collisions under quasi-static fading, but it is a non-blind approach. Moreover, the blind version of NDMA (B-NDMA) requires tight transmitter phase control and static channels. As another blind method, NDMA with independent component analysis (ICA-NDMA) performs under quasi-static channels, but its multiplicity detection technique suffers at low SNRs. In this paper, efficient collision resolution is achieved by employing a new multiplicity detection technique for ICA-NDMA, where both theoretical and experimental results are presented.	hash table;retransmission (data networks)	Baris Özgül;Hakan Deliç	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30182-0_34	telecommunications;computer science;fading	Robotics	38.22632113991737	72.61590373826483	56603

A compact and informative expression of the Cramer-Rao bound is derived for large training sequence sizes. It is proved that the asymptotic performance bounds depend on the choice of the training sequence only via the asymptotic covariance profiles. Moreover, it is shown that the asymptotic performance bounds do not depend on the number of users and the values of the frequency offsets. Next, we bring to the fore the training strategies which minimize the asymptotic performance bounds and which are, therefore, likely to lead to accurate estimates of the parameters. In particular, for a given user, it is shown that accurate frequency offset estimates are likely to be obtained by introducing relevant correlation between training sequences sent at different antennas. On the other hand, accurate channel estimation is achieved when training sequences sent at different antennas are uncorrelated. Simulation results sustain our claims.	asymptote;channel state information;coefficient;frequency offset;mimo;simulation;telecommunications link	Serdar Sezginer;Pascal Bianchi;Walid Hachem	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2007.894264	asymptotic analysis;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;antenna;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	38.87837919556916	74.43582255526879	56927

Like the cod ing bounds for Huffman coding — which concern the traditional linear code objective of minimizing average co deword length — these are in terms of a form of entropy and the probability of the most probable input symbol. As in H uffman coding, some upper bounds can be found using sufficient conditions for the codeword corresponding to the most probable symbol being one bit long. Whereas having probability no less than 0.4 is a tight sufficient condition for this to be the case in Huffm an coding, other penalties differ, some having a tighter condition, some a lo oser condition, and others having no such sufficient condition. The objectives explored here are ones for which o ptimal codes can be found using a generalized form of Huffman coding. These objectives include one related to que ueing (an increasing exponential average), one related to single-shot communications (a decaying exponential ave rage), and the recently formulated minimum maximum pointwise redundancy. For these three objectives, we also i nvestigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal code with a 1-bit codeword. In the last of them — and in a related fourth obj ective, dth exponential redundancy — multiple bounds are obtained fo r i ferent intervals, much as in traditional Huffman coding.

However, the standard description of the quantum state of a laser field is surprisingly insufficient to understand the quantum nature of such implementations. In this paper, we give a quantum information-theoretic description of a propagating continuous-wave laser field and reinterpret various quantum-optical experiments in light of this. A timely example is found in a recent controversy about the quantum teleportation of continuous variables. We show that contrary to the claims of T. Rudolph and B. C. Sanders [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 077903 (2001)], a conventional laser can be used for quantum teleportation with continuous variables and for generating continuous-variable quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we show that optical coherent states do play a privileged role in the description of propagating laser fields even though they cannot be ascribed such a role for the intracavity field.	quantum state	Steven J. van Enk;Christopher A.

The error probabilities for these schemes approach zero at a rate which is doubly exponential in block length. Outer bounds on the capacity region are also obtained for both channels. The achievable region obtained for the multiple access channel is shown to coincide with the outer bound, yielding a solution of the capacity region for this problem. While the achievable region for the broadcast channel does not coincide with the outer bound, for all cases except that in which one channel is a physically degraded version of the other, the achievable region lies outside the set of rates achievable in the absence of feedback. This is th~ first case in which it has been demonstrated that feedback can enlarge the capacity region of broadcast channels.	additive white gaussian noise;block code;channel capacity;feedback;multi-user;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lawrence H.

7d6564d7fcea1dec7ebd4c10e37deeab5dd15f87	on the ergodic secrecy capacity with full duplex communication		Full duplex (FD) communication promises significant performance gains under ideal network settings. Generally, it has been shown that the throughput and delay gains of FD communication are somewhat limited in realistic conditions, leading researchers to study other possible applications where significantly higher gains over half duplex communication can be availed. The potential of FD nodes in improving the physical layer security of a communication link is investigated in this contribution. Specifically, we present a thorough analysis of the achievable secrecy rate for a transceiver pair in FD mode in the presence of a passive eavesdropper assuming a generic system model. The ergodic secrecy rate with FD communication is found to grow linearly with the log of the direct channel signal to noise ratio as opposed to the flattened out secrecy rate with conventional half duplex communication and irrespective of the eavesdropper channel strengths.

It is assumed that the fading samples are statistically independent and that perfect estimates of these samples are provided to the decoder. These upper bounds on the bit and block error probabilities are based on certain variations of the Gallager bounds. These bounds do not require integration in their final version and they are reasonably tight in a certain portion of the rate region exceeding the cutoff rate of the channel. By inserting inter-connections between these bounds, we show that they are generalized versions of some reported bounds for the binary-input AWGN channel.

It is shown that multiplexing gains that are higher than that of the direct link are possible for any finite SNR, in such a network, under any fading statistics. Thus relaying can offer not only stronger link reliability, but also higher spectral efficiency, compared with non-relay transmission. Several schemes for the decode-and-forward protocol are proposed and are shown to offer the same outage probability and diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) as if the transmit antennas at the source and the relay(s) were co-located, under certain power constraints. Thus a higher multiplexing gain than that of the direct link can be obtained if the destination has more antennas than the source.	cooperative mimo;digital monetary trust;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);inline linking;multiplexing;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency	Yijia Fan;H.

In this paper, we analyze the transmission characteristics of the power line channel and model it with mathematics channel. The multipath effect of the power line channel is studied with a novel technology named compressive sensing herein. We also proposed a new method to the power line channel estimation based on compressive sensing. We can collect and extract the effective parameters of the power line channel to storage, which only take very little storage space. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce the amount of processing data in the digital signal processing module and decrease the requirement for the hardware.

We study the problem of matching between correlated information sources and a K-out-of-M multiple-access channel. We show that by employing the correlation between the information sources and using a two-step coding scheme better results can be achieved compared to separate source and channel coding. A coding and decoding scheme is described and sufficient conditions for reliable transmission of the correlated information sources via the K-out-of-M multiple-access channel, based on this scheme are obtained. >		Masoud Salehi	1995	IEEE Trans.

The DoF outer bounds reveal a fundamental rank-matching phenomenon, reminiscent of impedance matching in circuit theory. It is well known that the maximum power transfer in a circuit is achieved not for the maximum or minimum load impedance but for the load impedance that matches the source impedance. Similarly, the maximum DoF in the rank-constrained    $2 \times 2 \times 2$    MIMO interference network is achieved not for the maximum or minimum ranks of the destination hop, but when the ranks of the destination hop match the ranks of the source hop. In fact, for mismatched settings of interest, the outer bounds identify a DoF loss penalty that is precisely equal to the rank-mismatch between the two hops. For symmetric settings, we also provide achievability results to show that along with the min-cut max-flow bounds, the rank-mismatch bounds are the best possible, i.e., they hold for all channels that satisfy the rank-constraints and are tight for almost all channels that satisfy the rank-constraints. Limited extensions—from sum-DoF to DoF region, from 2 unicasts to    $X$    message sets, from 2 hops to more than 2 hops and from 2 nodes per layer to more than 2 nodes per layer—are considered to illustrate how the insights generalize beyond the elemental    $2 \times 2 \times 2$    channel model.	multiflow	Hua Sun;Sundar R.

This assumption may be impractical in distributed ad hoc, cognitive, or heterogeneous networks. This paper considers the two-user interference channel with one oblivious receiver (IC-OR), i.e., one receiver lacks knowledge of the interfering cookbook, whereas the other receiver knows both codebooks. This paper asks whether, and if so how much, the channel capacity of the IC-OR is reduced compared with that of the classical IC where both receivers know all codebooks. A novel outer bound is derived and shown to be achievable to within a gap for the class of injective semideterministic IC-ORs; the gap is shown to be zero for injective fully deterministic IC-ORs. An exact capacity result is shown for the general memoryless IC-OR when the nonoblivious receiver experiences very strong interference. For the linear deterministic IC-OR that models the Gaussian noise channel at high SNR, nonindependent identically distributed. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits are shown to achieve points not achievable by i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits used in the same achievability scheme. For the real-valued Gaussian IC-OR, the gap is shown to be at most 1/2 bit per channel use, even though the set of optimal input distributions for the derived outer bound could not be determined. Toward understanding the Gaussian IC-OR, an achievability strategy is evaluated in which the input alphabets at the nonoblivious transmitter are a mixture of discrete and Gaussian random variables, where the cardinality of the discrete part is appropriately chosen as a function of the channel parameters. Surprisingly, as the oblivious receiver intuitively should not be able to jointly decode the intended and interfering messages (whose codebook is unavailable), it is shown that with this choice of input, the capacity region of the symmetric Gaussian IC-OR is to within 1/2 log (12πe)≈ 3.34 bits (per channel use per user) of an outer bound for the classical Gaussian IC with full codebook knowledge at both receivers.	channel capacity;channel use;codebook;cognition;hoc (programming language);information theory;interference (communication);multi-user;norm (social);semantic network;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Alex Dytso;Daniela Tuninetti;Natasha Devroye	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2388481	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	35.71215522583739	71.10041683048135	59762
37104b48f1a711538b03b6ec33182c5f4879f34e	privacy of information sharing schemes in a cloud-based multi-sensor estimation problem		In this paper, we consider a multi-sensor estimation problem wherein each sensor collects noisy information about its local process, which is only observed by that sensor, and a common process, which is simultaneously observed by all sensors. The objective is to assess the privacy level of (the local process of) each sensor while the common process is estimated using cloud computing technology. The privacy level of a sensor is defined as the conditional entropy of its local process given the shared information with the cloud. Two information sharing schemes are considered: a local scheme, and a global scheme. Under the local scheme, each sensor estimates the common process based on its measurement and transmits its estimate to a cloud. Under the global scheme, the cloud receives the sum of the sensors' measurements. It is shown that, in the local scheme, the privacy level of each sensor is always above a certain level which is characterized using Shannon's mutual information. It is also proved that this result becomes tight as the number of sensors increases. We also show that the global scheme is asymptotically private, i.e., the privacy loss of the global scheme decreases to zero at the rate of $O(1/M)$ where $M$ is the number of sensors.

That is, a sign is a twofold entity composed of a formal component, which we call signal, and a referential component, namely a reference. Based on this conception, we say that a referent is coded in a particular sign, or that a sign is decoded in a particular referent. In selective scenarios it is crucial for the success of any adaptive innovation or communicative exchange that, if a particular referent a is coded in a particular signal s during the coding process, then the referent a is decoded from the sign s during the decoding process. In other words the referentiality of a signal must be preserved after being decoded, due to a selective pressure. Despite the information-theoretic flavour of this requirement, an inquiry into classical concepts of information theory such as entropy or mutual information will lead us to the conclusion that information theory as usually stated does not account for this very important requirement that natural communication systems must satisfy. Motivated by the relevance of the preservation of referentiality in evolution, we will fill this gap from a theoretical viewpoint, by deriving the consistent information conveyed from an arbitrary coding agent $A^v$ to an arbitrary decoding agent $A^u$ and discussing several of its interesting properties.

2d967877e3b8740251ce45fc5e0fe448396c29f2	on the alternative relaying diamond channel with conferencing links		In this paper, the diamond relay channel is considered, whic h consists of one source-destination pair and two relay nodes connected with rate-limited out-of -band conferencing links. In particular, we focus on the half-duplex alternative relaying strategy, in which the two relays operate alternatively over time. With different amounts of delay, two conferencin g strategies are proposed, each of which can be implemented by either a general two-side conferencin g scheme (for which both of the two conferencing links are used) or a special-case one-side con f rencing scheme (for which only one of the two conferencing links is used). Based on the most general tw o-side conferencing scheme, we derive the achievable rates by using the decode-and-forward (DF) and a mplify-and-forward (AF) relaying schemes, and show that these rate maximization problems are convex. B y further exploiting the properties of the optimal solutions, the simpler one-side conferencing i s shown to be equally good as the two-side conferencing in term of the achievable rates under arbitrar y channel conditions. Based on this, the DF rate in closed-form is obtained, and the principle to use whi ch one of the two conferencing links for oneside conferencing is also established. Moreover, the DF sch eme is shown to be capacity-achieving under certain conditions with even one-side conferencing. For th e AF relaying scheme, one-side conferencing is shown to be sub-optimal in general. Finally, numerical re sults are provided to validate our analysis.	anisotropic filtering;direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);entropy maximization;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical analysis;numerical method;relay channel;system controller hub	Chuan Huang;Shuguang Cui	2012	CoRR		telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	34.08960546328734	73.87516889371115	60838

In this two-hop communication scenario, where the cooperation from the relay node is essential, we investigate whether achieving non-zero secrecy rate is possible. Specifically, we treat the relay node as an eavesdropper from whom the source information needs to be kept secret, despite the fact that its cooperation in relaying this information is needed. We find that a positive secrecy rate is indeed achievable, with the aid of the destination node or an external node that jams the relay, i.e., by cooperative jamming. We derive an upper bound on the secrecy rate by means of an eavesdropper-relay separation argument. We remark that this upper bound is the first of its kind in Gaussian channels with cooperative jamming. The upper bound is strictly smaller than the channel capacity without secrecy constraints. The achievable secrecy rates are found using stochastic encoding and compress-and-forward at the relay. Numerical results show that the gap between the bound and the achievable rate is small when the relay's power is larger than the power of the jammer and the source. In essence, this paper shows that a cooperative jammer enables secure communication to take place using an untrusted relay which would be otherwise impossible.	channel capacity;cooperative mimo;feedback;global communications conference;hop;information needs;inline linking;jam;numerical method;radio jamming;relay;secure communication;subject matter expert turing test;tree (data structure)	Xiang He;Aylin Yener	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.185	wireless ad hoc network;information needs;transmitter;secure communication;telecommunications;computer science;upper and lower bounds;relay channel;computer security;channel capacity;wireless;encoding;computer network	Mobile	34.614563221914416	71.61940526693154	60876

With PNC, the destructive effect of interference in wireless networks is eliminated and the capacity of networks can be boosted significantly. This paper addresses a key outstanding issue in PNC: synchronization among transmitting nodes. We first investigate the impact of imperfect synchronization in a 3-node network with a straightforward detection scheme. It is shown that with QPSK modulation, PNC on average still yields significantly higher capacity than straightforward network coding when there are synchronization errors. Significantly, this remains to be so even in the extreme case when synchronization is not performed at all. Moving beyond a 3-node network, we propose and investigate a synchronization scheme for PNC in a general chain network. And we argue that if the synchronization errors can be bounded in the 3-node case, they can also be bounded in the general N -node case. Lastly, we present simulation results showing that PNC is robust to synchronization errors. In particular, for the mutual information performance, there is about 2 dB loss without phase or symbol synchronization.

For the discrete memoryless (DM) case, we establish lower and upper bounds on the channel capacity. The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the source that uses a Gel’fand-Pinsker like binning scheme at the source, and is based on partial decodeand-forward at the relay. The upper bound improves upon that obtained by assuming that the channel state is available at the source, the relay, and the destination. For the Gaussian case also, we establish lower and upper bounds on the capacity. The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme that consists in a superposition of generalized dirty paper coding (GDPC) and standard DPC at the source, and partial decode-and-forward at the relay. In this case also, the upper bound is better than that obtained by assuming that the channel state is available at the source, the relay, and the destination. For the general Gaussian RC and the degraded Gaussian RC, the lower bound and the upper bound meet, and so give the capacity, for some extreme cases, and so the capacity is obtained for these cases.	channel capacity;deferred procedure call;duplex (telecommunications);product binning;relay channel	Abdellatif Zaidi;Luc Vandendorpe	2009	EURASIP J.

This kind of mapping acts like an analog error correcting code that improves the fidelity between the source signal and the reconstructed one at the receiver. It is well known that a limitation for extending CVQKD to larger distances is the reconciliation efficiency. Such lack of efficiency in reconciliation is mainly due to the difficulty of finding good error correcting codes for low signal-to-noise ratios. Having this limitation in mind, our protocol allows increasing the signal-to-noise ratio between Alice and Bob, thus making reconciliation easier.	alice and bob;code;coherent states;distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;error detection and correction;forward error correction;heterodyne;map;mutual information;nonlinear system;quantum key distribution;redundancy (engineering);shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;spiral model	Edmar J.

The watermarked signal can then be used for different purposes ranging from copyright protection, data authentication, fingerprinting, to information hiding. In this thesis, digital watermarking will be investigated from both an information theoretic viewpoint and a numerical computation viewpoint. From the information theoretic viewpoint, we first study a new digital watermarking scenario, in which watermarks and covertexts are generated from a joint memoryless watermark and covertext source. The configuration of this scenario is different from that treated in existing digital watermarking works, where watermarks are assumed independent of covertexts. In the case of public watermarking where the covertext is not accessible to the watermark decoder, a necessary and sufficient condition is determined under which the watermark can be fully recovered with high probability at the end of watermark decoding after the watermarked signal is disturbed by a fixed memoryless attack channel. Moreover, by using similar techniques, a combined source coding and Gel’fand-Pinsker channel coding theorem is established, and an open problem proposed recently by Cox et al is solved. Interestingly, from the sufficient and necessary condition we can show that, in light of the correlation between the watermark and covertext, watermarks still can be fully recovered with high probability even if the entropy of the watermark source is strictly above the standard public watermarking capacity. We then extend the above watermarking scenario to a case of joint compression and watermarking, where the watermark and covertext are correlated, and the watermarked signal has to be further compressed. Given an additional constraint of the compression rate of the watermarked signals, a necessary and sufficient condition is determined again under which the watermark can be fully recovered with high probability at the end of public	algorithm;channel capacity;computation;data compression;digital watermarking;distortion;embedded system;fingerprint (computing);message authentication;numerical analysis;steganography;theory;watermark (data file);with high probability	Wei Sun	2006			telecommunications;digital watermarking;theoretical computer science;mathematics;watermark;computer security	Crypto	33.35851755070708	67.24859944214171	61845

We characterize the region of achievable rates and distortions where a Markov form (Helper)-(User 1)-(User 2) holds. The main insight of the result is that in order to achieve the optimal rate, the helper may use a binning scheme, as in Wyner-Ziv, where the side information at the decoder is the “further” user, namely, User 2.

However, most existing schemes ordinarily focus on secrecy rate enhancement, which may not be achieved with the non-Gaussian signals. Therefore, we consider this security problem from the actual signal point of view. On the basis of this premise, a novel scheme is proposed. In our scheme, each original signal in one constellation is converted as a transmitted signal in another constellation, and the principle of this variation can be safely told to the user without being learned by others. With this conversion, the eavesdropper is difficult to restore the original signals. Performance analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient for physical layer security improvement.	java platform, standard edition;simulation;zero suppression	Datong Xu;Pinyi Ren;Qinghe Du;Li Sun;Yichen Wang	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108520	computer network;computer science;premise;secrecy;network security;physical layer;information processing;wireless;eavesdropping;demodulation	Mobile	32.0201371636574	69.56220715147946	62402

In this paper, we consider a code division multiplex (CDM) scheme for satellite DAB. For diversity purposes, this system makes use of at least two satellites, and in urban areas, where the satellite signals are shadowed by large structures, a terrestrial network is employed. We present a forward error protection (FEC) scheme that is robust under a variety of channel conditions, especially in cases where the received signal is severely attenuated because of highway underpasses and tunnels. This FEC scheme makes use of time diversity, and this introduces a large delay. Such delays will not affect the performance of broadcast systems; however, the delay will be an issue during tuning when a switch to another channel occurs. We introduce a separate low-delay low-rate tuning channel to facilitate tuning. Extensive simulation results are given to examine the performance of the system, and it is shown that about 70 audio channels, each with a rate of 96 kbit/s, can be satisfactorily supported in a bandwidth of approximately 12.5 MHz in most of the channel conditions considered.	multiplexing	Vijitha Weerackody;Hui-Ling Lou;Z.

However, these results are often based on the simplifying assumption that each node in the network has perfect channel knowledge and ignore the channel-estimation overhead. In this tutorial paper, we take a fresh look at the problem of learning fading channels. By focusing on simple channel models, we will illustrate how to quantify rigorously the throughput loss due to channel-estimation overhead. Specifically, by exploiting that in the absence of a priori channel knowledge at the receiver, the noiseless received signal is a nonlinear function of the transmitted signals and the propagation channel, we will show how to unveil the geometric structure underlying the channel input output relation, and how to use this geometry to characterize capacity at high SNR. We will also demonstrate that this approach is useful to determine the largest rate achievable at finite SNR and finite blocklength.	channel state information;input/output;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;throughput	Erwin Riegler;Günther Koliander;Wei Yang;Giuseppe Durisi	2013	2013 First International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)	10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2013.6623374	fading distribution;binary erasure channel;electronic engineering;spatial correlation;telecommunications;engineering;channel state information;communication;fading;precoding;mimo	Mobile	35.10585416822022	73.34669846305952	62609

Chunked codes are an attractive alternative to random linear network codes due to their lower complexity. Our results, which include upper bounds on the delay and the average delay, are the first of their kind for CC over networks with such probabilistic traffics. These results demonstrate that a stand-alone CC or a precoded CC provides a better tradeoff between the computational complexity and the convergence speed to the network capacity over the probabilistic traffics compared to arbitrary deterministic traffic.

For any fixed rate R>0 and any memoryless source with finite source and reproduction alphabets and a common distribution p, the nth-order distortion redundancy D/sub n/(R) of fixed-rate coding is defined as the minimum of the difference between the expected distortion per symbol of any block code with length n and rate R and the distortion rate function d(p,R) of the source p. It is demonstrated that for sufficiently large n, D/sub n/(R) is equal to -(/spl part///spl part/R)d(p,R) ln n/2n+o(ln n/n), where (/spl part///spl part/R)d(p,R) is the partial derivative of d(p,R) evaluated at R and assumed to exist. For any fixed distortion level d>0 and any memoryless source p, the nth-order rate redundancy R/sub n/(d) of coding at fixed distortion level d (or by using d-semifaithful codes) is defined as the minimum of the difference between the expected rate per symbol of any d-semifaithful code of length n and the rate-distortion function R(p,d) of p evaluated at d. It is proved that for sufficiently large n, R/sub n/(d) is upper-bounded by ln n/n+o(ln n/n) and lower-bounded by In n/2n+o(In n/n). As a by-product, the lower bound of R/sub n/(d) derived in this paper gives a positive answer to a conjecture proposed by Yu and Speed (1993).	data compression	Zhen Zhang;En-Hui Yang;Victor K.-W.

An input to this channel consists of a block of l ≥ 1 bits which experiences a deletion with probability p, a duplication with probability q, and remains unchanged with probability 1 - p - q. For this channel a capacity expression is obtained in the asymptotic regime where p + q = o(l/logl). As a corollary, we obtain an asymptotic expression for the capacity of the so called “segmented” deletion and duplication channel where the input now consists of several blocks and each block independently experiences either a deletion, or a duplication, or remains unchanged.	experience	Hamed Mirghasemi;Aslan Tchamkerten	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483212	block code;binary erasure channel;channel code;telecommunications;probability;mathematics;error exponent;channel capacity;statistics	Theory	36.271600463437856	67.616024918392	63993

This channel consists of two source nodes communicating two independent messages to their corresponding destination nodes. One of the sources, referred to as the cognitive source, has a noncausal knowledge of the message of the other source, referred to as the primary source. Each destination is assumed to decode only its intended message. In addition, the destination corresponding to the cognitive source assists the other destination by transmitting cooperative information through a relay link. We derive a new upper bound on the capacity region of discrete memoryless CICPC. Moreover, we characterize the capacity region for two new classes of this channel: (1) degraded CIC-PC, and (2) a class of semideterministic CIC-PC.	cognition;interference (communication);primary source;relay;transmitter	Mohammad Kazemi;Sahar Hashemgeloogerdi	2014	CoRR		telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	34.58312010824738	72.39885725296166	65198

We first show that this channel can be represented by a circulant matrix that facilitates the derivation of the bounds. We then show that those bounds are robust to non-equal distances and non-equal angular separation, and closely indicate the performance of three dimensional MU-MIMO channel taking into account the antenna height, antenna patterns, and ground reflection in the terrestrial environment. We also show the MU-MIMO channel capacity for the central node using a uniform linear, triangular, square, and circular array as a function of remote node locations and central node antenna spacing, and conclude that the circular array provides the best performance.	angularjs;channel capacity;circulant matrix;line-of-sight (missile);multi-user mimo;terrestrial television	Hajime Suzuki;Dan C.

We assume that the adversary has a power constraint, which she can utilize to have any arbitrary jamming strategy. The multiple access channel between the legitimate transmitters and the receiver thus becomes arbitrarily varying. We derive inner and outer bounds on the secrecy rate region of our model. In the case of a degraded channel, we characterize the optimal secrecy sum-rate, and within 0.5 bits per channel use the optimal individual rate constraints. As a special case, we obtain the secrecy capacity of the point-to-point Gaussian wiretap channel when the eavesdropper is able to arbitrarily jam.	adversary (cryptography);channel use;color depth;fibre channel point-to-point;jam;radio jamming;transmitter	Remi A.

The obtained expression also takes into account the effect of different physical layer parameters such as modulation and coding methods. However, its computational complexity grows quickly as the network size increases. To address this, we also present an accurate approximation method in which the probability of success for a link is predicted by considering only a subset of the interfering nodes. A sufficient condition for the accuracy of this prediction is also presented. The validity of the proposed methods are verified by a series of simulations.	approximation;computational complexity theory;computer programming;flow network;modulation;randomness;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;throughput	Arash T.

This was established using Gaussian codebooks for transmission and random mappings at the relays. In this paper, we develop structured lattice codes that implement the QMF strategy. The main result of this paper is that such structured lattice codes can approximately achieve the Gaussian relay network capacity universally, again within an additive constant. In addition, we establish a similar result for half-duplex networks, where we demonstrate that one can approximately achieve the capacity using fixed transmit-receive (TX-RX) schedules for the relays with no transmit power optimization across the different TX-RX states of the network.	code;codebook;duplex (telecommunications);gaussian (software);mathematical optimization;power optimization (eda);quadrature mirror filter;relay;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ayfer Özgür;Suhas N.

The scheme implements a randomized scheduling and power allocation mechanism, where each legitimate node transmits in random time slots and with random transmit power. Such randomization results in ambiguity at the eavesdropper with regard to the origin of each transmitted frame. The scheme is analyzed in a time-varying binary block erasure channel model and secrecy outage probabilities are derived and empirically evaluated. The scheme is implemented over an IEEE 802.15.4-enabled Sun SPOT sensor motes. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant secrecy gains with a vanishing outage probability, at the expense of slight decrease in throughput, even when the eavesdropper is equipped with a receive power based classifier and is located too close to the transmitter node.	binary erasure channel;channel (communications);downtime;duplex (telecommunications);eve;ieee 1471;provable security;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);secure communication;sun spot;sun outage;throughput;transmitter	Ahmed Elmorsy;Mohamed Yasser;Mohamed Elsabagh;Moustafa Youssef	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963462	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;information security;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.36880855728984	69.25921791056497	67743

The first step handles the scheduling within the folding sets to reduce the switching activity using a greedy algorithm solution for the traveling sales person (TSP) NP-hard problem. The greedy algorithm gives a sub-optimal solution of the TSP problem with low implementation cost. For a typical word-length, and for large folding factors, the projected reduction in switching activity can be as large as 50%. HEAT tool was used to simulate the effect of this reduction using a typical Baugh-Wooley multiplier and the reduction in power consumption for a wireline equalization implementation was found to lie between 25% and 60%. The new algorithm is based on a simple breadth-first search approach and can be easily performed for one time only when the filter is geared to the steady-state mode. The second step involves optimal pipelining of the folded hardware elements for minimum power. The tradeoff between the number of pipelining levels and the power consumption is evaluated. To compensate for the LMS degradation due to pipelining, a 1-pole IIR compensator is introduced in the error loop for relaxed LMS. The IIR based relaxation outperforms the relaxed lookahead pipelining by 2-3 dB of output error. Another feature of the IIR relaxation is the “smoothing” nature of the filter, thus reducing the effective switching activities on the multiplier input. The combined effect of the two techniques can lead to power savings up to 65% compared to a normal folded structure. Simulations for the combined techniques are carried out for the digital subscriber loop channel and significant savings in power are demonstrated.	adaptive filter;breadth-first search;computer simulation;elegant degradation;finite impulse response;greedy algorithm;http pipelining;infinite impulse response;least mean squares filter;linear programming relaxation;local loop;np-hardness;parsing;pipeline (computing);requirement;scheduling (computing);smoothing;software requirements;steady state;travelling salesman problem	Ahmed F.

It is proved that the diversity orders of the JEP and the SEP (of every symbol) is limited by error propagation to N-K+1. Based on our exact error probability analysis, however, we suggest an optimization of JEP over nonnegative quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation sizes (rates) and average powers across transmitters which yield significant improvements over the usual equal power and equal rate assignment. In fact, the JEP of such an optimized design has the much improved diversity order of N (which is also the diversity order obtained through the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) detector). Moreover, it is seen that these simple optimized designs can achieve a significant fraction of the /spl epsi/-outage capacity even without outer codes. It is also known-but only through simulations-that when the symbols are detected in certain channel realization-dependent orders it is possible to improve substantially over fixed-order detection in the case of the equal rate and equal power assignment. We provide an analysis for a recently proposed channel-dependent ordering rule and show that it does not provide an improvement of the diversity order of the JEP beyond N-K+1. Another ordering rule that was proposed earlier to maximize the worst case post-detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under the perfect feedback assumption is shown to be optimal under a more compelling criterion that does not involve that simplifying assumption. While efficiently computable, this ordering rule is seen to perform almost as well as the optimal channel-dependent ordering rule that minimizes the conditional JEP (and hence the JEP). Nevertheless, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with an optimized rate and power allocation and a fixed order of detection is not only less complex but also has a significantly lower JEP than that of the equal-power, equal-rate system, where transmitters are detected in a channel-dependent order, optimal or otherwise.	best, worst and average case;code;coherence (physics);computable function;data flow diagram;decorrelation;jdk enhancement proposal;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;propagation of uncertainty;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;symantec endpoint protection;transmitter	Narayan Prasad;Mahesh K.

However, given a specific network, it is still unknown whether quantum cooperative communication can be successfully performed. In this paper,we investigate network coding for quantumcooperativemulticast (QCM) over the classic butterfly network. A very reasonable definition of QCM is first introduced. It not only perfectly focuses on the basic idea of quantum cooperative communication, but also wonderfully reflects the characteristic of classical multicast over a specific network structure. Next, we design QCM protocol for two-level systems and generalize the protocol into d-dimensional Hilbert space. It is shown that our protocols have significant advantages in terms of resource cost and compatibility with classical multicast. Besides, the success probability, which only depends on the coefficients of the initial quantum states, is carefully analyzed. In particular if the source nodes choose the quantum equatorial states, success probability can reach 1.	centralisation;coefficient;hilbert space;information theory;linear network coding;multicast;quantum information;quantum state;qubit	Gang Xu;Xiubo Chen;Jing Li;Cong Wang;Yi-Xian Yang;Zongpeng Li	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-015-1098-6	quantum information;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;mathematics;efficiency	Theory	31.468647687365813	71.99663613104863	69682

For the case in which the DMC is known and the quality of the reconstruction is evaluated with a given single-letter fidelity criterion, we propose a discrete denoising algorithm that does not assume knowledge of statistical properties of the input sequence. Yet, the algorithm is universal in the sense of asymptotically performing as well as the optimum denoiser that knows the input sequence distribution, which is only assumed to be stationary. Moreover, the algorithm is universal also in a semi-stochastic setting, in which the input is an individual sequence, and the randomness is due solely to the channel noise. The proposed denoising algorithm is practical, requiring a linear number of register-level operations and sublinear working storage size relative to the input data length.	algorithm;channel (communications);discrete fourier transform;noise (electronics);noise reduction;randomness;semiconductor industry;stationary process	Tsachy Weissman;Erik Ordentlich;Gadiel Seroussi;Sergio Verdú;Marcelo J.

In addition, user 2 overhears the transmission of user 1 through a noisy channel, hence the term ‘cognitive’. Capacity bounds for such channel in different parameter regimes are obtained and the impact of such causal cognition is carefully studied. In particular, depending on the channel parameters, the cognitive link may not be useful in terms of the capacity region.

The contribution of the paper goes in two main directions: 1) extending classical bounds of Shannon to classical-quantum channels, and 2) proposing a new framework for lower bounding the probability of error of channels with a zero-error capacity in the low rate region. The relation between these two problems is revealed by showing that Lovász' bound on zero-error capacity emerges as a natural consequence of the sphere packing bound once we move to the more general context of classical-quantum channels. A variation of Lovász' bound is then derived to lower bound the probability of error in the low rate region by means of auxiliary channels. As a result of this study, connections between the Lovász theta function, the expurgated bound of Gallager, the cutoff rate of a classical channel, and the sphere packing bound for classical-quantum channels are established.	alexander horned sphere;bekenstein bound;binary symmetric channel;code word;convex function;convex set;density matrix;distortion;dummy variable (statistics);dynamic markov compression;formal proof;information theory;lovász number;mathematical optimization;minimax;norm (social);optimization problem;orwell;quantum;regular expression;scott continuity;set packing;shannon (unit);windows 95	Marco Dalai	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2283794	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quantum information science;mathematics;classical capacity;channel capacity;statistics	Theory	35.79977915839515	64.9816520463528	71156

Lightwave Techology 27 (2009) pp. 5230-34]. The crack is ultimate and absolute because it works under idealized conditions, and produces much higher data visibility for the eavesdropper than the protocol provides for Alice and Bob. Even with the most idealistic driving noise spectrum stated by Liu, during the most secure phase of the protocol, far away from the transients, where the system is already in its most secure steady-state, the eavesdropper has 100% success rate in identifying the key bits, at the same time when Alice and Bob have less than 100% success rate while using the Liu protocol. No statistics is needed, Eve can extract the secure bit from two samples of the signal in the two direction. Thus the Liu-protocol offers no security against the attack described in this paper.	alice and bob;colors of noise;eve;key exchange;lightwave 3d;phased-array optics;steady state	Zoltán Gingl;Laszlo B.

The set of wiretap sets is arbitrary. The wiretapper can access any one but not more than one wiretap set. From each wiretap set, the wiretapper can obtain some partial information about the private message, which is measured by the equivocation of the message given the symbols obtained by the wiretapper. The security strategy is to encode the message with some random key at the sender. Only the message is required to be recovered at the receiver. Under this setting, we define an achievable rate tuple consisting of the size of the message, the size of the key, and the equivocation for each wiretap set. We first prove a tight rate region when both the message and the key are required to be recovered at the receiver. Then, we extend the result to the general case when only the message is required to be recovered at the receiver. Moreover, we show that even if stochastic encoding is employed at the sender, the message rate cannot be increased.	encode;linear network coding;linear programming;personal message;point-to-point (telecommunications)	Fan Cheng;Raymond W.

96e971128351acc871e3c4919bbf906d6b4337e0	secure distributed state estimation of an lti system over time-varying networks and analog erasure channels		We study the problem of collaboratively estimating the state of an LTI system monitored by a network of sensors (nodes), subject to the following important practical considerations: (i) certain sensors might be arbitrarily compromised by an adversary and (ii) the underlying communication graph governing the flow of information across sensors might be time-varying. We first analyze a scenario involving intermittent communication losses that preserve certain information flow patterns over bounded intervals of time. By equipping the sensors with adequate memory, we show that one can obtain a fully distributed, provably correct state estimation algorithm that accounts for arbitrary adversarial behavior, provided certain conditions are met by the network topology. We then argue that our approach can handle bounded communication delays as well. Next, we explore a case where each communication link stochastically drops packets based on an analog erasure channel model. For this setup, we propose state estimate update and information exchange rules, along with conditions on the network topology and packet drop probabilities, that guarantee mean-square stability despite arbitrary adversarial attacks.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;binary erasure channel;channel (communications);correctness (computer science);information exchange;language technologies institute;linear time-invariant theory;network packet;network topology;sensor;time-varying network	Aritra Mitra;Shreyas Sundaram	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431060	computer science;control theory;information flow (information theory);lti system theory;binary erasure channel;erasure;network topology;distributed computing;bounded function;network packet;communication channel	Metrics	34.62498185188744	68.25392976942435	71769

In this paper, the asymptotic diversity properties of a cooperative transmission system are investigated. The analysis is carried out for an amplify-and-forward multi-relay protocol implementing a distributed randomized space-time block code. According to this approach, each relay multiplies the received signal by its specific spreading matrix, which is selected as having random independent and identically distributed entries. It is shown that the asymptotic diversity order of this system can vary from 2 to the total number of relays plus one. Furthermore, the achieved diversity order critically depends on the quotient between the number of rows and columns of the spreading matrices, which need to be sufficiently tall in order to guarantee full diversity of the system.	approximation;block code;column (database);cooperative mimo;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);inline linking;like button;randomized algorithm;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;transmitter	David Gregoratti;Xavier Mestre	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;cooperative diversity;communication;diversity gain	Robotics	36.39859863806304	74.34591029474726	71953

In particular, our goal is to identify a parameter regime where a simple layered superposition (SLS) coding scheme achieves the entire GDoF region. With αij representing the channel strength parameter for the link from the j th antenna of the transmitter to the i receiver, we prove that SLS is GDoF optimal without the need for time-sharing if max(αki, αim) ≤ αii and αki + αim ≤ αii + αkm for all i, k ∈ [3],m ∈ [M ]. The GDoF region under this condition is a convex polyhedron. The result generalizes to arbitrary M ≥ 3.

In this paper, we model different types of random network communications as the transmission of flats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us to introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding (RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously proposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we first evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in the error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and throughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of partial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC outperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more efficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible alterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which generalizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus reduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct metrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of codes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in particular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on rank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The gain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of complexity.	algorithm;code;communications protocol;data rate units;elementary;error detection and correction;linear network coding;matroid;random graph;routing;sensitivity and specificity;store and forward;theory;throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video	Maximilien Gadouleau;Alban Goupil	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2094818	affine geometry;matroid;communications protocol;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;error detection and correction;information theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Networks	38.36135432525111	65.38482139904744	73399

Furthermore, we consider the replacement attack and jamming attack explicitly, when imposing symbol, peak or an average constraint on the jamming sequence. We show, that in all cases the optimal strategy for the eavesdropper is to disturb each symbol equiprobable in the former case, or to jam each symbol with the same jamming power in the latter case. A consequence is, that the eavesdropper's replacement attack can be modeled as an additional Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Additionally, we demonstrate, that if the attacker is able to induce a channel corruption which corresponds to his own channel's degradedness or which is even worse, no positive secrecy rate is achievable.	binary symmetric channel;computer memory;distortion;jam;key (cryptography);key-agreement protocol;noise power;radio jamming	Carsten Rudolf Janda;Christian Scheunert;Eduard Axel Jorswieck	2014	2014 48th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2014.7094818	telecommunications;engineering;communication;computer security	Security	33.95926468038431	68.99470967516207	73722

By comparing the proposed lower bound with the decentralized coded caching scheme of Maddah-Ali and Niesen, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized to within a multiplicative gap of 4.7 for the worst case, improving the previous analytical gap of 12. Furthermore, for the case when users' requests follow the uniform distribution, the multiplicative gap is tightened to 4.7, improving the previous analytical gap of 72. As an independent result of interest, for the single-user average case in which the user requests multiple files, it is proved that caching the most requested files is optimal.	best, worst and average case;cache (computing);information theory;multi-user	Chien-Yi Wang;Sung Hoon Lim;Michael Gastpar	2016	2016 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2016.7888186	probability distribution;random variable;real-time computing;cpu cache;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;markov process;server;statistics	Theory	32.59201990868845	70.84494644496513	73941

In this paper, we present examples of wireless networks in which decoding and achieving capacity on certain links or subnetworks gives us lower rates than other simple schemes, like forwarding. This implies that the separation of channel and network coding that holds for many classes of wireline networks does not, in general, hold for wireless networks. Next, we consider Gaussian and erasure wireless networks where nodes are permitted only two possible operations: nodes can either decode what they receive (and then re-encode and transmit the message) or simply forward it. We present a simple greedy algorithm that returns the optimal scheme from the exponential-sized set of possible schemes. This algorithm will go over each node at most once to determine its operation, and hence, is very efficient. We also present a decentralized algorithm whose performance can approach the optimum arbitrarily closely in an iterative fashion	brute-force search;converge;data compression;download;encode;erasure code;greedy algorithm;information theory;iterative method;linear network coding;multicast;relay;section 508 amendment to the rehabilitation act of 1973;signal-to-noise ratio;subnetwork;time complexity;vii	Radhika Gowaikar;Amir F.

OFDM is a multicarrier modulation technique and considered to offer significant reduction of the data symbol to be carried per carrier channel, especially in ultra-high speed optical communications with bit rate reaching 100 Gb/s or even higher. This paper thus presents a novel and generic OFDM system employing both MATLAB Simulink and FPGA-based development software platform for simulation as well as hardware implementation for the generation and detection of OFDM signals for wireless and optical communications transmission media. Although the transmission medium is modeled with delay distortion filter in the baseband, this model would be valid for passband signals as the amplitude is represented by complex amplitude whose phase would be the phase of the carrier. The Simulink and hardware models presented hereunder are scalable to much higher speed allowing possible implementation in multi-Giga samples per second electronic processors. The sub-systems of the OFDM transmitter and receiver are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of such models for ultra-wideband communication systems such as wireless access and long haul optical fiber communication backbone networks.

We base our study on a framework developed by Gallager in IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 11, 3 (1965), where the minimum decoding error probability is upper-bounded by an average of a generalized Chernoff’s bound over a code ensemble. We show that the resulting bound in the framework can be directly assessed by the replica method, which has been developed in statistical mechanics of disordered systems, whereas in Gallager’s original methodology further replacement by another bound utilizing Jensen’s inequality is necessary. Our approach associates a seemingly ad hoc restriction with respect to an adjustable parameter for optimizing the bound with a phase transition between two replica symmetric solutions, and can improve the accuracy of performance assessments of general code ensembles including low density parity check codes, although its mathematical justification is still open.	channel capacity;chernoff bound;forward error correction;hoc (programming language);information theory;jensen's inequality;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;social inequality	Yoshiyuki Kabashima	2008	CoRR	10.1088/1742-6596/143/1/012018	phase transition;binary symmetric channel;jensen's inequality;channel code;information theory;statistical mechanics;probability of error;upper and lower bounds;physics	Robotics	39.09214454503805	64.68393064076668	74754

Two important properties of one-time random linear measurements acquired using a Gaussian independent identically distributed matrix are outlined: 1) the measurements reveal only the energy of the sensed signal and 2) only the energy of the measurements leaks information about the signal. An important consequence of the above facts is that CS provides information theoretic secrecy in a particular setting. Namely, a simple strategy based on the normalization of the Gaussian measurements achieves, at least in theory, perfect secrecy, enabling the use of CS as an additional security layer in privacy preserving applications. In the generic setting in which CS does not provide information theoretic secrecy, two alternative security notions linked to the difficulty of estimating the energy of the signal and distinguishing equal-energy signals are introduced. Useful bounds on the mean square error of any possible estimator and the probability of error of any possible detector are provided and compared with the simulations. The results indicate that CS is in general not secure according to cryptographic standards, but may provide a useful built-in data obfuscation layer.	compressed sensing;confidentiality;cryptography;information theory;information-theoretic security;locality-sensitive hashing;mean squared error;simulation	Tiziano Bianchi;Valerio Bioglio;Enrico Magli	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493982	computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;internet privacy;compressed sensing;privacy;computer security;statistics	Security	31.506435267912714	68.16235165519927	74794

Currently, QKD systems can be categorized by its source of uncertainty in nature; single photon or coherent light. As coherent light is harnessed, the overall cost for composing systems drops in general. However, more elaborate post processing is required to extract and share errorless secret keys. Such process is called reconciliation, which is critical to performance. To extend the maximum distance to distill secret keys and prevent it from being bottleneck, we propose a reconciliation protocol that combines multidimensional reconciliation and polar codes. Especially, considering some practical issues, Gaussian approximation is chosen to construct polar codes. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol can support decent performance of coherent-light-based systems at long distance with reduced complexity.	approximation;authentication;categorization;coherence (physics);polar code (coding theory);quantum key distribution;simulation	Yongseen Kim;Changho Suh;June-Koo Kevin Rhee	2017	2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190991	theoretical computer science;photon;key (lock);gaussian;bottleneck;detector;mathematics;polar;quantum key distribution;coherence (physics)	Mobile	30.11737049134139	66.17523151100703	75546

We study both noiseless and noisy binary channels (i.e., bit flips). In the noiseless case, we present an encoding strategy (called exponential backoff encoding) which uses a decreasing amount of energy in consecutive transmissions between energy arrivals. We analyze the achievable rate of backoff encoding and show that it can outperform a uniform energy usage policy. We then extend the encoding strategy to a noisy binary channel, suggest a corresponding decoder, and analyze its performance. We believe our constructive approach complements existing approaches which focus on the information capacity of energy harvesting channels.	algorithm;block code;channel capacity;code;exponential backoff;time complexity	Carol Wang;Mehul Motani	2017	2017 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2017.8277981	battery (electricity);exponential backoff;theoretical computer science;coding (social sciences);energy harvesting;computer science;binary number;communication channel	Mobile	35.3737590559204	67.84004546668314	77833

Motivated by this result, recently a coding scheme with a rate of 1-logq(2) over a symmetric q-ary constellation has been proposed that achieves a PMEPR less than c log(n), where c is a constant. The idea of this coding scheme is to adjust the sign of subcarriers using so-called Chernoff bound-based derandomization algorithm. In this paper, using Chernoff bound and second order exponential Markov bound in conjunction with Gaussian approximation, two new variations of the derandomization algorithm are presented that yield roughly the same statistical PMEPR at the same rate. Moreover, it is rigorously established that the asymptotic PMEPR of both these algorithms is exactly the same as that of the original derandomization algorithm. Given a fixed amount of memory, our new algorithms can reduce the complexity up to one order, i.e. from O(n3) to O(n2). On the other hand, given a fixed computational complexity, our algorithms can reduce the required memory down to half.	approximation;chernoff bound;code word;computational complexity theory;gaussian elimination;markov chain;pre-shared key;randomized algorithm;simulation;subcarrier;time complexity	Mohammad Ghasemi Damavandi;Aliazam Abbasfar;David G.

For a downlink multipleinput single output (MISO) broadcast channel, with M antennas at the transmitters and K single antenna receivers, the maximum multiplexing gain or the maximum degrees of freedom (DoF) is min(M,K). The optimal DoF of min(M,K) is achievable if the transmitter has access to perfect, instantaneous CSIT from all receivers. In this paper, we pose the question that what is minimum amount of CSIT required per user in order to achieve the maximum DoF of min(M,K). By minimum amount of CSIT per user, we refer to the minimum fraction of time that the transmitter has access to perfect and instantaneous CSIT from a user. Through a novel converse proof and an achievable scheme, it is shown that the minimum fraction of time, perfect CSIT is required per user in order to achieve the DoF of min(M,K) is given by min(M,K)/K.	channel state information;mimo;multiplexing;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter	Ravi Tandon;Syed Ali Jafar;Shlomo Shamai	2012	CoRR		telecommunications;control theory	Networks	36.01442583397681	73.36135048757643	78396

Experimental results permit to assess the efficiency of the system in terms of: (1) transmission reliability, which is significantly improved compared to reference systems, and (2) computational costs, which allows for the feasible real-time reception process of broadcast applications with off-line embedding.	algorithmic efficiency;channel (communications);computation;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;utility functions on indivisible goods	Cléo Baras;Nicolas Moreau	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2005.1521598	binary code;channel code;telecommunications;digital watermarking;computer science;theoretical computer science;wiener filter;information hiding;spread spectrum;statistics	Robotics	38.921027424262114	67.6177263672305	78436

Using a computer to test whether a certain rate vector is achievable with vector linear network codes for a multisource network coding instance and whether there exists a multi-linear secret sharing scheme achieving a specified information ratio for a given secret sharing instance are shown to be special cases of CLRP. Methods for solving CLRP built from group theoretic techniques for combinatorial generation are developed and described.

737bc1094f1d887293e5e398f901dc10ef5734e0	random access channel coding in the finite blocklength regime		Consider a random access communication scenario over a channel whose operation is defined for any number of possible transmitters. Inspired by the model recently introduced for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters by Polyanskiy, we assume that the channel is invariant to permutations on its inputs, and that all active transmitters employ identical encoders. Unlike Polyanskiy, we consider a scenario in which neither the transmitters nor the receiver know which or how many transmitters are active. We refer to this agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel, or RAC. Limited feedback is used to ensure that the collection of active transmitters remains fixed during each epoch. The decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of active transmitters (k) and their messages but not which transmitter sent which message. The central result of this work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is first-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. While prior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require 2k – 1 simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold rule and achieves the same dispersion.	active galactic nucleus;encoder;epoch (reference date);first-order reduction;oracle rac;random access;transmitter	Michelle Effros;Victoria Kostina;Recep Can Yavas	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437831	permutation;mathematical optimization;encoder;real-time computing;transmitter;computer science;invariant (mathematics);random-access channel;communication channel;random access	Crypto	35.07908609901636	68.45007481027244	78603

Privacy is measured through the information leakage as quantified by the mutual information between the users outputs and learners inputs. The input perturbation mechanism proposed can be implemented by individual users with a space and time complexity that is independent of the horizon T. For the proposed mechanism, the information leakage is shown to be bounded by the Gaussian channel capacity in the full information setting. The regret bound of the privacy preserving learning mechanism is identical to the non private OGD with only differing in constant factors.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;channel capacity;gradient descent;information leakage;mutual information;regret (decision theory);spectral leakage;time complexity	Ruochi Zhang;Parv Venkitasubramaniam	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461756	mathematical optimization;encryption;mutual information;information leakage;bounded function;computer science;gradient descent;regret;convex function;channel capacity	Robotics	34.661300310029745	69.04700725257138	78627

The problem at hand is to effectively “amplify” the channel state sequence at Bob while “masking” it from Eve. The extent to which the state sequence cannot be masked from Eve is referred to as leakage, and the paper is aimed at characterizing the tradeoff-region between amplification and leakage rates for such a system. An achievable coding scheme is presented, wherein the transmitter enumerates the state sequence using two indices, and transmits one of the indices over the channel to facilitate the amplification process. For the case when Bob observes a “stronger” channel than Eve, the achievable coding scheme is enhanced with secure refinement. The optimal amplification-leakage rate difference, called as differential amplification capacity, is characterized for the degraded binary and the degraded Gaussian channels. For the degraded Gaussian model, extremal corner points of the tradeoff region are characterized. In addition, the gap between the outer bound and achievable rate-regions is determined, where it is shown that the gap is less than half a bit for a wide set of channel parameters.	alice and bob;amplifier;bitwise operation;eve;refinement (computing);spectral leakage;transmitter	Onur Ozan Koyluoglu;Rajiv Soundararajan;Sriram Vishwanath	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120267	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Theory	34.4361966096657	69.6483667908184	78631

In this paper, we consider this problem by incorporating the physical layer parameters in contrast to the most of the previous work which assumed a collision channel. Specifically, the pilot signals that nodes transmit are successfully decoded if the strength of the received signal relative to the interference is sufficiently high. Thus, each node must extract signal parameter information from the superposition of an unknown number of received signals. This problem falls naturally in the purview of random set theory (RST) which generalizes standard probability theory by assigning sets, rather than values, to random outcomes. The contributions in the paper are twofold: First, we introduce the realistic effect of physical layer considerations in the evaluation of the performance of logical discovery algorithms; such an introduction is necessary for the accurate assessment of how an algorithm performs. Secondly, given the double uncertainty of the environment (that is, the lack of knowledge of the number of neighbors along with the lack of knowledge of the individual signal parameters), we adopt the viewpoint of RST and demonstrate its advantage relative to classical matched filter detection method.	algorithm;intel matrix raid;interference (communication);matched filter;quantum superposition;randomness;set theory;signal processing	Jeongho Jeon;Anthony Ephremides	2010	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2012.00015	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;statistics	AI	28.481435305590967	72.70543895362209	78741
38d2eb7e3918902f561aef76f9aa2003e667687d	regular hilberg processes: an example of processes with a vanishing entropy rate		A regular Hilberg process is a stationary process that satisfies both a power-law growth of topological entropy and a hyperlogarithmic growth of maximal repetition. Hypothetically, such processes may arise in statistical modeling of natural language. A striking property of ergodic regular Hilberg processes is that the length of the Lempel-Ziv code is orders of magnitude larger than the block entropy. This is possible since regular Hilberg processes have a vanishing entropy rate. In this paper, we provide a constructive example of regular Hilberg processes, which we call random hierarchical association (RHA) processes. We demonstrate that for those RHA processes, the expected length of any uniquely decodable code is orders of magnitude larger than the block entropy of the ergodic component of the RHA process. Our proposition complements the classical result by Shields concerning nonexistence of universal redundancy rates.	entropy rate;ergodic theory;ergodicity;lempel–ziv–stac;maximal set;natural language;stationary process;statistical model;topological entropy;variable-length code	Lukasz Debowski	2017	IEEE Trans.

In this comment, it is proved that the probability of correct decision of an arbitrary constellation admits a similar representation as well. Based on this fact, it is shown that the stochastic ordering { ≤ Gα, α ≥ 0} proposed by the authors as an extension of the existing Laplace transform order to compare the average SERs over two different fading channels actually predicts that the average SERs are equal for any constellation of dimensionality smaller than or equal to 2α. Furthermore, it is noted that there are no positive random variables X1 and X2 such that the proposed stochastic ordering is satisfied in the strict sense, i.e., X1 <; Gα X2 when α = N/2 for any positive integer N. Additional remarks are noted about the fading scenarios at low SNR and the generalization to additive compound Gaussian noise originally discussed in the subject paper.	additive white gaussian noise;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods;monotone	Berkan Dulek	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2290712	gaussian noise;additive white gaussian noise;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;laplace transform;statistics	Vision	37.545375254889514	68.91927693765666	79353

This paper extends the scope of this quantizer to coding of sources with memory. First considered is a simple extension, called the predictive TB-SVQ, which applies a closed-loop predictive coding operation in each survivor path of the Viterbi codebook search algorithm. Although the predictive TB-SVQ outperforms all other known structured fixed-rate vector quantizers, due to practical reasons, it may not approach the rate-distortion limit. A new quantization scheme motivated by the precoding idea of Laroia et al. (1993), called the precoded TB-SVQ, is also considered; the granular gain is realized by the underlying trellis code while the combination of the precoder and the SVQ structure provides the boundary gain. This new quantization scheme is asymptotically optimal and can, in principle, approach the rate-distortion bound for Markov sources.	trellis quantization;vector quantization	Cheng-Chieh Lee;Rajiv Laroia	2000	IEEE Trans.

This particular channel assumption is not always feasible in compact MIMO design with space limitation and mutual interference. For the sake of generality, by invoking Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for the optimality of convex programming, in this paper we propose asymptotic capacity expressions and precoding designs for generally correlated wireless multi-hop MIMO channels. The channel at each hop is spatially correlated, the source symbols are mutually correlated, and the additive Gaussian noise at each hop is colored. Simulation results shows that the proposed precoding designs can significantly increase the end-to-end mutual information while it does not require resources of the system such as transmission power or bandwidth.	additive white gaussian noise;asymptote;convex optimization;end-to-end principle;hop;input/output;interference (communication);karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mimo;mutual information;relay;simulation;tucker decomposition;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Nguyen N.

The existence of unknown number of eavesdroppers is assumed but with maximum number of antennas at any eavesdropper is limited to a known value $N_E$. The channel matrices between the transmitters and the receiver is available everywhere, while the legitimate pair have no information about the eavesdroppers channels. A new upperbound is established and The DoF region is characterized. It is important to note that the same problem was studied with arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channels, our region is larger than their upperbound. It is important to note that the same problem has been studied recently with arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channels and an upperbound has been derived. However, our achievable sum secure DoF exceeds their previously derived upperbound. Consequently, we revisited the uppperbound derivation and we re-derived a new mathematically robust upperbound.	mimo	Mohamed Amir;Tamer Khattab;Tarek M.

For the source encoder, both scalar and vector quantisation are considered. The codebook index output by the encoder is sent over a noisy discrete memoryless channel whose statistics could be unknown at the transmitter. At the receiver, the code vector corresponding to the received index is passed through a linear receive filter, whose output is an estimate of the source instantiation. Under this setup, an approximate expression for the average weighted mean-square error (WMSE) between the source instantiation and the reconstructed vector at the receiver is derived using high-resolution quantisation theory. Also, a closed-form expression for the linear receive filter that minimises the approximate average WMSE is derived. The generality of framework developed is further demonstrated by theoretically analysing the performance of other adaptation techniques that can be employed when the channel statistics are available at the transmitter also, such as joint transmit–receive linear filtering and codebook scaling. Monte Carlo simulation results validate the theoretical expressions, and illustrate the improvement in the average distortion that can be obtained using linear filtering techniques.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);codebook;distortion;encoder;end-to-end principle;image resolution;image scaling;mean squared error;monte carlo method;quantization (image processing);quantization (physics);simulation;substitution (logic);transmitter;universal instantiation;vector quantization	Ganesan Thiagarajan;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy	2013	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2013.0041	receiver;mathematical optimization;transmitter;electronic engineering;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	37.90052424370805	66.72060353280803	80253

The region is analyzed for two specific broadcast channels: 1) A generalization of Dueck's channel, where it is shown that for noiseless output-feedback the region coincides with the capacity region; 2) A noisy version of Blackwell's channel, where it is shown that for noiseless - and in some cases noisy - output-feedback, the region improves upon the no-feedback capacity region.	blackwell (series);block cipher mode of operation;broadcast domain;dvd region code;feedback;markov chain;transmitter	Ofer Shayevitz;Michele A.

By viewing overhead as the cost of constraints imposed on a system, information-theoretic techniques can be used to obtain fundamental limits on overhead information, and multiple constraints lead to an intriguing chain rule for overhead. In principle, protocol overhead in practical implementations can then be benchmarked against these fundamental limits in order to identify opportunities for improvement.

Han and Kobayashi proposed a receiving strategy, which performs a joint unique decoding of messages of interest along with a subset of messages, which are not of interest. It is now well-known that this provides an achievable region, which is, in general, larger than if the receiver treats all messages not of interest as noise. Nair and El Gamal and Chong, Motani, Garg, and El Gamal independently proposed a generalization called indirect or nonunique decoding where the receiver uses the codebook structure of the messages to uniquely decode only its messages of interest. Nonunique decoding has since been used in various scenarios. The main result in this paper is to provide an interpretation and a systematic proof technique for why nonunique decoding, in all known cases where it has been employed, can be replaced by a particularly designed joint unique decoding strategy, without any penalty from a rate region viewpoint.

Using uniform input distributions reduces the achievable rate, which is called the shaping gap. Gallager's idea for reliable communication with zero shaping gap is to do encoding, matching, and jointly decoding and dematching. In this work, a scheme is proposed that consists in matching, encoding, decoding, and dematching. Only matching is channel specific whereas coding is not. Thus off-the-shelf LDPC codes can be applied. Analytical formulas for shaping and coding gap of the proposed scheme are derived and it is shown that the shaping gap can be made zero. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme allows to operate off-the-shelf LDPC codes with zero shaping gap and a coding gap that is unchanged compared to uniform transmission.	input/output;low-density parity-check code;markov chain;noise shaping;numerical method;shaping codes	Georg Böcherer;Rudolf Mathar	2011	2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop	10.1109/ITW.2011.6089473	markov chain;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;information theory;theoretical computer science;probability of error;mathematics;channel capacity;encoding;statistics;channel	Mobile	36.17180849909532	67.81922929662194	81150

The codewords are vector subspaces of a fixed ambient space; thus codes for this model are collections of such subspaces. Koetter and Kschis-chang constructed a remarkable family of codes similar to Reed-Solomon codes in that codewords are obtained by evaluating certain (linearized) polynomials. In a previous work, we introduced a new family of sub-space codes based upon Koetter-Kschichang construction wich are efficiently list-decodable. By that we could achieve a better decoding radius at low rates than Koetter-Kschischiang codes. In this paper, we consider the problem of list-decoding of sub-space codes with multiplicities. We first establish the notion of multiplicity for linearized polynomials in this context. Then we take advantage of enforcing multiple roots for the interpolation polynomial in order to achieve a better decoding radius. We are also able to list-decode at higher rates. The end result is the following: for any integers L and r, our list-L decoder with multiplicity r guarantees successful recovery of the message subspace provided that the normalized dimension of the error is at most 2(L+1)/r+1 − 1 − L(L+1)/r(r+1) R∗ where R∗ is the normalized packet rate. This improves the normalized decoding radius upon the previous results for a wide range of rates. The parameter r is independent of the code construction and can be chosen at the decoder in such a way that the decoding radius is maximized. As L tends to infinity, the decoding radius of our construction with appropriate choice of r approaches 1/R∗ − 1.	class diagram;code word;folded reed–solomon code;interpolation;linear network coding;list decoding;network packet;network topology;polynomial;randomized algorithm	Hessam Mahdavifar;Alexander Vardy	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120336	block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;error floor	Theory	31.540119617166084	70.97203707462215	81638

A dynamic programming algorithm is applied to optimally allocate to each source coded packet error protection in the form of a choice of channel code and a decision on the use of cooperation. The results show that for degraded source-destination channels, the use of user cooperation on all source coded packets significantly improves the reconstructed quality. As the source-destination channel improves the optimal policy becomes a hybrid that uses user cooperation only for the most important source packets. When the source destination channel is sufficiently good, all source packets are sent without cooperation. Thus, a test is presented to estimate the channels states when cooperation is first used.	algorithm;bitstream;channel (communications);channel capacity;codec;dynamic programming;embedded system;encoder;image quality;information privacy;network packet;neural coding;spectral efficiency;tom	Andres Kwasinski;K.

This problem can be also called “Berger-Yeung problem with correlated messages”. It corresponds to the source coding part of the graph-based framework for transmission of a pair of correlated sources over the multiple-access channel (MAC) where one is lossless and the other is lossy. As a result, the achievable rate-distortion region for this problem is provided. It is an information-theoretic characterization of the rate of exponential growth (as a function of the number of source samples) of the size of the bipartite graphs which can represent a pair of correlated sources with satisfying one distortion criterion. A rigorous proof of the achievability and the converse part is given. It is also shown that there exists functional duality between Berger-Yeung problem with correlated messages and semi-deterministic broadcast channel with correlated messages. This means that the optimal encoder-decoder mappings for one problem become the optimal decoder-encoder mappings for the dual problem. In the duality setup, the correlation structure of the messages in the two dual problems, source distortion measure and channel cost measure are also specified.	data compression;decision problem;distortion;distributed source coding;duality (optimization);eisenstein's criterion;emoticon;encoder;graph (discrete mathematics);information theory;lossless compression;lossy compression;multiseat configuration;problem solving;semiconductor industry;shannon (unit);time complexity	Suhan Choi;Hichan Moon	2012	IEICE Transactions		random graph;distributed source coding;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	ML	36.323530764803955	65.84440586217997	82201

Under the proposed scheme, intermediate sensor nodes, acting as relays to the base station, partially decode the information packets as they traverse the multi-hop wireless network. Nodes collaborate, in a distributed pair-wise manner to allocate the processing budget to individual nodes and obtain near optimal performance. We make recommendations for fast convergence with minimal burden on intermediate nodes. We show that the proposed scheme achieves much better performance than end-to-end channel coding. We use iteratively decodable low density parity check (LDPC) codes to demonstrate the efficiency of our technique.	algorithm;asynchronous i/o;bit error rate;channel capacity;end-to-end principle;fast fourier transform;forward error correction;iteration;low-density parity-check code;opera (web browser);overhead (computing);parity bit;relay;statistical model;traverse	Saad B.

We propose a method for secret key agreement in such a network that is based on well-established point-to- point techniques and repeated application of the one-time pad over a graphical representation of the network. Three specific problems are investigated. (1) Each terminal's observations are correlated only with the observations of a central terminal. All these terminals wish to generate a common secret key. (2) Two designated terminals wish to generate a secret key with the help of other terminals. (3) All terminals wish to generate a common secret key. In each of these cases, we show that our two-step approach can yield an optimal protocol, in terms of the resulting secret key rates. Furthermore, such a protocol is provided for the first two problems, while an efficient protocol is given for the third problem.	graphical user interface;key (cryptography);key generation;one-time pad;regular expression	Chunxuan Ye;Alex Reznik	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557610	shared secret;entropy;information theory;cryptography;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;homomorphic secret sharing;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;key distribution;computer security;entropy rate;statistics	Theory	33.21077299936466	68.23607246998274	82634

ce107a67b3b277114b279a8081023c2541dfae85	euclidean network information theory		Many network information theory problems face the similar difficulty of single letterization. We argue that this is due to the lack of a geometric structure on the space of probability distributions. In this thesis, we develop such a structure by assuming that the distributions of interest are all close to each other. Under this assumption, the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence is reduced to the squared Euclidean metric in an Euclidean space. In addition, we construct the notion of coordinate and inner product, which will facilitate solving communication problems. We will present the application of this approach to the point-to-point channels, general broadcast channels (BC), multiple access channels (MAC) with common sources, interference channels, and multi-hop layered communication networks without or with feedback. It can be shown that with this approach, information theory problems, such as the single-letterization, can be reduced to some linear algebra problems. Solving these linear algebra problems, we will show that for the general broadcast channels, transmitting the common message to receivers can be formulated as the trade-off between linear systems. We also provide an example to visualize this trade-off in a geometric way. For the MAC with common sources, we observe a coherent combining gain due to the cooperation between transmitters, and this gain can be obtained quantitively by applying our technique. In addition, the developments of the broadcast channels and multiple access channels suggest a trade-off relation between generating common messages for multiple users and transmitting them as the common sources to exploit the coherent combining gain, when optimizing the throughputs of communication networks. To study the structure of this trade-off and understand its role in optimizing the network throughput, we construct a deterministic model by our local approach that captures the critical channel parameters and well models the network. With this deterministic model, for multi-hop layered networks, we analyze the optimal network throughputs, and illustrate what kinds of common messages should be generated to achieve the optimal throughputs. Our results provide the insight of how users in a network should cooperate with each other to transmit information efficiently.

It is used to derive lower bounds on the symmetric distortions that are achievable over Gaussian and binary adder MACs. When specialized to symmetric Gaussian MACs and Gaussian sources, the new lower bound recovers Lapidoth and Tinguely's max-correlation lower bound (2010) when the channel bandwidth is equal to the source bandwidth, and it improves on it when the channel bandwidth is higher. An analogous condition is also derived for the MAC with correlated sources and feedback.	adder (electronics);detailed balance;distortion;feedback;lossy compression	Amos Lapidoth;Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti;Michele A.

The messages are arbitrarily correlated, and the finite-field channel is linear and is subject to additive noise of arbitrary distribution. The problem is to determine the minimum achievable source-channel rate, defined as channel uses per source symbol needed for reliable communication. We combine Slepian-Wolf source coding and functional-decode-forward channel coding to obtain the solution for two classes of source and channel combinations. Furthermore, for correlated sources that have their common information equal their mutual information, we propose a new coding scheme to achieve the minimum source-channel rate.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;data compression;forward error correction;mutual information;relay channel;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lawrence Ong;Gottfried Lechner;Sarah J.

The information theoretic cut-set upper bound to the capacity is shown to be achieved to within 1.96(N+2) bits by noisy network coding, thereby reducing the previously known gap. This gap is obtained as a special case of a more general constant gap result for Gaussian half-duplex multicast networks. It is then shown that the generalized degrees-of-freedom of this network is the solution of a linear program, where the coefficients of the linear inequality constraints are proved to be the solution of several linear programs referred as the assignment problem in graph theory, for which efficient numerical algorithms exist. The optimal schedule, that is, the optimal value of the 2N possible transmit-receive configuration states for the relays, is investigated and known results for diamond networks are extended to general relay networks. It is shown, for the case of N=2 relays, that only N+1=3 out of the 2N=4 possible states have a strictly positive probability and suffice to characterize the capacity to within a constant gap. Extensive experimental results show that, for a general N -relay network with N≤8 , the optimal schedule has at most N+1 states with a strictly positive probability. As an extension of a conjecture presented for diamond networks, it is conjectured that this result holds for any half-duplex relay network and any number of relays. Finally, a network with N=2 relays is studied in detail to illustrate the channel conditions under which selecting the best relay is not optimal, and to highlight the nature of the rate gain due to multiple relays.	algorithm;assignment problem;coefficient;duplex (telecommunications);graph theory;linear inequality;linear network coding;linear programming;multicast;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relay;schedule (computer science);social inequality	Martina Cardone;Daniela Tuninetti;Raymond Knopp;Umer Salim	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2314636	mathematical optimization;duplex;combinatorics;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;assignment problem;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio;artificial neural network	Theory	33.95763825998794	72.43991774898213	83603

The core of such a system is the comparison for the receiver between an original binary code, an original corrupted code and a copy of the original code. We analyze two strategies, depending on whether or not the receiver use a binary version of its observation to perform its authentication test. By deriving the optimal test within a Neyman-Pearson setup, a theoretical analysis shows that a thresholding of the code induces a loss of performance. This study also highlights the fact that the probability of the type I and type II errors can be better approximated, by several orders of magnitude, computing Chernoff bounds instead of the Gaussian approximation. Finally we evaluate the impact of an uncertainty for the receiver on the opponent channel and show that the authentication is still possible whenever the receiver can observe forged codes and uses them to estimate the parameters of the model.	approximation algorithm;authentication;binary code;channel (communications);chernoff bound;printing;thresholding (image processing)	Anh Thu Phan Ho;Bao An Mai Hoang;Wadih Sawaya;Patrick Bas	2013		10.1145/2482513.2482538	statistical hypothesis testing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;authentication;computer security;algorithm;statistics	Security	30.91056097177891	66.82691878243617	83665

PD channels can be restricted to the set of optical channels, which allows for the parties to exploit the benefits in experimental quantum communications. We show that for a PD channel, the partial degradability property leads to higher quantum data rates in comparison with those of a degradable channel. The PD property is particularly convenient for quantum communications and allows one to implement the experimental quantum protocols with higher performance. We define a coding scheme for PD channels and give the achievable rates of quantum communication.	quantum channel;quantum programming	Laszlo Gyongyosi	2014	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2308574	communications protocol;quantum information;quantum information science;telecommunications;computer science;amplitude damping channel;theoretical computer science;quantum network;quantum capacity;mathematics;quantum convolutional code;quantum channel;classical capacity;quantum mechanics;encoding;quantum error correction	Theory	31.31260671305339	65.83139282591881	84338

Yet, it can be used to reduce the amount of communication required to process a variety of distributed computational tasks. We speak of pseudo-telepathy when quantum entanglement serves to eliminate the classical need to communicate. In earlier examples of pseudo-telepathy, classical protocols could succeed with high probability unless the inputs were very large. Here we present a simple multi-party distributed problem for which the inputs and outputs consist of a single bit per player, and we present a perfect quantum protocol for it. We prove that no classical protocol can succeed with a probability that differs from /2 by more than a fraction that is exponentially small in the number of players. This could be used to circumvent the detection loophole in experimental tests of nonlocality.	algorithm;information theory;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum nonlocality;quantum pseudo-telepathy;with high probability	Tamal K.

Clearly, this network with five nodes involves all the problems encountered in relay and broadcast channels. New inner bounds on the capacity region of this class of channels are derived. These results can be seen as a generalization and hence unification of previous work in this topic. Our bounds are based on the idea of recombination of message bits and various effective coding strategies for relay and broadcast channels. Capacity result is obtained for the semi-degraded BRC-CR, where one relay channel is degraded while the other one is reversely degraded. An inner and upper bound is also presented for the degraded BRC with common relay (BRC-CR), where both the relay and broadcast channel are degraded which is the capacity for the Gaussian case. Application of these results arise in the context of opportunistic cooperation of cellular networks.	bioinformatics resource centers;relay channel;semiconductor industry;unification (computer science)	Arash Behboodi;Pablo Piantanida	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513531	cellular network;broadcast radiation;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.76066311434883	71.30624632768	84868

The emerging 100 Gigabit Ethernet (GE) technology is a promising candidate for providing a ten-fold increase of todays available Internet transmission rate. As the need for 100 Gigabit Ethernet equipment rises, so does the need for equipment, which can properly test these systems during development, deployment and use. This paper presents early results from a work-in-progress academia-industry collaboration project and elaborates on the challenges of performing bit error rate testing at 100Gbps. In particular, we show how Bit Error Rate Testing (BERT) can be performed over an aggregated 100G Attachment Unit Interface (CAUI) by encapsulating the test data in Ethernet frames at line speed. Our results show that framed bit error rate testing can be performed at speeds exceeding 100Gbps using commercially available Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Even though extensive parallelization is used to achieve this goal, the resulting resource consumption of the proposed design remains relatively modest, leaving plenty of room for additional functionality besides the bit error rate tester.	attachment unit interface;behavioral pattern;bit error rate;field-programmable gate array;framing (world wide web);gigabit;internet;media-independent interface;parallel computing;passive optical network;pseudorandom binary sequence;requirement;software deployment;test data;phpmyadmin	Anders Rasmussen;Sarah Ruepp;Michael S.

We show the quantitative gap between these detection strategies and especially in the quantum-limited region where the quantum noise seriously limits the transmission rate. For an extremely weak signal input power, there is a crucial gap between the capacity limit and the transmission rates of the WDM system with dyne-type detections. We show that this gap is filled by applying a collective square root detection (SRD) only for each channel, not necessary for quantum collective decoding among WDM channels.	channel (communications);coherent;conjunctive query;fiber-optic communication;fibre channel;johnson–nyquist noise;key (cryptography);lossy compression;modulation;numerical analysis;optical fiber;pre-shared key;quantum channel;quantum information science;quantum noise;sensor;wavelength-division multiplexing	Atsushi Waseda;Masahide Sasaki;Masahiro Takeoka;Mikio Fujiwara;Morio Toyoshima;Hidema Tanaka	2010	2010 International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2010.56	electronic engineering;telecommunications;optics;physics	Theory	38.9434880622501	71.02042507367051	85203

Our fundamental philosophy in doing so is to convert all of the reliability function problems to the pertinent computation problems in the large deviation-probability theory. It turns out that this kind of new methodology, which was recently developed by Han, enables us to establish quite compact general formulas of the reliability function for general sources including all nonstationary and/or nonergodic sources with countably infinite alphabet. Such general formulas are presented from the information-spectrum point of view.	computation;data compression;ergodicity;function problem;han unification;relevance	Te Sun Han	2000	IEEE Trans.

In 1972, Khodak claimed to provide upper and lower bounds for the achievable redundancy rate, however, he did not offer explicit construction of such codes. In this paper, we first present a constructive and transparent proof of Khodak's result showing that for memoryless sources there exists a code with the average redundancy bounded by D -5/3, where D is the average delay (e.g., the average length of a dictionary entry). We also describe an algorithm that constructs a VV length code with a small redundancy rate for large D. Then, we discuss several generalizations. We prove that the worst case redundancy does not exceed D -4/3. Furthermore, we provide similar upper bound for Markov sources (of order 1). Finally, we consider bounds that are valid for almost all memoryless and Markov sources for which the set of exceptional source parameters has zero measure. In particular, for all memoryless sources outside this exceptional class, we prove there exists a VV code with the average redundancy rate bounded by D -1-m/3+ epsiv and the worst case redundancy rate bounded by D -1-m/3+ epsiv, where m is the cardinality of the alphabet. We complete our analysis with a lower bound showing that for all VV codes the average and the worst case redundancy rates are at least D -2m-1- epsiv for almost all memoryless sources in the sense that the set of exceptional source parameters has zero measure. We prove these results using techniques of Diophantine approximations.	algorithm;approximation;best, worst and average case;code;data compression;dictionary;markov chain;probabilistically checkable proof;redundancy (engineering);verification and validation	Yann Bugeaud;Michael Drmota;Wojciech Szpankowski	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.929959	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;information theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;statistics	Theory	37.029565066055426	62.44570675711547	86213
6c6fbce2c0c27795bb5a7c504a5b2604aeb201a6	optimal communication of states of dynamical systems over gaussian channels with noisy feedback: the scalar case		We consider the problem of communicating the state of a dynamical system via a Shannon Gaussian channel. The receiver, which acts as both a decoder and estimator, observes the noisy measurement of the channel output and makes an optimal estimate of the state of the dynamical system in the minimum mean square sense. Noisy feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is present. The transmitter observes the noisecorrupted feedback message from the receiver together with a possibly noisy measurement of the state the dynamical system. These measurements are then used to encode the message to be transmitted over a noisy Gaussian channel, where a per symbol power constraint is imposed on the transmitted message. Thus, we get a mixed problem of Shannon’s source-channel coding problem and a sort of Kalman filtering problem. In particular, we consider two feedback instances, one being feedback of receiver measurements and the second being the receiver’s state estimates. We show that optimal encoders and decoders are linear filters with a finite memory and we give explicitly the state space realizations of the optimal filters. For the case where the transmitter has access to noisy measurements of the state, we derive a separation principle for the optimal communication scheme. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of noiseless feedback or no feedback from the receiver to the transmitter. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a stationary solution are also given for the feedback cases considered. NOTATION x x = (x(0), x(1), ..., x(t)).

15bba9eeb69d0bda6a9dbb3f27b01fc1dd9c443b	reflections on shannon information: in search of a natural information-entropy for images		It is not obvious how to extend Shannon’s original information entropy to higher dimensions, and many different approaches have been tried. We replace the English text symbol sequence originally used to illustrate the theory by a discrete, bandlimited signal. Using Shannon’s later theory of sampling we derive a new and symmetric version of the second order entropy in 1D. The new theory then naturally extends to 2D and higher dimensions, where by naturally we mean simple, symmetric, isotropic and parsimonious. Simplicity arises from the direct application of Shannon’s joint entropy equalities and inequalities to the gradient (del) vector field image embodying the second order relations of the scalar image. Parsimony is guaranteed by halving of the vector data rate using Papoulis’ generalized sampling expansion. The new 2D entropy measure, which we dub delentropy, is underpinned by a computable probability density function we call deldensity. The deldensity captures the underlying spatial image structure and pixel co-occurrence. It achieves this because each scalar image pixel value is nonlocally related to the entire gradient vector field. Both deldensity and delentropy are highly tractable and yield many interesting connections and useful inequalities. The new measure explicitly defines a realizable encoding algorithm and a corresponding reconstruction. Initial tests show that delentropy compares favourably with the conventional intensity-based histogram entropy and the compressed data rates of lossless image encoders (GIF, PNG, WEBP, JP2K-LS and JPG-LS) for a selection of images. The symmetric approach may have applications to higher dimensions and problems concerning image complexity measures.

In this model, there are two transmitters and a receiver where all three terminals receive noisy channel outputs. In addition, there is a one-way public channel from the transmitters to the receiver. Each of the transmitters intends to share a secret key with the receiver by using the MAC and the public channel, where the transmitters are eavesdroppers with respect to each other. Two strategies for secret key sharing are considered, namely, the pregenerated key strategy and the two-stage key strategy. For both of them, inner and outer bounds of the secret key capacity region are derived. Furthermore, the effect of the public channel is discussed and the two strategies are compared. In both strategies, it is assumed that the channel outputs at the transmitters are only used for eavesdropping and not as inputs to the encoders. The effect of this assumption in the presence of the public channel is analyzed for some Gaussian MACs.	asymptotic equipartition property;code word;encoder;fano's inequality;key (cryptography);key-agreement protocol;noisy-channel coding theorem;one-way function;social inequality;transmitter	Somayeh Salimi;Mahmoud Salmasizadeh;Mohammad Reza Aref;Jovan Dj.

Each edge receives a symbol from a node and outputs a symbol to a node in each time slot. An edge (ℓ, i) terminating at node i is said to incur zero delay on an edge (i, j) originating from node i if the following holds in each time slot: Node i receives the symbol output from (ℓ, i) before encoding the symbol to be transmitted on (i, j). Otherwise, (ℓ, i) is said to incur a delay on (i, j). In the classical model, every edge incurs a unit delay on every other edge and the cut-set bound is a well-known outer bound on the capacity region. However, if an edge is allowed to incur zero delay on another edge, then there exists a two-node network whose capacity region exceeds the classical cut-set bound. In this paper, we investigate the multimessage multicast network (MMN) consisting of independent channels and study the capacity region under an edge-delay model where an edge may incur zero delay on some other edges. Our edge-delay model subsumes the classical model. Our result reveals that the capacity region of the MMN with independent channels and zero-delay edges lies within the classical cut-set bound despite a violation of the classical unit-delay assumption.	multicast;mystery meat navigation;newman's lemma;telecommunications network	Silas L.

Recent studies suggest that many of these channels are affected by additive noise that is best explained by alpha-stable statistics. We study in this work such channel models and we characterize the capacity-achieving input distribution for those channels under fractional order moment constraints. We prove that the optimal input is necessarily discrete with a compact support for all such channels. Interestingly, if the second moment is viewed as a measure of power, even when the channel input is allowed to have infinite second moment, the optimal one is found to have finite power.	additive white gaussian noise;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jihad Fahs;Ibrahim C.

An efficient implementation protocol that can run directly on top of 802.11 for wireless Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) settings. To do so, we take advantage on a first hand, of the transfer matrix of the protocol (i.e. the random process managing the coefficients of the linear combinations), and on a second hand, of the ability of a sender node to change its transmission range at ease, and broadcast packets to all neighbouring nodes. Specifically, we use MORE’s transfer matrix as our covert channel, where we hide secret messages in each transmission	coefficient;covert channel;distortion;linear network coding;multicast;routing;steganography;stochastic process;transfer matrix	Mohamed Amine Belhamra;El Mamoun Souidi	2018		10.5220/0006852302540264	computer network;encoding (memory);computer science	Networks	31.240057523652414	73.00893113901117	86752

In this paper, making use of an adapted version of that method, we generalize their result to more sophisticated scenarios, where the functions to be computed are polynomial functions. Since all discrete functions are fundamentally restrictions of polynomial functions, our results are universally applied.	codebook;data compression;encoder;han unification;handy board;linear network coding;modulo operation;polynomial	Sheng Huang;Mikael Skoglund	2012	2012 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications		distributed source coding;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;shannon–fano coding;elias gamma coding;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;communications system;polynomial;source code	Theory	37.53031441616788	64.55912698722368	86975

In this paper, we present Arimoto-Blahut type algorithm toward computing the capacity region of the DBC. By using Kumar's method, we prove the global convergence of the algorithm when some conditions hold and derive an expression for its convergence rate.	algorithm;convex function;global optimization;local convergence;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;rate of convergence;time complexity	Kensuke Yasui;Toshiyasu Matsushima	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513525	probability distribution;time complexity;random variable;entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;degradation;convergence;convexity;mathematics;markov process;rate of convergence;code;broadcasting;channel capacity;encoding;statistics;polynomial	Theory	35.5006704899093	65.89772529656626	86996

However, such elaborate methods differ a lot from the unsophisticated way biological entities are supposed to communicate. Yet, it has been recently shown by Feinerman, Haeupler, and Korman [PODC 2014] that complex coordination tasks such as rumor spreading and majority consensus can ε plausibly be achieved in biological systems subject to noisy communication channels, where every message transferred through a channel remains intact with small probability 1 over 2 + ε, without using coding techniques. This result is a considerable step towards a better understanding of the way biological entities may cooperate. It has nevertheless been established only in the case of 2-valued opinions: rumor spreading aims at broadcasting a single-bit opinion to all nodes, and majority consensus aims at leading all nodes to adopt the single-bit opinion that was initially present in the system with (relative) majority. In this paper, we extend this previous work to k-valued opinions, for any constant k≥2.  Our extension requires to address a series of important issues, some conceptual, others technical. We had to entirely revisit the notion of noise, for handling channels carrying k-valued messages. In fact, we precisely characterize the type of noise patterns for which plurality consensus is solvable. Also, a key result employed in the bivalued case by Feinerman et al. is an estimate of the probability of observing the most frequent opinion from observing the mode of a small sample. We generalize this result to the multivalued case by providing a new analytical proof for the bivalued case that is amenable to be extended, by induction, and that is of independent interest.	biological system;code;consensus (computer science);data compression;decision problem;entity;forward error correction;image noise;mathematical induction;podc;rumor spread in social network	Pierre Fraigniaud;Emanuele Natale	2016		10.1145/2933057.2933089	artificial intelligence;distributed computing;algorithm	Theory	31.41285896856834	64.64976217199622	87342

Conventional geolocation of RF emitters has adopted active methodologies by illuminating targets, such as radar sensors. However, active geolocation draws unwanted attention of adversary, thus highly increases threats and vulnerabilities of the sensing devices. As security issues become a central concern in sensing applications, we propose a small unmanned-aerial-system for passive geolocation of RF emitters. Multiple electronic surveillance sensors are mounted on small unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) to provide geolocation awareness. Both sensors-toUAV and UAVs-to-fusion-center communications are investigated. Different with previous studies, our approach is based on an empirical path loss and log-normal shadowing model, from a wireless communication and signal processing vision. The communication degradation from UAV to fusion center has been taken into consideration other than assuming lossless performance.

By developing a tight outerbound as well as an achievable scheme which exploits the idea of interference alignment, we are able to exactly characterize the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of the network when the channel coefficients are time- or frequency-varying, which equals $$ \frac{{KM}} {{K + \min (M,K)}} $$ (where M and K denote the number of receiver antennas and number of users in per cell, respectively) per cell. From the DoF result, it can be observed that in addition to the multi-user gain which has been reported for the network with single-antenna BSs, there also exists the multi-antenna gain in the cellular network. In particular, when the number of users is large, we can nearly achieve the interference-free DoF of a cellular network with multiple-antenna BSs, which is a somewhat surprising result.	coefficient;interference (communication);multi-user	Jun Sun;Yingzhuang Liu;Guangxi Zhu	2010	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-010-0085-x	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;degrees of freedom;statistics	ML	36.0142991288593	73.611162453473	87455
27843f16664019ed235eb9e622b511d6c08b3a2e	the design of protograph ldpc codes for channel-coded physical-layer network coding	separate complete decoding;physical layer network coding;protograph code	For two-way relay channel-coded physical network coding (CPNC) systems with sufficiently low code rate, the separate complete decoding (SCD) scheme outperforms the joint channel-physical network coding (JCNC) scheme. Hence, this paper addresses the design of protograph LDPC codes to approach the SCD-based CPNC capacity. In fact, due to virtual erasures induced by CPNC transmission, the conventional protograph that approaches point to point (P2P) AWGN capacity may not perform well in SCD-based CPNC channel in terms of error rates. We then use the finite-length EXIT chart to calculate iterative decoding threshold of a joint code graph formed by two codes in the SCD. Furthermore, we investigate the serial separate complete decoding (S-SCD) and parallel separate decoding (P-SCD). Simulation results show that with the S-SCD, the proposed protograph codes have within 0.9 dB of their capacity limits for rates from 1/3 to 3/5.	additive white gaussian noise;code rate;coding theory;exit chart;ibm notes;iterative method;linear network coding;low-density parity-check code;qr code;relay channel;simulation;slowly changing dimension;vii	Pingping Chen;Kaixiong Su;Yi Fang;Lingjun Kong	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794683	discrete mathematics;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Arch	32.94310457840466	72.93297635458713	87677

The transmitter observes a stream of messages, one message in each coherence block, and the receiver needs to output a sequence of messages, each with a fixed delay of T coherence blocks. We characterize the associated diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for this model. The proposed coding scheme involves a semi-infinite random Gaussian tree-code and a sequential decision directed decoder. The converse applies an outage amplification argument that exploits the delay constraint to amplify the error event associated with a single message to an entire sequence of messages.	digital monetary trust;downtime;multiplexing;semiconductor industry;stream (computing);streaming media;transmitter	Ashish Khisti;Stark C.

We apply our bound to study the rate distortion function under distortion measure |x − x| for sources that follow a log-concave probability distribution. In particular, we establish that the difference between the rate distortion function and the Shannon lower bound is at most log(√2e) ≈ 1.9 bits, independently of r and the target distortion d. For mean-square error distortion, the difference is at most log √πe ≈ 1.55 bits, regardless of d. Our results generalize to the case of vector X. Our proof technique leverages tools from convex geometry.	concave function;differential entropy;distortion;mean squared error;rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit)	Arnaud Marsiglietti;Victoria Kostina	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006487	differential entropy;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;maximum entropy probability distribution;distortion;distortion function;upper and lower bounds;mathematical analysis;random variable;rate–distortion theory;distortion (mathematics);mathematics	Theory	36.092730970342636	64.43039520258012	88683

We show that this discrete superposition network provides a near-optimal digital interface for operating a class consisting of many Gaussian networks in the sense that any code for the discrete superposition network can be naturally lifted to a corresponding code for the Gaussian network, while achieving a rate that is no more than a constant number of bits lesser than the rate it achieves for the discrete superposition network. This constant depends only on the number of nodes in the network and not on the channel gains or SNR. Moreover the capacities of the two networks are within a constant of each other, again independent of channel gains and SNR. We show that the class of Gaussian networks for which this interface property holds includes relay networks with a single source-destination pair, interference networks, multicast networks, and the counterparts of these networks with multiple transmit and receive antennas. The code for the Gaussian relay network can be obtained from any code for the discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. This lifting scheme establishes that the superposition model can indeed potentially serve as a strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks. We present similar results for the K ×K Gaussian interference network, MIMO Gaussian interference networks, MIMO Gaussian relay networks, and multicast networks, with the constant gap depending additionally on the number of antennas in case of MIMO networks.	apollonian network;code;interference (communication);lifting scheme;mike lesser;multi-user mimo;multicast;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Manish Anand;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2120070	multicast;channel code;telecommunications;information theory;signal processing;deterministic system;mathematics;deterministic system;signal-to-noise ratio;lifting scheme;encoding;statistics;computer network;mimo	ML	33.62196932267114	71.82509644202072	90220

This paper demonstrates that enabling cooperation between the transmitters of a two-user multiple access channel via a cooperation facilitator that has access to both messages, always results in a network whose maximal- and average-error sum-capacities are the same-even when the information shared with the encoders is negligible. Thus, for a multiple access channel whose maximal- and average-error sum-capacities differ, the maximal-error sum-capacity is not continuous with respect to the output edge capacities of the facilitator. This shows that for some networks, sharing even a negligible number of bits per channel use with the encoders can yield a non-negligible benefit.	channel use;color depth;encoder;maximal set;transmitter	Parham Noorzad;Michelle Effros;Michael Langberg	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541606	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Arch	34.06338139127566	73.05529607781538	90796

This is a generalization of both the classical reverse Shannon theorem, and the classical-quantum Slepian-Wolf problem. The optimal noiseless communication rate is found to be reduced from the mutual information between the channel input and output by the Holevo information between the channel output and the quantum side information. Our main theorem has two important corollaries. The first is a quantum generalization of the Wyner-Ziv problem: rate-distortion theory with quantum side information. The second is an alternative proof of the tradeoff between classical communication and common randomness distilled from a quantum state. The fully quantum generalization of the problem considered is quantum state redistribution. Here the sender and receiver share a mixed quantum state and the sender wants to transfer part of her state to the receiver using entanglement and quantum communication.

In all optical communications settings that have been analyzed within a quantum framework so far, the gaps between the quantum limit to the capacity and the Shannon limit for structured receivers become most significant in the low photon-number regime. Here, we present a quantum treatment of a multiple-transmitter multiple-receiver multi-spatial-mode free-space interference channel with diffraction-limited loss and a thermal background. We consider the performance of a laser-light (coherent state) encoding in conjunction with various detection strategies such as homodyne, heterodyne, and joint detection. Joint detection outperforms both homodyne and heterodyne detection whenever the channel exhibits “very strong” interference. We determine the capacity region for homodyne or heterodyne detection when the channel has “strong” interference, and we conjecture the existence of a joint detection strategy that outperforms the former two strategies in this case. Finally, we determine the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate regions for both homodyne and heterodyne detection and compare them to a region achievable by a conjectured joint detection strategy. In these latter cases, we determine achievable rate regions if the receivers employ a recently discovered minentropy quantum simultaneous decoder.	coherence (physics);coherent states;downtime;ergodicity;fibre channel point-to-point;fock state;graph coloring;han unification;heterodyne;interference (communication);noisy-channel coding theorem;quantum channel;quantum limit;semiclassical physics;shannon (unit);transmitter;turbulence	Saikat Guha;Ivan Savov;Mark M.

Kullback's principle of cross-entropy minimization is used for deriving optimum decoding rules assuming a linear, possibly non-systematic, binary code. A log-likelihood formalism is used throughout. Two decoding rules results, one by solving a system of analog implicit non-linear equations written in terms of a generator matrix, the other being the conventional one. We discuss simplified versions of both, present an interpretation of the first rule and compare it with the second one, given that both are intended to provide approximates of the same quantities.	approximation	Gerard Battail	2001	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S1571-0653(04)00171-4	list decoding;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sequential decoding;mathematics;linear equation;cross entropy;algorithm	Theory	38.48115685444561	60.492836840441875	91234

Therefore, the source has to prioritize between the two possible transmission policies: preempting the current update or discarding the new one. We consider Poisson arrivals and general service time, and refer to this system as the M/G/1/1 queue. We start by studying the average status update age and the optimal update arrival rate for these two schemes under general service time distribution. We then apply these results on two practical scenarios in which updates are sent through an erasure channel using (a) an infinite incremental redundancy (IIR) HARQ system and (b) a fixed redundancy (FR) HARQ system. We show that in both schemes the best strategy would be not to preempt. Moreover, we also prove that, from an age point of view, IIR is better than FR.	best practice;binary erasure channel;code word;computer monitor;emoticon;hybrid automatic repeat request;infinite impulse response;network packet;procedural generation;queueing theory;reliable messaging;simulation	Elie Najm;Roy D.

e0e6411eb29d17191b808fc7ebbc9fce40691066	initial results on deep learning for joint channel equalization and decoding		Historically, most of the channel encoding and decoding algorithms have been designed to deal with and evaluated under the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. However, in the reality, the channel is far more complicated than the AWGN assumption. Traditionally, qualizers are employed to combat the channel effects and frequency-selective fading of wireless channels. In this article, we take the advantage of deep learning approaches to handle the various channel distortions, by proposing an end-to-end approach. To train the model efficiently, the training data is obtained by simulation where the encoding process and the channel effects are viewed as a complete black box. This method can also be applied to time- varying channels for simultaneously channel estimation and symbol detection. Simulation results show that the deep learning based decoders have the ability to learn the complicated encoder function and address various channel effects. Furthermore, the deep learning based method provides an end-to-end approach, leading to a better performance in the channels with various distortions. This article represents the first step for a universal framework of information recovering from a large range of channel codes and channels.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;ampersand;artificial neural network;black box;code;decoding methods;deep learning;distortion;encoder;end-to-end principle;experiment;random neural network;unified framework;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hao Ye;Geoffrey Ye Li	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288419	artificial neural network;fading;electronic engineering;encoder;computer science;nonlinear distortion;deep learning;additive white gaussian noise;machine learning;decoding methods;communication channel;artificial intelligence	EDA	39.067567294260215	68.3080413421278	91413

While the P2P channel transmitter - transmitter 3 - causes an interference at the primary MAC receiver, we assume that the primary channel transmitters - transmitters 1 and 2 - do not cause any interference at the P2P receiver. It is assumed that one of the MAC transmitters has cognitive capabilities and cribs causally from the other MAC transmitter. Furthermore, we assume that the cognitive transmitter knows the message of transmitter 3 in a noncausal manner, thus introducing the three-user Multiple Access Cognitive Z-Interference Channel (MA-CZIC). We obtain inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the three-user MA-CZIC for both strictly and nonstrictly causal cribbing cognitive encoders.	causal filter;cognition;encoder;interference (communication);peer-to-peer;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);primary channel;telecommunications network;transmitter	Jonathan Shimonovich;Anelia Somekh-Baruch;Shlomo Shamai	2013	2013 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2013.6691305	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;co-channel interference;computer network	Mobile	34.635375742808144	72.59565437531062	91427

To pose side channel-attacks to the Shannon cipher system, we regard them as a signal estimation via encoded data from two distributed sensors. This can be formulated as the one helper source coding problem posed and investigated by Ahlswede, Korner(1975), and Wyner(1975). We further investigate the posed problem to derive new secrecy bounds. Our results are derived by a coupling of the result Watanabe and Oohama(2012) obtained on bounded storage eavesdropper with the exponential strong converse theorem Oohama(2015) established for the one helper source coding problem.	cipher;data compression;information theory;sensor;shannon (unit);side-channel attack;time complexity	Yasutada Oohama;Bagus Santoso	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437666	converse theorem;cipher;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;source code;side channel attack;bounded function;computer science;exponential function	Theory	33.70233861376603	66.90093063569023	91463

In particular, we consider the realistic condition of non-unit quantum efficiency for the homodyne detectors. This formula can easily be specialized to describe the standard Bell measurement and the heterodyne detection, which are exploited in many contexts, including protocols of quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography. In its general form, our formula can be adopted to study quantum information protocols in the presence of experimental imperfections and asymmetric setups, e.g., deriving from the use of unbalanced beam splitters.	sensor	Gaetana Spedalieri;Carlo Ottaviani;Stefano Pirandola	2013	Open Syst.

We consider transmission of packets from one source to many receivers over a single-hop broadcast erasure channel. Our method utilizes a predictive model to request feedback only when the probability that all receivers have completed decoding is significant. In addition, our proposed NACK-based feedback mechanism enables all receivers to request, within a single time slot, the number of retransmissions needed for successful decoding. We present simulation results as well as analytical results that show the favorable scalability of our technique as the number of receivers, file size, and packet erasure probability increase. We also show the robustness of this scheme to uncertainty in the predictive model, including uncertainty in the number of receiving nodes and the packet erasure probability, as well as to losses of the feedback itself. Our scheme, SMART, is shown to perform nearly as well as an omniscient transmitter that requires no feedback. Furthermore, SMART, is shown to outperform current state of the art methods at any given erasure probability, file size, and numbers of receivers.	acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;binary erasure channel;feedback;linear network coding;multicast;network packet;predictive modelling;smart;scalability;simulation;transmitter	Arman Rezaee;Linda M.

Similar to the separation architecture, the joint source– channel coding system architecture in this approach is modu lar, whereby the source encoding and channel decoding operations are decoupled. However, unlike the sep aration architecture, the same codeword is used for both source coding and channel coding, which allows the resulting hybrid coding scheme to achieve the performance of the best known joint source–chan nel coding schemes. Applications of the proposed architecture to relay communication are also disc ussed.

We study both low-delay and asymptotically high-delay (in the sense of infinite source and coding block lengths) joint source-channel coding schemes based on purely analog and hybrid-digital analog (HDA) schemes with bandwidth expansion, respectively. The achievable (square error) distortion region of these schemes under matched and mismatched noise power is analyzed. The low-delay scheme uses a non-parametric analog mapping that is designed using a joint optimization of the encoder and the decoder. Numerical results show that the non-parametric approach adapts better to the interference than the classical linear scheme. For the high-delay regime, we establish a lower bound on the system's distortion and propose a layered HDA scheme based on Wyner-Ziv and HDA Costa coding. The proposed HDA scheme is shown to perform close to the derived bound and to be resilient under noise mismatch.	additive white gaussian noise;bandwidth expansion;channel capacity;distortion;encoder;forward error correction;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;noise power;numerical method;scheme;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ahmad Abou Saleh;Wai-Yip Chan;Fady Alajaji	2013	2013 13th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory	10.1109/CWIT.2013.6621593	transmitter;codec;speech recognition;distortion;channel code;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;mathematics;shannon–hartley theorem;source code	ML	37.63106452640671	66.73467797489819	92335

When the channel noise is impulsive, its distribution at the receiver decision point, and therefore its effect on the users, depends strongly on the type of modulation. We quantify this effect using information theoretic measures: capacity and error-exponent, where the latter is represented by its cut-off rate parameter. For low to moderate impulse power, the cut-off rate associated with multitone is greater than the cut-off rate associated with single-tone-in contrast to the relation between the corresponding Shannon capacities. This leads to anomalous behavior of the error-versus-information-rate performance. We show that this behavior relates to the tendency toward Gaussianity of the noise after multitone demodulation. We also provide specific evaluation of this phenomena for advanced data transmission over the cable TV (hybrid fiber coax) channel.		Danny Stopler;Ram Zamir	2001	IEEE Trans.

Successive interference cancelation is required, in general, in order to extract the content of all services. For a low-complexity implementation, the receiver can obtain the strongest (top-layer) signal assuming underlying signals to behave like thermal noise. The thermal noise assumption may not be valid under certain conditions and a more accurate characterization of the interference could bring improved performance. This paper analyzes the validity of the noise-like assumption considering the power ratio between signals and the required carrier-to-noise ratio for error-free reception. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of a demapping algorithm that exploits the knowledge of the constellation of underlying signals. Generalized mutual information, performance evaluation, and complexity analysis are provided with the additive white Gaussian noise-like assumptions and with the proposed alternative in order to assess the potential performance improvements that can be achieved.

0f4fb05760e8cbe682fc03fbe7e1e419d44fa24f	a perspective on massive random-access		This paper discusses the contemporary problem of providing multiple-access (MAC) to a massive number of uncoordinated users. First, we define a random-access code for Ka-user Gaussian MAC to be a collection of norm-constrained vectors such that the noisy sum of any Ka of them can be decoded with a given (suitably defined) probability of error. An achievability bound for such codes is proposed and compared against popular practical solutions: ALOHA, coded slotted ALOHA, CDMA, and treating interference as noise. It is found out that as the number of users increases existing solutions become vastly energy-inefficient. Second, we discuss the asymptotic (in blocklength) problem of coding for a K-user Gaussian MAC when K is proportional to blocklength and each user's payload is fixed. It is discovered that the energy-per-bit vs. spectral efficiency exhibits a rather curious tradeoff in this case.	code;interference (communication);ka band;random access;spectral efficiency	Yury Polyanskiy	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006984	code division multiple access;theoretical computer science;discrete mathematics;probability of error;decoding methods;aloha;distributed computing;gaussian;random access;spectral efficiency;mathematics	Embedded	36.983216616173365	71.74410041741992	93490

This protocol generates entanglement between a sender and receiver by coding for a noisy quantum channel with the aid of a noisy shared state. The mother and father protocols arise as special cases of the channel-state coding protocol, where the channel is noiseless or the state is a noiseless maximally entangled state, respectively. The channel-state coding protocol paves the way for formulating entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes that are robust to noise in shared entanglement. Finally, the channel-state coding protocol leads to a Smith-Yard superactivation, where we can generate entanglement using a zero-capacity erasure channel and a non-distillable bound entangled state.	binary erasure channel;code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;information theory;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;shannon (unit)	Mark M.

0aecc351b9337fe9bd640913c34d1f134ebd6016	a survey on robust interference management in wireless networks		Recent advances in the characterization of fundamental limits on interference management in wireless networks and the discovery of new communication schemes on how to handle interference led to a better understanding towards the capacity of such networks. The benefits in terms of achievable rates of powerful schemes handling interference, such as interference alignment, are substantial. However, the main issue behind most of these results is the assumption of perfect channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). In the absence of channel knowledge the performance of various interference networks collapses to what is achievable by time division multiple access (TDMA). Robustinterference management techniques are promising solutions to maintain high achievable rates at various levels of CSIT, ranging from delayed to imperfect CSIT. In this survey, we outline and study two main research perspectives of how to robustly handle interference for cases where CSIT is imprecise on examples for non-distributed and distributed networks, namely broadcast and X-channel. To quantify the performance of these schemes, we use the well-known (generalized) degrees of freedom (GDoF) metric as the pre-log factor of achievable rates. These perspectives maintain the capacity benefits at similar levels as for perfect channel knowledge. These two perspectives are: First, scheme-adaptation that explicitly accounts for the level of channel knowledge and, second, relay-aided infrastructure enlargement to decrease channel knowledge dependency. The relaxation on CSIT requirements through these perspectives will ultimately lead to practical realizations of robust interference management techniques. The survey concludes with a discussion of open problems.	block cipher mode of operation;channel (communications);channel state information;code word;confidentiality;graph coloring;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mimo;network topology;relay channel;requirement;robustness (computer science);secure by design;spectral efficiency;statistical interference;system analysis;thrust;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Jaber Kakar;Aydin Sezgin	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19070362	information theory;mathematics;robustness (computer science);mathematical optimization;channel state information;wireless network;telecommunications;ranging;distributed computing;time division multiple access;interference (wave propagation);communication channel	Mobile	34.79140988656448	73.09115498105268	93820

However, a potential concern of multihop transmission is that the incurred delay also increases with the number of hops, and hence may pose challenges for delay-sensitive applications. This paper investigates the issue of delay from the perspective of error exponents, motivated by the fact that delay is tightly coupled with reliability. Two multihopping strategies are compared. The concatenated coding strategy, in which relay nodes perform inner coding and the source-destination pair further performs outer coding, is shown to provide near-optimal performance at low rates. In contrast, the pass-or-decode strategy, where relay nodes can either decode-and-forward or simply pass the received symbols, is shown to outperform the concatenated coding strategy as the achievable rate increases. The comparison suggests different system architectures for high and low rate applications,respectively.	concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error exponent;relay;type system	Wenyi Zhang;Urbashi Mitra	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557420	concatenated error correction code;additive white gaussian noise;channel code;reliability theory;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;probability of error;serial concatenated convolutional codes;reliability;mathematics;error exponent;encoding;statistics;systems architecture	Arch	34.197764657967966	74.4326322577014	93861

Timedivision half-duplex relay strategies have thus been proposed to address this limitation. Amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) are two well-known half-duplex relay strategies in the literature. Later, DF approach was extended by the so-called variable-rate two-phase relay strategy, in which the transmission rates for both phases are not necessarily the same. More recently, a novel half-duplex relay strategy based on the information theoretical concepts of broadcast channel (BC) and multiple access channel (MAC) models is proposed. In this approach, the source broadcasts distinct data flows to the destination and the relay respectively during the first phase, and in the second phase the relay forwards the received information whereas the source sends another data flow to the destination. In this paper, we will first develop optimal resource allocation, in terms of power and time, for these half- duplex relay strategies, and then compare their performance under various link conditions.	anisotropic filtering;dataflow;direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);internet relay chat;relay channel;transceiver;two-phase commit protocol	Yong Li;Wenbo Wang;Jia Kong;Mugen Peng	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506616	data flow diagram;local management interface;link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;signal processing;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;broadcasting;wireless;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.035483017671964	73.85404403540065	94436
8bba55770ea5d8fc76b98c7314a1de0f9a8dca65	privacy in index coding: k-limited-access schemes		In the traditional index coding problem, a server employs coding to send messages to n clients within the same broadcast domain. Each client already has some messages as side information and requests a particular unknown message from the server. All clients learn the coding matrix so that they can decode and retrieve their requested data. Our starting observation is that, learning the coding matrix can pose privacy concerns: it may enable a client to infer information about the requests and side information of other clients. In this paper, we mitigate this privacy concern by allowing each client to have limited access to the coding matrix. In particular, we design coding matrices so that each client needs only to learn some of (and not all) the rows to decode her requested message. By means of two different privacy metrics, we first show that this approach indeed increases the level of privacy. Based on this, we propose the use of k-limited-access schemes: given an index coding scheme that employs T transmissions, we create a k-limited-access scheme with Tk ≥ T transmissions, and with the property that each client needs at most k transmissions to decode her message. We derive upper and lower bounds on Tk for all values of k, and develop deterministic designs for these schemes, which are universal, i.e., independent of the coding matrix. We show that our schemes are order-optimal when either k or n is large. Moreover, we propose heuristics that complement the universal schemes for the case when both n and k are small. M.

The transmitter has two independent messages, each of which is intended for one of the receivers but needs to be kept asymptotically perfectly secret from the other. It is shown that, surprisingly, under a matrix power constraint both messages can be simultaneously transmitted at their respective maximal secrecy rates. To prove this result, the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel is revisited and a new characterization of its secrecy capacity is provided via a new coding scheme that uses artificial noise (a prefix channel) and random binning.	confidentiality;mimo;maximal set;product binning;transmitter	Ruoheng Liu;Tie Liu;H.

This approach provides a sound heuristic justification for the widespread appearence of entropy and divergence (Knliback’s discrimination) in source coding. The results are based on the notion of composition class a set made up of all the distinct source sequences of a given length which are permutations of one another. The asymptotic growth rate of any composition class is precisely an entropy. For a finite memoryless constant source ail members of a composition class have equal probability; the probability of any given class therefore is equal to the number of sequences in the class times the probability of an individual sequence in the class. The number of different composition classes is algebraic in block length, whereas the probability of a composition class is exponential, and the probability exponent is a divergence. Thus if a codeword is assigned to all sequences whose composition classes have rate less than some rate R, the probability of error is asymptotically the probability of the most probable composition class of rate greater than R. This is expressed in terms of a divergence. No use is made either of the law of large numbers or of Chebyshev’s inequality.	block code;classful network;code word;data compression;heuristic;linear algebra;major stationary source;shannon's source coding theorem;social inequality;stationary process;time complexity;vergence	Giuseppe Longo;Andrea Sgarro	1979	IEEE Trans.

This scheme consists of two phases: 1) Using the CoF framework based on CIA we convert the Gaussian network into a deterministic finite-field network. 2) Using linear precoding (over finite-field) we eliminate the end-to-end interference in the finite-field domain. Further, we exploit the algebraic structure of lattices to enhance the performance at finite SNR, such that beyond a degree of freedom result (also achievable by other means). We can also show that PCoF with CIA outperforms timesharing in a range of reasonably moderate SNR, with increasing gain as SNR increases.	code;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);linear algebra;mimo;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;time-sharing	Song-Nam Hong;Giuseppe Caire	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620622	channel code;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;precoding;statistics	Arch	35.025851481279815	74.21591455721315	95509

9aed045568f4685fcfa12c01a66559fa71ef05a4	fixed-rate zero-delay source coding for stationary vector-valued gauss-markov sources		We consider a fixed-rate zero-delay source coding problem where a stationary vector-valued Gauss-Markov source is compressed subject to an average mean-squared error (MSE) dis- tortion constraint. We address the problem by considering the Gaussian nonanticipative rate distortion function (NRDF) which is a lower bound to the zero-delay Gaussian RDF. Then, we use its corresponding optimal “test-channel” to characterize the stationary Gaus- sian NRDF and evaluate the corresponding information rates. We show that the Gaussian NRDF can be achieved by p-parallel fixed-rate scalar uniform quantizers of finite support with dithering signal up to a multiplicative distortion factor and a constant rate penalty. We demonstrate our framework with a numerical example.	data compression;distortion;dither;markov chain;markov information source;mean squared error;numerical analysis;rate–distortion theory;resource description framework;stationary process	Photios A.

Specifically we study the tradeoff between the achievable distortion pairs between the two users. The case when the bandwidth-expansion factors of the two users are identical has been well studied in the literature and to our best knowledge remains an open problem. Surprisingly, when the bandwidth expansion factors are different, we characterize a range of values where both the users simultaneously attain their point-to-point optimal distortion. Furthermore in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, this set includes nearly all points where the weaker user has the higher bandwidth expansion factor. In other cases, we propose an achievable tradeoff between the distortion pairs.	bandwidth expansion;distortion;point-to-point protocol;signal-to-noise ratio	Louis Tan;Ashish Khisti;Emina Soljanin	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283721	attenuation distortion;mathematical optimization;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;phase distortion	Theory	36.76083491389395	71.82125490200958	96016

Despite the ability for free space optical technology to transmit a narrow beam of light to a specific destination, it is still possible for an eavesdropper to gather light and decode information intended for another user. This paper addresses the use of spatial diversity to improve confidentiality, thereby impeding potential eavesdroppers. We find that spatial diversity with coherent detection and wavefront predistortion based on turbulence state feedback is an effectively technique to improve the confidentiality of free space optical communication.	carrier recovery;coherence (physics);confidentiality;no-communication theorem;transmitter;turbulence;visual intercept;wavefront .obj file	Andrew Puryear;Vincent W.

Cover, El Gamal and Salehi gave an achievable region in the form of single-letter entropy and mutual information expressions, without a single-letter converse. Cover, El Gamal and Saleh i also gave a converse in terms of somen-letter mutual informations, which are incomputable. In this paper, we derive an upper bound for the sum rate of this channel in a single-letter expressio n by using spectrum analysis. The incomputability of the sum rate of Cover, El Gamal and Salehi scheme comes from the difficulty of characterizing the possible joint distributi ons for the n-letter channel inputs. Here we introduce a new data process ing inequality, which leads to a single-letter necessary condi tion for these possible joint distributions. We develop a single-le tter upper bound for the sum rate by using this single-letter necessary condition on the possible joint distributions.	list of linux distributions;mutual information;social inequality	Wei Kang;Sennur Ulukus	2005	Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.		probability distribution;random variable;entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;data processing;information theory;mathematics;mutual information;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Robotics	35.4741395820822	68.99104281434877	97016
50369bde54dadba721df14c00d1bd15375d49967	side information in the binary stochastic block model: exact recovery		In the community detection problem, one may have access to additional observations (side information) about the label of each node. This paper studies the effect of the quality and quantity of side information on the phase transition of exact recovery in the binary symmetric stochastic block model (SBM) with n nodes. When the side information consists of the label observed through a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability α, and when log( α ) = O(log(n)), it is shown that side information has a positive effect on phase transition; the new phase transition under this condition is characterized. When α is constant or approaches zero sufficiently slowly, i.e., log( α ) = o(log(n)), it is shown that side information does not help exact recovery. When the side information consists of the label observed through a binary erasure channel with parameter ǫ, and when log(ǫ) = O(log(n)), it is shown that side information improves exact recovery and the new phase transition is characterized. If log(ǫ) = o(log(n)), then it is shown that side information is not helpful. The results are then generalized to an arbitrary side information of finite cardinality. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for exact recovery that are tight, except for one special case under M -ary side information. An efficient algorithm that incorporates the effect of side information is proposed that uses a partial recovery algorithm combined with a local improvement procedure. Sufficient conditions are derived for exact recovery under this efficient algorithm. Index Terms Community detection, Stochastic block model, Side information, Exact recovery.

Our work studies the general case of communicating with imperfect delayed CSIT, and proceeds to present novel precoding schemes and degrees-of-freedom (DoF) bounds that are often tight, and to constructively reveal that even substantially imperfect delayed-CSIT, is in fact sufficient to achieve the optimal DoF performance previously associated to perfect delayed CSIT. Going one step further, we also constructively show that, this same optimal performance can in fact be achieved in the presence of additional imperfection of the global CSIR - i.e., even with imperfect receiver estimates of the channel of the other receiver. Specifically, for feedback-quality exponent β describing the high-SNR asymptotic rate-of-decay of the mean square error of the delayed CSIT estimate, the derived DoF d(β) for a given exponent β ϵ [0,1], reveals that the optimal two-user MIMO-BC DoF region previously associated to perfect delayed CSIT, can in fact be achieved for any imperfect β ≥ N/min(M, 2N) + N. Interestingly, for all the cases studied here, the derived quality threshold β* ≡Δ arg minβ{d(β) = d'} for any given symmetric DoF d', accepts the simple form of β* = (d'-d(0))/(d(l)-d(0)), describing the fraction of the DoF gap - between the no-CSIT and the full delayed CSIT case - that is covered to reach the target d'. The potential of an up to 1/β*-fold reduction in feedback bits, can be advantageous in the presence of feedback links with limited reliability and limited capacity.	channel state information;feedback;mimo;mean squared error;sensitivity index;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Jinyuan Chen;Petros Elia	2013	2013 IEEE 14th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2013.6612039	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Mobile	36.20373129778008	73.23885429423542	97197

While the second algorithm, called LZ78, has been sufficiently analyzed in the literature, the first, LZ77, has not yet. LZ77 parses input data into a sequence of phrases, each of which is the longest match in a fixed-sized sliding window which consists of the previously encoded M symbols. Each phrase is replaced by a pointer to denote the longest match in the window. Then, a window slides to just before the next symbol to he encoded, and so on. In this paper, we modify the algorithm of LZ77 to restrict pointers to starting only at the boundary of a previously parsed phrase in a window. Although the number of parsed phrases should increase more than those in LZ77, the amount of bits needed to encode pointers is considerably reduced since the number of possible positions to he encoded is much smaller. Then, we show that for any stationary finite state source, the modified LZ77 code is asymptotically optimal with the convergence rate O(log log M / log M ) where M is the size of a sliding window.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;encode;lz77 and lz78;lempel–ziv–stac;lempel–ziv–welch;parsing;pointer (computer programming);rate of convergence;stationary process;universal code (data compression)	Hiroyoshi Morita;Kingo Kobayashi	1993	IEEE Trans.

We propose a computationally efficient localization scheme by modeling it as an iterative classification problem. We design coding theory based iterative approaches for target localization where at every iteration, the fusion center (FC) solves an M-ary hypothesis testing problem and decides the region of interest for the next iteration. The coding theory based iterative approach works well even in the presence of Byzantine (malicious) sensors in the network. We further consider the effect of non-ideal channels. We suggest the use of soft-decision decoding to compensate for the loss due to the presence of fading channels between the local sensors and FC. We evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes in terms of the Byzantine fault tolerance capability and probability of detection of the target region. We also present performance bounds, which help us in designing the system. We provide asymptotic analysis of the proposed schemes and show that the schemes achieve perfect region detection irrespective of the noise variance when the number of sensors tends to infinity. Our numerical results show that the proposed schemes provide a similar performance in terms of mean square error as compared with the traditional maximum likelihood estimation but are computationally much more efficient and are resilient to errors due to Byzantines and non-ideal channels.	algorithmic efficiency;byzantine fault tolerance;coding theory;forward error correction;iteration;malware;mean squared error;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing);region of interest;sensor;soft-decision decoder	Aditya Vempaty;Yunghsiang Sam Han;Pramod K.

4d7490285717d1218678a3971b0908fe33ca89f3	skip-sliding window codes		Constrained coding is used widely in digital communication and storage systems. In this paper, we study a generalized sliding window constraint called the skip-sliding window constraint. A skip-sliding window (SSW) code is defined in terms of the length <tex>$L$</tex> of a sliding window, skip length <tex>$J$</tex>, and cost constraint <tex>$E$</tex> in each sliding window. Each valid codeword of length <tex>$L+kJ$</tex> is determined by <tex>$k+1$</tex> windows of length <tex>$L$</tex> where window <tex>$i$</tex> starts at <tex>$(iJ+1)$</tex>th symbol for all non-negative integers <tex>$i$</tex> such that <tex>$i\leq k$</tex>; and the cost constraint <tex>$E$</tex> in each window must be satisfied. In this work, two methods are given to enumerate the size of SSW codes. Using the proposed enumeration methods, the noiseless capacity of binary SSW codes is determined and observations such as greater capacity than other classes of codes are made. Moreover, some noisy capacity bounds are given. SSW coding constraints arise in various applications including simultaneous energy and information transfer.	code word;enumerated type;microsoft windows;numerical analysis;qr code;window function	Ting-Yi Wu;Anshoo Tandon;Lav R.

A discrete memoryless source encodes its source sequence using the standard Wyner-Ziv coding technique and forwards the bin index to another source that employs the bin index and its own correlated sequence to decode the first source's sequence. There is an adversary who may arbitrarily modify the bin index sent to the decoder. It is assumed the adversary may base the attack on the true bin index, its own sequence (which may be correlated to both the encoder and decoder sequences) as well as the known codebook used by the sources. It is shown that a non-simulatability condition on the joint source distribution is necessary and sufficient to achieve information integrity. However, the additional requirement of information integrity may incur a penalty on the rate-distortion performance.	adversary (cryptography);codebook;computer programming;data compression;data integrity;distortion;encoder;huffman coding;key (cryptography);key-agreement protocol;lossy compression;public-key cryptography	Eric Graves;Tan F.

In addition, both the channel inputs and channel disturbances can be arbitrary, except that the mutual information function for each channel is assumed strictly concave with respect to the input power. Hence, the channel capacity below which the code rate is guaranteed to be attainable by a sequence of codes with vanishing error can be determined by the minimum mutual information among any K out of N channels. We then investigate the power allocation that maximizes this minimum mutual information subject to a total power constraint. As a result, the optimal solution can be determined via a systematic algorithmic procedure by performing at most K single-power-sum-constrained maximizations. Based on this result, the closed-form formula of the optimal power allocation for an (N,K) -limited access channel with channel inputs and additive noises, respectively, scaled from two independent and identically distributed random vectors of length N is subsequently established, and is shown to be well interpreted by a two-phase water-filling principle. Specifically, in the first noise-power redistribution phase, the least N-K noise powers (equivalently, second moments) are first poured (as noise water) into a tank consisting of K interconnected unit-width vessels with solid base heights, respectively, equal to the remaining K largest noise powers. Afterward, those W vessels either with noise water inside or with solid base height equal to the new water surface level are subdivided into N-K+W vessels of rectangular shape with the same heights (as the water surface level) and widths in proportion to their noise powers. In the second signal-power allocation phase, the heights of vessel bases will be first either lifted or lowered according to the total signal power and channel mutual information functions, followed by the usual signal-power water-filling scheme. The two-phase water-filling interpretation then hints that the degree of “noisiness” for a general (possibly, nonadditive and non-Gaussian) limited access channel might be identified by composing the derivative of the mutual information function with its inverse.	algorithm;channel capacity;code rate;concave function;mutual information;two-phase commit protocol;utility functions on indivisible goods	Shih-Wei Wang;Po-Ning Chen;Chung-Hsuan Wang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2183338	independent and identically distributed random variables;mathematical optimization;resource allocation;noise;resource management;mathematics;mutual information;channel capacity;statistics;mimo	Theory	36.827488019998015	73.04863068014262	98500

In particular, we study the joint probability distribution of channel outputs in correlated Rayleigh fading channels in response to constant power signaling, such as M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK). We show that the distribution of the channel output at any given sampling time is marginally Gaussian. However, the joint distribution of a sequence of channel outputs cannot be jointly Gaussian. A consequence of this result is that the information rates stated to be exact in two recent contributions, are strict upper bounds to the achievable data rates. We examine the tightness of these upper bounds by comparing them with the MPSK upper bound under perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption. We find that the CSI upper bound is considerably tighter in slow fading channels, high signal-to-noise ratios, and low-dimension (such as binary) PSK signaling.	bekenstein bound;channel state information;information theory;key (cryptography);modulation;pre-shared key;rayleigh fading;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	Rauf Iqbal;Parastoo Sadeghi;Thushara Dheemantha Abhayapala	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.482	fading distribution;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;mathematics;channel state information;joint probability distribution;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;statistics	ML	38.41512989577374	74.45619997223868	98600

Motivated by the fundamental question of how much feedback is necessary to achieve a certain performance, this work seeks to establish bounds on the tradeoff between degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance and CSIT feedback quality. Specifically, this work provides a novel DoF region outer bound for the general K-user M ×1 MISO BC with partial current CSIT, which naturally bridges the gap between the case of having no current CSIT (only delayed CSIT, or no CSIT) and the case with full CSIT. The work then characterizes the minimum CSIT feedback that is necessary for any point of the sum DoF, which is optimal for the case with M ≥ K, and the case with M = 2, K = 3.	channel state information;feedback;multi-user;system analysis;transmitter	Jinyuan Chen;Sheng Yang;Petros Elia	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620376	transmitter;coherence;telecommunications;mathematics;channel state information;statistics	Vision	36.012635986484376	73.0393549087956	98694

However, the current secrecy outage formulation has two major limitations in evaluating the secrecy performance: a) the amount of information leakage to the eavesdropper cannot be characterized when an outage occurs, b) the current formulation does not give insights into the eavesdropper's decodability of confidential messages. To overcome such limitations and obtain in-depth understanding of secrecy performance over wireless fading channels, this paper proposes three new secrecy measures for different practical aims, namely, 1) generalized secrecy outage probability, 2) asymptotic lower bound on eavesdropper's decoding error probability, and 3) average information leakage rate. A specific example of wireless transmissions with a fixed-rate wiretap code is given to illustrate the use of the proposed secrecy measures.	best, worst and average case;confidentiality;downtime;emoticon;entropy (information theory);information leakage;information-theoretic security;numerical analysis;requirement;secure communication;spectral leakage;sun outage	Biao He;Xiangyun Zhou	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036893	telecommunications;computer science;information security;probability of error;computer security;fading;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.7929782732865	69.8203975435804	98710

Toward that end, we present the secrecy metric of degrees of freedom in an attacker's knowledge of the cryptogram, which is similar to equivocation. Using this notion of secrecy, we show how a specific practical channel coding system can be used to hide information about the ciphertext, thus increasing the difficulty of cryptographic attacks. The system setup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through independent packet erasure channels (PECs) with public feedback for authenticated automatic repeat-request (ARQ). The code design relies on puncturing nonsystematic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the intent of inflicting an eavesdropper with stopping sets in the decoder. The design amplifies errors when stopping sets occur such that a receiver must guess all the channel-erased bits correctly to avoid an error rate of one half in the ciphertext. We extend previous results on the coding scheme by giving design criteria that reduce the effectiveness of a maximum-likelihood (ML) attack to that of a message-passing (MP) attack. We further extend security analysis to models with multiple receivers and collaborative attackers. Cryptographic security is even enhanced by the system when eavesdroppers have better channel quality than legitimate receivers.	authentication;automatic repeat request;binary erasure channel;bit error rate;channel (communications);channel capacity;ciphertext;cryptogram;cryptography;cryptosystem;download;forward error correction;low-density parity-check code;message passing;network packet;puncturing;traverse;time complexity	Willie K.

As a solution to the first three problems, the multidimensional signaling has been proposed recently by author. In multidimensional signaling, for the conveyance information over spatial domain multiplexing (SDM) based fibers (few-mode fibers, few-core fibers, few-mode few- core fibers), all available degrees of freedoms, be optical or electrical, have been employed. In electrical domain discrete-time basis functions (such as Slepian sequences) have been employed. In optical domain, both polarization states and spatial modes have been employed. Additionally, the orthogonal division multiplexing (ODM) has been employed in optical domain to enable beyond 1 Pb/s serial optical transport over single-mode fibers. With SDM, the serial optical transport over SDM fibers exceeding 10 Pb/s is achievable. Concepts of statistical physics and information theory have been used in energy-efficient multidimensional signal constellation design. To solve for the security issues problem, the use of FBGs with impulse responses derived from mutually orthogonal Slepian sequences has been advocated.	basis function;division by zero;information theory;low-density parity-check code;modulation;multidimensional signal processing;multiplexing;next-generation network;oracle data mining;polarization (waves);signalling system no. 7	Ivan B.

41b5680725d3bd3e595cd629c0a6cf72a1c4de47	on the minimum subspace coding capacity of multiplicative finite-field matrix channels with a given rank distribution	channel estimation;receivers;network coding;precoding;matrix decomposition;transmitters	In the scenario of random linear network coding, the channel input and output are matrices over a finite field related by a multiplicative channel matrix. Such channels are called the multiplicative finite-field matrix channels (MFFMC). To communicate over such channels, subspace coding is a promising non-coherent network coding approach which does not require the estimation of the channel matrix. The capacity of subspace coding over the general MFFMC is still unknown (except for some special cases, such as the purely random channel and the uniform full rank channel). In this paper, for a given rank distribution, a class of worst-case channels is characterized and proved to achieve the minimum capacity of subspace coding. Hence the capacity of such a class of channels can serve as the tightest lower bound on the capacity of subspace coding over the MFFMC. Interestingly, for the purely random channel, the uniform full rank channel and the uniform given rank channel, our bound gives the exact value of the capacity of subspace coding. Numerical results show that our bound is tighter than some existing bound at small-to-moderate packet lengths.	best, worst and average case;coherence (physics);input/output;linear network coding;network packet	Chenchen Liu;Xiaolin Li;Baojian Zhou;Wai Ho Mow	2016	2016 22nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2016.7581511	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;channel capacity	Theory	36.19902100445739	71.8244631365662	99505

In this paper, we consider the transmission of common confidential data from a single-antenna transmitter to multiple multi-antenna receivers in the presence of multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Both the receivers and eavesdroppers employ maximal-ratio combining (MRC) to combine the signals received at multiple antennas. For the considered system, we derive its connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability to characterize the reliability level and the security level, respectively. Numerical results are also provided to analyze the tradeoff among the reliability and security performances and the number of antennas (or nodes) of either receivers or eavesdroppers.	channel (communications);confidentiality;downtime;information theory;information-theoretic security;maximal set;multicast;performance;rayleigh fading;reliability engineering;sun outage;telecommunications network;transmitter	Jinxiao Zhu;Yin Chen;Yoshitaka Nakamura;Xiaohong Jiang;Osamu Takahashi;Norio Shiratori	2015	2015 Eighth International Conference on Mobile Computing and Ubiquitous Networking (ICMU)	10.1109/ICMU.2015.7061056	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	34.008695806332085	71.00393079054876	99575

A Neyman–Pearson-like test is proposed and its non-asymptotic performance is clarified, for a short block length, it is numerically determined that the proposed test is superior to the previously reported Hoeffding-like test proposed by Han–Kobayashi. For a large deviation regime, it is shown that our proposed test achieves an optimal trade-off between the type I and type II exponents presented by Han–Kobayashi. Among the class of symmetric (type-based) testing schemes, when the type I error probability is non-vanishing, the proposed test is optimal up to the second-order term of the type II error exponent; the latter term is characterized in terms of the variance of the projected relative entropy density. The information geometry method plays an important role in the analysis as well as the construction of the test.	block code;classical xy model;cylinder seal;emoticon;encoder;entity–relationship model;error exponent;first-order predicate;han unification;information geometry;kullback–leibler divergence;multiseat configuration;numerical analysis;pokémon y;rewrite (programming)	Shun Watanabe	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2778252	discrete mathematics;kullback–leibler divergence;statistics;probability of error;type i and type ii errors;information geometry;statistical hypothesis testing;computer science;exponent;random variable;pearson's chi-squared test	SE	35.34563272820563	64.48324772198121	100209

The sensor node observes an unknown correlated circularly wide-sense stationary (c.w.s.s.) Gaussian field and communicates its observations to a remote fusion center using the energy it harvested. The fusion center employs minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation to reconstruct the unknown field. The distortion minimization problem under the online scheme, where the sensor has only access to the statistical information for the future energy packets is considered. We provide performance bounds on the achievable distortion under a slotted block transmission scheme, where at each transmission time slot, the data and the energy buffer is completely emptied. Our bounds provide insight to the trade-off between the buffer sizes and the achievable distortion. These trade-offs illustrate the insensitivity of the performance to the buffer size for signals with low degree of freedom and suggest performance improvements with increasing buffer size for signals with relatively higher degree of freedom.	data buffer;distortion;sensor node;stationary process	Ayça Özçelikkale;Tomas McKelvey;Mats Viberg	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541341	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics	Arch	29.66530199247953	73.16268632616456	100697

Recently, Avestimehr et al. have proposed a deterministic network model to approximate multiuser wireless networks. This model, known as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature as well as the multiuser interference inherent in the wireless medium. For the types of connections we consider, we show that the results of Avestimehr et al. under the ADT model can be reinterpreted within the algebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Médard. Using this framework, we propose an efficient distributed linear code construction for the deterministic wireless multicast relay network model. Unlike several previous coding schemes, we do not attempt to find flows in the network. Instead, for a layered network, we maintain an invariant where it is required that at each stage of the code construction, certain sets of codewords are linearly independent.	approximation algorithm;block code;code word;complexity;information theory;interference (communication);linear algebra;linear code;linear network coding;max-flow min-cut theorem;minimum cut;multi-user;multicast;network model;relay;unicast	MinJi Kim;Elona Erez;Edmund M.

We first characterize the underlying information theoretic limits, under different assumptions on the channel spatial and temporal correlation function. Our analysis reveals a novel role of “dumb antennas” in overcoming the negative impact of spatial correlation on the achievable secrecy rates. We further develop an adaptive rate allocation policy, which achieves higher secrecy rates in temporally correlated channels, and explicit constructions for ARQ secrecy coding that enjoy low implementation complexity. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a unified framework for ARQ-based secrecy in Wi-Fi networks. By exploiting the existing ARQ mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 standard, we develop security overlays that offer strong security guarantees at the expense of only minor modifications in the medium access layer. Our numerical results establish the achievability of nonzero secrecy rates even when the eavesdropper channel is less noisy, on the average, than the legitimate channel, while our Linux-based prototype demonstrates the efficiency of our ARQ overlays in mitigating all known, passive and active, Wi-Fi attacks at the expense of a minimal increase in the link setup time and a small loss in throughput.	automatic repeat request;flip-flop (electronics);information theory;linux;numerical analysis;prototype;throughput;unified framework	Yara Abdallah;Mohamed Abdel Latif;Moustafa Youssef;Ahmed Sultan;Hesham El Gamal	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2011.2123093	intrusion detection system;communications protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;spatial correlation;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;information security;automatic repeat request;computer security;correlation;linux kernel;physical layer;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.02471273508765	69.74906144997031	101763

In fact, nano-technologies like, e.g., molecular, nano-fluidic, nano-magnetic (and even FinFETs), might be used for mapping consecutive systems. We shall start by mentioning previous results for 1D consecutive systems, before focusing on 2D ones. After introducing 2D consecutive systems, the paper will present bounds for estimating their reliability. Simulation results for particular 2D consecutive cases will show that some of the bounds are in fact exact. Finally, comparisons of classical and consecutive schemes will show their advantages, and will be followed by conclusions and future directions of research.	bit error rate;gnu nano;simulation	Valeriu Beiu;Leonard Daus	2015	2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300038	reliability;mathematics;statistics	Theory	35.120817397054694	60.97705958023929	102296

The studied quantity is expressed as Shannon mutual information between the initial qubit state and the outcomes of a consecutive measurement.

This machinery is extremely powerful in achieving the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of single antenna systems. The scheme of real interference alignment is based on designing single-layer and multilayer constellations used for modulating information messages at the transmitters. We show that constellations can be aligned in a similar fashion as that of vectors in multiple antenna systems and space can be broken up into fractional dimensions. The performance analysis of the signaling scheme makes use of a recent result in the field of Diophantine approximation, which states that the convergence part of the Khintchine-Groshev theorem holds for points on nondegenerate manifolds. Using real interference alignment, we obtain the sum DoF of two model channels, namely the Gaussian interference channel (IC) and the X channel. It is proved that the sum DoF of the K-user IC is (K/2) for almost all channel parameters. We also prove that the sum DoF of the X-channel with K transmitters and M receivers is (K M/K + M - 1) for almost all channel parameters.	approximation;catastrophic interference;interference (communication);transmitter	Abolfazl Seyed Motahari;Shahab Oveis Gharan;Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali;Amir K.

A similar minimax theorem is established in the quadratic Gaussian setting, which is further leveraged to analyze the special case where the minimum sum rate subject to two levels of distortion constraints (with the second level imposed on the complete set of descriptions) is attained; in particular, we determine the minimum achievable distortions at the intermediate levels.	distortion;minimax theorem;multiple description coding;window function	Lin Song;Shuo Shao;Jun Chen	2013	2013 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2013.6691217	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	AI	35.741718342262	65.19264896165416	104281

The overheard signals, instead of being treated as interference, furnish the basis for cooperation among otherwise uncoordinated users. Although cooperative communications is not equivalent to virtual Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) communications, it has been shown to benefit the rate performance of all the involved source-destination pairs without increasing neither their transmit powers nor the channel bandwidth. This paper develops a new sum-rate outer bound for Gaussian IFC-GFs based on the idea of giving the receivers the least informative GF signal as side information. We compare our new outer bound with bounds available in the literature and numerically show for which network parameters our bound strictly improves on existing ones.	grammatical framework;industry foundation classes;information;interference (communication);mimo;numerical analysis	Shuang Echo Yang;Daniela Tuninetti	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205970	transmitter;telecommunications;noise;gaussian process;mathematics;multiplexing;statistics	Arch	34.85081413324615	73.01667861573003	104327

This paper focuses on the class of type-threshold functions, e.g., the maximum and the indicator functions. A simple network model capturing both the broadcast and superposition properties of wireless channels is considered: the collocated Gaussian network. A general multiround coding scheme exploiting superposition and interaction (through broadcast) is developed. Through careful scheduling of concurrent transmissions to reduce redundancy, it is shown that given any independent measurement distribution, all type-threshold functions can be computed reliably with a nonvanishing rate in the collocated Gaussian network, even if the number of sensors tends to infinity.	characteristic function (convex analysis);interactive computation;network model;quantum superposition;scheduling (computing);sensor;universal quantification	Chien-Yi Wang;Sang-Woon Jeon;Michael Gastpar	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2455977	entropy;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;reliability;distributed computing;sensor fusion;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computational model;encoding;statistics	Mobile	33.11520093068733	65.19186339457482	104329

The main focus is the sufficient and necessary conditions on the n umber of measurements for support recovery to be reliable. By drawing an analogy between the problem of s upport recovery and the problem of channel coding over the Gaussian multiple access channel, and explo iting mathematical tools developed for the latter problem, we obtain an information theoretic framewo rk for analyzing the performance limits of support recovery. Sharp sufficient and necessary condition s on the number of measurements in terms of the signal sparsity level and the measurement noise level ar e derived. Specifically, when the number of nonzero entries is held fixed, the exact asymptotics on the nu mber of measurements for support recovery is developed. When the number of nonzero entries increases i n certain manners, we obtain sufficient conditions tighter than existing results. In addition, we s how that the proposed methodology can deal with a variety of models of sparse signal recovery, hence dem onstrating its potential as an effective analytical tool.	channel capacity;detection theory;forward error correction;noise (electronics);sparse matrix	Yuzhe Jin;Young-Han Kim;Bhaskar D.

We consider the multimedia data transmissions in a dual-hop SIN communication scenario, where multiple disjoint source nodes need to transmit their UEP rateless coded data to a destination via a dynamic relay. We formulate the optimization problems to provide optimal degree distributions on the direct links and the dynamic relay links to satisfy the required error protection levels. The optimization methods are based on the And–Or tree analysis and can be solved by multi-objective programming. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the optimal DURC scheme, and simulation results show that the proposed DURC scheme can effectively provide UEP property under a variety of error requirements.	and–or tree;degree distribution;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;mebibyte;relay;requirement;simulation	Jian Jiao;Yi Yang;Bowen Feng;Shaohua Wu;Yonghui Li;Qinyu Zhang	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19010038	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	DB	32.35529429190077	72.94643228564436	104482

We consider transmission of packets from a single source to many receivers over a single-hop broadcast erasure channel with heterogeneous links. We propose a predictive model to minimize feedback as well as extraneous data transmissions by the source. In addition, we use the method of types to provide a lower bound for the expected total transmission time, and use simulations to show that our protocol operates close to this lower bound. We show that with SMART, counter to conventional wisdom, the average user's QoE improves slightly as the number of users increases. We demonstrate that SMART's algorithmic simplicity enables multicast transmissions that on average take fewer than 2 feedback rounds to complete. We show the favorable scalability of our technique with the number of users, which enables reliable quality of experience. We also show the robustness of this scheme to uncertainty in the number of receiving nodes, and packet erasure probability, as well as to partial loss of the feedback. Furthermore, we show that SMART performs nearly as well as an omniscient transmitter that requires no feedback.	acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;asymptotically optimal algorithm;binary erasure channel;channel state information;feedback;linear network coding;markov chain;multicast;network packet;predictive modelling;smart;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter	Arman Rezaee;Flávio du Pin Calmon;Linda M.

78eabbab985706f4b8b88b1100dc7242dedde211	on the design of signature codes in decentralized wireless networks	wireless network;entropy power inequality;multiuser interference;information theory	This paper addresses a unified approach towards communication in decentralized wireless networks of separate transmitter-receiver pairs. Different transmitters are connected to different receivers through channels with static and non-frequency selective gains. In general, users are unaware of each other’s codebooks and there is no central controller to assign the resources in the network to the users. A randomized signaling scheme is introduced in which each user locally spreads its Gaussian signal along a randomly generated spreading code comprised of a sequence of nonzero elements over a certain alphabet. Along with spreading, each transmitter also masks its output independently from transmission to transmission. Using a conditional version of entropy power inequality and a key lemma on the differential entropy of mixed Gaussian random vectors, achievable rates are developed for the users. Assuming the channel gains are realization of independent continuous random variables, each user finds the optimum parameters in constructing the randomized spreading and masking sequences by maximizing the average achievable rate per user. It is seen that as the number of users increases, the achievable Sum Multiplexing Gain of the network approaches that of a centralized orthogonal scheme where multiuser interference is completely avoided. An interesting observation is that in general the elements of a spreading code are not equiprobable over the underlying alphabet. This is in contrast to the customary use of binary PN codes in spread spectrum communications in which the code elements may be selected with equal probability over {−1, 1}. This particularly happens if the number of active users is greater than three. Finally, using the recently developed extremal inequality of Liu-Viswanath, we present an optimality result showing that transmission of Gaussian signals via spreading and masking yields higher achievable rates than the maximum achievable rate attained by applying masking only. ar X iv :1 00 3. 04 45 v1 [ cs .I T ] 1 M ar 2 01 0	centralized computing;codebook;differential entropy;entropy power inequality;interference (communication);multi-user;multiplexing;procedural generation;qr code;randomized algorithm;social inequality;transmitter	Kamyar Moshksar;Amir K.

In part I of this work, it has been shown for the AVMAC without the MCS that in order for the achievable rate region for deterministic codes and the average probability of error criterion to be nonempty, it was sufficient if the AVC were x nonsymmetrizable, y nonsymmetrizable, and xy nonsymmetrizable. (The necessity of these conditions had been shown earlier by Gubner (1990).) Let R/sub R/(W) denote the random code achievable rate region of the AVMAC W. In the present paper, the authors, in effect, trade the loss in achievable rates due to symmetrizability off the gains provided by the MCS. Let R(W, (K, L)) represent the achievable rate region of the AVC W with MCS, for deterministic codes and the average probability of error criterion. There are two main results: (1) if I(K/spl and/L)>0, then R(W, (K, L)) has a nonempty interior iff R/sub R/(W) does too and W is xy nonsymmetrizable; and (2) if I(K/spl and/L)>0, H(K|L)>0,H(L|K)>0 then the MCS can be transmitted over the AVMAC iff R/sub R/(W) has a nonempty interior and W is xy nonsymmetrizable.	transmission (bittorrent client)	Rudolf Ahlswede;Ning Cai	1999	IEEE Trans.

We present two system models, the parallel unshared-relay broadcast channel and the parallel shared-relay broadcast channel. In the first system, each relay node is peculiar to one of the users and does not assist any other user. In the second system, each relay node is shared by all users and assists all of them. Achievable rate regions for these two different channel models are derived in the discrete memoryless case. We also provide an outer bound on the rate regions, which is tighter than the cut-set bound.	relay	Liang Chen	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513530	database index;random variable;atomic broadcast;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;relay channel;encoding;statistics;computer network	Theory	34.55351157623342	71.55136455256934	105267

Under these metrics, the estimate-and-forward (EF) protocol has the best performance in a wide variety of cases. The EF protocol is defined as the relaying protocol in which the relay forwards an estimate of its received information. Although optimal estimates have been identified in the literature, an implementable detector at the receiver still remains to be found. In this paper, we solve this open problem by using a piecewise linear approximation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate (pLAM) of the received symbol at the relay. In the three-node cooperative wireless relay network, this new piecewise linear approximation leads to an analytical form of the detector at the destination. Furthermore, we show that the symbol error rates of this new framework closely approximate the true performance of EF when using a MMSE estimate of the received symbol at the relay. Finally, we provide several examples where we apply this new pLAM approach to multiple modulation schemes such as BPSK and 16-QAM, in both one- and two-way relay networks.	ampersand;approximation algorithm;entity framework;linear approximation;mean squared error;modulation;piecewise linear continuation;point-to-point (telecommunications);relay;sensor	Corina I.

The asymptotic (in the length) performance of such a combination for a fixed number of iterations is given by density evolution. Letting the number of iterations tend to infinity we get the density evolution (DE) threshold, the largest channel parameter so that the bit error probability tends to zero as a function of the iterations. In practice, we often work with short codes and perform a large number of iterations. It is, therefore, interesting to consider what happens if in the standard analysis we exchange the order in which the blocklength and the number of iterations diverge to infinity. In particular, we can ask whether both limits give the same threshold. Although empirical observations strongly suggest that the exchange of limits is valid for all channel parameters, we limit our discussion to channel parameters below the DE threshold. Specifically, we show that as long as the message reliabilities are bounded and other technical conditions are met, the bit error probability vanishes up to a nontrivial threshold regardless of how the limit is taken. This threshold is equal to the DE threshold when the minimum degree of the variable nodes is at least five and strictly less than the DE threshold for smaller degrees.	bit error rate;image scaling;iteration;low-density parity-check code;message authentication code;message passing;quantum channel	Satish Babu Korada;Rüdiger L.

2692f2bc4a51a7d4a52667618a22181aff21c07a	security and performance of continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems. (performance et sécurité de dispositifs de distribution quantique de clés à variables continues)		This thesis focuses on a cryptographic primitive that allows two distant parties, usually called Alice and Bob, to generate an arbitrary amount of secret key even in the presence of an eavesdropper, provided that they share a short initial secret message. This primitive is called quantum key distribution, or in short QKD; and differs from classical key distribution primitives in the sense that no assumption on the capacities of the eavesdropper is required to prove the security of the scheme. While several QKD protocols exist, we focus our study on continuous-variable protocols, which encode the information on the quadratures of the electromagnetic field. Some of these protocols are of particular interest because they can be implemented with standard fiber-based telecommunication components and feature an interferometric detection scheme that exhibits a high resistance to the noise induced by potential adjacent classical channels that propagate on the same optical fiber. The advantage of QKD over classical primitives relies on fundamental quantum physics principles such as the uncertainty principle: in a carefully designed QKD protocol, an eavesdropper cannot interact with the quantum system without introducing some noise which can be quantified by the parties of the protocol. However, even when there is no active eavesdropper, some errors inevitably occur during the transmission of quantum states between Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob must correct these errors to agree on a common bit string. Since this step is done by revealing some information on a public channel, it results in a limitation of the protocol in terms of tolerance to noise and losses. To overcome this, we develop efficient errorcorrecting codes that allow to extend the range of a QKD protocol based on a Gaussian modulation of the quadratures of the electromagnetic field. Security proofs for QKD protocols typically consider an ideal description of the protocol. In practice, however, one has to consider the distance between a practical implementation of a QKD protocol and its theoretical description. We study different aspects of a practical implementation of a Gaussian continuous-variable QKD protocol, such as the imperfect statistical estimation (in the finite-size scenario) of the parameters that are relevant to the security of the protocol and the quality of the practical Gaussian modulation of coherent states. We also consider a calibration attack that can lead to a powerful eavesdropping strategy. We demonstrate experimentally the distribution of secret keys over a 80 km fiber link when taking into account all the known imperfections of our system. Finally, we make initial deployment tests involving our QKD system and wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) classical channels on the same fiber link. We also demonstrate the long-term stability of our system in combination with high-speed classical encryptors.	alice and bob;bit array;coherent states;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;encode;estimation theory;experiment;key (cryptography);modulation;optical fiber;qr code;quantum key distribution;quantum mechanics;quantum state;quantum system;software deployment;uncertainty principle;wavelength-division multiplexing	Paul Jouguet	2013				Crypto	30.09060275322765	66.09891479818113	105842

Modern Coding Theory summarizes the state of the art in iterative coding, with particular emphasis on the underlying theory. Starting with Gallager's original ensemble of low-density parity-check codes as a representative example, focus is placed on the techniques to analyze and design practical iterative coding systems. The basic concepts are then extended for several general codes, including the practically important class of turbo codes. This book takes advantage of the simplicity of the binary erasure channel to develop analytical techniques and intuition, which are then applied to general channel models. A chapter on factor graphs helps to unify the important topics of information theory, coding, and communication theory. Covering the most recent advances in the field, this book is a valuable resource for graduate students in electrical engineering and computer science, as well as practitioners who need to decide which coding scheme to employ, how to design a new scheme, or how to improve an existing system.

These networks feature a single destination node and multiple nodes that can be either sources or relays or both. We show that simple inner and outer bounds on the capacity region obtained from noisy network coding exhibit a submodular structure and differ only in a constant, which is independent of the channel parameters and grows linearly only in the number of dedicated relay nodes. This tightens previous results where the gap grows linear in the total network size. Furthermore, the combination of submodularity with convexity of the bound expressions with respect to the optimal quantization noise parameters leads to an efficient characterization of a noisy network coding achievable rate region for multiple access relay networks via Lagrangian duality.	augmented lagrangian method;convex function;duality (optimization);linear network coding;quantization (signal processing);relay;shortest path problem;submodular set function	Maximilian Riemensberger;Lennart Gerdes;Wolfgang Utschick	2014	2014 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2014.6941695	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;relay channel	ML	33.78325680242814	71.82043519385118	106763

However, existing coding schemes have large redundancy for packets are coded by a random way or some certain probability distributions. Although the Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes are designed without redundancy, they are not effective when the packet erasure probability is high. To reduce the coding redundancy, lots of work use the receiver side information to adjust the codes construction on-the-fly, which is more beneficial. However, these work have disadvantages:1) the coding redundancy is also large; 2) the feedback schemes have great affect on performance. In this paper, we design a robust feedback scheme and a novel """"Rateless Online MDS Code""""(ROME) to eliminate the coding redundancy. Our contributions include that our codes are throughput optimal codes without redundancy, and the analysis on theoretical finite field size bound to achieve throughput optimal codes. We also design the finite field construction to speed up the encoding and decoding process.

Recently, a configurable transceiver architecture able to regulate its transmitting power based on the location of the destination node has been proposed. Unfortunately, the use of such transceiver requires a costly, time consuming and complex characterization phase performed at design time and mainly based on the use of field solver simulators whose accuracy has not yet been proved in the context of integrated on-chip antennas. In this paper we present a closed loop transmitting power self-calibration mechanism which allows to determine on-line the optimal transmitting power for each transmitting and receiving pair in a WiNoC. The proposed mechanism is general and can be applied to any WiNoC architecture with a low overhead in terms of silicon area. Its application to three well known WiNoC architectures shows its effectiveness in drastically reducing the overall communication energy (up to 50%) with a limited impact on performance.	bit error rate;closed-loop transfer function;electromagnetic field solver;network on a chip;online and offline;overhead (computing);reliability engineering;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;transceiver;transmitter	Andrea Mineo;Mohd Shahrizal Rusli;Maurizio Palesi;Giuseppe Ascia;Vincenzo Catania;Muhammad N.

In addition, m eavesdropper nodes are uniformly and independently distributed in [0,1]. For a randomly selected source-destination pair, we consider the problem of securely delivering a message from the source to the destination and we present achievable results on the number of eavesdropper nodes that can be tolerated by the network. Our constructions make use of cooperative jamming, in which nodes located close to the eavesdroppers generate artificial noise. For the one-dimensional network case, our results provide an improvement to the connectivity properties of the recently-introduced secrecy graph which is disconnected for any positive number of eavesdroppers without cooperative jamming. We consider cases of both known and unknown eavesdropper locations. For known eavesdropper locations, we show that a message can be securely delivered from the source to the destination with probability one as the number of nodes n goes to infinity, for any number of independent eavesdroppers m(n) satisfying equation. For unknown eavesdropper locations, we present a construction which can tolerate m(n) = o(n/ log n) under the assumption of independent eavesdroppers, but which is fragile in the face of collaborating eavesdroppers.	cooperative mimo;radio jamming;randomness	Cagatay Capar;Dennis Goeckel;Benyuan Liu;Donald F.

The interference is constrained by average power and peak amplitude upper bounds on its Fourier transform. In addition, no statistical description is assumed. The performance measure is a weighted (\pm 1) sum of the correlations between the received corrupted signal Fourier transform R_{m}(f) and each member of the signal set Fourier transforms \{S_{m}(f)\} . This measure also depends on the out-of-sync time shift t and the signal present probability p . Functional analysis concepts are utilized to state and solve the resulting generalized Lagrange multiplier problem in L_{2} . The worst case interference function W^{0}(f) is shown to have an average power equal to the average power upper bound and is independent of p , but dependent on t . A key parameter may need numerical techniques for evaluation. This power level is achieved with W^{0} as a clipped multiple of | \sum S_{m}| that follows the phase of \sum S_{m}(f) . The clipping level is the peak amplitude upper bound. The worst case performance is explicitly expressed in terms of W^{0} . Upper and lower bounds are also derived with respect to arbitrary signal sets. Additional bounds are obtained for interference functions independent of the signal set magnitudes or phases. As a recommendation to minimize the worst case performance, the communicator should transmit with a high average probability per signal pM^{-1} for a given fixed {\em sum} \sum S_{m}(f) and \tilde{S}_{m}(f)S_{n}(f)=0, m \neq n , all m,n . However, to weaken the effectiveness of some sub-worst case interference, compared with the worst case. the communicator should transmit with low average probability per signal pM^{-1} and a phase of \sum S_{m}(f) close to \pi . Further investigation of good signal sets is warranted.	best, worst and average case;interference (communication)	Joel M. Morris	1982	IEEE Trans.

b2dd238bba4988a0728bc56a2a745133f29bb72b	tighter lower bounds on mutual information for fiber-optic channels		In fiber-optic communications, evaluation of mutual information (MI) is still an open issue due to the unavailabi lity of an exact and mathematically tractable channel model. Traditionally, lower bounds on MI are computed by approximating the (original) channel with an auxiliary forward channel. I n this paper, lower bounds are computed using an auxiliary backwar d channel, which has not been previously considered in the con text of fiber-optic communications. Distributions obtained through two variations of the stochastic digital backpropagation ( SDBP) algorithm are used as auxiliary backward channels and these bounds are compared with bounds obtained through the conventional digital backpropagation (DBP). Through simulations, higher information rates were achieved with SDBP compared with DBP, which implies that tighter lower bound on MI can be achieved through SDBP.	approximation algorithm;backpropagation;channel (communications);cobham's thesis;digital back-propagation;fiber-optic communication;mutual information;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;optical fiber;simulation	Naga VishnuKanth Irukulapati;Marco Secondini;Erik Agrell;Pontus Johannisson;Henk Wymeersch	2016	CoRR	10.1109/JLT.2018.2869109	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	ML	36.90712173269491	70.23881182517617	107671
155d070aedfaf33c3377015aaddc46c59b295883	smiet: simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer		The performance of communication systems is fundamentally limited by the loss of energy through propagation and circuit inefficiencies. The emergence of the Internet of Nano Things ecosystem means there is a need to design and build nanoscale energy efficient communication subsystems. In this article, we show that it is possible to achieve ultra low energy communications at the nanoscale, if diffusive molecules are used for carrying data. While the energy of electromagnetic waves will inevitably decay as a function of transmission distance and time, the energy in individual molecules does not. Over time, the receiver has an opportunity to recover some, if not all, of the molecular energy transmitted.

Recent work by Kobayashi et al. presented a scheme that exploits both imperfect current CSIT and perfect outdated CSIT and achieves higher degrees of freedom (DoF) than possible with only imperfect current CSIT or only outdated CSIT individually. In this work, we further improve the achievable DoF in this setting by incorporating additional private messages, and provide a tight information theoretic DoF outer bound, thereby identifying the DoF optimal use of mixed CSIT. The new result is stronger even in the original setting of only delayed CSIT, because it allows us to remove the restricting assumption of statistically equivalent fading for all users.	channel state information;cobham's thesis;synergy;system analysis;theory;transmitter;yang	Tiangao Gou;Syed Ali Jafar	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.050412.120702	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;degrees of freedom;statistics	Mobile	36.04282339107151	72.94736322194174	107782

We develop a decentralized algorithm, based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), for implementing the proposed scheme in autonomous sensor networks. Results show that algorithm performance approaches the centralized clairvoyant detection algorithm in the low SNR regime, and exhibits excellent convergence rate and scaling behavior (w.r.t. number of nodes). We also devise a low-overhead, robust ADMM algorithm for Byzantine-resilient detection, and demonstrate its robustness to data falsification attacks.

This result generalizes Winter's measurement compression theorem for fixed independent and identically distributed inputs [Winter, CMP 244 (157), 2004] to arbitrary inputs, and more importantly, it identifies the quantum mutual information of a measurement as the information gained by performing it, independent of the input state on which it is performed. Our result is a generalization of the classical reverse Shannon theorem to quantum-to-classical channels. In this sense, it can be seen as a quantum reverse Shannon theorem for quantum-to-classical channels, but with the entanglement assistance and quantum communication replaced by shared randomness and classical communication, respectively. Our proof is based on quantum-proof randomness extractors and the post-selection technique for quantum channels [Christandl et al., PRL 102 (020504), 2009].	kullback–leibler divergence;measurement in quantum mechanics	Mario Berta;Joseph M.

3ef3aeb25b48ecac4059a23a84225e87fdc5c048	active secure coding based on eavesdropper behavior learning		The secrecy capacity achieving problem of the wiretap channel against an active eavesdropper with unlimited computational power over is an important foresighted task for secure communication. For active wiretap channel, the effectiveness of cryptography embedded secure coding schemes are limited due to the passive problem of physical layer coding. Thus in this paper, a novel solution called active secure coding scheme is proposed which combines physical secure coding with machine learning to implement an active defense against the active eavesdropper. To construct an universal active method for secure coding, an abstract active wiretap channel model is constructed under the detectable precondition, in which hidden Markov model is employed to build the internal eavesdropper behavior pattern (the stochastic process for eavesdropper behavior states) with stochastically mapped external observations. Based on the abstract model, an eavesdropper behavior pattern learning and eavesdropper behavior states decoding are constructed for estimating the optimal eavesdropper behavior states, which enables the secure coding scheme to respond the eavesdropper actively. Then this active secure coding method is performed to the general varying wiretap channel to construct an explicit active secure polar coding scheme. As proofed, the proposed active secure polar coding scheme can theoretically achieve the average secrecy capacity of t times secure transmissions under the reliability and strong security criterions.

Recent advances in biology have encouraged using genetically engineered bacteria as the main component in the molecular communication. This has stimulated a new line of research that attempts to study molecular communication among bacteria from an information-theoretic point of view. Due to high randomness in the individual behavior of the bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria is almost impossible. Therefore, we recently proposed that a population of bacteria in a cluster is considered as a node capable of molecular transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a reliable node out of many unreliable bacteria. The bacteria inside a node sense the environment and respond accordingly. In this paper, we study the communication between two nodes, one acting as the transmitter and the other as the receiver. We consider the case in which the information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter node propagate in the environment via the diffusion process. Then, their concentration sensed by the bacteria in the receiver node would decode the information. The randomness in the communication is caused by both the error in the molecular production at the transmitter and the reception of molecules at the receiver. We study the theoretical limits of the information transfer rate in such a setup versus the number of bacteria per node. Finally, we consider M-ary modulation schemes and study the achievable rates and their error probabilities.	information theory;modulation;population;randomness;transmitter	Arash Einolghozati;Mohsen Sardari;Faramarz Fekri	2012	2012 IEEE Information Theory Workshop	10.1109/ITW.2012.6404710	genetic engineering;transmitter;telecommunications;microorganism;molecular biophysics	ML	28.732066799026377	69.22801665342256	108989

We study an uncoordinated paradigm where the users send their packet a random number of times according to a probability distribution. Instead of discarding the collided packets, the receiver performs iterative collision resolution. Recently, a few studies have shown that the iterative collision resolution process can be viewed as message-passing decoding on an appropriately defined Tanner graph. Using this equivalence, they used standard techniques to numerically optimize the probability distribution and demonstrated substantial throughput improvement over slotted ALOHA. In this paper, we show that the well-known soliton distribution is an optimal probability distribution and that the resulting throughput efficiency can be arbitrarily close to 1.	hash table;iteration;iterative method;message passing;multi-user;network packet;norm (social);numerical analysis;programming paradigm;random number generation;soliton distribution;tanner graph;throughput;turing completeness;whole earth 'lectronic link	Krishna R.

With block codes the average distortion decreases toward distortion D at a doubly exponential rate in block length for any fixed rate greater than R(D) , the rate-distortion function. For tree codes a difference equation for the probability distribution of the distortion is derived with tree depth as an independent variable. Its numerical solution suggests that the same doubly exponential convergence behavior applies to tree codes.	distortion	Jim K. Omura;A. Shohara	1973	IEEE Trans.

When the noise is a stationary and ergodic process Z, the capacity is 1- H(Z) (H(·) denoting the entropy rate). It is shown analogously that when the noise is a deterministic sequence z∞, the capacity under finite-state encoding and decoding is 1 - ρ̅(z∞), where ρ̅(·) is Lempel and Ziv's finite-state compressibility. This quantity, termed the porosity σ(·) of the channel, holds as the fundamental limit to communication - even when the encoder is designed with knowledge of the noise sequence. A sequence of schemes are presented that universally achieve porosity for any noise sequence. These results, both converse and achievability, may be interpreted as a channel-coding counterpart to Ziv and Lempel's work in universal source coding, and also as an extension to existing work on communicating across modulo-additive channels with an individual noise sequence. In addition, a potentially more practical architecture is suggested that draws a connection with finite-state predictability, as introduced by Feder, Gutman, and Merhav.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;data compression;encoder;entropy rate;ergodic process;ergodicity;forward error correction;modulo operation;olami–feder–christensen model;stationary process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Vinith Misra;Tsachy Weissman	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2313578	entropy;speech recognition;channel code;noise;theoretical computer science;mathematics;probabilistic logic;source code	Vision	36.582214207649265	64.84704330803758	109875

In recent publications, it was shown that this separability can be lost if a restriction to a certain class of transmit strategies (such as linear strategies or zero-forcing strategies) is imposed. In this paper, we categorize the recent results into three different kinds of inseparability, and we discuss the characteristic properties of each kind. Moreover, two new inseparability results that fit into these categories are presented: for the case of linear zero-forcing with time-sharing and for linear transceivers in systems with two users.	categorization;information theory;linear separability;mimo;time-sharing;transceiver	Christoph Hellings;Wolfgang Utschick	2013			theoretical computer science;distributed computing	ML	36.59533945539598	70.4025974604871	110051

These M signals are used to communicate over an additive Gaussian white noise channel. It is shown that if a noiseless feedback channel is available one could use this feedback channel to inform the transmitter of the location of the center of gravity of the signal structure and thus obtain a very efficient signaling scheme. Each signal point is assigned a mass proportional to its posterior probability at the particular instant. The center of gravity is used by the transmitter as a new origin for the signal space. It is shown that some previously considered coding schemes for channels with feedback are particular cases of center-of-gravity feedback. The probability of error decreases as a double exponential function of the coding delay as opposed to an exponential decrease for one-way systems. The effect of noise in the feedback path is briefly considered.		J. Pieter M. Schalkwijk	1968	IEEE Trans.

This thesis looks at ways of combating such interference. In Chapters 1 and 2, we outline the necessary information and communication theory background. We define the concept of capacity – the highest rate at which information can be sent through a network with arbitrarily low probability of error. We also include an overview of a new set of schemes for dealing with interference known as interference alignment, paying special attention to a channel-state-based strategy called ergodic interference alignment. In Chapter 3, we consider the operation of large regular and random networks by treating interference as background noise. We consider the local performance of a single node, and the global performance of a very large network. In Chapter 4, we use ergodic interference alignment to derive the asymptotic sum-capacity of large random dense networks. These networks are derived from a physical model of node placement where signal strength decays over the distance between transmitters and receivers. In Chapter 5, we look at methods of reducing the long time delays incurred by ergodic interference alignment. We decrease the delay for full performance of the scheme, and analyse the tradeoff between reducing delay and lowering the communication rate. In Chapter 6, we outline a problem of discovering which users interfere with which; a situation that is equivalent to the problem of pooled group testing for defective items. We then present some new work that uses information theoretic techniques to attack group testing.

The aim of these methods is to detect the presence of signal in cognitive radio network (CRN) environment. These techniques have been described in VHDL and implemented on Xilinx FPGA technology, through an experimental demonstration via a bench composed of dongle (RTL2832U), a laptop and a XUP Virtex-II Pro FPGA platform. Implementation results and performance evaluation validate and demonstrate the feasibility of our hardware design. Therefore, this implementation confirms the efficiency (performance and complexity) of blind detection methods for cognitive radio.

c9ef4a0bafcc99765b65c9807a5d476adb80bbde	information-theoretic privacy with general distortion constraints		The privacy-utility tradeoff problem is formulated as determining the privacy mechanism (random mapping) that minimizes the mutual information (a metric for privacy leakage) between the private features of the original dataset and a released version. The minimization is studied with two types of constraints on the distortion between the public features and the released version of the dataset: (i) subject to a constraint on the expected value of a cost function f applied to the distortion, and (ii) subject to bounding the complementary CDF of the distortion by a non-increasing function g. The first scenario captures various practical cost functions for distorted released data, while the second scenario covers large deviation constraints on utility. The asymptotic optimal leakage is derived in both scenarios. For the distortion cost constraint, it is shown that for convex cost functions there is no asymptotic loss in using stationary memoryless mechanisms. For the complementary CDF bound on distortion, the asymptotic leakage is derived for general mechanisms and shown to be the integral of the single letter leakage function with respect to the Lebesgue measure defined based on the refined bound on distortion. However, it is shown that memoryless mechanisms are generally suboptimal in both cases.

49c4a0e2f1de18bca48bc864bcaea46af0ce49ad	low-complexity decoding is asymptotically optimal in the simo mac		A single input multiple output (SIMO) multiple access channel, with a large number of transmitters sending symbols from a constellation to the receiver of a multi-antenna base station, is considered. The fundamental limits of joint decoding of the signals from all the users using a low complexity convex relaxation of the maximum likelihood decoder (ML, constellation search) is investigated. It has been shown that in a rich scattering environment, and in the asymptotic limit of a large number of transmitters, reliable communication is possible even without employing coding at the transmitters. This holds even when the number of receiver antennas per transmitter is arbitrarily small, with scaling behaviour arbitrarily close to what is achievable with coding. Thus, the diversity of a large system not only makes the scaling law for coded systems similar to that of uncoded systems, but, as we show, also allows efficient decoders to realize close to the optimal performance of maximum-likelihood decoding. However, while there is no performance loss relative to the scaling laws of the optimal decoder, our proposed low-complexity decoder exhibits a loss of the exponential or near-exponential rates of decay of error probability relative to the optimal ML decoder.

When there is only statistical CSIT, the secrecy capacity is unknown in general. In this paper we investigate the relation between the usual multivariate stochastic order and the degradedness among the legitimate receiver's and eavesdropper's channels under fast fading with only statistical CSIT. The considered transmitter has multiple antennas and the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper both have multiple antennas. Based on the technique of coupling we derive criteria to check the degradedness of the fast fading Gaussian wiretap channel including some commonly used channel models even there is only statistical CSIT.

This adversarial setting is in contrast to traditional ones where the adversary controls a subset of links. In particular, we study, in the main, the class of routing-only schemes (as opposed to those allowing coding inside the network). Routing-only schemes usually have low implementation complexity, yet a characterization of the rates achievable by such schemes was open prior to this work. We first propose an LP based solution for secure communication against eavesdropping, and show that it is information-theoretically rate-optimal among all routing-only schemes. The idea behind our design is to balance information flow in the network so that no subset of nodes observe “too much” information. Interestingly, we show that the rates achieved by our routing-only scheme are always at least as good as, and sometimes better, than those achieved by “naïve” network coding schemes (i.e. the rate-optimal scheme designed for the traditional scenario where the adversary controls links in a network rather than nodes.) We also demonstrate non-trivial network coding schemes that achieve rates at least as high as (and again sometimes better than) those achieved by our routing schemes, but leave open the question of characterizing the optimal rate-region of the problem under all possible coding schemes. We then extend these routing-only schemes to the adversarial node-jamming scenarios and show similar results. During the journey of our investigation, we also develop a new technique that has the potential to derive nontrivial bounds for general secure-communication schemes.	adversary (cryptography);complexity;directed graph;linear network coding;radio jamming;routing;secure communication;unicast	Pak Hou Che;Minghua Chen;Tracey Ho;Sidharth Jaggi;Michael Langberg	2013	2013 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)	10.1109/NetCod.2013.6570834	directed graph;computer science;network security;mathematics;distributed computing;computer security;statistics;computer network	Crypto	32.503791009208506	68.75978487416903	111706

Multi-party means that there are more than one recipient in our scheme. We show that our quantum commitment scheme is unconditional hiding and binding, and hiding is perfect. Our technique is based on the interference of phase-encoded coherent states of light.

The goal of a private communication protocol that uses such a channel is for the sender X to transmit a message in such a way that the legitimate receiver B can decode it reliably, while the eavesdropper E learns essentially nothing about which message was transmitted. The ε-oneshot private capacity of a cq wiretap channel is equal to the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over the channel, such that the privacy error is no larger than ε ∈ (0, 1). The present paper provides a lower bound on the ε-one-shot private classical capacity, by exploiting the recently developed techniques of Anshu, Devabathini, Jain, and Warsi, called position-based coding and convex splitting. The lower bound is equal to a difference of the hypothesis testing mutual information between X and B and the “alternate” smooth max-information between X and E. The one-shot lower bound then leads to a non-trivial lower bound on the second-order coding rate for private classical communication over a memoryless cq wiretap channel.	acknowledgement (data networks);anurag kumar;approximation;binary logarithm;classical capacity;communications protocol;concave function;eve;information theory;kullback–leibler divergence;marginal model;mathematical optimization;mutual information;quantum channel;quantum information;quantum relative entropy;social inequality;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mark M.

We introduce a technique to obtain outer bounds to the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region through the new graph-theoretic notion of bottleneck nodes. Such nodes act as informational bottlenecks only under the assumption of delayed CSIT, and imply asymmetric DoF bounds of the form mD1 + D2 ≤ m. Combining this outer-bound technique with new achievability schemes, we characterize the sum DoF of a class of two-unicast wireless networks, which shows that, unlike in the case of instantaneous CSIT, the DoF of two-unicast networks with delayed CSIT can take an infinite set of values.	channel state information;graph theory;transmitter;unicast	Alireza Vahid;Ilan Shomorony;A.

On the other hand, noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) have greatly enhanced the ability of CV QKD. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian post-selection method simulating NAL in CV QKD, followed by a reconciliation process based on systematic Polar code. We distill the reliable data through the post-selection filter as the raw key and then encode them with systematic polar code. The numerical simulation show that the secure transmission distance can be enlarged more than thirty kilometers while keeping the advantages of Gaussian security evidences. The key error rate can close to zero when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is near 3 dB.	computer simulation;encode;linear amplifier;modulation;network abstraction layer;numerical linear algebra;polar code (coding theory);quantum key distribution;secure transmission;signal-to-noise ratio	Chen-Chen Qian;Sheng-Mei Zhao;Qian-ping Mao	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752742	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	EDA	39.16109916379976	66.97715307433712	112796

The sensed information at each of such nodes is forwarded to a central receiver through parallel independent AWGN channels. In this scenario the signals from different sensors can arrive at the central receiver at different instants of time each subject to a different time delay. In order to properly fuse the streams of data arriving from different sensors these streams need to be synchronized. In this paper we propose and compare, via numerical simulations, several new synchronization mechanisms specifically tailored for this setup.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;broadcast delay;centralized computing;computer simulation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;sensor	Ignacio Olabarrieta;Javier Del Ser	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems	10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624512	computer simulation;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Embedded	29.700710873682265	73.10736961331914	112906

Heegard and Berger's single-letter achievability bound is well known to be optimal for physically degraded side information; however, it is not known whether the bound is optimal for arbitrarily correlated side information (general discrete memoryless sources). In this paper, we consider a new setup where the side information at one receiver is conditionally less noisy than that at the other. The new setup includes degraded side information as a special case, and it is motivated by the literature on degraded and less noisy broadcast channels. Our key contribution is a converse proving the optimality of Heegard and Berger's achievability bound in a new setting, where the side information is conditionally less noisy and one distortion function is deterministic. The less noisy setup is also generalized to two different successive-refinement problems.	computable function;data compression;distortion;information theory;rate–distortion theory;refinement (computing)	Roy Timo;Tobias J.

We assume a Rayleigh fading channel, where rates and power are jointly and optimally allocated between the source layers based on channel statistics information, with the objective of maximizing the expected total received rate at the end user. We show that the optimization problem possesses a strong duality, and hence we use the dual form to show that the optimal solution can be obtained using a two-dimensional bisection search for any number of layers. The outer bisection search is over the Lagrangian dual variable and the inner bisection search is over the decoding SNR threshold of the last layer. Moreover, we show that with a small number of layers, we can approach the performance upper bound, that is achieved by transmitting an infinite number of layers.	bisection method;data compression;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quantum superposition;rayleigh fading;refinement (computing);search algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;strong duality;transmitter	Wessam Mesbah;Mohammed Shaqfeh;Hussein M.

Recently, Tarokh and others have raised the possibility of exploiting this knowledge to increase the data rates of a cognitive radio. However, there is a difference between knowing the signal transmitted by the primary and the actual interference at our receiver since there is a wireless channel between these two points. This raises the interesting problem of finding the achievable rates for a compound Gel'fand-Pinsker channel. The problem was addressed recently in the work by Mitran et al, where the authors gave some upper and lower bounds to the achievable rates, with an emphasis on fading channels. But the upper bounds in that work are sometimes non-computable. In this work, we derive computable upper bounds on the outage capacity for a channel where the primary signal can be Rayleigh faded at our receiver.	causal filter;cognitive radio;computable function;downtime;interference (communication);rayleigh–ritz method;sun outage;transmitter	Pulkit Grover;Anant Sahai	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557541	transmitter;telecommunications;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;fading;statistics	Theory	38.148086882332876	74.49658698730146	114272

Using a new approach for the random coding constructions, along with a generalization of the technique used in the two-channel El Gamal and Cover region to any n, the rate region presented here achieves points that have not been known in the literature previously. This rate region is derived from a concatenation of source-channel erasure codes developed in Part I of this work by deploying the framework of source coding with side information (""""random binning""""). The key idea is that by using the framework of source coding with side information, multiple statistically identical realizations representing the coarse version of a source can be simultaneously refined by a single encoding. We point out that there is an important conceptual difference in random coding construction for the multiple-descriptions coding problem between the case of n=2 and n>2. To illustrate the framework, we also present the important case of the Gaussian source in detail."""	concatenation;data compression;distortion;erasure code;product binning	Rohit Puri;S.

Intensity interferometry was developed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss [1], [2], and originally used to measure the angular diameter of stars [3] at both optical and radio frequencies. Since then, this method has been used in many other fields to measure the size of regions of interest. Here we introduce an opposite paradigm and show that the technique may be used to transmit information wirelessly. This channel does not require additional frequency bands or additional bandwidth as it relies on a phenomenon that is already present but unexploited in current systems, and it has the potential to be highly secure against eavesdropping, and thus shows promise as a means of steganographic communication. We discuss the information theory of our new type of channel and address the trade-off between channel capacity and signaling rate. Finally, we propose communication through intensity interferometry as a method of secure steganographic communication in general and suggest its application in particular for secure communications in networks of wireless sensors.	angularjs;channel capacity;emission intensity;frequency band;information theory;over the air;programming paradigm;radio frequency;region of interest;secure communication;sensor;steganography	Pedro N.

This paper studies the key generation problem in the two-way relay channel, in which there is no direct channel between the key generating terminals. We propose an effective key generation scheme that achieves a substantially larger key rate than that of a direct channel mimic approach. Unlike existing schemes, there is no need for the key generating terminals to obtain correlated observations in our scheme. We also investigate the effects of an active attacker on the proposed key generation protocol. We characterize the optimal attacker's strategy that minimizes the key rate of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we establish the maximal attacker's power under which our scheme can still achieve a nonzero key rate.	alice and bob;inline linking;key generation;maximal set;relay channel	Heng Zhou;Lauren M.

For a two hop parallel AF relay MAC, assuming a sum power constraint across all relays we characterize optimal relay amplification factors and the resulting capacity regions. We find the sum rate capacity and the maximum rate for each user in closed form and express the optimal rate pair (R1, R2) that maximizes μ1R1 +μ2R2 as the solution of a pair of simultaneous equations. We find that the parallel AF relay MAC with total transmit power of the two users P1 + P2 = P and total relay power PR is the dual of the parallel AF relay BC where the MAC source nodes become the BC destination nodes, the MAC destination node becomes the BC source node, the dual BC source transmit power is PR and the total transmit power of the AF relays is P . The duality means that the capacity region of the AF relay MAC with a sum power constraint P on the transmitters is the same as that of the dual BC. The duality relationship is found to be useful in characterizing the capacity region of the AF relay BC as the union of MAC capacity regions. The duality extends to distributed relays with multiple antennas and more than 2 hops as well. For the M hop AF relay MAC where the m hop consists of Rm relays (possibly with multiple antennas) with total transmit power Pm and source power is P0, the dual BC is obtained by reversing the direction of communication so that the transmit power of the BC source is PM and the relays participating in the i th hop have transmit power PM−i. Thus, even though the transmitters and receivers are switched, each link in the original MAC is associated with the same transmit power as in the dual BC.	anisotropic filtering;broadcast domain;hop-by-hop transport;relay;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;transmitter	Syed Ali Jafar;Krishna Srikanth Gomadam	2006	CoRR		simultaneous equations;telecommunications;information theory;mathematics;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.4484781875132	72.52980420494636	115137
1a559e5f7a5bc7ad39d228f37c4e35a5ba7188ca	on capacity of noncoherent mimo with asymmetric link strengths		We study the generalized degrees of freedom (gDoF) of the block-fading noncoherent MIMO channel with asymmetric distributions of link strengths, and a coherence time of T symbol durations. We first derive the optimal signaling structure for communication over this channel, which is distinct from that for the i.i.d MIMO setting. We prove that for T = 1, the gDoF is zero for MIMO channels with arbitrary link strength distributions, extending the result for MIMO with i.i.d links. We then show that selecting the statistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal for both Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) and Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) channels. We also derive the gDoF for the 2×2 MIMO channel with different exponents in the direct and cross links. In this setting, we show that it is always necessary to use both antennas to achieve the optimal gDoF, in contrast to the results for 2 × 2 MIMO with identical link distributions.

A single-letter characterization of the achievable region is derived in the stationary memoryless case. The new model generalizes some other (old and new) models of key agreement. In particular, key generation with an omniscient helper is the special case where the communicator knows all sources, for which we derive a zero-rate one-shot converse for the secret key per bit of communication.	key generation	Jingbo Liu;Paul W.

The privacy risk is evaluated by the detection cost of the eavesdropper which is assumed to be informed and greedy. For the sensors whose operations are constrained to suppress the privacy risk, it is shown that the optimal detection strategies are likelihood-ratio tests. This fundamental insight allows for the optimization to reuse known algorithms extended to incorporate the privacy constraint. The trade-off between the detection performance and privacy risk is illustrated in an example.	greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;privacy;sensor	Zuxing Li;Tobias J.

In this paper, we propose a novel lattice strategy called Aligned Precoded Compute-and-Forward (PCoF). This scheme consists of two phases: 1) Using the CoF framework based on signal alignment we transform the Gaussian network into a deterministic finite field network. 2) Using linear precoding (over finite field) we eliminate the end-to-end interference in the finite field domain. Further, we exploit the algebraic structure of lattices to enhance the performance at finite SNR, such that beyond a degree of freedom result (also achievable by other means). We can also show that Aligned PCoF outperforms time-sharing in a range of reasonably moderate SNR, with increasing gain as SNR increases.	end-to-end principle;interference (communication);linear algebra;mimo;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;time-sharing	Song-Nam Hong;Giuseppe Caire	2013	CoRR		combinatorics;telecommunications;mathematics	Vision	35.06798436735132	74.18019357100536	115923

Particularl y, a protection strategy against any single node failure is desi gned for a given network with a set of n disjoint paths between senders and receivers. Network coding and reduced capacity are depl oyed in this strategy without adding extra working paths to the readily available connection paths. This strategy is based on prote ction against node failures as protection against multiple link f ailures. In addition, the encoding and decoding operational aspectsof the premeditated protection strategy are demonstrated.	linear network coding;software deployment;telecommunications network	Salah A.

However, for certain networks such as cognitive ones, this may be an unrealistic assumption. We work towards understanding the impact of lack of codebook knowledge at some decoding nodes in the network. We do so by considering a two-user interference channel in which one of the receivers has no information about the codebook of the interfering transmitter, while the other receiver has both codebooks. We derive a novel outer bound for the special class of injective semi-deterministic interference channels which incorporates this codebook knowledge explicitly. For the linear deterministic channel, which models the Gaussian channel at high SNR, we demonstrate the surprising fact that non i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) points achieve points on the outer bound not achievable by Bernoulli(1/2) inputs. We then show that this is achievable to within a constant gap by a modified Han-Kobayashi scheme. We characterize the capacity region of the Gaussian noise channel to within 1/2 bit, even though we could not determine the set of optimal input distributions. Numerical evaluations suggest that if the non-oblivious transmitter uses a discrete input a larger sum-rate is achievable compared to the case where both users employ Gaussian codebooks or use time division in strong interference regime at high SNR.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;codebook;han unification;interference (communication);multi-user;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;theory;transmitter	Alex Dytso;Natasha Devroye;Daniela Tuninetti	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620584	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;decoding methods;mathematics;statistics	Theory	35.815868090176664	70.94491164640587	116749

5be6ed044c306c88daa1f8203695a413d83c94f0	on the ergodic rate lower bounds with applications to massive mimo		A well-known lower bound widely used in the massive MIMO literature hinges on channel hardening, i.e., the phenomenon for which, thanks to the large number of antennas, the effective channel coefficients resulting from beamforming tend to deterministic quantities. If the channel hardening effect does not hold sufficiently well, this bound may be quite far from the actual achievable rate. In recent developments of massive MIMO, several scenarios where channel hardening is not sufficiently pronounced have emerged. These settings include, for example, the case of small scattering angular spread, yielding highly correlated channel vectors, and the case of cell-free massive MIMO. In this short contribution, we present two new bounds on the achievable ergodic rate that offer a complementary behavior with respect to the classical bound: while the former performs well in the case of channel hardening and/or when the system is interference-limited (notably, in the case of finite number of antennas and conjugate beamforming transmission), the new bounds perform well when the useful signal coefficient does not harden but the channel coherence block length is large with respect to the number of users, and in the case where interference is nearly entirely eliminated by zero-forcing beamforming. Overall, using the most appropriate bound depending on the system operating conditions yields a better understanding of the actual performance of systems where channel hardening may not occur, even in the presence of a very large number of antennas.	algorithm;angularjs;beamforming;block code;call of duty: black ops;coefficient;coherence (physics);ergodic theory;ergodicity;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;undefined behavior	Giuseppe Caire	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2808522	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Networks	37.179749611301695	72.42681656586082	116956

The max-flow/min-cut theorem for a multicast session over a directed network has been extended to this wireless relay model. The result was first proved by a random coding scheme over large blocks of transmitted signals. In this paper, in the special case of a unicast session, a simple capacity-achieving transmission scheme for LDRN which codes over one symbol of information at each use of the network is obtained by a connection to the submodular flow problem and through the application of tools from matroid theory and submodular optimization theory. Polynomial-time algorithms for calculating the capacity of the network and the optimal coding scheme are implied by our analysis.	algorithm;code;data compression;flow network;matroid;max-flow min-cut theorem;maxima and minima;maximum flow problem;minimum cut;multicast;network model;polynomial;relay;routing;submodular set function;telecommunications network;time complexity;unicast	S.

Large transmitted powers suggest maximizing power efficiency (ratio of information rate to average signal power) as opposed to restricting bandwidth. The fundamental limit to reliable communication is determined, and is not affected by carrier frequency, dispersion, scattering, or motion. The available efficiency is limited by noise alone, and the available information rate is limited by noise and available average power. A set of five design principles (well within our own technological capability) can asymptotically approach the fundamental limit; no other civilization can achieve greater efficiency. Bandwidth can be expanded in a way that avoids invoking impairment by dispersion or scattering. The resulting power-efficient signals have characteristics very different from current SETI targets, with wide bandwidth relative to the information rate and a sparse distribution of energy in both time and frequency. Information-free beacons achieving the lowest average power consistent with a given receiver observation time are studied. They need not have wide bandwidth, but do distribute energy more sparsely in time as average power is reduced. The discovery of both beacons and information-bearing signals is analyzed, and most closely resembles approaches that have been employed in optical SETI. No processing is needed to account for impairments other than noise. A direct statistical tradeoff between a larger number of observations and a lower average power (including due to lower information rate) is established. The """"false alarms"""" in current searches are characteristic signatures of these signals. Joint searches for beacons and information-bearing signals require straightforward modifications to current SETI pattern recognition approaches."""	performance per watt;systems design	David G.

The Collins-Popescu analogy states that public classical communication, private classical communication, and secret key interact with one another somewhat similarly to the way that classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement interact. This paper discusses the information-theoretic treatment of this analogy for the case of noisy quantum channels. We determine a capacity region for a quantum channel interacting with the noiseless resources of public classical communication, private classical communication, and secret key. We then compare this region with the classical-quantum-entanglement region from our prior efforts and explicitly observe the informationtheoretic consequences of the strong correlations in entanglement and the lack of a super-dense coding protocol in the public-private-secret-key setting. The region simplifies for several realistic, physicallymotivated channels such as entanglement-breaking channels, Hadamard channels, and quantum erasure channels, and we are able to compute and plot the region for several examples of these channels.

We assume that the network implements network coding techniques to simultaneously deliver all the packets available at the source to all the destinations. We show how this problem can be looked at as a network generalization of the Ozarow-Wyner wiretap channel of type II. In particular, we show that network security can be achieved by using the Ozarow-Wyner approach of coset coding at the source on top of the implemented network code. This way, we quickly and transparently recover some of the results available in the literature on secure network coding for wiretapped networks. We also derive new bounds on the required secure code alphabet size and an algorithm for code construction.	algorithm;coding theory;data compression;linear network coding;multicast;network security;visual intercept	Salim Y.

It is shown how this can be done in a constructive manner. The proof of optimality (weak converse) is based on a novel entropy bound, which can be viewed as a substitute for Fano's lemma in the present context. The single-letter characterization of (second-order) capacity regions now rests on an entropy characterization problem, which often can be solved. This is done for the multiple-access channel with deterministic encoding strategies, and for the broadcast channel with randomized encoding strategies. >		Rudolf Ahlswede;Bart Verboven	1991	IEEE Trans.

This model consists of a two-user Gaussian interference channel where a cooperative secondary/cognitive source can causally learn the message of a primary source through a noisy link. The generalized Degrees-of-Freedom (gDoF) and the sum-capacity to within a constant gap are characterized for channels where one destination does not experience interference, referred to as interference-asymmetric channels. Both cases where the cognitive source operates in full- and half-duplex mode are considered. The different models are compared among themselves and with the case of interference-symmetric channels with either bilateral or unilateral source cooperation. In particular, the parameter regimes where causal cognition, or unilateral cooperation, attains the same gDoF of classical channel models, such as the noncooperative interference channel and the non-causal cognitive channel, are identified in order to determine when causal cognitive radio offers benefits in practical systems.	approximation;bilateral filter;catastrophic interference;causal filter;causality;cognition;cognitive radio;duplex (telecommunications);emoticon;interference (communication);network topology;primary source;relay channel	Martina Cardone;Daniela Tuninetti;Raymond Knopp;Umer Salim	2013	2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2013.6502980	telecommunications	Security	35.21715998031376	72.6540144649844	118296
5b6c1df7647bba2fa0aa56dea2d57a3f2e9ec76e	achievability bounds for t-fold irregular repetition slotted aloha scheme in the gaussian multiple access channel		We address the problem of massive random access for an uncoordinated Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC). The performance of T-fold irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) scheme for this channel is investigated. The main difference of this scheme in comparison to IRSA is as follows: any collisions of order up to T can be resolved with some probability of error introduced by Gaussian noise. First, we generalize the density evolution method for T -fold IRSA and noisy channel and find optimal degree distributions for different values of T . Then we perform analysis and find minimal Eb/N0 for a fixed length, rate and packet loss probability. The scheme is shown to work closer to finite length random coding bound proposed by Y.

Specifically, we examine a K-user bursty MIMO Gaussian MAC with a relay, where bursty traffic of each user is governed by a Bernoulli random process. As our main result, we characterize the degrees of freedom (DoF) region. To this end, we extend noisy network coding, in which relays compress-and-forward, to achieve the DoF cut-set bound. From this result, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition for attaining collision-free DoF performances. Also, we show that relays can provide a DoF gain which scales to some extent with additional relay antennas. Our results have practical implications in various scenarios of wireless systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and media access control protocols.	access control;bernoulli polynomials;internet of things;linear network coding;mimo;performance;relay;stochastic process	Sunghyun Kim;Changho Suh	2015	2015 53rd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/ALLERTON.2015.7447022	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Networks	35.181230677710076	72.0745948211259	118478

The integrated scheme employs both quadratures of a weak coherent state, with encrypted bits encoded on the signs and Gaussian random numbers encoded on the values of the quadratures. The integration enables quantum and classical data to share the same physical and logical channel.

Han and Kobayashi proposed a receiving strategy, which performs a joint unique decoding of messages of interest along with a subset of messages, which are not of interest. It is now well-known that this provides an achievable region, which is, in general, larger than if the receiver treats all messages not of interest as noise. Nair and El Gamal and Chong, Motani, Garg, and El Gamal independently proposed a generalization called indirect or nonunique decoding where the receiver uses the codebook structure of the messages to uniquely decode only its messages of interest. Nonunique decoding has since been used in various scenarios. The main result in this paper is to provide an interpretation and a systematic proof technique for why nonunique decoding, in all known cases where it has been employed, can be replaced by a particularly designed joint unique decoding strategy, without any penalty from a rate region viewpoint.

The main result is the derivation of the exact optimal worst-case delivery time — under the assumption of uncoded cache placement — for any user-to-cache association profile where each such profile describes how many users are helped by each cache. This is achieved with a new informationtheoretic converse that is based on index coding and which proves that a simple XOR-shrinking-and-removal codedcaching scheme is optimal irrespective of the user-to-cache association profile. All the results also apply directly to the related coded caching problem with multiple file requests.	best, worst and average case;cache (computing);distributed computing;exclusive or;link prefetching;network topology	Emanuele Parrinello;Ayse Ünsal;Petros Elia	2018	CoRR		discrete mathematics;mathematics;cache;converse;derivation;distributed computing	Theory	32.55757471083199	70.71219897045528	119329
de2a0510e9dbbdbf6c3986ad24bf10f3b2852c70	on linear coding schemes for stabilizing lti control with multiple sensors	linear code	We examine the problem of designing the encoding and control policies of a linear stochastic control system, where the communication channel between the plant state observer (sensor) and the controller is a lossy wireless channel that is constrained in terms of transmit power and bandwidth. For a first-order ARMA modeled plant with Gaussian statistics, when there are two sensors observing the plant, nonlinear encoding is shown to result in smaller cost at time instant T = 1 compared to the linear schemes, if transmissions are carried out over parallel Gaussian independent channels. In this paper, optimal linear coding schemes for the case of multiple sensors are examined. They are shown to minimize the control cost at the infinite time horizon, when the wireless channel is accessed using time division multiplexing. Our analysis is carried out for when separation between the state estimation and control is possible, and the optimal steady state control law is certainty equivalent. The distortion lower bound for estimating the plant state is derived, along with the necessary conditions on the transmit power that minimize the steady state control cost. We also propose a linear scheme that reaches the distortion bound asymptotically under relaxed conditions.	channel (communications);control system;distortion;first-order predicate;gaussian blur;linear code;lossy compression;multiplexing;nonlinear system;optimal control;sensor;steady state;stochastic control	Anna N.

The process {Xi} is observed at the encoder, and is supposed to be reproduced at two decoders, decoder Y and decoder Z, where {Yi} and {Zi} are observed, respectively, in either a causal or noncausal manner. The communication between the encoder and the decoders is carried in two successive stages. In the first stage, the transmission is available to both decoders and they reconstruct the source according to the received bit-stream and the individual side information ( {Zi} or {Yi}). In the second stage, additional information is sent to both decoders and they refine the reconstructions of the source according to the available side information and the transmissions at both stages. It is desired to find the necessary and sufficient conditions on the communication rates between the encoder and decoders, so that the distortions incurred (at each stage) will not exceed given thresholds. For the case of causal availability of side information at the decoders, an exact single-letter characterization of the achievable region is derived for the case of pure source-coding. Then, for the case of communication between the encoder and decoders carried over independent memoryless discrete channels with random states known causally/noncausally at the encoder and with causal side information about the source at the decoders, a single-letter characterization of all achievable distortion in both stages is provided and it is shown that the separation theorem holds. The results are derived without assuming any structural restrictions on side information, such as a Markov structure, etc. Finally, for noncausal degraded side information, inner and outer bounds to the achievable rate-distortion region are derived. These bounds are shown to be tight for certain cases of reconstruction requirements at the decoders. Due to the system setup, these results also shed some light on a problem of successive refinement with side information which is not degraded in the usual sense.	binary decoder;binary prefix;bitstream;causal filter;data compression;distortion;encoder;gabbay's separation theorem;markov chain;problem solving;refinement (computing);requirement;triplet state	Alina Maor;Neri Merhav	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2050951	random variable;speech recognition;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics;source code	Theory	36.57258286435941	66.00206658223614	119863
3460c1bf1273d02d8e9ad9ff84c78f818c82bea9	secure communications for the two-user broadcast channel with random traffic		In this paper, we study the stability region of the two-user broadcast channel (BC) with bursty data arrivals and security constraints. It is assumed that one of the receivers has a secrecy constraint, i.e., its packets need to be kept secret from the other receiver, which is defined based on signal to interference noise ratio. The receiver with secrecy constraint has full-duplex capability to send a jamming signal for improving its service rate. The stability region of the two-user BC with secrecy constraint is characterized for the general decoding case. Then, assuming two different decoding schemes, the respective stability regions are derived. The full-duplex operation of receiver results in self-interference, and the effect of imperfect self-interference cancelation on the stability region is also investigated. The stability region of the BC with a secrecy constraint, where the receivers do not have full duplex capability can be obtained as a special case of the results derived in this paper. In addition, the paper considers the problem of maximizing the saturated throughput of the queue for which there is no secrecy constraint under minimum service guarantees for the other queue. The results provide new insights on the effect of the secrecy constraint on the stability region of the BC. It is found that the stability region with secrecy constraint is sensitive to the degree of self-interference cancelation.	control theory;duplex (telecommunications);duplex printing;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;norm (social);optimization problem;radio jamming;throughput;transmitter	Parthajit Mohapatra;Nikolaos Pappas;Jemin Lee;Tony Q.

This is applied to Euclidean distortion, Hamming distortion, Kolmogorov distortion, and Shannon-Fano distortion. We show that in all these cases for every function satisfying the obvious constraints there are data that have this function as their individual rate-distortion function. Shannon’s distortion-rate function over a random source is shown to be the pointswise asymptotic expectation of the individual distortion-rate functions we have defined. The great differences in the distortion-rate functions for individual non-random (that is, the aspects important to lossy compression) data we established were previously invisible and obliterated in the Shannon theory. The techniques are based on Kolmogorov complexity.	distortion;information theory;kolmogorov complexity;lossy compression;randomness;rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit);shannon–fano coding;window function	Nikolai K.

For this setting, we characterize the achievable region in the space of three figures of merit: the security (measured in terms of the equivocation), the compressibility of the cryptogram, and the distortion associated with the reconstruction of the plaintext source. Although lossy reconstruction of the plaintext does not rule out the option that the (noisy) decryption key would differ, to a certain extent, from the encryption key, we show, nevertheless, that the best strategy is to strive for perfect match between the two keys, by applying reliable channel coding to the key bits, and to control the distortion solely via rate-distortion coding of the plaintext source before the encryption. In this sense, our result has a flavor similar to that of the classical source-channel separation theorem.

4d135f77571eff0c850076670c82eedbf3c9ef7d	transmission rates over state-dependent diamond channel		This study considers the state-dependent diamond channel (DC) in which the transmission is affected by another source, the interferer. Basically, the transmission from the source to its destination is carried out with the help of two parallel relays. All nodes forming the DC are assumed to be cognitive in the sense that these nodes can estimate the interference signal and then cooperate to remove its effect. For this channel model, the authors initially establish the achievable rate in the case that different noisy versions of the interference signal are non-casually available at all nodes. Then, a three-phase practical transmission scheme is proposed such that these nodes may estimate the interference signal causally and then start transmission. The authors' numerical results show that it is sufficient to have the interference signal at both the relays to get an interference-free achievable rate. In addition, the achievable rate of the DC channel is inversely proportional to the interference coding rate.	channel (communications);interference (communication);numerical analysis;relay;transmission (bittorrent client)	Moha'med Al-Jaafreh;Zouhair Al-qudah	2018	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2017.0517	diamond;computer network;mathematics;transmission (mechanics);communication channel	Mobile	34.170923929279596	73.15184002059064	120665

Although the achievable rate bounds are described by non– concave functions, the boundary of the achievable rate region could be generated by maximizing a weighted sum of the rates.

It is therefore interesting to approximate the inverse by a matrix polynomial. In this correspondence, means for computing the polynomial coefficients are proposed in the context of CDMA downlink transmissions on frequency-selective channels, the users having possibly different powers. Derivations are made in the asymptotic regime where the spreading factor and the number of users grow toward infinity at the same rate. Results pertaining to the mathematics of large random matrices, and in particular to free probability theory, are used. Spreading matrices are modeled as isometric random matrices (spreading vectors orthonormality is a natural assumption in downlink) and also as random matrices with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) elements.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;isometric projection;matrix polynomial;mean squared error;multi-user;sensor;stochastic matrix;telecommunications link	Walid Hachem	2004	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2003.821985	independent and identically distributed random variables;minimum mean square error;code division multiple access;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;random matrix;probability;mathematics;matrix polynomial;spread spectrum;free probability;statistics	Theory	38.38514527956369	73.87887923178283	121013
eb4bb8e2479c3b8d08738ec313478fd1351d6c38	on single-antenna rayleigh block-fading channels at finite blocklength		This paper concerns the maximum coding rate at which data can be transmitted over a noncoherent, singleantenna, Rayleigh block-fading channel using an error-correcting code of a given blocklength with a block-error probability not exceeding a given value. A high-SNR normal approximation of the maximum coding rate is presented that becomes accurate as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of coherence intervals L over which we code tend to infinity. Numerical analyses suggest that the approximation is accurate already at SNR values of 15 dB and for 10 or more coherence intervals.	approximation;forward error correction;numerical analysis;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio	Alejandro Lancho;Tobias Koch;Giuseppe Durisi	2017	CoRR		fading;mathematics;infinity;discrete mathematics;mathematical analysis;rayleigh scattering;code rate;communication channel;coherence (physics)	AI	39.10285022333034	73.00177495922283	121025

By analogy with Shannon theory, we define the classification capacity, which quantifies the maximum number of classes that can be discriminated with low probability of error, and the diversity-discrimination tradeoff, which quantifies the tradeoff between the number of classes and the probability of classification error. For classification of Gaussian mixture models, we identify a duality between classification and communications over non-coherent multiple-antenna channels. This duality allows us to characterize the classification capacity and diversity-discrimination tradeoff using existing results from multiple-antenna communication. We also identify the easiest possible classification problems, which correspond to low-dimensional subspaces drawn from an appropriate Grassmann manifold.	algorithm;coherence (physics);dictionary;digital monetary trust;information theory;linear classifier;mimo;machine learning;manifold alignment;manifold regularization;mixture model;shannon (unit);signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;statistical model	Matthew S.

Recent work by Avestimehr has approximated the capacity of this network up to an additive gap. The communication scheme achieving this capacity approximation is based on compress-and-forward, resulting in noise accumulation as the messages traverse the network. As a consequence, the approximation gap increases linearly with the network depth. This paper develops a computation alignment strategy that can approach the capacity of a class of layered, time-varying wireless relay networks up to an approximation gap that is independent of the network depth. This strategy is based on the compute-and-forward framework, which enables relays to decode deterministic functions of the transmitted messages. Alone, compute-and-forward is insufficient to approach the capacity as it incurs a penalty for approximating the wireless channel with complex-valued coefficients by a channel with integer coefficients. Here, this penalty is circumvented by carefully matching channel realizations across time slots to create integer-valued effective channels that are well suited to compute-and-forward. Unlike prior constant gap results, the approximation gap obtained in this paper also depends closely on the fading statistics, which are assumed to be i.i.d.

4e500aa0884af7dcdddf61e188aa5589e8437353	on stochastic orders and fast fading multiuser channels with statistical csit		In this paper, fading Gaussian multiuser channels are considered. If the channel is perfectly known to the transmitter, capacity has been established for many cases in which the channels may satisfy certain information theoretic orders such as degradedness or strong/very strong interference. Here, we study the case when only the statistics of the channels are known at the transmitter which is an open problem in general. The main contribution of this paper is the following: First, we introduce a framework to classify random fading channels based on their joint distributions by leveraging three schemes: maximal coupling, coupling, and copulas. The underlying spirit of all scheme is, we obtain an equivalent channel by changing the joint distribution in such a way that it now satisfies a certain information theoretic order while ensuring that the marginal distributions of the channels to the different users are not changed. The construction of this equivalent multi-user channel allows us to directly make use of existing capacity results, which includes Gaussian interference channels, Gaussian broadcast channels, and Gaussian wiretap channels. We also extend the framework to channels with a specific memory structure, namely, channels with finite-state, wherein the Markov fading broadcast channel is discussed as a special case. Several practical examples such as Rayleigh fading and Nakagami-m fading illustrate the applicability of the derived results.

233be01f701414fa5e1bbe1813151fd123fe7d4a	epistemic view of quantum states and communication complexity of quantum channels		The communication complexity of a quantum channel is the minimal amount of classical communication required for classically simulating a process of state preparation, transmission through the channel and subsequent measurement. It establishes a limit on the power of quantum communication in terms of classical resources. We show that classical simulations employing a finite amount of communication can be derived from a special class of hidden variable theories where quantum states represent statistical knowledge about the classical state and not an element of reality. This special class has attracted strong interest very recently. The communication cost of each derived simulation is given by the mutual information between the quantum state and the classical state of the parent hidden variable theory. Finally, we find that the communication complexity for single qubits is smaller than 1.28 bits. The previous known upper bound was 1.85 bits.	communication complexity;epr paradox;hidden variable theory;mutual information;quantum channel;quantum state;qubit;simulation;small	Alberto Montina	2012	Physical review letters	10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.110501	quantum operation;no-teleportation theorem;quantum information;quantum teleportation;quantum complexity theory;amplitude damping channel;quantum network;quantum discord;quantum capacity;open quantum system;quantum convolutional code;quantum chaos;quantum channel;classical capacity;quantum process;coherent information;quantum algorithm;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum sort	Theory	31.061835297322226	64.79571021692348	122764

To achieve this private index coding, we consider the use of secret keys that are shared among various subsets of users and the server. We characterize key access structures that allow private index coding. For up to three receivers, we characterize the rate region of transmission and key rates and show that scalar coding is optimal; we also show that scalar linear codes are sub-optimal for four receivers. Furthermore, when no keys are available, we consider a weaker notion of privacy analogous to weak security. Finally, for a different setting in which the server is allowed to send messages exclusively to a subset of users, we study the number of transmissions required to achieve error-free decoding and privacy.	code;key (cryptography);privacy;server (computing)	Varun Narayanan;Vinod M.

Watermarking can be viewed as a communication problem with side information (in the form of the host signal and/or a cryptographic key) available at the encoder and the decoder. The problem is mathematically defined by distortion constraints, by statistical models for the host signal, and by the information available in the game between the information hider, the attacker, and the decoder. In particular, information theory explains why the performance of watermark decoders that do not have access to the host signal may surprisingly be as good as the performance of decoders that know the host signal. The theory is illustrated with several examples, including an application to image watermarking. Capacity expressions are derived under a parallel-Gaussian model for the host-image source. Sparsity is the single most important property of the source that determines capacity.	digital watermarking;information theory	Pierre Moulin	2001	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(01)00037-8	identification;stochastic process;statistical model;telecommunications;digital watermarking;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;information protection policy;statistics	ML	33.263845638517395	67.01590989734301	124107

In this game model, the core contains all achievable rate vectors for CO with sum-rate being equal to a given value. Any rate vector in the core distributes the sum-rate among users in a way that makes all users willing to cooperate in CO. We give the necessary and sufficient condition for the core to be nonempty. Based on this condition, we derive the expression of the minimum sum-rate for CO and show that this expression is consistent with the results in multivariate mutual information (MMI) and coded cooperative data exchange (CCDE). We prove that the coalition game model is convex if the sum-rate is no less than the minimal value. In this case, the core is non-empty and a rate vector in the core that allocates the sum-rate among the users in a fair manner can be found by calculating the Shapley value.	game theory;multivariate mutual information	Ni Ding;Chung Chan;Tie Liu;Rodney A.

97e4d81e8dc538584187b7f538a0d4d549850655	quantum channel capacities per unit cost		Communication over a noisy channel is often conducted in a setting in which different input symbols to the channel incur a certain cost. For example, for bosonic quantum channels, the cost associated with an input state is the number of photons, which is proportional to the energy consumed. In such a setting, it is often useful to know the maximum amount of information that can be reliably transmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the capacity per unit cost. In this paper, we generalize the capacity per unit cost to various communication tasks involving a quantum channel, such as classical communication, entanglement-assisted classical communication, private communication, and quantum communication. For each task, we define the corresponding capacity per unit cost and derive a formula for it analogous to that of the usual capacity. Furthermore, for the special and natural cases in which there is a zero-cost state, we obtain expressions in terms of an optimized relative entropy involving the zero-cost state. For each communication task, we construct an explicit pulse-position-modulation coding scheme that achieves the capacity per unit cost. Finally, we compute capacities per unit cost for various bosonic Gaussian channels and introduce the notion of a blocklength constraint as a proposed solution to the long-standing issue of infinite capacities per unit cost. This motivates the idea of a blocklength-cost duality on which we elaborate in depth.		Dawei Ding;Dmitri S. Pavlichin;Mark M.

In the case of delay-limited block-fading channels, we find the solution to the minimum outage power allocation scheme with peak-to-average power constraints and arbitrary input distributions, and show that the signal-to-noise ratio exponent for any finite peak-to-average power ratio is the same as that of the peak-power limited problem, resulting in an error floor. In the case of the ergodic fully-interleaved channel, we find the power allocation rule that yields the maximal information rate for an arbitrary input distribution and show that capacities with peak-to-average power ratio constraints, even for small ratios, are very close to capacities without peak-power restrictions.

It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) is perfectly known at the receiver and is fed back to the transmitter at the regular time intervals. The system capacity is investigated in two cases: 1) finite-state Markov channel, and 2) additive white Gaussian noise channel with time-correlated fading. In the first case, it is shown that the capacity is achievable by multiplexing multiple codebooks across the channel. In the second case, the channel capacity and the optimal adaptive coding is obtained. It is shown that the optimal adaptation can be achieved by a single Gaussian codebook, while adaptively allocating the total power based on the side information at the transmitter.	adaptive coding;additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;channel state information;codebook;markov chain;multiplexing;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Mehdi Ansari Sadrabadi;Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali;Amir K.

e051da03c64f5905d28df9f665fd6f0b0f2cdec9	product network codes for reliable communications in diamond networks		In wireless networks, mobile users connect either with other devices or with base stations. They can experience high errors caused by losses, low levels of signals or disconnections. Due to these aspects, it is important to find ways to make the communication reliable. Product network codes represent a way to improve error-correction capability. The main idea is to use a powerful error correction code in time with random linear network coding in space domain. This paper analyses the error-correcting capabilities of product network codes composed by either Luby transform (LT) codes or Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, and RLNC. The kind of errors are burst errors. The results quantify how product network codes improve reliability in case of high burst error probability.

The encoder wishes to compress the source sequence in order to satisfy a distortion criterion at the decoder, while revealing only limited knowledge about the source to the eavesdropper. The side information available to the encoder, the legitimate decoder, or the eavesdropper can be influenced by a cost-constrained action sequence. Three different settings are studied. In the first two settings, we are interested in understanding the influence of the action sequence on the rate-distortion-leakage tradeoff where the action is taken either by the decoder or by the encoder to influence side information at the decoder and eavesdropper. Next, we consider a setting where common action-dependent side information is available securely to both encoder and decoder, and thus can be used for secret key generation. We characterize the optimal rate-distortion-cost-leakage region or the corresponding inner bounds for a discrete memoryless source for above settings. The results are useful in characterizing fundamental limits for example in secure sensor networking and future cyber physical systems.	data compression	Kittipong Kittichokechai;Tobias J.

df40a4d9379325d9939f47cf8a5748a8c7b21c55	energy efficiency of wireless cooperation		We study the energy efficiency of wireless transmissions for a class of networks where a large number of proximal nodes co-operate over the wireless medium to reliably decode the message from a distant transmitter (the source). The objective is to minimize the sum total of energy expenditure (per bit) over all transmissions in the network. The wireless medium is assumed to be affected by Gaussian noise and symmetric fading with the channel state information known at the receivers but not at the transmitters. Furthermore, we assume the possibility of wideband communication and no delay constraints. In a network with k proximal nodes, where the links amongst the nodes are much better than the link between the source and the nodes, the lower bound on the energy per bit could reduce by as much as k−1 (in k) up to a certain point. This suggests a large potential benefit in co-operating with proximal nodes. We first propose and analyze an estimate-and-forward transmission scheme inspired by the Gaussian CEO problem but show that it does not have such an asymptotic behavior (in k) under most conditions. Next, we propose a simple, uncoded aggregate-and-forward scheme and show that it has an almost optimal asymptotic behavior.	aggregate data;channel state information;transmitter	Aman Jain;Sanjeev R.

The fading process is assumed stationary within each block and to change independently from block to block; furthermore, its realizations are not known a priori to the transmitter and the receiver (noncoherent setting). A common approach to analyzing the capacity of this channel is to assume that the receiver performs matched filtering followed by sampling at symbol rate (symbol matched filtering). This yields a discrete-time channel in which each transmitted symbol corresponds to one output sample. Liang & Veeravalli (2004) showed that the capacity of this discrete-time channel grows logarithmically with the SNR, with a capacity pre-log equal to 1-Q/N. Here, N is the number of symbols transmitted within one fading block, and Q is the rank of the covariance matrix of the discrete-time channel gains within each fading block. In this paper, we show that symbol matched filtering is not a capacity-achieving strategy for the underlying continuous-time channel. Specifically, we analyze the capacity pre-log of the discrete-time channel obtained by oversampling the continuous-time channel output, i.e., by sampling it faster than at symbol rate. We prove that by oversampling by a factor two one gets a capacity pre-log that is at least as large as 1-1/N. Since the capacity pre-log corresponding to symbol-rate sampling is 1-Q/N, our result implies indeed that symbol matched filtering is not capacity achieving at high SNR.	matched filter;oversampling;rayleigh fading;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;transmitter	Meik Dörpinghaus;Günther Koliander;Giuseppe Durisi;Erwin Riegler;Heinrich Meyr	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2339820	telecommunications;mathematics;channel state information;statistics	ML	38.24446422549265	73.78825980730167	126032

We model the channel state using an ON/OFF Markovian model, and allow the transmitter to probe one of the channels at predetermined probing intervals to decide over which channel to transmit. For models in which the transmitter must transmit over the probed channel, it has been shown that a myopic policy that probes the channel most likely to be ON is optimal. In this work, we allow the transmitter to select a channel over which to transmit that is not necessarily the one it probed. We show that in the case where the two channels are i.i.d, all probing policies yield equal reward. We extend this problem to dynamically choose when to probe based on the results of previous probes, and characterize the optimal policy, as well as provide a LP in terms of state action frequencies to find the optimal policy.	approximation algorithm;mathematical optimization;relevance;transmitter	Matthew Johnston;Eytan Modiano	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831336	database index;transmitter;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;steady state;statistics	Mobile	30.39787012498849	72.47385751644461	126282
0921e632bc15c3c2b7d9d0bed9cdf9afc8d71078	interference mitigation through limited receiver cooperation: symmetric case	decoding;wireless networks;protocols;signal to noise ratio;radio receivers;transmitters	Interference is a major issue that limits the performance in wireless networks, and cooperation among receivers can help mitigate interference by forming distributed MIMO systems. The rate at which receivers cooperate, however, is limited in most scenarios. How much interference can one bit of receiver cooperation mitigate? In this paper, we study the two-user Gaussian interference channel with conferencing decoders to answer this question in a simple setting. We characterize the fundamental gain from cooperation: at high SNR, when INR is below 50% of SNR in dB scale, one-bit cooperation per direction buys roughly one-bit gain per user until full receiver cooperation performance is reached, while when INR is between 67% and 200% of SNR in dB scale, one-bit cooperation per direction buys roughly half-bit gain per user. The conclusion is drawn based on the approximate characterization of the symmetric capacity in the symmetric set-up. We propose strategies achieving the symmetric capacity universally to within 3 bits. The strategy consists of two parts: (1) the transmission scheme, where superposition encoding with a simple power split is employed, and (2) the cooperative protocol, where quantize-binning is used for relaying.	approximation algorithm;interference (communication);mimo;product binning;quantization (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	I.-Hsiang Wang;David Tse	2009	2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop		telecommunications;information theory;computer science;wireless network;statistics	Mobile	34.99524539011749	73.6527425858387	127038

A fingerprint, a mark unique to each user, is embedded into each copy of the distributed covertext. In a collusion attack, two or more users may combine their copies in an attempt to “remove” their fingerprints and forge a pirated copy. To trace the forgery back to members of the coalition, we need fingerprinting codes that can reliably identify the fingerprints of those members. Researchers have been focusing on designing or testing fingerprints for Gaussian host signals and the mean square error (MSE) distortion under some classes of collusion attacks, in terms of the detector’s error probability in detecting collusion members. For example, under the assumptions of Gaussian fingerprints and Gaussian attacks (the fingerprinted signals are averaged and then the result is passed through a Gaussian test channel), Moulin and Briassouli derived optimal strategies in a game-theoretic framework that uses the detector’s error probability as the performance measure for a binary decision problem (whether a user participates in the collusion attack or not); Stone and Zhao et al. studied average and other non-linear collusion attacks for Gaussian-like fingerprints; Wang et al. stated that the average collusion attack is the most efficient one for orthogonal fingerprints; Kiyavash and Moulin derived a mathematical proof of the optimality of the average collusion attack under some assumptions.	code;decision problem;distortion;embedded system;fingerprint (computing);forge;game theory;gaussian blur;mean squared error;nonlinear system;sensor;steganography	Ying Wang;Pierre Moulin	2007		10.1117/12.706575	probability density function;video;distortion;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;probability of error;decision problem;mean squared error;mutual information;computer security;information protection policy;fingerprint recognition	Security	32.98299599737435	67.13527959187044	127249

In this paper, we propose a directional squeezed-state protocol with signals detected by a Rindler observer in the relativistic quantum field framework. We derive an analytical solution to the transmission problem of squeezed states from the inertial sender to the accelerated receiver. The variance of the involved signal mode is closer to optimality than that of the coherentstate-based protocol. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol has better performance than the coherent-state counterpart especially in terms of the maximal transmission distance.	coherence (physics);coherent states;information processing;maximal set;quantum field theory;quantum information science;quantum key distribution;simulation	Jian Zhou;Ronghua Shi;Ying Guo	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-018-1821-1	observer (quantum physics);quantum information;inertial frame of reference;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum field theory;squeezed coherent state;communication source;quantum key distribution	EDA	30.326307387673243	64.7722528545025	127344

It is shown through an example that the rate-region can be strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity region. The coding strategy involves block-Markov superposition coding using Marton's scheme as the starting point. If the message rates in the Marton scheme are too high to be decoded at the end of a block, each receiver is left with a list of messages compatible with its output. In the next block, we send resolution information for each receiver to resolve its list. The key observation is that the resolution information of the first receiver is correlated with that of the second. We transmit this correlated information efficiently in the following block using ideas from the Han-Costa coding scheme.	code;han unification;markov chain	Ramji Venkataramanan;S.

0f90eff45bbe2086e707adc55b51712fa9abc073	tradeoffs between storage and latency for cache-aided relay interference channels with no csit		In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs between storage and latency for a k-user cache-aided relay interference channel with K antennas at the relay when channel state information (CSI) is not available at the transmitters. We propose a cache placement and content delivery scheme, and mainly focus on the case when each transmitter has a cache size capable of storing 1 out of K files in the library. The main contribution of our work is that by applying the relay decode-and-forward (DF) protocol, we can achieve a normalized delivery time (NDT) δ(μ) = (2Κ − 1)/K, which is the upper bound for the Κ-user interference channel with instantaneous CSI at the Transmitter (CSIT) when the normalized cache size at the transmitter is 1/K. We then consider caching at the relay, and based on the sum-Degree of Freedom (DoF) result, we found the achievable NDT to be (Κα + Κ − 1 − β)/(Ka − β), where a is the file splitting parameter and β is related to the relay cache size. We also analyze the case when the transmitter has a normalized cache size of 1. To our knowledge, no one had studied a relay interference channel with no CSIT but with caching. Our results show that caching at the relay side shortens the latency effectively, especially for a network with a large number of users. Furthermore, the presence of a relay in the network renders instantaneous CSIT unnecessary, which is a more practical situation in such systems.	cache (computing);channel state information;digital distribution;direction finding;interference (communication);relay;rendering (computer graphics);scheme;transmitter	Haobo Liang;Roger S.

Partial feedback for the LD-IC models a scenario in which the top l most-significant-bits of the channel output of receiver j are received as feedback at transmitter j, for j = 1, 2. The rationale for studying the LD-IC with partial feedback comes from the fact that it is a good approximation to the Gaussian interference channel with output feedback corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (commonly referred to as noisy feedback). The main contribution of this paper is to characterize the capacity region of the symmetric LD-IC with partial feedback. The main ingredient of the proof is to obtain novel upper bounds on weighted rates 2R1 + R2 and R1 + 2R2.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;block cipher mode of operation;design rationale;feedback;interference (communication);transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sy-Quoc Le;Ravi Tandon;Mehul Motani;H.

It is shown that syndromesource-coding can achieve arbitrarily small distortion with the number of compressed digits per source digit arbitrarily close to the entropy of a binary memoryless source. A “universal” generalization of syndrome-source-coding is formulated which provides robustly effective distortionless coding of source ensembles. Two examples are given comparing the performance of noiseless universal syndrome-source-coding to 1) run-length coding and 2) Lynch-Davisson-Schalkwijk-Cover universal coding for an-ensemble of binary memoryless sources.	arithmetic coding;data compression;distortion;forward error correction;run-length encoding;universal code (data compression);universal generalization	Teofilo C.

These error-correction mechanisms suffer either from high resolution loss or a large increase in the number of tile-types. In this paper, we propose dimension augmented proof-reading, a technique that uses the third dimension to do error-correction in two dimensional self-assembling systems. This involves no resolution loss in the two dimensions of interest, results in a smaller increase in the number of tile-types than previous techniques, and appears to have the same error-correction properties.  Error-correcting systems need to be analyzed in the kinetic Tile Assembly Model; such analysis involves complicated Markov Chains and is cumbersome. In this paper, we also present a set of completely combinatorial criteria that can be used to prove properties of error-correcting self-assembling systems. We illustrate these criteria by applying them to two known proof-reading systems, one of which was not previously known to work. We then use these criteria to prove the correctness of dimension augmented proof-reading applied to a self-assembling system that computes the parity of a string.	correctness (computer science);error detection and correction;gnu nano;image resolution;markov chain;parity bit;self-assembly	Ho-Lin Chen;Ashish Goel;Chris Luhrs	2008			ising model;markov chain;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;two-dimensional space;discrete mathematics;error detection and correction;image resolution;computer science;mathematics;geometry;self-assembly;algorithm;kinetics;statistics	Theory	35.84050149750456	61.103825220226	129116

In this case, we pose its computation as an optimization problem and analyze its structure. We show that the computation of the capacity region of the two-user discrete memoryless degraded broadcast channel can be characterized as a difference of convex optimization problem, a non-convex problem in general. For this problem, which cannot be solved optimally in polynomial time, we obtain necessary conditions for optimality which substantially reduce the set of potential capacity-achieving candidate distributions. As an application of this result, the capacity region of the BEC-BSC degraded broadcast channel is derived by maximizing the achievable rates over this set of reduced dimensionality.	battery eliminator circuit;binary symmetric channel;computable function;computation;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;time complexity	Eduard Calvo;Daniel Pérez Palomar;Javier Rodríguez Fonollosa;Josep Vidal	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595282	probability distribution;time complexity;random variable;optimization problem;entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convex optimization;mathematics;mutual information;channel capacity;statistics	Theory	35.59299339134038	65.91967444504606	129221

In particular, we address the case where the occurrence probabilities are unknown for some of the symbols in an alphabet. Bounds can be obtained for alphabets of a given size, for alphabets of up to a given size, and for alphabets of arbitrary size. The method operates on a Computer Algebra System, yielding closed-form expressions for all results. Finally, we show the potential of the proposed method to shed some light on the structure of the minimum redundancy achievable by the Huffman code.	computer algebra system;huffman coding	Ian Blanes;Miguel Hernández-Cabronero;Joan Serra-Sagristà;Michael W.

The symmetric capacity within O(1) is characterized for the symmetric case where all direct links have the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and all undesired links have the same interference-to-noise ratio (INR). The gap to the exact capacity is a constant which is independent of SNR and INR. On the achievability side, an interesting conclusion is that the generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) regime where treating interference as noise is found to be optimal in the 2 user interference channel, does not appear in the N + 1 user, 1 × N SIMO case. On the converse side, new multi-user outer bounds emerge out of this work that do not follow directly from the 2 user case. We also provide an outer bound on the capacity region of the 3 user SIMO Gaussian interference channel with 2 antennas at each receiver. This outer bound directly leads to the capacity region of this channel if the channel vectors satisfy certain conditions.	interference (communication)	Tiangao Gou;Syed Ali Jafar	2009		10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205565	transmitter;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Theory	36.36374346181314	73.26170650063524	129265

In this paper, we derive some information theory bounds on the performance of noisy compressive sensing to calculate the data rate with particular distortion, which has significant meaning in data storage technique. We analyze the rate distortion performance of noisy compressive sensing under Mean Squared distortion and Hamming distortion, and give more accurate results. Besides, mathematical lower bounds of rate distortion function and theoretical minimal useful bit rates are provided for these two distortion for the first time. We also give a theoretical upper bound of the Mean Squared distortion of compressive sensing process. The relationships of bit rate per dimension R(D)/N and M, N, and M/N are given and plotted in this paper, and both theoretical analysis and numerical results show that compressive sensing uses less number of bits to represent the same information compared to conventional information acquisition and reconstruction techniques.	compressed sensing;computer data storage;data acquisition;distortion;information theory;mean squared error;numerical analysis;rate–distortion theory;uncompressed video;window function	Junjie Chen;Qilian Liang;Baoju Zhang;Xiaorong Wu	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649377	mathematical optimization;information theory;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;compressed sensing;statistics	Mobile	36.816850504431756	64.25984268949041	129743

By employing quantization, it is possible to obtain binary codewords with a non-uniform distribution. The obtained statistics is hence suitable for optimal, direct quantization of non-uniform Bernoulli sources. We employ a message-passing algorithm combined with a decimation procedure in order to perform compression. The experimental results based on GF(q)-LDGM codes with regular degree distributions yield performances quite close to the theoretical rate-distortion bounds.	algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;code word;data compression;decimation (signal processing);degree distribution;distortion;grammatical framework;lossy compression;message passing;performance;qr code;quantization (signal processing);time-sharing	Lorenzo Cappellari	2010	2010 IEEE Information Theory Workshop		discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;source code	Theory	37.90993828747389	63.94239389988026	130099

In practice, the encoding system must often be designed when only vague information is available concerning the source distribution; i.e., it is known only that the source distribution is a member of some class ,~. I t is thus important to extend Shannon's theory to cover this case. In this paper we define a rate distortion function for a class of sources, R,~(d), and prove a coding theorem. This theorem establishes that R,~(d) is the minimLtm channel capacity required by any system which can transmit each source in ~ with average distortion =< d, and that for a compact class of sources this rate can be approached as closely as desired. Further, we show that for a compact class, R,~(d) is the sup of Re(d) over all a in ~. This last result is important in that it greatly sireplifies the computation of R,~(d).	channel capacity;computation;distortion;rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit);vagueness	David J.

The new algorithm utilizes two well- known tools from statistical physics and computer science: Gibbs sampling and simulated annealing. In order to code a source sequence xn, the encoder initializes the reconstruction block as xn = xn, and then at each iteration uniformly at random chooses one of the symbols of xn, and updates it. This updating is based on some conditional probability distribution which depends on a parameter beta representing inverse temperature, an integer parameter k = o(logn) representing context length, and the original source sequence. At the end of this process, the encoder outputs the Lempel-Ziv description of xn, which the decoder deciphers perfectly, and sets as its reconstruction. The complexity of the proposed algorithm in each iteration is linear in k and independent of n. We prove that, for any stationary ergodic source, the algorithm achieves the optimal rate-distortion performance asymptotically in the limits of large number of iterations, beta, and n. We also show how our approach carries over to such problems as universal Wyner-Ziv coding and compression-based denoising.	algorithm;arithmetic coding;asymptotically optimal algorithm;computer science;data compression;distortion;encoder;ergodicity;gibbs sampling;iteration;lempel–ziv–stac;lossy compression;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;noise reduction;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);simulated annealing;stationary process;winzip	Shirin Jalali;Tsachy Weissman	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558567	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;source code	Theory	38.272802470510584	62.98530129105968	130776

We investigate the asymptotic reliability of optimal random block codes on Gaussian arbitrarily varying channels (GAVC’s). A GAVC is a discrete-time memoryless Gaussian channel with input power constraint PT and noise power N,, which is further corrupted by an additive “jamming signal.” The statistics of this signal are unknown and may be arbitrary, except that they are subject to a power constraint PJ. We distinguish between two types of power constraints: peak and average. For peak constraints on the input power and the jamming power we show that the GAVC has a random coding capacity. For the remaining cases in which either the transmitter or the jammer or both are subject to average power constraints, no capacities exist and only X-capacities are found. The asymptotic error probability suffered by optimal random codes in these cases is determined. Our results suggest that if the jammer is subject only to an average power constraint, reliable communication is impossible at any positive code rate.	additive white gaussian noise;adversary (cryptography);arbitrarily varying channel;code rate;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;noise power;radio jamming;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Brian L.

One is the m&hod used by Shamloll in his first papers on illformation theory.’ The second was given by the preseilt author in his doctoral thesis.’ Both methods show that by using “codes” in which the “code words” are sequences of increasing length n, the probability of reception error for any fixed rate of transmission H < C goes to zero as n goes to infinity.

We assume that each transmitter has side-information consisting of the messages of the Jl users to its left and the Jr users to its right, and that each receiver can decode its message using the signals received at its own antenna, at the il antennas to its left, and at the ir antennas to its right. For this setting, we characterize the multiplexing gain, i.e., the asymptotic logarithmic growth of the sum-rate capacity at high SNR, and point out interesting duality aspects. We also present results on the multiplexing gain of a symmetric version of this network where the signal sent by a given transmitter is interfered by the signals sent by the transmitter to its left and the transmitter to its right.	cellular model;cognitive network;interference (communication);loran-c;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;transmitter	Nathan Levy;Shlomo Shamai;Michele A.

A Nitadori-like formula is discovered for an optimal quantizer when ρ(<sup>△</sup>= σ<sub>p</sub>/σ<sub>q</sub>) = 1/2. Also it is shown that the distortion expressions derived rigorously for asymptotically optimal quantile quantizers essentially confirm the heuristically obtained previous result that the distortion decreases as 1/ N<sup>3/ρ</sup> for the heavy mismatch of ρ >; 3/2, as lnN/ N<sup>2</sup> for the critical mismatch of ρ = 3/2, and as 1/N<sup>2</sup> for the mild mismatch of ρ <; 3/2, where N is the number of quantization points. These asymptotic behaviors agree surprisingly well with Bennett's integral even in the critical and heavy mismatched cases. Thus, in the case of nonuniform quantizers, the long-conjectured convergence of the MSE distortion to zero at a rate other than 1/N<sup>2</sup> is confirmed rigorously. In addition, optimal uniform quantizers are found to be heavily mismatched when ρ >; 1 and the resulting distortion decreases as (In N/N<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/p</sup>.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;distortion;heuristic;laplacian matrix;mean squared error;nonuniform sampling;quantization (signal processing)	Sangsin Na	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2146390	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;asymptotic analysis;computer science;mathematics;statistics;source code	ML	36.8621449475295	63.63934604149904	131569

Instead of considering the original encoder, we consider a related one which is quasi-stationary. We use the quasi-stationary property in order to formulate linear requirements that must hold on the probabilities of the constrained arrays that are generated by the encoder. These requirements are used as part of a linear program. The minimum and maximum of the linear program bound the rate of the encoder from below and from above, respectively. A lower bound on the rate of an encoder is also a lower bound on the capacity of the corresponding constraint. For some constraints, our results lead to tighter lower bounds than what was previously known.	encoder	Ido Tal;Ron M. Roth	2010	IEEE Trans.

For the two user MIMO interference channel, we find a general inner bound and a genie-aided outer bound that give us the exact number of degrees of freedom in many cases. We also study a share-and-transmit scheme for transmitter coopera tion. For the share-and-transmit scheme, we show how the gains of transmitter cooperation are entirely offset by the cost of enabling that cooperation so that the available degrees of freedom ar e not increased.	catastrophic interference;genie;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;relay;transmitter	Syed Ali Jafar;Maralle J.

The channel state consists of two independent components, S1 and S2, available at Encoder 1 and Encoder 2, respectively. The problem where the state is available at only one of the encoders is a special case . We consider two scenarios. In the first, the states are available at the encoders in a strictly causal manner. We derive an achievable region, which is tight for a Gaussian MAC where the state sequence comprises the channel noise and is available at one of the encoders only. In the second scenario the state sequence is available to the encoders in a causal manner, as in Shannon's model. A simple extension of the previous result to Shannon strategies yields an achievability result. Our region contains as a special case the naïve rate region obtained when each of the users applies Shannon strategies.

The sender Alice first shares m − 1 Bell states and one n +1-particle Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state with n agents, where the agent Bob, who is designated to recover the original m-qubit state, just keeps m particles and other agents (all controllers) n − 1 particles, that is, each controller only holds one particle in hand. Subsequently, Alice performs m Bell-basis measurements on her 2m particles and each controller only need take a single-particle measurement on his particle with the basis X. Finally, Bob can recover the original m-qubit state with the corresponding local unitary operations according to Alice and all controllers’ measurement results. Its intrinsic efficiency for qubits approaches 100%, and the total efficiency really approaches the maximal value, which is higher than those of the known symmetric schemes.	greenberger–horne–zeilinger state;maximal set;quantum state;qubit	Runhua Shi;Liusheng Huang;Wei Yang;Hong Zhong	2011	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-010-0176-z	quantum information;quantum information science;no-communication theorem;theoretical computer science;greenberger–horne–zeilinger state;secret sharing;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum cryptography;quantum mechanics	Theory	30.381941125863584	64.85890781634735	132917
eb1e3dd4934ac6618f1017e25d19d5abe76e7fd9	secrecy dof of blind mimome wiretap channel with delayed csit		We study the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output multiple-eavesdropper wiretap channel where a transmitter wishes to communicate a confidential message to a legitimate receiver in the presence of eavesdroppers. Each node in the network is equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas. Furthermore, channels are time varying, and there is no channel state information available at the transmitter (CSIT) with respect to eavesdroppers’ channels; and transmitter only has access to delayed CSIT of the channel to the legitimate receiver. The secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) for such a network has only been characterized for special cases, and is unknown in general. We completely characterize the SDoF of this network for all antenna configurations. In particular, we strictly improve the state-of-the-art achievable scheme for this network by proposing more efficient artificial noise alignment at the receivers. Furthermore, we develop a tight upper bound by utilizing three important inequalities that provide lower bounds on the received signal dimensions at receivers which supply delayed CSIT or no CSIT. These inequalities together allow for analysis of signal dimensions in networks with heterogeneous CSIT; and as a result, we present a converse proof that leads to characterization of SDoF for all possible antenna configurations.	channel state information;confidentiality;mimo;transmitter	Sina Lashgari;Amir Salman Avestimehr	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756602	computer science;theoretical computer science;secrecy;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;communication channel	Crypto	35.56921786451151	72.08467842377782	133121

New class of message-wise unequal error protection problems are also introduced. Even for data-rates approaching the channel capacity, it is shown that a crucial part of information can be protected with exponential reliability.

These approximations are then used to show that, when N is moderately large, it is better to use equi-interval quantizing than the optimum fixed-N quantizer if the signal is to be subsequently buffered and transmitted at a tixed bit rate. Finally, the problem of optimum quantizing in the presence of buffering is examined, and the numerical results presented for Gaussian signals indicate that equilevel quantizing yields nearly optimum results.	approximation;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing)	Roger C.

4abe7342db204cf46e61df7c23834585b0026bfc	on tdma optimality in locally connected networks with no csit		In this work, we study scenarios of wireless networks where using simple Time-Division-Multiple-Access (TDMA) is optimal if no channel state information is available at the transmitters (no CSIT). We consider single-hop locally conected interference networks where each transmitter is connectedto the receiver that has the same index as well as L succeeding receivers. The considered rate criterion is the per user Deg rees of Freedom as the number of transmitter-receiver pairs goesto infinity. For the case whenL = 1, it was shown in previous work that TDMA is optimal, even if each message can be available at multiple transmitters and linear cooperation schemes ar e allowed. Here, we extend this conclusion to the case where L = 2, by proving optimality of TDMA in this case as well. We then study the problem for general values ofL without allowing for cooperative transmission. We prove optimality of TDMA when each transmitter is serving the receiver with the same index , and finally conjecture based on an example that the same conclusion applies even if each receiver can be served by any single transmitter connected to it.	channel state information;gareth rees (software developer);interference (communication);transmitter	Aly El Gamal	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	35.253086745109435	74.24245978868173	134341

The sum-rate capacity of this class of channels is determined. As with the Gaussian case, the sum-rate capacity is achieved by letting the transceiver pair subject to interference communicate at a rate such that its message can be decoded at the unintended receiver using single user detection. It is also established that this class of DMICs is equivalent in capacity region to certain degraded interference channels. This allows the construction of capacity outer-bounds using the capacity regions of associated degraded broadcast channels. The same technique is then used to determine the sum-rate capacity of DMICs with mixed interference as defined in this paper. The obtained capacity bounds and sum-rate capacities are used to resolve the capacities of several new DMICs.	interference (communication);transceiver	Fangfang Zhu;Biao Chen	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2322872	telecommunications;mathematics;interference;markov process;statistics;transceiver	Arch	35.45144301106767	70.79000350513017	134490

An exception is networks where channels are spatially correlated. This paper characterizes the capacity region of two-user erasure interference channels with delayed knowledge of the channel state information and spatially correlated channels. There are instances where spatial correlation eliminates any potential gain from delayed channel state information and instances where it enables the same performance that is possible with instantaneous knowledge of channel state. The key is an extremal entropy inequality for spatially correlated channels that separates the two types of instances. It is also shown that to achieve the capacity region, each transmitter only needs to rely on the delayed knowledge of the channels to which it is connected.	camera serial interface;channel state information;interference (communication);social inequality;transmitter	Alireza Vahid;A.

Both encoders transmit a common message and, one of the encoders also transmits an individual message. We study the capacity region of this communication model. We establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region. The outer bound is non-trivial, and has a relatively simple form. Furthermore, we show that the inner and outer bounds coincide in some special case; and, so, we characterize the capacity region fully in these cases. The results shed more light on the utility of delayed channel state information for increasing the capacity region of multiaccess channels; and tie with some recent progress in this framework.	bekenstein bound;channel state information;encoder;transmitter	Abdellatif Zaidi;Shlomo Shamai	2013	2013 IEEE 14th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2013.6612043	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Mobile	35.24932346849748	71.9242196919666	134938

In this paper, we derive achievable rates on Gaussian vector channels with cooperative C&F relaying. In order to extend previous information-theoretic results from the scalar to the vector Gaussian channel, we exploit recent results in distributed source coding. Like in source coding with side information at the decoder, the relay applies a conditional Karhunen Loeve transform (CKLT) to its observed signal, followed by a separate Wyner-Ziv encoding of each output stream with a different rate and under a sum-rate constraint. However, these Wyner-Ziv coding rates are such that the total mutual information between the source and destination is maximized. This differs from the conventional source coding approach in which the rates are selected to minimize the total squared distortion, leading to the well-known reverse-waterfilling algorithm. We show that the maximization of the C&F mutual information is also a convex problem. The optimum Wyner-Ziv coding rates have a simple analytical expression, and can be obtained by a waterfilling algorithm. Finally, we illustrate these results by simulations of MIMO-OFDM relaying in a system similar to IEEE802.16.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;convex optimization;data compression;distortion;distributed source coding;entropy maximization;information theory;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;mutual information;relay;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sébastien Simoens;Olga Muñoz;Josep Vidal	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.697	distributed source coding;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;index term;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mutual information;karhunen–loève theorem;statistics;source code	ML	34.800858386409836	74.19808088102235	135337

The advantages of this approach are twofold: First, it extends existing results on the achievable DoF to generalized antenna configurations. Second, it unifies the analysis for time-varying and constant channels and provides valuable insights and interconnections between the two channel models. It turns out that a DoF of NM/M+N-1 is feasible whenever the sum of the L2j ≥ [N - 1][M - 1].	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);relay	Daniel Frank;Karlheinz Ochs;Aydin Sezgin	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952287	telecommunications	Visualization	36.22704689220482	73.9303025228309	135771

a378285fa986c65c867888caafd382b968a6f1f6	quantum side information: uncertainty relations, extractors, channel simulations		Any theory of information processing always depends on an underlying physical theory. Information theory based on classical physics is known as classical information theory, and information theory based on quantum mechanics is called quantum information theory. It is the aim of this thesis to improve our understanding of the similarities and differences between classical and quantum information theory by discussing various information theoretic problems from the perspective of an observer with the ability to perform quantum operations. This thesis is divided into four parts, each is self contained and can also be read separately. In the first part, we discuss the algebraic approach to classical and quantum physics and develop information theoretic concepts within this setup. This approach has the advantage of being mathematically very general, and with this, allows to describe virtually all classical and quantum mechanical systems. Moreover, it enables us to include physical situations with infinitely many degrees of freedom involved. In the second part, we discuss the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The principle states that even if we have full classical information about the state of a quantum system, it is impossible to deterministically predict the outcomes of all possible measurements. In comparison, the perspective of a quantum observer allows to have quantum information about the state of a quantum system. This then leads to an interplay between uncertainty and quantum correlations. It turns out that even in the presence of this additional information, we exhibit nontrivial bounds on the uncertainty contained in the measurements of complementary observables. We provide an information theoretic analysis by discussing so-called entropic uncertainty relations with quantum side information. In the third part, we discuss the concept of randomness extractors. Classical and quantum randomness are an essential resource in information theory, cryptography, and computation. However, most sources of randomness exhibit only weak forms of unpredictability, and the goal of randomness extraction is to convert such weak randomness into (almost) perfect randomness. We discuss various constructions for classical and quantum randomness extractors, and we examine especially the performance of these constructions relative to an observer with quantum side information.

Unlike the classical relay networks where the transmit signal of a relay node depends only on its past received symbols, our network model consists of two types of relays, i.e., relays with one sample delay (classical relays) and relays without delay (causal relays) whose transmit signal depends not only on the past received symbols but also on the current received symbol. For this network, we derive two new cut-set bounds, one when the causal relays have their own messages and the other when not. Our new cut-set bounds recover the classical cut-set bound when there is no causal relay. Using two examples, i.e., causal vector Gaussian two-way relay channel and causal vector Gaussian relay channel, we show that the new cut-set bounds can be achieved by a simple amplify-and-forward type relaying. Our result for the causal relay channel strengthens the previously known capacity result for the same channel by El Gamal, Hassanpour, and Mammen.	causal filter;internet relay chat;network model;relay channel	Ihn-Jung Baik;Sae-Young Chung	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120175	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;relay channel	ML	34.70870787739077	71.75442405164387	136839

In particular, this perspective of code-on-network-graphs (CNG) can be exploited to map source data generated within WSN (of size K) to a variable nodes subset in low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The resulting fixed size symbol stream when transmitted through the network suffers erasures. At sink, an average of z source symbols can be recovered by employing belief propagation decoding. In this paper, we determine CNG code ensembles that achieve maximal recovery (z/K) for different erasure rates and network topological constraints corresponding to node transmission range. An analytic framework to predict code performance under transmission range constraints is developed. Additionally, necessary condition for code stability was derived using fixed-point stability analysis. Optimal solutions for a WSN with 1000 nodes are determined using differential evolution algorithm. We outline a distributed algorithm for generating a sequence of encoded symbols adhering to the designed code ensemble. The performance of the designed CNG code is demonstrated to be superior to random NC and growth code based ensembles, as well as resilient to network size and inter-connectivity variations.	belief propagation;degree distribution;differential evolution;distributed algorithm;forward error correction;ibm notes;linear network coding;low-density parity-check code;maximal set;microsoft research;network mapping;network packet;parity bit;sensor;software propagation;source data	Kiran Misra;Shirish S.

db9184bcf9c1b2ec84e5870964d236bac265c03f	optimal index codes via a duality between index coding and network coding		In Index Coding, the goal is to use a broadcast channel as efficiently as possible to communicate information from a source to multiple receivers which can possess some of the information symbols at the source as side-information. In this work, we present a duality relationship between index coding (IC) and multiple-unicast network coding (NC). It is known that the IC problem can be represented using a side-information graph $G$ (with number of vertices $n$ equal to the number of source symbols). The size of the maximum acyclic induced subgraph, denoted by MAI S is a lower bound on the broadcast rate. For IC problems with MAIS = n - 1 and MAI S = n - 2, prior work has shown that binary (over F 2) linear index codes achieve the MAI S lower bound for the broadcast rate and thus are optimal. In this work, we use the the duality relationship between NC and IC to show that for a class of IC problems with MAIS = n - 3, binary linear index codes achieve the MAI S lower bound on the broadcast rate. In contrast, it is known that there exists IC problems with MAIS = n - 3 and optimal broadcast rate strictly greater than MAIS.

The heterogeneity of CSIT lies in the timeliness of channel state that governs the link from the transmitter to different receivers - CSI of each link can be perfectly (causally or non-causally), delayed, or not available at the transmitter. We focus on the erasure BC and the bursty Gaussian BC, where the channel states are governed by memoryless Bernoulli processes, independent across users. For the erasure BC with perfect single-user CSIT, we characterize its capacity region regardless of the CSIT of the other user and show that this capacity region strictly contains that with no CSIT. For the case with delayed single-user CSIT, we propose an opportunistic network coding scheme that achieves a strictly larger rate region than the no-CSIT capacity region. These results are extended to the bursty Gaussian BC, where for the perfect single-user CSIT scenario, the capacity region is characterized to within a bounded gap; and for the delayed single-user CSIT scenario, a rate region based the opportunistic network coding scheme is derived. As a corollary, single-user CSIT is able to increase the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) for bursty Gaussian BC. Our result is in sharp contrast to the recent negative result by Davoodi and Jafar [1], where it is shown that for fast-fading MISO broadcast channel, single-user CSIT does not help at all in terms of sum DoF.	bernoulli polynomials;channel state information;linear network coding;multi-user;system analysis;transmitter	Shih-Chun Lin;I.-Hsiang Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541281	telecommunications	Theory	35.69460482406399	72.5218910386812	137597
eed26bb190bf925d261a707322c7aabf6b5dce0c	rate-distortion problem for physics based distributed sensing	nccr mics;nccr mics cl1	We consider the rate-distortion problem for sensing the continuous space-time physical temperature in a circular ring on which a heat source is applied over space and time, and which is also allowed to cool by radiation or convection to its surrounding medium. The heat source is modelled as a continuous space-time stochastic process which is bandlimited over space and time. The temperature field is the result of a circular convolution over space and a continuous-time causal filtering over time of the heat source with the Green's function corresponding to the heat equation, which is space and time invariant. The temperature field is sampled at uniform spatial locations by a set of sensors and it has to be reconstructed at a base station. The goal is to minimize the mean-square-error per second, for a given number of nats per second, assuming ideal communication channels between sensors and base station. We find a) the centralized R/sup c/ (D) function of the temperature field, where all the space-time samples can be observed and encoded jointly. Then, we obtain b) the R/sup s-i/ (D) function, where each sensor, independently, encodes its samples optimally over time and c) the R/sup st-i/ (D) function, where each sensor is constrained to encode also independently over time. We also study two distributed prediction-based approaches: a) with perfect feedback from the base station, where temporal prediction is performed at the base station and each sensor performs differential encoding, and b) without feedback, where each sensor locally performs temporal prediction.	bandlimiting;causal filter;centralized computing;circular convolution;distortion;encode;emoticon;mean squared error;network address translation;sensor;stochastic process;time-invariant system	Baltasar Beferull-Lozano;Robert L.

We are aiming to characterize the capacity region of this model given discrete memoryless Gaussian channels. We establish three capacity upper bounds by relaxing the cut-set bound, and by extending two capacity bounds originally derived for MIMO relay channels. We also present one lower bound by using decoding-and-forward relaying combined with network beam-forming.	backhaul (telecommunications);converge;direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);mimo;multicast;numerical analysis;relay	Jinfeng Du;Ming Xiao;Mikael Skoglund	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633767	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	34.39384813086399	72.74081809055035	138122

New capacity outer bounds are established for these channels. These outer bounds are all derived based on a novel unified framework. Using the derived outer bounds, some new capacity results are proved for the CIC and the CRC; a mixed interference regime is identified for the two-user CIC, where decoding interference at one receiver and treating interference as noise at the other one is sum-rate optimal. In addition, a noisy interference regime is derived for the one-sided CIC. Our new capacity theorems for the CIC contain the previously obtained results regarding the Gaussian channel as special cases. For the CRC, a full characterization of the capacity region for a class of more-capable channels is derived. Moreover, it is shown that the derived outer bounds are useful to study channels with one-sided receiver side information wherein one of the receivers has access to the nonintended message; capacity bounds are also discussed in details for such scenarios. Our results lead to new insights regarding the nature of information flow in the basic interference networks.	additive white gaussian noise;cognitive radio;cyclic redundancy check;interference (communication);unified framework	Reza K.

PICOD models `content-type coding' applications, such as web searches. PICOD significantly differs from classical index coding (where each client desires a specific message not present in its side information set) in the following sense. Past work showed that for PICOD O(log n) broadcast transmissions suffice to satisfy all the n clients, as opposed to the Ω(n) transmissions required by index coding; the key to this exponential improvement in number of transmissions is a probabilistic argument to show that a single transmission can satisfy at least a constant fraction of the clients. This paper elaborates further on this key result as follows. (i) A non-probabilistic analysis provides a lower bound, no smaller than 1/e, on the largest fraction of PICOD clients that can be satisfied by a single transmission in the case where all side information sets have the same cardinality; the new bound is tighter than known ones for any number of messages and clients, and sheds light into how the cardinality of the side information sets affects the number of clients satisfied by a single transmission. (ii) The same argument applied to the case where a message is in the side information set of any given client with probability p ∈ (0, 1) independent of all other messages and clients, and when there are sufficiently many messages, provides an more refined characterization of the performance than known results.	probabilistic analysis of algorithms;time complexity	Tang Liu;Daniela Tuninetti	2016	2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2016.7606849	telecommunications;operations management;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	34.339662667844415	60.56887728102483	138858

Specifically, we consider a network with a mixture of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers that are distributed according to two independent Poisson point processes on a √n × √n square. Assuming that legitimate nodes can generate artificial noise, which is shown in the literature to be an effective way of suppressing eavesdropping, we provide sufficient conditions on the transmission power and the noise generation power required for a network with known intensity of eavesdroppers to be asymptotically almost surely connected with secrecy constraint as n → ∞, considering the cases of both non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers.	high-level programming language;information theory	Tao Yang;Guoqiang Mao;Wei Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036827	wireless ad hoc network;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;euclidean distance;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;computer network	Mobile	31.57149920675326	69.83125635987301	139061

It is only known to the transmitter and receivers that the actual channel realization is fixed and from a pre-specified set of channels. The information theoretic criterion of strong secrecy is analyzed in detail and generalized in such a way that it completely captures the behavior and the abilities of the non-legitimate receiver. Its impact on the decoding performance of the non-legitimate receiver is characterized as well. In particular, it is shown that regardless of the computational capabilities and the applied decoding strategy of the non-legitimate receiver, his decoding error always tends to one. This gives a valuable signal processing implication of the generalized secrecy criterion and identifies desirable properties of an optimal code design.	computation;confidentiality;information theory;profiling (computer programming);signal processing;strong secrecy;transmitter	Rafael F.

The latter model leads to an interesting binomial sum asymptotics with super-exponential growth functions. Our findings could be used to approximate numerically the minimax redundancy for various ranges of the sequence length and the alphabet size. These results are obtained by analytic techniques such as tree-like generating functions and the saddle point method.	approximation algorithm;minimax;numerical analysis;open-source software;time complexity;universal code (data compression)	Wojciech Szpankowski;Marcelo J.

94eefcfed36071fe53c49df9c67e3b7c33c0020f	probabilistic teleportation of arbitrary two-qubit quantum state via non-symmetric quantum channel		Quantum teleportation has significant meaning in quantum information. In particular, entangled states can also be used for perfectly teleporting the quantum state with some probability. This is more practical and efficient in practice. In this paper, we propose schemes to use non-symmetric quantum channel combinations for probabilistic teleportation of an arbitrary two-qubit quantum state from sender to receiver. The non-symmetric quantum channel is composed of a two-qubit partially entangled state and a three-qubit partially entangled state, where partially entangled Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state and W state are considered, respectively. All schemes are presented in detail and the unitary operations required are given in concise formulas. Methods are provided for reducing classical communication cost and combining operations to simplify the manipulation. Moreover, our schemes are flexible and applicable in different situations.	automatic control;bell state;computation;greenberger–horne–zeilinger state;protocol stack;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum state;quantum teleportation;qubit;transformation matrix;w state	Kan Wang;Xu-Tao Yu;Xiao-Fei Cai;Zaichen Zhang	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20040238	mathematical optimization;qubit;quantum information;quantum mechanics;mathematics;quantum entanglement;quantum information science;quantum teleportation;quantum channel;quantum state;w state	Arch	30.786577159887226	65.16413252596656	139427
be8d8c4c937a13d53a569490c6d5752ea96cfde7	overcoming unambiguous state discrimination attack with the help of schrödinger cat decoy states		In this work we propose the technique for phasecoded weak coherent states protocols utilizing two signal states and one decoy state which is found as linear combination of signal states (Schrödinger Cat states); the latter allows to overcome the USD attack. For instance, Schrödinger Cat states can be considered as even coherent states. Moreover we consider decoy states implementation based on squeezed vacuum states which might not disables USD completely yet produces discrimination probabilities low enough to distribute keys in channel with particular losses. Thus we can detect Eve simply by monitoring the detection rate of decoy states. It should be noted that this approach can be scaled to more complex schemes. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement	coherent states;decoy state;eve;image scaling;ps (unix);quantum key distribution;scalability;schrödinger;schrödinger's cat	Andrei Gaidash;Anton Kozubov;George Miroshnichenko	2018	CoRR		discrete mathematics;decoy state;quantum mechanics;linear combination;schrödinger's cat;coherent states;decoy;mathematics;communication channel	Security	29.710058394159095	65.98165293973487	139465

Our constructions are based on constellations for the classical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, and we adapt the results of Wu and Verdú [Allerton 2010, pp. 620] for the AWGN to determine achievable rates of classical and quantum information transmission for the thermal noise channel. Several constellations allow classical rates approaching the classical capacity, recently determined by Giovannetti et al. [Nature Photonics 8, 796 (2014)], while in the quantum case the rates approach the Gaussian coherent information. The constellations can also be used for private transmission of classical information at the coherent information rate.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;classical capacity;code word;coherent information;coherent states;encoder;imaginary time;johnson–nyquist noise;microsoft outlook for mac;physical information;polar code (coding theory);preprocessor;public-key cryptography;quantum information;quantum programming;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Felipe G.

In this paper, as an application of the Slepian-Wolf theorem, an advanced distributed source coding scheme for correlated images is presented. Assuming that the correlated image is a noisy version of the original, the scheme involves modulo encoding of the pixel values and encoding (compression) of the resulting symbols with binary and nonbinary turbo-codes, so that rate savings are achieved practically without loss.	bitwise operation;data compression;distributed source coding;modulo operation;pixel;turbo code	Angelos D.

Given that S and X are drawn from a finite set with joint distribution pS,X, we prove that a non-trivial amount of useful information can be disclosed while not disclosing any private information if and only if the smallest principal inertia component of the joint distribution of S and X is 0. This fundamental result characterizes when useful information can be privately disclosed for any privacy metric based on statistical dependence. We derive sharp bounds for the tradeoff between disclosure of useful and private information, and provide explicit constructions of privacy-assuring mappings that achieve these bounds.	information-theoretic security;personally identifiable information;privacy;ps (unix)	Flávio du Pin Calmon;Ali Makhdoumi;Muriel Médard	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2015.7282765	random variable;information theory;data mining;mathematics;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;correlation;measurement;statistics	Theory	33.563085219995784	65.53733681718231	139744

A joint source-channel code maps a block of <i>k</i> source symbols onto a length-<i>n</i> channel codeword, and the fidelity of reproduction at the receiver end is measured by the probability ε that the distortion exceeds a given threshold <i>d</i>. For memoryless sources and channels, it is demonstrated that the parameters of the best joint source-channel code must satisfy <i>nC</i> - <i>kR</i>(<i>d</i>) ≈ √(<i>nV</i> + <i>k V</i>(<i>d</i>)) <i>Q</i><sup>-1</sup>(ε), where <i>C</i> and <i>V</i> are the channel capacity and channel dispersion, respectively; <i>R</i>(<i>d</i>) and <i>V</i>(<i>d</i>) are the source rate-distortion and rate-dispersion functions; and <i>Q</i> is the standard Gaussian complementary cumulative distribution function. Symbol-by-symbol (uncoded) transmission is known to achieve the Shannon limit when the source and channel satisfy a certain probabilistic matching condition. In this paper, we show that even when this condition is not satisfied, symbol-by-symbol transmission is, in some cases, the best known strategy in the nonasymptotic regime.	approximation;channel capacity;code rate;code word;coding theory;data compression;distortion;forward error correction;lossy compression;noisy-channel coding theorem;numerical analysis	Victoria Kostina;Sergio Verdú	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283533	rate–distortion theory;channel code;telecommunications;information theory;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;error exponent;channel capacity;statistics;source code	Theory	36.772856988938116	65.70917388281457	140180

The presence of capacity constraints introduces theoretical and practical problems. The following problem is addressed: given that the peripheral encoders that satisfy these constraints are scalar quantizers, how should they be designed in order that the central test to be performed on their output indices is most powerful? The scheme is called cooperative design-separate encoding since the quantizers process separate observations but have a common goal; they seek to maximize a system-wide performance measure. The Bhattacharyya distance of the joint index space as such a criterion is suggested, and a design algorithm to optimize arbitrarily many quantizers cyclically is proposed. A simplified version of the algorithm, namely an independent design-separate encoding scheme, where the correlation is either absent or neglected for the sake of simplicity, is outlined. Performances are compared through worked examples. >		Maurizio Longo;Tom D. Lookabaugh;Robert M. Gray	1990	IEEE Trans.

For a two-user interference channel, a feedback link can exist between receivers and transmitters in nine canonical architectures (see Fig. 3 ), ranging from only one feedback link to four feedback links. We derive the exact capacity region for the symmetric deterministic interference channel and the constant-gap capacity region for the symmetric Gaussian interference channel for all of the nine architectures. We show that for a linear deterministic symmetric interference channel, in the weak interference regime, all models of feedback, except the one, which has only one of the receivers feeding back to its own transmitter, have the identical capacity region. When only one of the receivers feeds back to its own transmitter, the capacity region is a strict subset of the capacity region of the rest of the feedback models in the weak interference regime. However, the sum-capacity of all feedback models is identical in the weak interference regime. Moreover, in the strong interference regime, all models of feedback with at least one of the receivers feeding back to its own transmitter have the identical sum-capacity. For the Gaussian interference channel, the results of the linear deterministic model follow, where capacity is replaced with approximate capacity.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;channel capacity;feedback;fractal dimension;interference (communication);transmitter	Achaleshwar Sahai;Vaneet Aggarwal;Melda Yuksel;Ashutosh Sabharwal	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2278691	telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Mobile	35.933016182350414	72.43624364152423	140483

We consider the scenario in which the relay node receives transmissions only from one of the sources but its transmissions are received at both destinations. We first derive two upper bounds on the achievable GDoF: the first bound is based on the genie-aided approach, and the second bound is based on the cut-set theorem. We then derive an achievable GDoF by employing the decode-and-forward strategy at the relay and by treating interference as noise at each receiver. Lastly, we derive conditions on the gains of the links, under which this simple scheme is GDoF-optimal. Our results support the application of relaying in scenarios in which the interference is weak.	direction finding;genie;intelligent character recognition;interference (communication);relay	Daniel Zahavi;Ron Dabora	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874857	fading distribution;telecommunications;control theory;co-channel interference;channel state information;fading	Embedded	36.04319343707316	73.23325887207604	140613

This connection allows one to translate performance guarantees from one setup to the other.	channel capacity;compressed sensing;forward error correction;linear code;linear programming decoding;parity-check matrix	Alexandros G.

Although the capacity of the relay channel is still unknown even in the single-relay case, two fundamentally different relay schemes have been developed by (Cover and El Gamal, 1979) for such channels, which, depending on whether the relay decodes the information or not, are generally known as Decode-and-Forward (D-F) and Compress-and-Forward (C-F). In the D-F relay scheme, the relay first decodes the message sent by the source and then forwards it to the destination, and the destination decodes the message taking into account the inputs of both the source and the relay. In contrast, the C-F relay scheme is used when the relay cannot decode the message sent by the source, but still can help by compressing its observation into some compressed version, and forwarding this compression into the destination; the destination then either successively or jointly decodes the compression of the relay’s observation and the original message of the source. For the single-relay case, it is known that joint compression-message decoding, although providing more freedom in choosing the compression at the relay, cannot achieve higher rates for the original message than successive decoding. This thesis addresses some fundamental issues in generalizing and unifying the above D-F and C-F relay schemes to the multiple-relay case. We first generalize the C-F scheme to multiple-relay channels, and investigate the question of whether compression-message joint decoding can improve the achievable rate compared to successive decoding in the multiple-relay case. It is demonstrated that in the case of multiple relays, there is no improvement on the achievable rate by joint decoding either. More interestingly, it is discovered that any compressions not supporting successive decoding will actually lead to strictly lower achievable rates for the original message. Therefore, to maximize the achievable rate for the original message, the compressions should always be chosen to support successive decoding.

The number of retransmissions to achieve the necessary diversity level equals the collision multiplicity, whose proper detection is essential for good performance. The well-known network-assisted diversity multiple access employs the rank test method to detect the multiplicity blindly, but constant channel parameters throughout the retransmissions and the tight control of the transmitter phase are required. In this paper, a superior blind collision multiplicity detection technique is introduced for per-slot varying channels by combining the minimum description length (MDL) criterion and the rank test method. The proposed method and the rank test are compared both theoretically and experimentally.	experiment;hash table;mdl (programming language);minimum description length;network packet;retransmission (data networks);source separation;transmitter;turing test;whole earth 'lectronic link	Baris Özgül;Hakan Deliç	2004	IEEE 60th Vehicular Technology Conference, 2004.

General discrete memoryless channels with arbitrary input distributions are considered. The capacities of MLC with maximum likelihood decoding and with MSD are calculated, and it is shown that using MLC may result in loss in the achievable rate for reliable communication. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the rate loss to be zero are derived. A new random coding error exponent is derived for MLC with MSD. For the special case of uniform inputs, the new error exponent can be easily calculated by its inverse function, which is given by the sum of the inverse error exponents of the conditional sub-channels.	decoding methods;error exponent;multi-level cell;multistage amplifier	Amir Ingber;Meir Feder	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205311	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;channel code;probability of error;mathematics;inverse function;error exponent;channel capacity;encoding;statistics	Embedded	36.966600681618665	67.69814669521479	143336
5971b78dcf3b6f778c1535a9b58d13a30d9d24e5	optimal golomb-rice code extension for lossless coding of low-entropy exponentially distributed sources		This paper presents an extension of Golomb-Rice (GR) code for coding low-entropy sources, which the gap between their entropy and the conventional GR code length gets larger. We mention here the following four facts related to the proposed code, extended-domain GR (XDGR) code: it is represented by multiple code trees, based on the idea of almost instantaneous fixed-to-variable length codes, with its algorithm being a generalization of unary coding; its structure naturally contains run-length coding; the gap between the entropy and its average code length is theoretically guaranteed to be asymptotically negligible as the entropy of the exponentially distributed sources tends to zero; and its coding parameter, corresponding to the negative-domain Rice parameter of GR code, can be estimated from the input source-symbol sequence. Experimental evaluations are also presented supporting the theorems. The proposed XDGR code, having simple algorithm and high compression performance, is expected to be used for many coding applications, which deals with exponentially distributed sources at low bit rates.	algorithm;display resolution;golomb coding;golomb ruler;huffman coding;lossless compression;rice's theorem;run-length encoding;time complexity;unary coding;unary operation;variable-length code	Ryosuke Sugiura;Yutaka Kamamoto;Noboru Harada;Takehiro Moriya	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2018.2799629	discrete mathematics;source code;simple algorithm;unary coding;decoding methods;exponential distribution;computer science;golomb coding;low bit;lossless compression	Theory	38.06598720163805	62.65136448030054	143711

Users treat each other as noise and there is no central controller to assign the resources to the users. Each user randomly spreads the symbols in its Gaussian codewords by the so-called signatures of spreading gain N. Any receiver is aware of the signatures of its affiliated transmitter, however, it is unaware of the signatures of other users. This makes the interference plus noise at each receiver be mixed Gaussian, and hence, there is no closed expression for the achievable rates of users. Invoking conditional entropy power inequality and a key upper bound on the differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random vector, we develop a lower bound on the achievable rates of users. This lower bound has the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling as that of the exact achievable rate. It is shown that the sum multiplexing gain (SMG) in the network can be made arbitrarily close to (K/N) for any finite values of K and N where K ≤ N. The effect of matched filtering is studied in the particular case where the signatures are constructed over a binary alphabet. It is established that the SMG of the network is larger than (1/2e) regardless of the value of K as long as N = 2 and the signatures are generated according to a proper nonuniform distribution. This paper is concluded by a section on signature design in the finite SNR regime. The main observation is that for any two different methods A and B of designing the signatures, if method A results in a larger achievable rate per user for sufficiently large SNR values, then construction B is likely to yield larger achievable rates for sufficiently small values of SNR. This behavior is attributed to the interplay between two critical factors, namely, the multiplexing gain per user and what we refer to as the interference entropy factor.	antivirus software;code word;conditional entropy;differential entropy;entropy power inequality;image scaling;interference (communication);multiplexing;randomness;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality;transmitter;type signature	Kamyar Moshksar;Amir K.

It represents the scenario where the adversary may have correlated side information, e.g., a partial finger print or a DNA sequence of a relative of the legitimate user. We find the optimal exponent of the deception probability by proving both the achievability and the converse.

In this context, the paper investigates an innovative paradigm, according to which the residual data storage capacity of passive RFID tags is used as a kind of “virtual” communication channel to exchange data in RFID ecosystems of the Internet of Things (IoT). The performance of the paradigm is assessed through the evaluation of a number of important communication parameters, such as goodput and delay. The analytical study, validated through simulations, evaluates the impact that the following key parameters have on the system performance: 1) radio channel errors; 2) collisions; 3) number of involved readers; 4) memory block reading size under noisy channel conditions; and 5) heterogeneous storage capacity of available tags. This allows obtaining design directives for a well-performing implementation of the proposed communication paradigm. In particular, accounting for the negative effects of channel errors on the system goodput, in this paper, we highlight the relationship between optimal memory reading block size and channel errors to maximize the communication performance.	block size (cryptography);channel (communications);computer data storage;ecosystem;goodput;internet of things;noisy-channel coding theorem;programming paradigm;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation;software deployment	Ivan Farris;Leonardo Militano;Antonio Iera;Silverio Carlo Spinella	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2546882	radio-frequency identification;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;wireless;computer network;channel	Mobile	29.84317947016403	73.942108628187	144469

24ddefe67cdc8d798fc5253f8edfdc2da9931efe	privacy-utility tradeoffs under constrained data release mechanisms		Privacy-preserving data release mechanisms aim to simultaneously minimize information-leakage with respect to sensitive data and distortion with respect to useful data. Dependencies between sensitive and useful data results in a privacy-utility tradeoff that has strong connections to generalized rate-distortion problems. In this work, we study how the optimal privacy-utility tradeoff region is affected by constraints on the data that is directly available as input to the release mechanism. In particular, we consider the availability of only sensitive data, only useful data, and both (full data). We show that a general hierarchy holds: the tradeoff region given only the sensitive data is no larger than the region given only the useful data, which in turn is clearly no larger than the region given both sensitive and useful data. In addition, we determine conditions under which the tradeoff region given only the useful data coincides with that given full data. These are based on the common information between the sensitive and useful data. We establish these results for general families of privacy and utility measures that satisfy certain natural properties required of any reasonable measure of privacy or utility. We also uncover a new, subtler aspect of the data processing inequality for general non-symmetric privacy measures and discuss its operational relevance and implications. Finally, we derive exact closed-analyticform expressions for the privacy-utility tradeoffs for symmetrically dependent sensitive and useful data under mutual information and Hamming distortion as the respective privacy and utility measures.

69af846af14908d010745c65dd8b821da3e333ea	fundamental bound on the reliability of quantum information transmission		Information theory tells us that if the rate of sending information across a noisy channel were above the capacity of that channel, then the transmission would necessarily be unreliable. For classical information sent over classical or quantum channels, one could, under certain conditions, make a stronger statement that the reliability of the transmission shall decay exponentially to zero with the number of channel uses, and the proof of this statement typically relies on a certain fundamental bound on the reliability of the transmission. Such a statement or the bound has never been given for sending quantum information. We give this bound and then use it to give the first example where the reliability of sending quantum information at rates above the capacity decays exponentially to zero. We also show that our framework can be used for proving generalized bounds on the reliability.	arabic numeral 0;information theory;noisy-channel coding theorem;physical information;quantum channel;quantum information	Naresh Sharma;Naqueeb Ahmad Warsi	2013	Physical review letters	10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.080501	quantum operation;no-teleportation theorem;quantum information;quantum teleportation;amplitude damping channel;quantum capacity;quantum channel;classical capacity;coherent information;channel capacity;quantum algorithm;quantum mechanics;quantum error correction	Theory	34.91236323657041	65.37944935471596	144854

For a given code defined by an encoder-decoder pair (/spl alpha/, /spl beta/), its dual code is obtained by interchanging the encoder and decoder: (/spl beta/, /spl alpha/). It is shown that if a code (/spl alpha/, /spl beta/) is optimal at rate p channel uses per source sample and if it satisfies a certain uniform continuity condition, then its dual code (/spl beta/, /spl alpha/) is optimal for rate 1//spl rho/ channel uses per source sample. Further, it is demonstrated that there is a code which is optimal but its dual code is not optimal. Finally, using random coding, we show that there is an optimal code which has an optimal dual. The duality concept is also presented for the cases of (i) binary memoryless equiprobable source and binary-symmetric channel (BSC), and (ii) colored Gaussian source and additive colored Gaussian noise (ACGN) channel.	channel capacity;forward error correction	Udar Mittal;Nam C.

We present a general formula for the capacity region of the interference channel with two pairs of users. The formula shows that the capacity region is the union of a family of rectangles, where each rectangle is determined by a pair of spectral inf-mutual information rates. Although the presented formula is usually difficult to compute, it provides us useful insights into the interference channels. For example, the formula suggests us that the simplest inner bounds (obtained by treating the interference as noise) could be improved by taking into account the structure of the interference processes. This is verified numerically by computing the mutual information rates for Gaussian interference channels with embedded convolutional codes.	convolutional code;embedded system;interference (communication);mutual information;numerical analysis	Lei Lin;Xiao Ma;Xiujie Huang;Baoming Bai	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283914	convolutional code;channel code;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;zero-forcing precoding;probability;mathematics;statistics	Arch	35.931728465802166	70.79040982898537	145357

This model captures the problem of embedding covert messages in an innocuous codebook and generalizes previous models in which the innocent behavior corresponds to the absence of communication between legitimate users. We identify the exact asymptotic behavior of the number of reliable and covert bits when the rate of the innocuous codebook is close to the channel capacity of the adversary. In particular, our results characterize the dependence of the number of covert bits on the channel parameters and the characteristics of the innocent codebook.	adversary (cryptography);channel capacity;codebook;transmitter	Keerthi Suria Kumar Arumugam;Matthieu R.

We provide equivalent expressions for these bounds and derive explicit formulas for the rates where the bounds are attained. These equivalent representations can be readily computed for arbitrary source-channel pairs via Arimoto’s algorithm. When the channel’s distribution satisfies a symmetry property, the bounds admit closed-form parametric expressions. We then use our results to provide a systematic comparison between the JSCC error exponent EJ and the tandem coding error exponent ET , which applies if the source and channel are separately coded. It is shown that ET ≤ EJ ≤ 2ET . We establish conditions for which EJ > ET and for which EJ = 2ET . Numerical examples indicate that EJ is close to 2ET for many source-channel pairs. This gain translates into a power saving larger than 2 dB for a binary source transmitted over additive white Gaussian noise channels and Rayleigh fading channels with finite output quantization. Finally, we study the computation of the lossy JSCC error exponent under the Hamming distortion measure.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;channel (communications);channel capacity;computation;distortion;error exponent;forward error correction;lossy compression;numerical linear algebra;rayleigh fading;utility functions on indivisible goods;window function	Yangfan Zhong;Fady Alajaji;L.

The settings investigated in this context include the Gaussian wiretap channel, the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC), and the Gaussian BC with confidential messages (BCC). This paper shows that the specific properties of the SNR-evolution of the MMSE and conditional MMSE functions are necessary and sufficient conditions for capacity or equivocation achieving code sequences. In some cases, the complete SNR-evolution of a family of code sequences can be determined, providing significant insight into the disturbance (in terms of MMSE) such codes have on unintended receivers at other SNRs. Moreover, the effects of an additional MMSE constraint on the capacity region and on the SNR-evolution of code sequences are considered in the BC and BCC settings. Such an analysis emphasizes the tradeoff between rates and limited disturbance on unintended receivers.	additive white gaussian noise;apache axis;bricx command center;catastrophic interference;code word;codebook;concave function;confidentiality;converge;expanded memory;interference (communication);multi-user;multitier architecture;negativity (quantum mechanics);personal message;point-to-point protocol;quantum superposition;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;unified framework;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ronit Bustin;Rafael F.

To obtain a better understanding of cooperation, we consider a model in which two transmitters send rate-limited descriptions of their messages to a “cooperation facilitator”, a node that sends back rate-limited descriptions of the pair to each transmitter. This model includes the conferencing encoders model and a prior model from the current authors as special cases. We show that except for a special class of multiple access channels, the gain in sum-capacity resulting from cooperation under this model is quite large. Adding a cooperation facilitator to any such channel results in a network that does not satisfy the edge removal property. An important special case is the Gaussian multiple access channel, for which we explicitly characterize the sum-rate cooperation gain.	cooperative mimo;encoder;transmitter	Parham Noorzad;Michelle Effros;Michael Langberg	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;encoder;simulation;cost–benefit analysis;node (networking);gaussian;distributed computing;special case;transmitter;communication channel;computer science;facilitator	ML	34.07704116462604	72.51764813971464	146448

To better understand cooperation, we consider communication over a multiple access channel using a “cooperation facilitator”, a node that receives rate-limited message descriptions from the transmitters and sends rate-limited message descriptions back. This model includes the conferencing encoders model and a prior model from the current authors as special cases. We characterize a class of multiple access channels for which there is no gain in sum-capacity under current or prior cooperation models. We then show that for all other multiple access channels, the gain in sum-capacity can be far greater than the capacity of the cooperation facilitator's output links. These channels violate the edge removal property. The Gaussian multiple access channel is an important special case for which we explicitly characterize the sum-rate cooperation gain.	anil k. jain (electrical engineer, born 1946);eddy willems;encoder;transmitter	Parham Noorzad;Michelle Effros;Michael Langberg	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2015.7282412	transmitter;simulation;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;statistics	Arch	34.170177293232975	72.40444272413164	147605
fc874f818b76bb9d2b149a319622f65fa7b4b00f	bandwidth and rate allocation tradeoffs of source : channel coding, packetization and modulation in unequally protected multimedia communication systems	dissertations;academicelectrical engineering communication theory and systems discipline ucsd;laurence b milstein arslan suayb s;electrical engineering multimedia communications bandwidth and rate allocation tradeoffs of source channel coding packetization and modulation in unequally protected multimedia communication systems university of california san diego pamela c cosman	A conventional approach to the design of wireless multimedia communications is the layered approach, in which the network layers function independent of each other. This kind of layered approach is inspired partly by Shannonu0027s separation theorem in which the optimization of each block is equivalent to optimization of the overall source-channel coding operation. However, the separation theorem is valid only in a point-to-point communication scenario in the case of asymptotically long block lengths of data and assumes huge amounts of processing power and delay. Therefore, current practical communication systems strive to jointly design building blocks of a multimedia system for better performance. The focus of this dissertation is therefore to present various joint designs for different channel models and systems, although limited by physical constraints such as bandwidth, power and complexity. First, a robust coded scheme for progressive multimedia transmission is considered for an additive white Gaussian noise channel, a Rayleigh fading channel, and a frequency selective channel using in combination different unequal protection methods. We investigate the judicious use of the limited bandwidth through the combination and optimization of a progressive source coder, a rate compatible punctured convolutional code and a hierarchical modulation. Next, we investigate a novel packet formatting scheme for progressive sources using interleavers and various channel codes. The source coder is combined with a concatenated block coding mechanism to produce a robust transmission system for embedded bit streams. The objective is to create embedded codewords such that, for a particular information block, the necessary protection is obtained via multiple channel codings, contrary to the conventional methods which use a single code rate per information block. We show that near capacity performance can be achieved using the proposed scheme in conjunction with low density parity check codes in a binary symmetric channel scenario. We initially focus on coding strategies for multimedia where the channel state information is missing. A generalized Digital Fountain (DF) code is proposed to provide efficient universal forward error correction solution for lossy packet networks with increased unequal error protection and unequal recovery time properties. We propose a progressive source transmission system using this generalized code design. We apply the generalized DF code to a progressive source and show that it has better unequal protection and recovery time properties than other published results	forward error correction;modulation;network packet	Suayb S.

c0ec74b6c9de0852ed8c0ca10b2b5e5c743e84e6	low-density code-domain noma: better be regular		A closed-form analytical expression is derived for the limiting empirical squared singular value density of a spreading (signature) matrix corresponding to sparse low-density code-domain (LDCD) non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) with regular random user-resource allocation. The derivation relies on associating the spreading matrix with the adjacency matrix of a large semiregular bipartite graph. For a simple repetition-based sparse spreading scheme, the result directly follows from a rigorous analysis of spectral measures of infinite graphs. Turning to random (sparse) binary spreading, we harness the cavity method from statistical physics, and show that the limiting spectral density coincides in both cases. Next, we use this density to compute the normalized input-output mutual information of the underlying vector channel in the large-system limit. The latter may be interpreted as the achievable total throughput per dimension with optimum processing in a corresponding multiple-access channel setting or, alternatively, in a fully-symmetric broadcast channel setting with full decoding capabilities at each receiver. Surprisingly, the total throughput of regular LDCD-NOMA is found to be not only superior to that achieved with irregular user-resource allocation, but also to the total throughput of dense randomly-spread NOMA, for which optimum processing is computationally intractable. In contrast, the superior performance of regular LDCD-NOMA can be potentially achieved with a feasible message-passing algorithm. This observation may advocate employing regular, rather than irregular, LDCD-NOMA in 5G cellular physical layer design.	adjacency matrix;algorithm;biregular graph;computational complexity theory;message passing;mutual information;randomness;sparse matrix;spectral density;throughput	Ori Shental;Benjamin M.

In this problem, given a graph G = (V, E) representing clients in a broadcast network, each of which initially hold a (not necessarily disjoint) set of information packets; one wishes to design a communication scheme in which eventually all clients will hold all the packets of the network. Communication is performed in rounds, where in each round a single client broadcasts a single (possibly encoded) information packet to its neighbors in G. The objective is to design a broadcast scheme that satisfies all clients with the minimum number of broadcast rounds. The coded cooperative data exchange problem has seen significant research over the last few years; mostly when the graph G is the complete broadcast graph in which each client is adjacent to all other clients in the network, but also on general topologies, both in the fractional and integral setting. In this paper, we focus on the integral setting in general topologies G, both undirected and directed. For undirected graphs, we tie the coded cooperative data exchange problem on G to variants of the dominating set problem and in such show that solving the problem exactly or even approximately within a multiplicative factor of log |V| is intractable (i.e., NP-hard). We then turn to study efficient data exchange schemes for undirected topologies yielding a number of communication rounds comparable with our intractability result. Last, we tie the coded cooperative data exchange problem for directed topologies to the directed Steiner tree problem, yielding efficient data exchange approximation schemes. Our communication schemes do not involve encoding, and in such yield bounds on the coding advantage in the setting at hand.	approximation;coefficient;dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);np-hardness;network packet;scheme;steiner tree problem	Mira Gonen;Michael Langberg	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283990	combinatorics;atomic broadcast;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;encoding;approximation theory	Theory	31.5362956956587	71.09597293238116	148189

We model human decisions using Rieger–Wang’s prospect theory, which is an extension of traditional prospect theory to continuous decision spaces. Having found a closed-form expression for the receiver’s best response strategy under any general setting, we consider two settings: Gaussian SIT games and exponential SIT games. While the Gaussian SIT games result in strategies that are independent of subjective biases of both the transmitter and the receiver, we show that the equilibrium strategies in exponential SIT games depend on the subjective biases of both the transmitter and the receiver. Numerical results are presented to illustrate results in both Gaussian and exponential settings.

06c60eb1455c142e4213b7f6fd41498d451d1556	degrees of freedom of cache-aided wireless interference networks		We study the role of caches in wireless interference networks. We focus on content caching and delivery across a Gaussian interference network, where both transmitters and receivers are equipped with caches. We provide a constant-factor approximation of the system’s degrees of freedom (DoF), for arbitrary number of transmitters, number of receivers, content library size, receiver cache size, and transmitter cache size (as long as the transmitters combined can store the entire content library among them). We demonstrate approximate optimality with respect to information-theoretic bounds that do not impose any restrictions on the caching and delivery strategies. Our characterization reveals three key insights. First, the approximate DoF is achieved using a strategy that separates the physical and network layers. This separation architecture is thus approximately optimal. Second, we show that increasing transmitter cache memory beyond what is needed to exactly store the entire library between all transmitters does not provide more than a constant-factor benefit to the DoF. A consequence is that transmit zero-forcing is not needed for approximate optimality. Third, we derive an interesting tradeoff between the receiver memory and the number of transmitters needed for approximately maximal performance. In particular, if each receiver can store a constant fraction of the content library, then only a constant number of transmitters are needed. Our solution to the caching problem requires formulating and solving a new communication problem, the symmetric multiple multicast X-channel, for which we provide an exact DoF characterization.	approximation algorithm;cpu cache;cache (computing);information theory;interference (communication);maximal set;multicast;transmitter;zero-forcing precoding	Jad Hachem;Urs Niesen;Suhas N.

The key component of this theory is the substitution of the decoder in Shannonu0027s classical communication model with a universal Turing machine. Using this model, the mathematical framework for examining the efficiency of coding schemes is the algorithmic or Kolmogorov (1965) complexity. CDT extends this framework to include distortion by defining the complexity distortion function. We show that despite their different natures, CDT and rate distortion theory (RDT) predict asymptotically the same results, under stationary and ergodic assumptions. This closes the circle of representation models, from probabilistic models of information proposed by Shannon in information and rate distortion theories, to deterministic algorithmic models, proposed by Kolmogorov in Kolmogorov complexity theory and its extension to lossy source coding, CDT.	distortion;ergodicity;lossy compression;rate–distortion theory;stationary process	Daby M.

We discuss the guarantees for ℓ1-min decoding of quantized network coded messages, based on Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of the resulting measurement matrix. This is done by deriving the relation between tail probability of ℓ2-norms and satisfaction of RIP. The obtained relation is then used to compare our designed measurement matrix, with i.i.d.

Finally, we present our numerical evaluations, which shows that the proposed design of network coding coefficients results in a measurement matrix with an RIP behavior, similar to that of i.i.d.

The effect of self-interference on the stability region has also been investigated. In particular, the stability region is characterized under two types of decoding schemes: (a) both the receivers perform treating interference as noise and (b) receiver with full-duplex capability performs successive decoding and other receiver treats interference as noise. As a by product of the analysis, the stability region of the BC with secrecy constraint where the receivers do not have FD capability can be obtained as a special case of the results derived in this paper. It is found that if the self-interference cancelation at the full-duplex receiver is not efficient, then the gain obtained in secure throughput due to transmission of the jamming signal by the FD receiver can diminish. In particular, it is found that the stability region with secrecy constraint is sensitive to the coefficient of self-interference cancelation under certain cases.	coefficient;duplex (telecommunications);emoticon;interference (communication);radio jamming;throughput	Parthajit Mohapatra;Nikolaos Pappas;Jemin Lee;Tony Q.

Motivated by sensor network applications, i t i assumed that the relays and the destinations all have access to side information correlated with the unde rlying source signal. Joint source-channel cooperative transmission is studied in which the relays hel p the transmission of the source signal to the destinations by using both their overheard signals, as in th e classical channel cooperation scenario, as well as the available correlated side information. Decodeand forward (DF) based cooperative transmission is considered in a network of multiple relay terminals a nd two different achievability schemes are proposed: i) a regular encoding and sliding-window decodin g scheme without explicit source binning at the encoder, and ii) a semi-regular encoding and backward de coding scheme with binning based on the side information statistics. It is shown that both of these s chemes lead to the same source-channel code rate, which is shown to be the source-channel capacity in the case of i) a physically degraded relay network in which the side information signals are also degra ded in the same order as the channel; and ii) a relay-broadcast network in which all the terminals wan t to reconstruct the source reliably, while at most one of them can act as a relay.

In particular, Arıkan’s polarization technique applied individually to each user will polarize any m-user binary input MAC into a finite collection of extremal MACs. The extremal MACs have a number of desirable properties: (i) the ‘uniform sum rate’ of the original channel is not lost, (ii) the extremal MACs have rate regions that are not only polymatroids but matroids and thus (iii) their uniform sum rate can be reached by each user transmitting either uncoded or fixed bits; in this sense they are easy to communicate over. Provided that the convergence to the extremal MACs is fast enough, the preceding leads to a low complexity communication scheme that is capable of achieving the uniform sum rate of an arbitrary binary input MAC. We show that this is indeed the case for arbitrary values of m.	matroid;polar code (coding theory);polarization (waves);transmitter	Emmanuel Abbe;Emre Telatar	2009	CoRR		combinatorics;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Crypto	35.80254098712524	68.58235762648987	151827

We have integrated SD with QTC to benefit from the inherent near optimum performance of turbo codes. We have further incorporated the quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol within the proposed QTC-SD system for the sake of ensuring absolute security. Explicitly, the QSDC protocol exploits dummy entangled pairs for detecting the presence of eavesdropper. Hence, the proposed scheme ensures absolute security, detects the presence of an eavesdropper and considers practical issues when error is induced in a quantum depolarizing channel. Furthermore, we have experimentally determined the noise threshold levels for the proposed QTC-SD system to detect the presence of an eavesdropper.

The rate region depicts the sum primary rate versus the secondary rate and is establi shed assuming that the secondary link performs rate-splitting. The achievable rate region is the union of two types of achievabl e rate regions. The first type is a rate region established assu ming that the secondary receiver cannot decode any primary signa l, whereas the second is established assuming that the seconda ry receiver can decode the signal of one primary receiver. The achievable rate region is determined first assuming discret memoryless channel (DMC) then the results are applied to a Gaussian channel. In the Gaussian channel, the performance of rate-splitting is characterized for the two types of rate regions. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition to determine which primary signal that the secondary receiver can decode without degrading the range of primary achievable sum ratesis provided. When this condition is satisfied by a certain primary user, the secondary receiver can decode its signal and achie ve larger rates without reducing the primary achievable sum rates from the case in which it does not decode any primary signal. I t is also shown that, the probability of having at least one pri mary user satisfying this condition grows with the primary signal to noise ratio.	access network;additive white gaussian noise;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	John Tadrous;Mohammed Nafie	2011	CoRR		cognitive radio;index term;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;satisfiability	Mobile	36.08565375919675	71.53102858036341	152514

Specifically, we introduce one-step Quantized Network Coding (QNC), which is a hybrid combination of network coding and packet forwarding for transmission. Motivated by the work on Bayesian compressed sensing, we derive theoretical guarantees on robust recovery in a one-step QNC scenario. Our mathematical derivations for Gaussian messages express the opportunity of distributed compression by using one-step QNC, as a simplified version of QNC scenario. Our simulation results show an improvement in terms of quality-delay performance over routing based packet forwarding.	compressed sensing;embedded system;linear network coding;network packet;routing;simulation;sparse;sparse matrix	Mahdy Nabaee;Fabrice Labeau	2012	CoRR		simulation;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Networks	31.623567927163275	73.08736918297298	152605

The sensors observe random samples in parallel and communicate with a fusion center, who makes the global decision based on the sensor inputs. On the one hand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely transmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio test (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected sample size as error rates tend to zero. On the other hand, for systems with limited power and bandwidth resources, decentralized solutions that only send a summary of local samples (we particularly focus on a one-bit communication protocol) to the fusion center is of great importance. To this end, we first consider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized statistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a uniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its suboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of the quantized statistics under both the hypotheses. We then propose a decentralized GSPRT based on level-triggered sampling. That is, each sensor runs its own GSPRT repeatedly and reports its local decision to the fusion center asynchronously. We show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal as the local thresholds and global thresholds grow large at different rates. Finally, two particular models and their associated applications are studied to compare the centralized and decentralized approaches. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed level-triggered sampling based decentralized scheme aligns closely with the centralized scheme with substantially lower communication overhead, and significantly outperforms the uniform sampling and quantization-based decentralized scheme.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;centralized computing;communications protocol;interrupt;kullback–leibler divergence;numerical method;overhead (computing);pseudo-random number sampling;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing);sensor	Shang Li;Xiaoou Li;Xiaodong Wang;Jingchen Liu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2693156	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;probability of error;control theory;mathematics;sensor fusion;software testing;statistics	Vision	28.860772793013304	71.95304423565071	152626

For signals that have inherent sparse structures, compressive sensing (CS) is applied to facilitate efficient sparse signal transmissions over lossy communication links without data compression or error protection. The natural packet loss in the lossy link is modeled as a random sampling process of the transmitted data, and the original signal will be reconstructed from the lossy transmission results using the CS-based reconstruction method at the receiving end. The impacts of packet lengths on transmission efficiency under different channel conditions have been discussed, and interleaving is incorporated to mitigate the impact of burst data loss. Extensive simulations and experiments have been conducted and compared to the traditional automatic repeat request (ARQ) interpolation technique, and very favorable results have been observed in terms of both accuracy of the reconstructed signals and the transmission energy consumption. Furthermore, the packet length effect provides useful insights for using compressed sensing for efficient sparse signal transmission via lossy links.	access control;algorithm;automatic repeat request;channel capacity;compressed sensing;data compression;download;experiment;forward error correction;hearing loss, high-frequency;interpolation imputation technique;iterative reconstruction;lossy compression;network packet;petrosal sinus sampling;routing;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;sparse matrix;transitional region;transmitter device component;disease transmission	Liantao Wu;Kai Yu;Dongyu Cao;Yu Hen Hu;Zhi Wang	2015		10.3390/s150819880	data compression;computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;compressed sensing;statistics	Mobile	25.46644899196623	66.92985020189867	152793

In this work we consider the topological interference management problem within the context of a two cell two user interference broadcast channel (IBC) with alternating connectivity. Topological information, even though minimal, allows the transmitters to track the changing network structure and then exploit the varying connectivity states to obtain a degrees of freedom (DoF) gain. Thus, the main result of this work is the derivation of a novel outer bound on the DoF achievable by the two cell two user IBC in an alternating connectivity scenario. Additionally, we propose a scheme based on joint coding across states that achieves this outer bound for the case where all alternating connectivity states are equiprobable.	channel state information;information-based complexity;interference (communication);telecommunications network;transmitter	Paula Aquilina;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178530	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;interference;co-channel interference;multiplexing;encoding;computer network	Mobile	34.422582466163135	72.30044674255434	152837

An ideal solution is a rateless wireless system, in which the sender encodes data without any explicit estimation or adaptation, implicitly adapting to the level of noise or interference. In this paper, we present a novel rateless code, the spinal code, which uses a hash function over the message bits to produce pseudo-random bits that in turn can be mapped directly to a dense constellation for transmission. Results from theoretical analysis and simulations show that spinal codes essentially achieve Shannon capacity, and out-perform best-known fixed rate block codes.	channel capacity;code;hash function;interference (communication);pseudorandomness;shannon capacity of a graph;simulation;throughput	Jonathan Perry;Hari Balakrishnan;Devavrat Shah	2011		10.1145/2070562.2070568	block code;online codes;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer network	Networks	38.992755467075064	65.9108407475056	154066

Although Arikan's bounds are asymptotically tight, the improvement of the bounds in this paper is significant in the non-asymptotic regime.

Classes of memoryless sources defined by an envelope condition on the marginal distribution provide benchmarks for coding techniques originating from the theory of universal coding over finite alphabets. We prove general upper bounds on minimax regret and lower bounds on minimax redundancy for such source classes. The general upper bounds emphasize the role of the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) codes with respect to minimax regret in the infinite alphabet context. Lower bounds are derived by tailoring sharp bounds on the redundancy of Krichevsky-Trofimov coders for sources over finite alphabets. Up to logarithmic (resp., constant) factors the bounds are matching for source classes defined by algebraically declining (resp., exponentially vanishing) envelopes. Effective and (almost) adaptive coding techniques are described for the collection of source classes defined by algebraically vanishing envelopes. Those results extend our knowledge concerning universal coding to contexts where the key tools from parametric inference are known to fail.	adaptive coding;data compression;lossless compression;marginal model;matching (graph theory);minimax;regret (decision theory);universal code (data compression)	Stéphane Boucheron;Aurélien Garivier;Elisabeth Gassiat	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.2008150	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;variable-length code;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Theory	36.96310135796261	62.72418330967914	155186

Focusing on the slow-fading scenario (one block delay), the worst-case expected-rate loss is precisely characterized for the point-to-point fading channel and is characterized to within one bit for the fading-paper channel.	best, worst and average case;coherence (physics);ergodicity;fibre channel point-to-point	Jae Won Yoo;Tie Liu;Shlomo Shamai	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283839	fading distribution;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;fading	Embedded	36.6016558727135	72.43711914707282	156249

A closed form expression is derived for the quantized channel cutoff rate and for the optimum orthogonal quantization similar to the one that has been derived for binary signaling. While orthogonal quantization is natural for commmlcation systems in which the transmltted signals are themselves orthogo~ it can also be profitably applied to other signals, e.g., a simplex set in a lower dimensional space. Though orthogonal quantization is inferior to optimal quantization, it is essentfally simpler and does not incur great loss in performance. A numerical example illustrates the relative merits of optimal and orthogonal quantization for the simplex set in the plane.	numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing)	Nachum Shacham;Israel Bar-David	1978	IEEE Trans.

c573a8a07f91076920a17fcabd32af1db80810b0	novel outer bounds for combination networks with end-user-caches		This paper studies the tradeoff between the memory size M and the download time / rate R∗ for networks where a server with N files is connected to H relays (without caches), which in turns are connected to K users equipped with caches of size M files. When each user is connected to a different subset of r relays, i.e., K = (Hr), the system is referred to as a combination network with end-user-caches. In this work, outer bounds are derived for the practically motivated case of uncoded cache contents, that is, bits of the various files are directly copied in the user caches without any coding. In this case, once the cache contents and the user demands are known, the problem reduces to a general index coding problem. This paper shows that relying on a well known “acyclic index coding outer bound” results in bounds that are not tight for combination networks with enduser-caches (as opposed to the case without relays) and provides two novel ways to derive the tightest known outer bounds to date. As a result of independent interest, an inequality that generalizes the well-known sub-modularity of entropy is derived.	directed acyclic graph;download;huffman coding;index (publishing);relay;server (computing);social inequality;whole earth 'lectronic link	Kai Wan;Mingyue Ji;Pablo Piantanida;Daniela Tuninetti	2017	2017 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2017.8277986	theoretical computer science;inequality;end user;cache;m-files;distributed computing;computer science;download	Theory	32.6023930270923	70.61425513202859	156647
31d1817464a34eba5fbfb9c34b0510ceebfd27b1	a non-probabilistic model of relativised predictability in physics	unpredictability;randomness;complementarity;technical report;prediction	Unpredictability is an important concept throughout physics and plays a central role in quantum information theory. Despite this, little effort has been devoted to studying generalised notions or models of (un)predictability in physics. In this paper, we continue the programme of developing a general, non-probabilistic model of (un)predictability in physics. We present a more refined model that is capable of studying different degrees of “relativised” unpredictability. This model is based on the ability of an agent, acting via uniform, effective means, to predict correctly and reproducibly the outcome of an experiment using finite information extracted from the environment. We use this model to study the degree of unpredictability certified by different quantum phenomena further, showing that quantum complementarity guarantees a form of relativised unpredictability that is weaker than that guaranteed by Kochen–Specker-type value indefiniteness. We exemplify further the difference between certification by complementarity and value indefiniteness by showing that, unlike value indefiniteness, complementarity is compatible with the production of computable sequences of bits.	complementarity (physics);complementarity theory;computable function;cryptography;exemplification;hilbert space;information theory;kochen–specker theorem;mathematical model;observable;quantum computing;quantum information;quantum mechanics;randomness;statistical model	Alastair A.

A zero-mean unit-ariance first-order Markov sequence is chosen as the input to thc system, and the leak parameter of the ADPCM accumulator is made equal to the intersample correlation of the input sequence. Using this fundamental structure, a method is presented for computing the exact joint probability distribution function of quantization error and step-size in ADPCM. From the joint distribution, marginal quantization error, and step-size distributions are obtained for Gauss-Markov, exponential-Markov, and uniform-Markov input signals. Empirical distributions obtained from simulations agree very well with their theoretical counterparts.	adaptive differential pulse-code modulation;quantization (signal processing)	Lawrence H.

Although the DQLC is well performing, it leaves a certain gap to the performance upper bound (or distortion lower bound) based on arbitrary code length. The purpose of this paper is to determine if the generalization of the DQLC to arbitrary code length, named Vector Quantization Linear Coder (VQLC), can close the gap to the bound when the code length is large. Our results show that the VQLC mapping has the potential to reach the upper bound for any number of Gaussian sources at high SNR when the sources are uncorrelated. We also approximately determine the VQLC performance as a function of code length for the special case of two sources.	arbitrary code execution;channel capacity;distortion;forward error correction;signal-to-noise ratio;vector quantization	Pål Anders Floor;Anna N.

22526b8e45e8a71d2c42dc81ede521f5d3b006d8	sphere packing and zero-rate bounds to the reliability of classical-quantum channels		In this paper, the sphere packing bound of Fano, Shannon, Gal-lager and Berlekamp and the zero-rate bound of Berlekamp are extended to general classical-quantum channels. The upper bound for the reliability function obtained from the sphere packing coincides at high rates, for the case of pure state channels, with a lower bound derived by Burnashev and Holevo [21]. Thus, for pure state channels, the reliability function at high rates is now exactly determined. For the general case, the obtained upper bound expression at high rates was conjectured to represent also a lower bound to the reliability function, but a complete proof has not been obtained yet. Finally, the obtained zero-rate upper bound to the reliability function of a general classical-quantum channel with no zero-error capacity coincides with a lower bound obtained by Holevo, thus determining the exact expression.	alexander horned sphere;quantum channel;quantum state;set packing;shannon (unit)	Marco Dalai	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;chapman–robbins bound;calculus;mathematics	Theory	35.75233383339276	63.589208122839764	157314

However, these codes are classically implemented [1] over finite fields whose size depends on some global network parameters (size of the network, the number of sinks) that may be unknown prior to code design. Also, the entire network code may have to be redesigned when a new node joins. In this work, we present the first universal and robust distributed linear network coding schemes. Our schemes are universal since they are independent of all network parameters. They are robust since in case nodes join or leave, the remaining nodes do not need to change their coding operations and the receivers can still decode. They are distributed since nodes need only have topological information about the part of the network upstream of them, which can be naturally streamed as part of the communication protocol. We present both probabilistic and deterministic schemes that are all asymptotically rate-optimal in the coding block-length, and have guarantees of correctness. Our probabilistic designs are computationally efficient, with order-optimal complexity. Our deterministic designs guarantee zero error decoding, albeit via codes with high computational complexity in general. Our coding schemes are based on network codes over “scalable fields”. Instead of choosing coding coefficients from one field at every node as in [1], each node uses linear coding operations over an “effective field-size” which depends on the node's distance from the source node. The analysis of our schemes requires technical tools that may be of independent interest. In particular, we generalize the Schwartz-Zippel lemma [2] by proving a nonuniform version, wherein variables are chosen from sets of possibly different sizes. We also provide a novel robust distributed algorithm to assign unique IDs to network nodes.	algorithmic efficiency;coefficient;communications protocol;computational complexity theory;correctness (computer science);distributed algorithm;global network;linear algebra;linear code;linear network coding;scalability;schwartz–zippel lemma;streaming media	Tracey Ho;Sidharth Jaggi;Svitlana Vyetrenko;Lingxiao Xia	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935297	communications protocol;distributed algorithm;discrete mathematics;linear network coding;information theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;probability;linear code;mathematics;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;computational model;finite field;statistics	Theory	31.552273261878334	71.02729850996884	157634

It suffices that the noisy observation Z be the sum of a function of the side information Y and independent Gaussian noise, while the source data X must be the sum of a function of Y, a linear function of Z, and a random variable N such that the conditional expectation of N given Y and Z is zero, almost surely. Furthermore, the side information Y may be arbitrarily distributed in any alphabet, discrete or continuous. Under these general conditions, we prove that no rate loss is incurred due to the unavailability of the side information at the encoder. In the noiseless Wyner-Ziv case, i.e., when the source data is directly observed, the assumptions are still less restrictive than those recently established in the literature. We confirm, theoretically and experimentally, the consistency of this analysis with some of the main results on high-rate Wyner-Ziv quantization of noisy sources.	approximation;distortion;encoder;experiment;gaussian blur;linear function;linear separability;marginal model;quantization (signal processing);rate–distortion theory;source data;unavailability;utility functions on indivisible goods;vector quantization;winzip	David Rebollo-Monedero;Bernd Girod	2005	Data Compression Conference	10.1109/DCC.2005.6	random variable;image analysis;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	ML	36.302298990920505	64.77217778281182	157653

In particular, we derive its optimal second-order coding rate region, its error exponent (reliability function), and its moderate deviations constant under mild conditions on the source. To obtain the second-order asymptotics, we extend some ideas from Watanabe’s work. In particular, we leverage the properties of an appropriate generalization of the conditional distortion-tilted information density, which was first introduced by Kostina and Verdú. The converse part uses a perturbation argument by Gu and Effros in their strong converse proof of the discrete Gray–Wyner problem. The achievability part uses two novel elements: 1) a generalization of various type covering lemmas and 2) the uniform continuity of the conditional rate-distortion function in both the source (joint) distribution and the distortion level. To obtain the error exponent, for the achievability part, we use the same generalized type covering lemma, and for the converse, we use the strong converse together with a change-of-measure technique. Finally, to obtain the moderate deviations constant, we apply the moderate deviations theorem to probabilities defined in terms of information spectrum quantities.	distortion;error exponent;information design;lossy compression;rate–distortion theory;scott continuity	Lin Zhou;Vincent Y.

This is not a realistic assumption because of feedback delay. A novel approach by Lee and Heath, space-time interference alignment (STIA), proves that in the underdetermined (overloaded) multi-input single-output (MISO) BC with Nt transmit antennas and K = Nt + 1 users Nt (sum) Degrees of Freedom (DoF) are achievable if the feedback delay is not too big, thus disproving the conjecture that any delay in the feedback necessarily causes a DoF loss. However the feedback delay needs to remain less or equal to Tc over Nt+1, where Tc is the coherence time. We consider the MIMO BC and show that the use of multi-antenna receivers allows to achieve full (sum) DoF with bigger feedback delay, up to equation. We also extend this result to the MIMO IC.	channel state information;interference (communication);mimo;system analysis;transmitter	Yohan Lejosne;Dirk T. M.

Transmitter aims to convey a common message to both receiver 1 and 2, and a confidential message only to receiver 1. It can take actions to affect the generation of channel states which are causally known to the encoder. The inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region of such a channel are characterized. The corresponding bounds on the secrecy capacity are also obtained. To achieve the rate-equivocation triples, we construct coding schemes using superposition coding and Wyner's random binning. For the special case where no common message is sent, the inner and outer bounds coincide with each other. A binary example is given to illustrate the results.	causality;coding theory;confidentiality;encoder;product binning;secure communication;transmitter	Xinxing Yin;Yan Zhu;Xiao Chen;Liang Pang;Zhi Xue	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2014.25	telecommunications;computer science;broadcast control channel;computer security	Vision	34.415134561632215	68.59251650485716	159273

Recently, it has been shown [1] that TDMA is no longer optimal in cases of unequal CSIR, e.g., when one receiver has CSIR and another does not. This paper proposes a multiplicative superposition that attains degrees of freedom uniformly higher than [1] and TDMA. The proposed scheme uses coherent signaling for the receiver with CSIR, and Grassmannian signaling for the receiver without CSIR. This signaling structure is shown to attain the optimal degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna configurations.	cell signaling;channel state information;coherence (physics);mimo;maximal set;transmitter	Yang Li;Aria Nosratinia	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283964	telecommunications;mathematics;computer network	Mobile	35.87534642801147	73.80102542895968	159381

The modes (transmit or receive) of the half-duplex nodes together specify the state of the network. A relaying protocol uses a specific sequence of states and a coding scheme for each state. In this paper, we first obtain an outer bound for the rate region of all achievable (Ra, Rb) based on the half-duplex cut-set bound. This outer bound can be numerically computed by solving a linear program. It is proved that at any point on the boundary of the outer bound only four of the six states of the network are used. We then compare it with achievable rate regions of various known protocols. We consider two kinds of protocols: (1) protocols in which all messages transmitted in a state are decoded with the received signal in the same state, and (2) protocols where information received in one state can also be stored and used as side information to decode messages in future states. Various conclusions are drawn on the importance of using all states, use of side information, and the choice of processing at the relay. Then, two analytical outer bounds (as opposed to an optimization problem formulation) are derived. Using an analytical outer bound, we obtain the symmetric capacity within 0.5 bits for some channel conditions where the direct link between nodes a and b is weak.	direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);emoticon;human-based computation;inline linking;linear programming;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relay channel;state (computer science);xojo	K.

For this reason, the sensed PSDs by the distributed sensors in the area are collected and fused by a fusion center (FC). But, for a given zone, the sensed PSD by neighbor CR sensors may contain a shared common component for a while, and this component can be exploited in the theory of the distributed source coding to compress as much as possible. For this reason, distributed compressive sensing (DCS) methods are used here to exploit the correlation between PSDs and compress them more and reduce this type of overhead traffic. The proposed method can be used to develop a framework when the holding time of the users is large in comparison with the rate of the spectrum sensing.	centralized computing;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;data compression;distributed source coding;overhead (computing);sensor;spectral density;while	Mohammad Eslami;Farah Torkamani-Azar;Esfandiar Mehrshahi	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2391265	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;mathematical model;mathematics;compressed sensing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	28.666030398397144	71.24180942786666	159832
586f52aa4cdcad172c9d852183541848e1ac081b	strong secrecy in pairwise key agreement over a generalized multiple access channel		This paper considers the problem of pairwise key agreement without public communication between three users connected through a generalized multiple access channel (MAC). While two users control the channel inputs, all three users observe noisy outputs from the channel and each pair of users wishes to agree on a secret key hidden from the remaining user. We first develop a “pre-generated” key-agreement scheme based on secrecy codes for the generalized MAC, in which the channel is only used to distribute pre-generated secret keys. We then extend this scheme to include an additional layer of rate-limited secret-key generation by treating the observed channel outputs as induced sources. We characterize inner and outer bounds on the strong secret-key capacity region for both schemes. For a special case of the “pre-generated” scheme, we obtain an exact characterization. We also illustrate with some binary examples that exploiting the generalized nature of the generalized MAC may lead to significantly larger key-agreement rates.	code;key (cryptography);key generation;key-agreement protocol;public-key cryptography;strong secrecy	Somayeh Salimi;Matthieu R.

The system studied communicates i.i.d. Gaussian sources on a point-to-point Gaussian memoryless channel with limited feedback (supporting channel state information at most). The mappings, named Shannon-Kotel’nikov (SK) mappings, are memoryless mappings between the source space of dimension M and the channel space of dimension N. Such mappings can be used for error control when M < N, called dimension expansion, and for lossy compression when M > N, called dimension reduction. The SK-mappings operate on amplitude continuous and time discrete signals (meaning that there is no bits involved) through (piecewise) continuous curves or hyper surfaces in general. The reason for studying SK-mappings is that they are delay free, robust against varying channel conditions, and have quite good performance at low complexity. First a theory for determining and categorizing the distortion using SKmappings for communication is introduced and developed. This theory is further used to show that SK-mappings can reach the information theoretical bound optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) when their dimension approach infinity. One problem is to determine the overall optimal geometry of the SKmappings. Indications on the overall geometry can be found by studying the codebooks and channel constellations of power constrained channel optimized vector quantizers (PCCOVQ). The PCCOVQ algorithm will find the optimal placing of quantizer representation vectors in the source space and channel symbols in the channel space. A PCCOVQ algorithm giving well performing mappings for the dimension reduction case has been found in the past. In this thesis the PCCOVQ algorithm is modified to give well performing dimension expanding mappings for scalar sources, and 1:2 and 1:3 PCCOVQ examples are given. Some example SK-mappings are proposed and analyzed. 2:1 and 1:2 PCCOVQ mappings are used as inspiration for making 2:1 and 1:2 SK-	algorithm;british undergraduate degree classification;categorization;channel capacity;channel state information;codebook;dimensionality reduction;distortion;error detection and correction;fibre channel point-to-point;forward error correction;lossy compression;minimal mappings;quantization (signal processing);ski combinator calculus;shannon (unit)	Pål Anders Floor	2008			binary erasure channel;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;channel capacity	ML	37.89291897013246	66.28822938887731	160052

Due to its fundamental and practical importance, there has been an increasing interest in this channel. However, surprisingly, there has been little work that characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and transmission rate across all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ratios. In this paper, we consider amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying due to its simplicity. We first derive the random coding error exponent for the link in each direction. From the exponent expression, the capacity and cutoff rate for each link are also deduced. We then put forth the notion of the bottleneck error exponent, which is the worst exponent decay between the two links, to give us insight into the fundamental tradeoff between the rate pair and information-exchange reliability of the two terminals.	anisotropic filtering;duplex (telecommunications);error exponent;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Tony Q.

For fast-varying fading channels the training length and training interval can be optimized jointly to maximize the throughput. The optimal balance of training and payload depends on the combination of Doppler frequency and frame length. Here we show that, depending on the degree of mobility for large enough signal to noise ratio, there is a definite advantage in fragmenting the frame with dispersed segments of training symbols of smaller length rather than having a highly reliable channel estimate by concentrating all the training symbols at the beginning of the frame.	channel state information;ip fragmentation;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Stefano Savazzi;Umberto Spagnolini	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.186	minimum mean square error;speech recognition;bit error rate;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;markov model;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;communications system;wireless;statistics	Vision	37.86335726213645	71.92618460016021	160650

4a9a033f7f871f48b4a16ed80823a44adf1f49f0	equal-image-size source partitioning: creating strong fano's inequalities for multi-terminal discrete memoryless channels		This paper introduces equal-image-size source partitioni ng, a new tool for analyzing channel and joint source-channe l coding in a multi-terminal discrete memoryless channel environment . Equal-image-size source partitioning divides the source (combination of messages and codewords) into a sub-exponential number of subsets. Over each of these subsets, the exponential orders of the minimum image sizes of most messages are roughly equal to the same entropy term. This property gives us the strength of minimum image sizes and the flexibility of entropy terms. Usi ng the method of equal-image-size source partitioning, we p rove separate necessary conditions for the existence of average ror and maximum-error codes. These necessary condition s are much stronger than the standard Fano’s inequality, and can be wea ken d to render versions of Fano’s inequality that apply to c odes with non-vanishing error probabilities. To demonstrate th power of this new tool, we employ the stronger average-erro r version of Fano’s inequality to prove the strong converse for the dis crete memoryless wiretap channel with decaying leakage, wh ich heretofore has been an open problem.	channel (communications);code word;fano's inequality;i/o controller hub;limbo;social inequality;spectral leakage;time complexity	Eric Graves;Tan F.

Our key observation is that, in a broadcast environment, this problem resolves into estimating the maximum number of packets dropped among many receivers rather than for each individual receiver. With rateless codes, this estimation relates to the number of redundant transmissions needed at the source in order for all receivers to correctly decode a message with high probability. We develop and analyze two new data dissemination protocols, called Random Sampling (RS) and Full Sampling with Limited Feedback (FSLF), based on the moment and maximum likelihood estimators in extreme value theory. Both protocols rely on a single-round learning phase, requiring the transmission of a few feedback packets from a small subset of receivers. With fixed overhead, we show that FSLF has the desirable property of becoming more accurate as the receivers's population gets larger. Our protocols are channel agnostic, in that they do not require a-priori knowledge of (i.i.d.) packet loss probabilities, which may vary among receivers. We provide simulations and an improved full-scale implementation of the Rateless Deluge over-the-air programming protocol on sensor motes as a demonstration of the practical benefits of our protocols, which translate into about 30% latency and energy consumption savings.	code;extreme value theory;feedback;full scale;maxima and minima;network packet;overhead (computing);simulation;with high probability	Weiyao Xiao;Sachin Agarwal;David Starobinski;Ari Trachtenberg	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462083	real-time computing;online codes;telecommunications;computer science;maximum likelihood;statistics;computer network	Metrics	31.014400468368223	73.87964649083696	161196

Transmitter 1 (primary user) interferes with receiver 2 while transmitter 2 (secondary user) does not interfere with receiver 1. In addition, receiver 2 suffers from a random state sequence which is non-causally known only at transmitter 1. For this setup, which is also investigated by Duan et al. in [1], first we characterize the capacity region for the deterministic case and then by the obtained insight from analyzing the deterministic case, we establish sufficient conditions under which lattice-based transmission schemes meet the capacity region outer bound. In general, we show that lattice codes can achieve the capacity region to within 1over2 log (3) ≈ 0.79 bit of the outer bound for all values of channel parameters.	code;interference (communication);lattice model (finance);transmitter	Shahab Ghasemi-Goojani;Hamid Behroozi	2014	2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications		electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics	Theory	35.05928351049351	70.67578003946963	161668

Shannon theoretic arguments are invoked to gain insight into the implications on performance of the main system parameters and multiple-access techniques. In Part I, we specialize to the linear model and address the case of practical importance where the cell-site receiver processes only the signals received at this cell site, and where the actively interfering users assigned to other cells (but not those within the cell) are interpreted as Gaussian noise (worst case assumption). We assume that the cell-site receiver is aware of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios for all users assigned to that cell while the users’ transmitters do not have access to this side information. We first investigate several different scenarios and focus on the effect of fading and intercell interference and then provide a general formulation for an achievable rate region (inner-bound) of which all the different scenarios are special cases. The features of TDMA and wideband (WB) intracell multiple-access techniques are examined as well as the role of (optimized) fractional intercell time-sharing (ICTS) protocol. With no fading, orthogonality within the cell is optimal (not unique, however) with or without intercell interference. When fading is present and intercell interference is not dominant, WB intracell access is found advantageous due to an inherent fading averaging effect. This conclusion may reverse when intercell interference takes place and exceeds a given threshold; and then intracell orthogonal signaling (TDMA) is preferable. With intercell interference present, it is demonstrated that fractional ICTS may prove beneficial as compared to full exploitation of time (no sharing) at each cell, where the latter is known to be optimal under no fading conditions and an ultimate receiver which optimally processes all the information received at all cell sites. In Part II, the model is extended to account for cell-site receivers that may process also the received signal at an adjacent cell site, compromising thus between the advantage of incorporating additional information from other cell sites on one hand and the associated excess processing complexity on the other. Various settings which include fading, TDMA, WB, and (optimized) fractional ICTS protocols are investigated and compared. In this case and for the WB approach and large number of users per cell it is found, surprisingly, that fading may enhance performance in terms of Shannon theoretic achievable rates.

Based on this condition, we shall develop a general protocol of designing optimal QCMs for qubit system. With a series of examples, where the known optimal fidelities introduced in previous works are recovered with present scheme, we show that our protocol represents a general solution for the problem of cloning in qubit case. The unitary transformations for realizing the various kinds of optimal QCMS, are also given in a systematic way.	quantum cloning;qubit	Fei Wu;Xiaohua Wu	2012	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-011-0226-1	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	34.877915742298434	64.22029895553177	161897

The goal of the agents is to describe the source to a central unit, which wants to reconstruct the source within a given distortion. The rate-distortion region of the vector Gaussian CEO problem is unknown in general. Here, we provide an outer bound for the rate-distortion region of the vector Gaussian CEO problem. We obtain our outer bound by evaluating an outer bound for the multiterminal source coding problem by means of a technique relying on the de Bruijn identity and properties of the Fisher information. Next, we investigate the tightness of our outer bound. Although our outer bound is tight for certain cases, we show that our outer bound does not provide the exact rate-distortion region in general. To this end, we provide an example and show that the rate-distortion region is strictly contained in our outer bound for this example.		Ersen Ekrem;Sennur Ulukus	2014	IEEE Trans.

The active stations communicate via a multiple-access channel. If a subset $Q$ of active stations transmits in the same round, all active stations can recognize from the signal strength how many stations have transmitted (i.e., they learn the size of set $Q$), even though they may not be able to decode the contents of transmitted messages. The goal is to let each active station to learn about the set of all active stations. It is well known that $\Theta(k\log_{k+1} n)$ rounds are enough, even for non-adaptive deterministic algorithms. A natural interesting generalization arises when we are required to identify a subset of $m\leq k$ active stations. We show that while for randomized or for adaptive deterministic algorithms $O(m \log_{m+1} n)$ rounds are sufficient, the non-adaptive deterministic counterpart still requires $\Theta(k\log_{k+1} n)$ rounds, therefore, finding any subset of active stations is not easier than finding all of them by a non-adaptive deterministic algorithm. We prove our results in the more general framework of combinatorial search theory, where the problem of identifying active stations on a multiple-access channel can be viewed as a variant of the well-known counterfeit coin problem.	combinatorial search;constructible function;deterministic algorithm;polynomial;randomized algorithm;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link;with high probability	Gianluca De Marco;Dariusz R.

We derive outer bounds on the achievable sum rate and construct coding schemes achieving the outer bounds. For a large parameter range, the sum capacity is identical to the sum capacity of the interference channel obtained by silencing the weaker user in the multiple access channel. For other interference configurations, the sum rate can be increased using interference alignment, which exploits the channel gain difference of the users in the multiple access channel. From these results, lower bounds on the generalized degrees of freedom for the Gaussian counterpart are derived.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;approximation algorithm;bit-level parallelism;interference (communication);linear code	Jörg Bühler;Gerhard Wunder	2011	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;telecommunications;information theory;point-to-point;mathematics;degrees of freedom;upper and lower bounds;statistics	ML	36.38265724820569	72.87008056529858	162939

This paper focuses on the simpler problem of adaptive waveform-amplitude design for which we obtain interesting analytical results. We treat an TV-step design problem where a fixed waveform can be transmitted into the channel N times with amplitudes that can be chosen as a function of past channel outputs. For N = 2 and a linear Gaussian channel model, we derive the optimal amplitude to transmit at the second step as a function of the first measurement. This adaptive 2-step energy allocation strategy yields a mean-squared error (MSE) improvement of at least 1.7 dB relative to the optimal non-adaptive strategy. Motivated by the optimal two-step strategy we propose a suboptimal adaptive TV-step strategy that can achieve an MSE improvement of more than 5 dB for N = 50. Applications of our results to MIMO and inverse scattering channel models are discussed.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);channel state information;decibel;estimation theory;mimo;mean squared error;waveform	Raghuram Rangarajan;Raviv Raich;Alfred O.

The received vector corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is modeled as the noisy output of a finite state vector Markov source. Subsequently, a discretely valued basis of minimal dimensionality is identified for the input space. Estimation of the output labels associated with this basis allows labeling of the state transition diagram. For this purpose, certain identifiable characteristics of the output sequences of the Markov source are used to classify its states and generate an initial codebook for a vector quantizer used to restore the output level.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;cluster analysis;codebook;markov chain;markov information source;quantization (signal processing);state diagram;state transition table;utility functions on indivisible goods	Fred Daneshgaran;Marina Mondin;Fabio Dovis;M.

For signaling rates up to about 25% faster than the Nyquist rate, it is shown that the minimum distance does not drop below the value which it would have in the ideal case wherein there is not intersymbol interference.

In this model, the completely positive and trace preserving map governing the channel statistics is, instead of being perfectly known, only revealed as member of a certain set of channels. Therefore, coding schemes have to be used which are simultaneously reliable for each member of this set. Utilizing universal codes for classical-quantum channels, we introduce optimal universal coding schemes for entanglement assisted message transmission of compound quantum channels. The resulting coding theorem together with a corresponding converse statement leads us to a single-letter expression for the entanglement assisted message transmission capacity of compound quantum channels.	entanglement-assisted classical capacity;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;universal code (data compression)	Holger Boche;Gisbert Janssen;Stephan Kaltenstadler	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541585	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;squashed entanglement;amplitude damping channel;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;mathematics;quantum channel;classical capacity;code;statistics	Theory	35.23778420514991	66.84741399838178	164242

In 1952 Hu man constructed his optimal code that minimizes the average code length among all pre x codes for known sources. Actually, Hu man codes minimizes the average redundancy de ned as the di erence between the code length and the entropy of the source. Interestingly enough, no optimal code is known for other popular optimization criterion such as the maximal redundancy de ned as the maximum of the pointwise redundancy over all source sequences. We rst prove that a generalized Shannon code minimizes the maximal redundancy among all pre x codes, and present an eÆcient implementation of the optimal code. Then we compute precisely its redundancy for memoryless sources. Finally, we study universal codes for unknown source distributions. We adopt the minimax approach and search for the best code for the worst source. We establish that such redundancy is a sum of the likelihood estimator and the redundancy of the generalize code computed for the maximum likelihood distribution. This replaces Shtarkov's bound by an exact formula. We also compute precisely the maximal minimax for a class of memoryless sources. The main ndings of this paper are established by techniques that belong to the toolkit of the \analytic analysis of algorithms"""" such as theory of distribution of sequences modulo 1 and Fourier series. These methods have already found applications in other problems of information theory, and they constitute the so called analytic information theory."""	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;data compression;holographic principle;information theory;mathematical optimization;maximal set;minimax;modulo operation;performance evaluation;redundancy (engineering);redundancy (information theory);shannon (unit);universal code (data compression)	Michael Drmota;Wojciech Szpankowski	2002		10.1007/3-540-45995-2_29	systematic code;polynomial code;prefix code;entropy;combinatorics;constant-weight code;universal code;redundancy;canonical huffman code;information theory;variable-length code;self-synchronizing code;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;linear code;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Theory	37.28222121227792	62.91006392510829	164599

Furthermore, this separation proves to be optimal. In certain applications where sensitive information should be protected as early as possible, it is preferable to perform encryption first and then compress the encrypted data. We call this the reversed system. Johnson et al. proposed an achievability scheme for the reversed system that utilizes modulo-sum encryption followed by compression using Wyner-Ziv distributed source coding with side information. However, the scheme requires more compression rate and secrecy key rate than the conventional system that first compresses and then encrypts. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme for the reversed system where encryption is done using a permutation cipher and then the encrypted data is compressed using the optimal rate-distortion code. The proposed scheme can achieve the optimal compression rate and secret key rate, and therefore shows that reversing the order of encryption and compression does not lead to performance loss of an encryption-compression system.	cipher;data compression;distortion;distributed source coding;encryption;information sensitivity;key (cryptography);lossy compression;modulo operation;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering	Wei Kang;Nan Liu	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483379	data compression;multiple encryption;40-bit encryption;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;link encryption;mathematics;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;attribute-based encryption	Security	32.85469633263527	67.12889000636316	164838

Rayleigh fading wireless channels, where neither the sender nor the receivers have access to instantaneous channel state information (CSI). We present two results. At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secret-key capacity is bounded in SNR, regardless of the number of antennas at each terminal. Second, for a system with a single antenna at both the legitimate and the eavesdropper terminals and an arbitrary number of transmit antennas, the secret-key capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete, with a finite number of mass points. Numerically we observe that at low SNR, the capacity achieving distribution has two mass points with one of them at the origin.	channel state information;key (cryptography);key-agreement protocol;numerical integration;public-key cryptography;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio	Anurag Agrawal;Zouheir Rezki;Ashish Khisti;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2011.2158999	random variable;telecommunications;distribution function;mathematics;statistics	Crypto	33.798639722925245	69.36884856809768	164864

Simple and intuitive as it appears, the conjecture has remained open since its proposal in 2004 [1], [2], and is now a well-known unsolved problem in the field of network coding. Based on a recently proposed tool of space information flow [3]-[5], we present a geometric framework for analyzing the multiple unicast conjecture. The framework consists of four major steps, in which the conjecture is transformed from its throughput version to cost version, from the graph domain to the space domain, and then from high dimension to 1-D, where it is to be eventually proved. We apply the geometric framework to derive unified proofs to known results of the conjecture, as well as new results previously unknown. A possible proof to the conjecture based on this framework is outlined.	apply;chi;graph (discrete mathematics);information flow (information theory);isometric projection;linear network coding;routing;throughput;unicast	Tang Xiahou;Chuan Wu;Jiaqing Huang;Zongpeng Li	2012	2012 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)	10.1109/NETCOD.2012.6261881	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear network coding;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	31.881115480925722	62.75808742807365	165181

However, these issues as well as the solvability are less understood for networks with multiple multicast sessions. Recently, Wang and Shroff showed that the solvability of networks with two unit-rate multicast sessions (2-URMS) can be decided in polynomial time . In this paper, we prove that for the 2-URMS networks: 1) the solvability can be determined with time O(|E|); 2) a solution can be constructed with time O(|E|); 3) an optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time; 4) the number of encoding links required to achieve a solution is upper-bounded by max{3,2N - 2}; and 5) the field size required to achieve a linear solution is upper-bounded by max{2, ⌊√{2N-7/4}+1/2⌋}, where |E| is the number of links and N is the number of sinks of the underlying network. Both bounds are shown to be tight.	feasible region;linear code;linear network coding;multicast;time complexity	Wentu Song;Kai Cai;Rongquan Feng;Chau Yuen	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2262492	linear network coding;computer science;theoretical computer science;communication complexity;mathematics;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;statistics;computer network	Metrics	31.553766438969514	71.3415261589216	165266

As a result, we derive the Hoeffding bounds under two-way LOCC POVMs and separable POVMs. Further, we derive Stein’s lemma type of optimal error exponents under one-way LOCC, two-way LOCC, and separable POVMs up to the third order, which clarifies the difference between one-way and two-way LOCC POVM. Our results clarify the relationship between the entanglement of Renyi entropy and the hypothesis testing under LOCC, since the entanglement of Renyi entropy appears in the formula of both the Hoeffding bounds and Stein’s lemma type of error exponents. This paper gives a very rare example in which the optimal performance under the infinite-round two-way LOCC is also equal to that under separable operations and can be attained with two-round communication, but not with the one-way LOCC.	white noise	Masahito Hayashi;Masaki Owari	2017	IEEE Trans.

The goal is to improve diversity of data bursts on a slotted-ALOHA-like channel thanks to error correcting codes and Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC). This scheme can be considered as a generalization of the Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha (CRDSA) where the different replicas of this system are replaced by the different parts of a single word of an error correcting code. The performance of this scheme is first studied through a density evolution approach. Then, simulations confirm the CRDSA results by showing that, for a time frame of 400 slots, the achievable total throughput is greater than 0.7 × C, where C is the maximal throughput achieved by a centralized scheme. This paper is a first analysis of the proposed scheme which open several perspectives. The most promising approach is to integrate collided bursts into the decoding process in order to improve the obtained performance.	bell laboratories layered space-time;burst error;centralized computing;code;communications satellite;error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);linear network coding;maximal set;national center for supercomputing applications;simulation;throughput	Huyen Chi Bui;Jérôme Lacan;Marie-Laure Boucheret	2010	CoRR		linear network coding;error detection and correction;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;communications satellite;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.62565739081398	72.63064603281205	165762

The setting considered a general channel and gene ral (possibly mismatched) decoding metric. Both achievable and converse results were given in t erms of a functionF (R), which is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the pairwise error probability. When the d coding metric is matched to the channel (which is the focus o f this paper), the converse bound reduces to the minimax converse, proposed in [2]. Consider an abstract channel coding problem; that is a rando m transformation defined by a pair of measurable spaces of inputsX and outputsY and a conditional probability measure WY |X : X 7→ Y. Let M be a positive integer. The minimax converse is a lower bound on the error probability of any code with M codewords. The proof of the minimax converse relies on a reduction from the channel coding problem to the binary h ypothesis problem and the bound is given using the functiona l βα (P,Q), which represents the performance of an optimal test to disc riminate between the probability measure P andQ, where1− α is the significance level of the test.

One of the main challenges in the analysis of fading networks, specifically multi-receiver networks including fading ICs, is to obtain efficient capacity outer bounds. In this paper, a novel capacity outer bound is established for the two-user ergodic fading IC. Besides being well-described, our outer bound is efficient from several aspects. Specifically, it is optimal for the fading IC with uniformly strong interference. Also, it is sum-rate optimal for the channel with uniformly mixed interference. More importantly, it is proved that when each transmitter has access to any amount of CSIT that includes the interference to noise ratio at its non-corresponding receiver, the outer bound differs by no more than one bit from the achievable rate region given by Han-Kobayashi scheme. This result is viewed as a generalization of the Etkin-Tse-Wang “to within one bit” capacity result for the static channel to the time-varying wireless fading case.	ergodic theory;ergodicity;interference (communication)	Reza Khosravi-Farsani	2013		10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620328	fading distribution;transmitter;telecommunications;rician fading;radio resource management;co-channel interference;channel state information;radio receiver;fading;computer network	Mobile	35.42795649120167	72.21201592877371	166461

We derive a water-filling solution of the communication-rate-key-rate tradeoff for a wide class of discrete memoryless vector Gaussian sources which subsumes the case without an eavesdropper. Moreover, we derive an explicit formula for the maximum secret key per bit of communication for all discrete memoryless vector Gaussian sources using a tensorization property and a variation on the enhanced channel technique of Weingarten et al. Finally, a one-shot information spectrum achievability bound for key generation is proved from which we characterize the communication-rate-key-rate tradeoff for stationary Gaussian processes.	data processing inequality;gaussian process;key (cryptography);key generation;one-way function;social inequality;stationary process	Jingbo Liu;Paul W.

We examine the case of self-information loss, where the predictions are probability assignments which is equivalent to universal data compression. While previous results in that area are asymptotic only, we examine a class of machine structures and find an optimal method for allocating the probabilities to the machine states which achieves minimal redundancy w.r.t. the constant predictors class. We show analytic bounds for the redundancy of machines from that class, and construct machines with redundancy that is arbitrarily close to these bounds. Finally, we compare our machines to previously proposed machines and show that our machine with 300 states achieves smaller redundancy than the best machine known so far with 6000 states.	asymptote;data compression;deterministic finite automaton;finite-state machine;kerrison predictor;redundancy (engineering);self-information	Amir Ingber;Meir Feder	2006	Data Compression Conference (DCC'06)	10.1109/DCC.2006.54	data compression;entropy;discrete mathematics;concrete;computer science;turing machine;theoretical computer science;machine learning;probability;sequence;mathematics;automaton;finite-state machine;redundancy;algorithm;statistics	ML	36.92203824424491	61.60400055471082	166644

Our techniques incorporate the Rényi entropies, particularly, with Rényi parameter  $\alpha =2$ . Moreover, since our upper bound is additive under tensor product, we get as a corollary an upper bound for the classical capacity of unital quantum channels. Interestingly, our upper bound for the classical capacity depends only on the operator norm of matrix representations of channels on the space of traceless Hermitian operators, and is tight in the sense that it gives the precise quantity of classical capacity of the Werner–Holevo channel. As an example, we study quantum channels with operator sum representation that is made of the discrete Weyl operators (generalized Pauli operators), and explain how our formula works in this case. Finally, we find new examples for which the minimum output Rényi 2-entropy is additive.	additive model;classical capacity;quantum channel;qubit;rényi entropy;tensor operator;utility functions on indivisible goods	Motohisa Fukuda;Gilad Gour	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2641455	entropy;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;food additive;amplitude damping channel;quantum discord;quantum capacity;mathematics;joint quantum entropy;stress;quantum channel;upper and lower bounds;classical capacity;quantum entanglement;channel capacity	Theory	34.98363101634786	63.530909776772845	168033

The main idea is to model the resulting network as a finite-field linear deterministic multiple-access channel (MAC), and show that linear precoding at the source nodes is capacity-achieving. Since linear processing is performed at all the source and intermediate nodes, desired symbols can be decoded at the sink node by simply solving a set of linear equations. The result has also been extended to multi-source wireless erasure networks which incorporate the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions.	code;interference (communication);linear equation;linear network coding;multi-source;transmitter	Xiaoli Xu;Yong Zeng;Yong Liang Guan	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)	10.1109/ICICS.2015.7459897	linear network coding;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;mathematical model;interference;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;precoding;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.62788444259864	73.13354574744531	168041

Emphasis is placed on a characterization of secret key capacity, i.e., the largest rate of an achievable secret key, and on algorithms for key construction. Various information theoretic security requirements of increasing stringency: weak, strong and perfect secrecy, as well as different types of sources: finite-valued and continuous, are studied. Specifically, three different models are investigated. First, we consider strong secrecy generation for a discrete multiterminal source model. We discover a connection between secret key capacity and a new source coding concept of """"minimum information rate for signal dissemination,"""" that is of independent interest in multiterminal data compression. Our main contribution is to show for this discrete model that structured linear codes suffice to generate a strong secret key of the best rate.Second, strong secrecy generation is considered for models with continuous observations, in particular jointly Gaussian signals. In the absence of suitable analogs of source coding notions for the previous discrete model, new techniques are required for a characterization of secret key capacity as well as for the design of algorithms for secret key generation. Our proof of the secret key capacity result, in particular the converse proof, as well as our capacity-achieving algorithms for secret key construction based on structured codes and quantization for a model with two terminals, constitute the two main contributions for this second model.Last, we turn our attention to perfect secrecy generation for fixed signal observation lengths as well as for their asymptotic limits. In contrast with the analysis of the previous two models that relies on probabilistic techniques, perfect secret key generation bears the essence of """"zero-error information theory,"""" and accordingly, we rely on mathematical techniques of a combinatorial nature. The model under consideration is the """"Pairwise Independent Network"""" (PIN) model in which every pair of terminals share a random binary string, with the strings shared by distinct pairs of terminals being mutually independent. This model, which is motivated by practical aspects of a wireless communication network in which terminals communicate on the same frequency, results in three main contributions. First, the concept of perfect omniscience in data compression leads to a single-letter formula for the perfect secret key capacity of the PIN model; moreover, this capacity is shown to be achieved by linear noninteractive public communication, and coincides with strong secret key capacity. Second, taking advantage of a multigraph representation of the PIN model, we put forth an efficient algorithm for perfect secret key generation based on a combinatorial concept of maximal packing of Steiner trees of the multigraph. When all the terminals seek to share perfect secrecy, the algorithm is shown to achieve capacity. When only a subset of terminals wish to share perfect secrecy, the algorithm is shown to achieve at least half of it. Additionally, we obtain nonasymptotic and asymptotic bounds on the size and rate of the best perfect secret key generated by the algorithm. These bounds are of independent interest from a purely graph theoretic viewpoint as they constitute new estimates for the maximum size and rate of Steiner tree packing of a given multigraph. Third, a particular configuration of the PIN model arises when a lone """"helper"""" terminal aids all the other """"user"""" terminals generate perfect secrecy. This model has special features that enable us to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for Steiner tree packing to achieve perfect secret key capacity."""	code;key generation;set packing	Sirin Nitinawarat	2010			secrecy;information theory;key distribution;theoretical computer science;key generation;secret sharing;homomorphic secret sharing;steiner tree problem;mathematics;pairwise independence	Crypto	33.22861107007522	68.07855416806576	168049

Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an additive ε-close estimate to the capacity, the presented algorithm requires O((N ν M)M3 log(N)1/2ε-1) steps, where N denotes the input alphabet size and M denotes the output dimension. We then generalize the method to the task of approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded continuous input alphabet and a finite-dimensional output. This, using the idea of a universal encoder, allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity for channels with a finite-dimensional quantum mechanical input and output. In particular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can be reduced to a multi-dimensional integration problem. For certain families of quantum channels, we prove that the complexity to derive an additive ε-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or even polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme in practice.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;convex optimization;encoder;input/output;iterative method;polynomial;quantum channel;quantum mechanics;utility functions on indivisible goods	David Sutter;Tobias Sutter;Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani;Renato Renner	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2503755	entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convergence;food additive;amplitude damping channel;quantum capacity;mathematics;classical capacity;channel capacity;holevo's theorem	Theory	35.92221732317227	65.37078888285296	168181

The goal is to gain new insights due to the inclusion of MIMO (multiple antennas at both transmitters and receivers) into the signal space partitioning schemes associated with partial CSIT. An interesting idea that emerges from this study is “elevated multiplexing” where the signals are split into streams and transmitted from separate antennas at elevated power levels, which allows these signals to be jointly decoded at one receiver which has fewer spatial dimensions with lower interference floors, while another receiver is simultaneously able to separately decode these signals with a higher interference floor but across a greater number of spatial dimensions. Through elevated multiplexing we find that there is a DoF benefit from increasing the number of antennas at a transmitter even if that transmitter already has more antennas than its desired receiver and has no CSIT.	code;interference (communication);mimo;multiplexing;space partitioning;transmitter	Bofeng Yuan;Syed Ali Jafar	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536890	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing	Networks	36.19726542291396	73.8927499440513	168829

This has applications to quickly encoding and decoding lossless codes. In addition, one modification of the approach solves any quasiarithmetic prefix coding problem, while another finds optimal codes restricted to the set of codes with g codeword lengths for user-specified g (e.g., g = 2).

The cost of the direct computation of these probabilities-e.g., the probability of false alarm, the probability of a miss, or the average error probability-is combinatorial in the number of sensors and becomes infeasible even with small size networks. The method is based on the theory of large deviations, in particular, the saddlepoint approximation and applies to generic parallel fusion sensor networks, including networks with nonidentical sensors, nonidentical observations, and unreliable communication links. The paper demonstrates with parallel fusion sensor network problems the accuracy of the saddlepoint methodology: 1) computing the detection performance for a variety of small and large sensor network scenarios; and 2) designing the local detection thresholds.

Specializing our results to the Gaussian MIMO many-to-one i t rference channel, which is a special case of the class of channels considered, we obtain new capacity result s. Firstly, while previous results characterized noisy interference regimes for many-to-one interference channe ls with inputs having average power constraints, we show that this remains valid for a more general class of inputs. Th is more general class of inputs includes the practical scenario of the inputs being restricted to fixed finite-size c onstellations such as PSK or QAM. Secondly, we extend noisy interference results previously studied in interfer ence channels with single antenna nodes at all transmitters , to MIMO and parallel many-to-one interference channels. Fi nally, while previous results considered the Gaussian interference channel with full channel state information ( CSI) at all nodes, we provide a noisy interference regime for fading Gaussian many-to-one interference channels wit hout CSI at the transmitters. While the many-to-one interference channel requires inter fer nce alignment, which in turn requires structured codes in general, we argue that in the noisy interference reg ime, interference is implicitly aligned by random coding irrespective of the input distribution. As a byproduct of ou r study, we identify a second class of many-to-one interference channels (albeit deterministic) where rando m coding is optimal (though interference is not treated as noise). We attribute the optimality of random coding in this second class of channels to the resolvability of the multiple interferers at the receiver which precludes the po ssibility of interference alignment and hence obviates the need of structured codes.	british undergraduate degree classification;channel state information;code;hardware random number generator;interference (communication);mimo;one-to-many (data model);pre-shared key;randomness;transmitter	Viveck R.

366345ffe0fd022b2e401f66033114ebe55345e7	a hypothesis testing approach for communication over entanglement assisted compound quantum channel		We study the problem of communication over compound quantum channel in the presence of entanglement. Classically such channels are modeled as a collection of conditional probability distributions wherein neither the sender nor the receiver is aware of the channel being used for transmission, except for the fact that it belongs to this collection. We provide achievability and converse bounds for this problem in the one shot quantum setting in terms of quantum hypothesis testing relative-entropy. Our achievability proof is similar in spirit to its classical counterpart. To arrive at our result, we use the technique of position based decoding along with a new approach for constructing a union of two projectors, which can be of independent interest.	kullback–leibler divergence;movie projector;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;quantum mechanics	Anurag Anshu;Rahul Jain;Naqueeb Ahmad Warsi	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437775	discrete mathematics;combinatorics;quantum mechanics;decoding methods;quantum entanglement;quantum capacity;mathematics;communication source;quantum channel;quantum;amplitude damping channel;communication channel	Theory	34.74828738631919	66.55810432743952	170099
a83b0b66b880c0d1f8479b6567df7d0e0a7da3e3	a broadcast approach to multiple access adapted to the multiuser channel		A broadcast strategy for multiple access communication over slowly fading channels is introduced, in which the channel state information is known to only the receiver. In this strategy, the transmitters split their information streams into multiple independent information layers, each adapted to a specific actual channel realization. The major distinction between the proposed strategy and the existing ones is that in the existing approaches, each transmitter adapts its transmission strategy only to the fading process of its direct channel to the receiver, hence directly adopting a single-user strategy previously designed for the single-user channels. However, the contribution of each user to a network-wide measure (e.g., sum-rate capacity) depends not only on the user's direct channel to the receiver, but also on the qualities of other channels. Driven by this premise, this paper proposes an alternative broadcast strategy in which the transmitters adapt their transmissions to the combined states resulting from all users' channels. This leads to generating a larger number of information layers by each transmitter and adopting a different decoding strategy by the receiver. An achievable rate region that captures the trade-off among the rates of different information is established and is shown to subsume the existing known regions.	channel state information;multi-user;transmitter	Samia Kazemi;Ali Tajer	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006655	fading;premise;channel state information;streams;discrete mathematics;computer science;decoding methods;transmitter;telecommunications;distributed computing;communication channel;broadcasting	Mobile	33.865856839890704	74.35031869731051	170181

We propose a lattice-based coding scheme in which the BSs decode linear combinations of the transmitted messages, in the spirit of Compute-and-Forward (CoF), but differs from it essentially in that the decoded equations are remapped to linear combinations of the channel input symbols, sent compressed in a lossy manner to the CP, and are not required to be linearly independent. Also, by opposition to the standard CoF, an appropriate multi-user decoder is utilized to recover the sent messages. This novel scheme differs from both classical Compute-and-Forward and Successive Wyner-Ziv (SWZ) and it is shown to outperform both schemes, in certain regimes, through some numerical examples.	backhaul (telecommunications);central processing unit;code;lossy compression;multi-user;numerical analysis;radio access network;telecommunications link	Inaki Estella Aguerri;Abdellatif Zaidi	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510695	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;lattice;mathematical model;encoding;statistics;computer network	EDA	33.33604033764495	74.48009554584323	170485

The direct proof relies on an achievable region for the general BC that is tight for the SD scenario. This achievable region follows by a coding scheme that combines rate-splitting and binning with Marton and superposition coding. The SD-BC is shown to be operationally equivalent to a class of relay-BCs (RBCs) and the correspondence between their capacity regions is established. Furthermore, a dual source coding problem, referred to as the Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner (WAK) problem with one-sided encoder cooperation, is proposed. Transformation principles between the problems are presented and the optimal rate region for the AK problem is stated. The SD-BC capacity and the admissible region of the AK problem are shown to be dual to one another in the sense that the information measures defining the corner points of both regions coincide. Special cases of the two problems are inspected and shown to maintain duality.	broadcast domain;data compression;duality (optimization);encoder;internet relay chat;product binning;regular expression;semiconductor industry	Ziv Goldfeld;Haim H.

Prev iously we introduced alternate capacity definitions to Shannon capacity, including the capacity ver sus outage and the expected capacity. These generalized definitions relax the constraint of Shannon cap a ity that all transmitted information must be decoded at the receiver. In this work alternate end-to-end d istortion metrics such as the distortion versus outage and the expected distortion are introduced to relax t he constraint that a single distortion level has to be maintained for all channel states. For transmission of stationary and ergodic sources over stationary and ergodic channels, the classical Shannon separation the rem enables separate design of source and channel codes and guarantees optimal performance. For gene alized communication systems, we show that different end-to-end distortion metrics lead to diffe rent conclusions about separation optimality even for the same source and channel models. Separation does not imply isolation the source and channel still need to communicate with each other through some interfaces. For Shannon separation schemes, the interface is a single-number comparison between the source coding rate and the channel ca pacity. Here we include a broader class of transmission schemes as separation schemes by relaxing t he constraint of a single-number interface. We show that one such generalized scheme guarantees the sepa ration optimality under the distortion versus outage metric. Under the expected distortion metric , separation schemes are no longer optimal.

First, we derive a lower bound on the fidelity of a stabilizer code via its quantum enumerator. Next, we find the average quantum enumerators of the ensembles of finite length stabilizer and CSS codes. We use the average quantum enumerators for obtaining lower bounds on the average fidelity of these ensembles. We further improve the fidelity bounds by estimating the quantum enumerators of expurgated ensembles of stabilizer and CSS codes. Finally, we derive fidelity bounds in the asymptotic regime when the code length tends to infinity. These results tell us which code rate we can afford for achieving a target fidelity with codes of a given length. The results also show that in symmetric depolarizing channel a typical stabilizer code has better performance, in terms of fidelity and code rate, compared with a typical CSS codes, and that balanced CSS codes significantly outperform other CSS codes. Asymptotic results demonstrate that CSS codes have a fundamental performance loss compared with stabilizer codes.	cascading style sheets;code rate;enumerator polynomial;quantum depolarizing channel;stabilizer code	Alexei E.

Inspired by probabilistic amplitude shaping, we propose a probabilistic eigenvalue shaping (PES) scheme as a means to increase the data rate of the system. We exploit the fact that for an NFT-based transmission scheme, the pulses in the time domain are of unequal duration by transmitting them with a dynamic symbol interval and find a capacity-achieving distribution. The PES scheme shapes the information symbols according to the capacity-achieving distribution and transmits them together with the parity symbols at the output of a low-density parity-check encoder, suitably modulated, via time-sharing. We furthermore derive an achievable rate for the proposed PES scheme. We verify our results with simulations of the discrete-time model as well as with split-step Fourier simulations.	data rate units;embedded system;encoder;imaginary time;low-density parity-check code;modulation;noise shaping;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;packetized elementary stream;potential energy surface;simulation;spectral efficiency;time-sharing;transmitter;nftables	Andreas Buchberger;Alexandre Graell i Amat;Vahid Aref;Laurent Schmalen	2018	Journal of Lightwave Technology	10.1109/JLT.2018.2854760	probability density function;electronic engineering;fourier transform;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;nonlinear system;mathematics;parity (mathematics);time domain;control theory;amplitude;probabilistic logic	Mobile	38.78852027987292	71.70195982226566	172049

Massey gave an information theoretic proof of this result and the proof does not require U and R to be independent. By adding an extra assumption that I(U; R) = 0, we show a tighter lower bound on H(R) by proving that the logarithm of the message sample size cannot be larger than the entropy of the secret key. Then we consider that a perfect secrecy system is used multiple times. A new parameter, namely effective key consumption, is defined and justified. This paper shows the existence of a fundamental tradeoff between the effective key consumption and the number of channel uses for transmitting a ciphertext.	ciphertext;information theory;information-theoretic security;key (cryptography);shannon (unit);transmitter	Siu-Wai Ho;Terence Chan;Chinthani Uduwerelle	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033797	entropy;semantic security;cryptography;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;computer security;statistics	Crypto	33.4967925811367	67.93489798793009	172406

We formulate three transmission strategies for the above network, which involve using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference from a subset of the transmitters as noise. We use sum-rate as the criterion of optimality for evaluating the strategies. For the first two strategies, we characterize the sum-rate capacity under certain channel conditions, while for the other strategy, we derive a sum-rate outer bound and characterize the gap between the outer bound and the achievable sum-rate of the strategy. Finally, we illustrate the regions where the derived channel conditions are satisfied for each strategy.	codebook;interference (communication);one-to-many (data model);transmitter	Ranga Prasad;Srikrishna Bhashyam;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883609	adjacent-channel interference;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;co-channel interference	Robotics	35.24788514180108	72.67412599414104	172770

Specifically we consider a four-node network in which two nodes wish to compute a modulo-sum of two independent Bernoulli sources generated from the other two, and a similar task is done in the other direction. The main contribution of this work lies in the characterization of the computation capacity region for a deterministic model of the network via a novel transmission scheme. One consequence of this result is that not only we can get an interaction gain over the one-way non-feedback computation capacities, we can sometime get all the way to perfect-feedback computation capacities simultaneously in both directions.

The receivers can simultaneously reconstruct different qubit states containing the joint information from all senders. Compared with the protocols proposed by Su et al. (Int J Quantum Inf 10:1250006 (2012), the information of the prepared states in our schemes is distributed in a different way. Our protocols can be applied not only to states with real parameters but also ones with complex parameters. Moreover, the N-to-2 protocol is suitable for general qubit states besides equatorial states, and the receivers need not to perform any measurements and CNOT gates to reconstruct the states.

Denoting this quantity by gε(X,Y ), we show that for perfect privacy, i.e., ε = 0, one has g0(X,Y ) = 0 for any pair of absolutely continuous random variables (X,Y ) and then derive a second-order approximation for gε(X,Y ) for small ε. This approximation is shown to be related to the strong data processing inequality for mutual information under suitable conditions on the joint distribution PXY . Next, motivated by an operational interpretation of data privacy, we formulate the privacy-utility tradeoff in the same setup using estimationtheoretic quantities and obtain explicit bounds for this tradeoff when ε is sufficiently small using the approximation formula derived for gε(X,Y ).	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;approximation;data processing inequality;information privacy;information-theoretic security;maximal set;mutual information;personally identifiable information;social inequality;utility functions on indivisible goods	Shahab Asoodeh;Fady Alajaji;Tamás Linder	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49175-2_13	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	ML	33.92501925511254	65.54968485375268	173113

We systematically study a practical scenario by taking into account all relevant parameters including sampling delay, eavesdroppers’ location, qualities of legitimate and eavesdropping channels, Doppler spread, and pilot length. Our findings indicate that secret key capacity is determined by the cross correlation of the channel measurements, and a better legitimate channel is not necessary when the correlation between legitimate channels is higher than correlation between legitimate and eavesdropping channels. We also find that it is possible to tune the secret key capacity by carefully designing the sampling delay, pilot length, and channel qualities.

6773be4c33e84815c883191dffb01cedbb63cbda	bit loading and precoding for mimo communication systems	telekommunikation;telecommunications	This thesis considers the joint design of bit loading, precoding and receive filters for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) digital communication system. Both the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to know the channel matrix perfectly. It is well known that, for linear MIMO transceivers, orthogonal transmission (i.e., diagonalization of the channel matrix) is optimal for some criteria such as maximum mutual information. It has been shown that if the receiver uses the linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detector, the optimal transmission strategy is to perform bit loading on orthogonal subchannels. In the first part of the thesis, we consider the problem of designing the transceiver in order to minimize the probability of error given maximum likelihood (ML) detection. A joint bit loading and linear precoder design is proposed that outperforms the optimal orthogonal transmission. The design uses lattice invariant operations to transform the channel matrix into a lattice generator matrix with large minimum distance separation at a low price in terms of transmit power. With appropriate approximations, it is shown that this corresponds to selecting lattices with good sphere-packing properties. An algorithm for this power minimization is presented along with a lower bound on the optimization. Apparently, given the optimal ML detector, orthogonal subchannels are (in general) suboptimal. The ML detector may suffer from high computational complexity, which motivates the use of the suboptimal but less complex MMSE detector. An intermediate detector in terms of complexity and performance is the decision feedback (DF) detector. In the second part of the thesis, we consider the problem of joint bit loading and precoding assuming the DF detector. The main result shows that for a DF MIMO transceiver where the bit loading is jointly optimized with the transceiver filters, orthogonal transmission is optimal. As a consequence, inter-symbol interference is eliminated and the DF part of the receiver is actually not required, only the linear part is needed. The proof is based on a relaxation of the discrete set of available bit rates on the individual subchannels to the set of positive real numbers. In practice, the signal constellations are discrete and the optimal relaxed bit loading has to be rounded. It is shown that the loss due to rounding is small, and an upper bound on the maximum loss is derived. Numerical results are presented that confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate that orthogonal transmission and the truly optimal DF design perform almost equally well.

Tree coding and tree search strategies are investigated for the discrete-time memoryless Gaussian source encoded for a signal-power-to-mean-squared-error ratio of about 30 dB (about 5 binary digits per source output). Also, a theoretical lower bound on average search effort is derived. Two code search strategies (the Viterbi algorithm and the stack algorithm) were simulated in assembly language on a large digital computer. After suitable modifications, both strategies yielded encoding with a signal-to-distortion ratio about 1 dB below the limit set by the rate-distortion function. Although this performance is better than that of any previously known instrumentable scheme, it unfortunately requires search computation of the order of l0^5 machine cycles per source output encoded.

Then, by maximizing the obtained upper bound over all the discrete input distributions with equally spaced mass points, and approximating, we reach to a third order equation for the optimum input distribution. Our equation (i) determines the optimum input distribution directly in contrary to the Farid-Hranilovic (FH) work where it is found numerically, and also, (ii) gives a previously derived second order equation for the optimum input distribution of FSO channels with input-independent Gaussian noise in a special case. Using numerical illustrations, we compare our input distribution with previous works.	channel capacity;farid essebar;farid f. abraham;mutual information;numerical analysis;social inequality	Kobra Akbari Dadamahalleh;Ghosheh Abed Hodtani	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620517	probability distribution;gaussian noise;additive white gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;channel capacity;statistics	Theory	36.97177507398298	69.46032376511306	174389

By combining some fundamental quantum mechanical principles of single photons with various aspects of information theory, quantum cryptography represents a fundamental shift in the basis for security from numerical complexity to the fundamental physical nature of the communications channel. As such, it promises the holy grail of data security: theoretically unbreakable encryption. Of course, implementing quantum cryptography in real broadband communications systems poses some unique challenges, including generating single photons, distilling random keys from the quantum key distribution process, and maintaining security at both the theoretical and practical level. Overall, quantum cryptography has a place in the history of secret keeping as a novel and potentially useful paradigm shift in the approach to broadband data encryption.	channel (communications);data security;electrical engineering;information theory;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;quantum cryptography;quantum key distribution;quantum mechanics	Daniel J.

2e800cd774ef6dae5dd77b175c5d392192a110b8	can negligible cooperation increase network reliability? (extended version)		In network cooperation strategies, nodes work together with the aim of increasing transmission rates or reliability. For example, cooperation can be employed to obtain a code with small maximal-error from a code with small average-error that does not make use of cooperation. In networks where rates achievable under a maximal-error constraint differ from those achievable under an average-error constraint, such a benefit can be potentially viewed as both increasing reliability and increasing rate. Let us define the cooperation rate as the number of bits per channel use shared with each node as part of the cooperation strategy. We here demonstrate that even a negligible cooperation rate can sometimes yield a non-negligible benefit. Precisely, we employ Dueck's example of a multiple access channel whose maximal and average-error sum-capacities differ, to show that there exists a network whose maximal-error sum-capacity is not continuous with respect to its edge capacities.	channel use;color depth;maximal set	Parham Noorzad;Michelle Effros;Michael Langberg	2016	CoRR		computer security	Theory	33.67788584159858	72.98603740618277	174596
733af1ab3063f8292bee7904506f5e000a3cd4ff	a lower bound on the differential entropy of log-concave random vectors with applications		We derive a lower bound on the differential entropy of a log-concave random variable X in terms of the p-th absolute moment of X. The new bound leads to a reverse entropy power inequality with an explicit constant, and to new bounds on the rate-distortion function and the channel capacity. Specifically, we study the rate-distortion function for log-concave sources and distortion measure d(x, x̂) = |x− x̂|r, with r ≥ 1, and we establish that the difference between the rate-distortion function and the Shannon lower bound is at most log( √ πe) ≈ 1.5 bits, independently of r and the target distortion d. For mean-square error distortion, the difference is at most log( √ πe 2 ) ≈ 1 bit, regardless of d. We also provide bounds on the capacity of memoryless additive noise channels when the noise is log-concave. We show that the difference between the capacity of such channels and the capacity of the Gaussian channel with the same noise power is at most log( √ πe 2 ) ≈ 1 bit. Our results generalize to the case of a random vector X with possibly dependent coordinates. Our proof technique leverages tools from convex geometry.	1-bit architecture;additive white gaussian noise;approximation;channel capacity;data compression;differential entropy;distortion;entropy power inequality;inferring horizontal gene transfer;information theory;logarithmically concave function;mean squared error;noise power;rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit);social inequality;utility functions on indivisible goods	Arnaud Marsiglietti;Victoria Kostina	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20030185	binary entropy function;maximum entropy probability distribution;joint quantum entropy;differential entropy	Theory	36.05738334181912	64.70239069627476	175273

This condition is expressed in terms of linear independence-over the rationals-of monomials in the off-diagonal entries of the IC matrix and is satisfied for almost all IC matrices. There is, however, a prominent class of IC matrices that admits K/2 DoF but fails to satisfy this condition. The main contribution of the present paper is a more general condition for K/2 DoF (in fact for 1/2 DoF for each user) that, inter alia, encompasses this example class. While the existing condition by Stotz and Bölcskei is of algebraic nature, the new condition is canonical in the sense of capturing the essence of interference alignment by virtue of being expressed in terms of a generic injectivity condition that guarantees separability of signal and interference.	interference (communication);linear separability;monomial	Erwin Riegler;Syed Ali Jafar;Helmut Bölcskei;Shlomo Shamai	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541507	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Arch	36.5361786617515	72.45509928171505	175407

Those systems have exhibited some flaws, as the secret key rate of corresponding protocols remains unaltered, while the eavesdropper obtains the entire secret key. We propose the negative acknowledgment state quantum key distribution protocol as a novel protocol capable of detecting the eavesdropping activity of the Intercept Resend with Faked Sates (IRFS) attack without requiring additional optical components different from the BB84 protocol because the system can be implemented as a high software module. In this approach, the transmitter interleaves pairs of quantum states, referred to here as parallel and orthogonal states, while the receiver uses active basis selection.	acknowledgment index;bb84;key (cryptography);quantum key distribution;quantum state;retransmission (data networks);sensor;transmitter;visual intercept	Luis A.

Simple and intuitive as it appears, the conjecture has remained open since its proposal in 2004, and is now a well-known unsolved problem in the field of network coding. Based on a recently proposed tool of space information flow, we present a geometric framework for analyzing the multiple-unicast conjecture. The framework consists of four major steps, in which the conjecture is transformed from its throughput version to cost version, from the graph domain to the space domain, and then from high dimension to 1-D, where it is to be eventually proved. We apply the geometric framework to derive unified proofs to known results of the conjecture, as well as new results previously unknown. A possible proof to the conjecture based on this framework is outlined.	apply;graph (discrete mathematics);hilbert space;isometric projection;linear network coding;routing;throughput;unicast	Tang Xiahou;Zongpeng Li;Chuan Wu;Jiaqing Huang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2308998	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear network coding;shannon–fano coding;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;geometric networks;random geometric graph	Theory	31.894091477841403	62.75204571437614	176202

In the protocol, a boss can asymmetrically distribute an arbitrary two-qubit state, which has not been investigated by the previous papers, to the distant agents in a network. The asymmetric distribution leads to that the agents' authorities for getting the secret state are hierarchical. In other word, they have different authorities for the boss's secret state. Moreover, the symmetry feature of cluster state reflects our protocol will have a better extendibility. Thus, we further propose a multiparty HQIS protocol. In our HQIS protocol, the agents only need the single-qubit measurement, which is an appealing advantage in practically implementation. Meanwhile, the present protocol can be modified to implement the threshold-controlled teleportation.	cluster state;quantum information;qubit	Gang Xu;Cong Wang;Yixian Yang	2014	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-013-0670-1	discrete mathematics;cluster state;theoretical computer science;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	30.43661760836248	64.7864299210691	176353

The confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possible from receiver 2. The broadcast channel from the source node to receivers 1 and 2 is corrupted by multiplicative fading gain coefficients in addition to additive Gaussian noise terms. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and the receivers. The parallel BCC with independent subchannels is first studied, which serves as an information-theoretic model for the fading BCC. The secrecy capacity region of the parallel BCC is established, which gives the secrecy capacity region of the parallel BCC with degraded subchannels. The secrecy capacity region is then established for the parallel Gaussian BCC, and the optimal source power allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region are derived. In particular, the secrecy capacity region is established for the basic Gaussian BCC. The secrecy capacity results are then applied to study the fading BCC. The ergodic performance is first studied. The ergodic secrecy capacity region and the optimal power allocations that achieve the boundary of this region are derived. The outage performance is then studied, where a long-term power constraint is assumed. The power allocation is derived that minimizes the outage probability where either the target rate of the common message or the target rate of the confidential message is not achieved. The power allocation is also derived that minimizes the outage probability where the target rate of the confidential message is not achieved subject to the constraint that the target rate of the common message must be achieved for all channel states.	bricx command center;channel state information;coefficient;confidentiality;degraded mode;downtime;ergodic hypothesis;ergodic theory;ergodicity;information needs;secure communication;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yingbin Liang;H.

By contrast, in this note, we show that when the noises are anti-correlated and feedback is present, then a pre-log of two can be attained. In other words, in this special case, in the limit of high SNR, the scalar Gaussian broadcast channel turns into two parallel AWGN channels. Achievability is established via a coding strategy due to Schalkwijk, Kailath, and Ozarow.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);feedback;signal-to-noise ratio	Michele A.

b1209c5ec8725949fe74a1c52eb2ba326248428c	achieving perfect secrecy with one bit keys		Shannon perfect secrecy, also known as one-time pad, can only be achieved by using exactly a different key bit for each information bit. This requirement makes the implementation of perfect secrecy impractical in most applications. In this paper, a novel coding scheme for security is proposed that achieves perfect secrecy with only half a bit key per packet or equivalently, one bit key per two packets, regardless of the size of the packet. This surprising result implies that the ratio of key to the ratio of the data can asymptotically go to zero. The coding scheme has been applied to distributed cloud storage systems. Further, optimal code for security is defined and it has been shown that the proposed approach is optimal.		Mohsen Karimzadeh Kiskani;Hamid R.

5aa7d1cb06d7a74aed8b1e51f95454ec3d616abf	a new achievability scheme for the relay channel	compress and forward;relay channel;information theory	In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme for the general relay channel. This coding scheme is in the form of a block Markov code. The transmitter uses a superposition Markov code. The relay compresses the received signal and maps the compressed version of the received signal into a codeword conditioned on the codeword of the previous block. The receiver performs joint decoding after it has received all of the B blocks. We show that this coding scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known Compress-And-Forward (CAF) scheme proposed by Cover and El Gamal. Our coding scheme provides options for preserving the correlation between the channel inputs of the transmitter and the relay, which is not possible in the CAF scheme. Thus, our proposed scheme may potentially yield a larger achievable rate than the CAF scheme. ∗This work was supported by NSF Grants CCR 03-11311, CCF 04-47613 and CCF 05-14846, and was presented in part at IEEE Information Theory Workshop, Lake Tahoe, CA, September 2007.	code word;ibm notes;information theory;map;markov chain;microsoft customer care framework;relay channel;sap composite application framework;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wei Kang;Sennur Ulukus	2007	CoRR		telecommunications;information theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;relay channel;statistics	Crypto	36.90737791388082	66.97073265393256	177128

A key feature of unequal coherence lengths is that the per-transmission cost of acquiring CSI and its effect on achievable rates may vary significantly among the nodes, thus pre-existing receive CSI on a typical node should not be assumed as it will hide this key feature of the problem. In this paper, the method of product superposition is employed to find the achievable degrees of freedom region of multiuser broadcast channel where the users coherence lengths have arbitrary integer ratios. The achievable degrees of freedom region meets the outer bound when the transmitter has fewer antennas than the receivers, or when all receivers have the same number of antennas, hence for this class of antenna configurations the optimal degrees of freedom is now known.	camera serial interface;multi-user;transmitter	Mohamed Fadel;Aria Nosratinia	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541304	telecommunications;mathematics;computer network	Embedded	36.26984322665373	73.78624112302354	177545

The data under compression are random sequence of variable Y which at time t : y0, y1,..., yt have occurred. Y random integer {0, 1, ..., N-1}. So, at time t, if we produce Yt+1 to be really a subset to Y so that yt+1 ∈ Yt+1 then we can write or send the index of yt+1 in Yt+1 instead of yt+1 . To do it we create a function F, which learned from some recent past Y by the fixed rules, to map a known set onto Y. The known set is the set known by both sender and receiver, and also, the function F is automatically created the same at both sides.	c date and time functions;data compression;simulation	Toan L. P.

The two main loss functions that are considered are the square error loss and the self-information loss. Universal prediction w.r.t. the self-information loss can be combined with arithmetic encoding to construct a universal encoder, thus explores the universal coding problem. The performance of randomized time-invariant K-state universal predictors, and provide performance bounds in terms of the number of states K for long enough sequences is analyzed. In the case where the comparison class consists of constant predictors for the square error loss, the tight bounds indicating that the optimal asymptotic expected redundancy is O(1/K) is provided. An upper bound on the coding redundancy of O((log K)/K) and a lower bound of O(1/K) is shown for the self-information loss.	arithmetic coding;bitstream;data compression;emulator;encoder;finite-state machine;kerrison predictor;loss function;primitive recursive function;randomized algorithm;recursion (computer science);self-information;time complexity;time-invariant system;universal code (data compression)	Eado Meron;Meir Feder	2004	Data Compression Conference, 2004.

A key feature of the problem considered here is that the source downlink channel has a higher loss rate than the channels between pairs of receivers; this feature implies that completion time may be reduced by offloading transmissions to receiver-receiver links and taking advantage of their higher reliability. Three strategies are analyzed and compared: a strategy in which all transmissions are carried out by the original source node; a strategy in which the original source transmits until it is able to designate a proxy-source among the receiver nodes to complete the multicast; and a strategy in which the original source transmits the minimal number of packets possible and cooperative transmissions among receivers are used to complete the multicast. These strategies are compared in terms of the number of packet transmissions needed to complete the multicast.	automated theorem proving;block size (cryptography);lossy compression;multi-user mimo;multicast;network packet;relay;telecommunications link	Brooke Shrader;IV C.

Alice and Bob want to agree on a key KAB that is protected from Charlie. At the same time, Alice and Charlie want to agree on a key KAC that is protected from Bob. In order to construct codebooks for the key agreement, Alice has to know how the sources are distributed. Therefore, she requests Bob and Charlie to send her sufficient information about their observations. We also assume that Bob and Charlie, besides agreeing with Alice on the keys, want to learn as much as possible about the other user's key: we call this quantity the leakage. We model these reports by having Bob and Charlie select discrete memoryless channels and passing their true observations through them. We approach this problem from a game-theoretic point of view. For a class of Bob and Charlie's objective functions which are linear in the key rate and the leakage rate, we characterize a Nash equilibrium. Also, we propose a strategy that Alice can apply in order to ensure that Bob and Charlie's honest reporting is a Nash equilibrium.	alice and bob;codebook;game theory;key-agreement protocol;nash equilibrium;spectral leakage	Nebojsa Milosavljevic;Michael Gastpar;Kannan Ramchandran	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513707	game theory;simulation;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;cryptography;artificial intelligence;zirconium;zinc;alice and bob;mathematics;nash equilibrium;statistics	Theory	33.771537676440914	68.84091066437163	178377

In this paper, the issue of whether or not the secrecy capacity is a continuous function of the system parameters is examined. In particular, this is done for channel uncertainty modeled via compound channels and arbitrarily varying channels, in which the legitimate users know only that the true channel realization is from a pre-specified uncertainty set. In the former model, this realization remains constant for the entire duration of transmission, while in the latter the realization varies from channel use to channel use in an unknown and arbitrary manner. The secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel is shown to be robust in the sense that it is a continuous function of the uncertainty set. Thus, small variations in the uncertainty set lead to small variations in secrecy capacity. However, the secrecy capacity of the arbitrarily varying wiretap channel is shown to be discontinuous in the uncertainty set meaning that small variations can lead to dramatic losses in capacity.	adversary (cryptography);channel use;code;scott continuity;secure communication	Holger Boche;Rafael F.

d4c267d08950de1991976afde65fc998835713fa	bayesian error based sequences of mutual information bounds		The inverse relation between mutual information (MI) and Bayesian error is sharpened by deriving finite sequences of upper and lower bounds on MI in terms of the minimum probability of error (MPE) and related Bayesian quantities. The well known Fano upper bound and Feder-Merhav lower bound on equivocation are tightened by including a succession of posterior probabilities starting at the largest, which directly controls the MPE, and proceeding to successively lower ones. A number of other interesting results are also derived, including a sequence of upper bounds on the MPE in terms of a previously introduced sequence of generalized posterior distributions. The tightness of the various bounds is illustrated for a simple application of joint spatial localization and spectral typing of a point source.	mutual information;olami–feder–christensen model;succession;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sudhakar Prasad	2014	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;statistics	ML	35.506571871618014	64.82289865524642	178635

With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and a snapshot observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model. We propose to use a notion of local rumor center to characterize P<sub>c</sub>(n), the correct detection probability of the source estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes, for regular trees of node degree δ. First, when all nodes are suspects, lim<sub>n→∞</sub>P<sub>c</sub>(n) grows from 0.25 to 0.307 as δ increases from three to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different approach; furthermore, P<sub>c</sub>(n) monotonically decreases with n and increases with δ even in the finite-n regime. Second, when the suspect nodes form a connected subgraph of the network, lim<sub>n→∞</sub>P<sub>c</sub>(n) significantly exceeds the a priori probability if δ ≥ 3, and reliable detection is achieved as δ becomes sufficiently large; furthermore, P<sub>c</sub>(n) monotonically decreases with n and increases with δ. Third, when there are only two suspect nodes, lim<sub>n→∞</sub>P<sub>c</sub>(n) is at least 0.75 if δ ≥ 3; and P<sub>c</sub>(n) increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are multiple suspect nodes, among all possible connection patterns, that all the suspects form a single connected subgraph yields the smallest P<sub>c</sub>(n). Our analysis leverages ideas from the Pólya's urn model in probability theory and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.	expanded memory;rumor spread in social network;snapshot (computer storage)	Wenxiang Dong;Wenyi Zhang;Chee Wei Tan	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620711	combinatorics;theoretical computer science;machine learning;probability;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Theory	39.17259949818932	61.05081696345331	178695

We propose several improved doping methods to reduce the average doping rate. We then provide an analysis of the proposed doping methods based on the study of the decoding ripple evolution. Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed doping approaches provide significant performance gain over the existing random doping strategy. We then apply the doped LT decoding to the wireless broadcast system in which limited feedback is allowed. We propose a majority vote based doping selection and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed doping selection through simulations. I. INTRODUCTION Rateless codes, e.g., Luby-Transform (LT) codes (1), are commonly used for data transmission without any feedback. However, if limited feedback is allowed, the data recovery per- formance can be improved. Some works that have considered rateless codes over a feedback channel include (2) and (3). In (2), rateless coding with feedback is proposed in the form of hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ), called doped rateless decoding. On the other hand, in (3), the transmitter adjusts the degree distributions of the LT code to improve performance based on the feedback of the number of correctly decoded bits. In this paper, following (2), we propose several improved doping methods for LT codes to reduce the number of doping iterations (or the doping rate) required for correct decoding. Based on the code structure and degree information, the doped input symbol is deliberately selected which potentially adds more bits to the decoding ripple. Following the Markov- modulated random walk model in (2), we provide performance analysis for the proposed doping methods. Moreover, we apply doped LT decoding to wireless broadcast systems in which the same data stream is sent to multiple receivers. We propose a majority voting based selection and several other criterions at the transmit side for the broadcast systems in conjunction with the proposed doping approaches at the receivers.	computer simulation;doping (semiconductor);ripple effect	Guosen Yue;Momin Uppal;Xiaodong Wang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963047	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;markov process;statistics;computer network	Robotics	32.103023346559546	74.38479812817155	178884

The gaps for the sum and individual rates using a quadratic distortion measure are upper-bounded by 1.5 and 0.5 bits/sample, respectively, and are universal with respect to the source being encoded and the desired distortion levels. Variants of our basic ideas are presented, including upper and lower bounds on the second channel's rate when the first channel's rate is arbitrarily close to the rate-distortion function; these bounds differ, in the limit as the code block length goes to infinity, by not more than 2 bits/sample. An interesting aspect of our methodology is the manner in which the matching single-letter outer bound is obtained, as we eschew common techniques for constructing single-letter bounds in favor of new ideas in the field of rate loss bounds. We expect these techniques to be generally applicable to other settings of interest.	block (programming);block code;distortion;rate–distortion theory	Luis Alfonso Lastras-Montaño;Vittorio Castelli	2006	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.862073	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Theory	36.687423858793586	64.96500859228698	179007

Two wardens, who do not collude with each other, monitor communication from the transmitter and the relay, respectively, through two Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs) to detect the presence of a covert message. The objective of the transmitter is to deliver the covert message successfully to the receiver without exceeding the covertness threshold of either warden. We identify the optimal asymptotic scaling of message and key bits and the dependence of the covert throughput on the two covertness thresholds.	internet relay chat;relay channel;throughput;transmitter	Keerthi Suria Kumar Arumugam;Matthieu R.

8d2d9b688f633c59e33e9d95b101d5e63eae3092	efficient joint network-source coding for multiple terminals with side information		Consider the problem of source coding in networks with multiple receiving terminals, each having access to some kind of side information. In this case, standard coding techniques are either prohibitively complex to decode, or require network-source coding separation, resulting in sub-optimal transmission rates. To alleviate this problem, we offer a joint network-source coding scheme based on matrix sparsification at the code design phase, which allows the terminals to use an efficient decoding procedure (syndrome decoding using LDPC), despite the network coding throughout the network. Via a novel relation between matrix sparsification and rate-distortion theory, we give lower and upper bounds on the best achievable sparsification performance. These bounds allow us to analyze our scheme, and, in particular, show that in the limit where all receivers have comparable side information (in terms of conditional entropy), or, equivalently, have weak side information, a vanishing density can be achieved. As a result, efficient decoding is possible at all terminals simultaneously. Simulation results motivate the use of this scheme at non-limiting rates as well. ∗The material in this paper was presented in part at the Information Theory and Applications Workshop, San Diego, USA, 2011 and the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, Saint Petersburg, Russia, 2011. †Authors are with the Department of Communication Systems Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.

Two new outer bounds on the capacity region are derived, which improve uniformly over the best known (genie-aided) outer bound. The two corner points of the capacity region as well as the sum rate capacity are established, and it is shown that a single-letter solution is adequate to achieve both the corner points and the sum rate capacity. Furthermore, the full capacity region is characterized in situations in which the sum rate capacity is equal to the capacity of the helper problem. The proof exploits the optimal-transportation idea of Polyanskiy and Wu (which was used previously to establish an outer bound on the capacity region of the interference channel) and the worst-case Gaussian noise result for the case in which the input and the noise are dependent.	best, worst and average case;encoder;genie;interference (communication)	Wei Yang;Yingbin Liang;Shlomo Shamai;H.

The goal is to answer the following question: what is the minimum (worst-case) fraction of the total HD capacity that one can always achieve by smartly selecting a subset of k relays, out of the N possible ones? We make progress on this problem for k = 1 and k = 2 and show that for N = k + 1, k ∈ {1, 2} at least k/k+1 of the total HD capacity is always approximately (i.e., up to a constant gap) achieved. Interestingly, and differently from the Full-Duplex (FD) case, the ratio in HD depends on N, and decreases as N increases. For all values of N and k for which we derive worst case fractions, we also show these to be approximately tight. This is accomplished by presenting N-relay Gaussian HD diamond networks for which the best k-relay subnetwork has an approximate HD capacity equal to the worst-case fraction of the total approximate HD capacity. Moreover, we provide additional comparisons between the performance of this simplification problem for HD and FD networks, which highlight their different natures.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;duplex (telecommunications);level of detail;relay;subnetwork;total hi def	Martina Cardone;Christina Fragouli;Daniela Tuninetti	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541767	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;telecommunications;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Theory	33.844590432314526	72.48004627867643	180238

9fe05dff443cec9335d617a821fa2ee2ac94da09	a degrees-of-freedom-achieving scheme for the temporally correlated mimo interference channel with delayed csit		A simple scheme is proposed to achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) of the temporally correlated two-user multiple-input-multiple-output interference channel with delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The delayed CSIT is exploited for temporal alignment at the transmitters and spatial zero-forcing of interference at the receivers. The transmitters estimate the current CSIT using perfect delayed CSIT. For most antenna configurations, the proposed scheme achieves the optimal DoF-region of this channel by precoding (resp. decoding) over a finite number of time slots at each transmitter (resp. receiver). This is an improvement over existing achievable methods, which require infinite channel extensions (hence, infinite decoding delay) and involve complicated encoding and decoding procedures.	channel state information;interference (communication);mimo;region-based memory management;transmitter	Mohsen Rezaee;Peter J.

a3e06ee523066cf09d63780136051c5022354d09	the capacity of degraded cognitive interference channel with unidirectional destination cooperation		Previous works established the capacity region for some special cases of discrete memoryless degraded cognitive interference channel (CIC) with unidirectional destination cooperation (UDC). In this letter, we characterize the capacity region of the general discrete memoryless degraded CIC-UDC. The obtained results imply that the capacity region is achieved by the Gel’fand-Pinsker coding at the cognitive transmitter, superposition coding at the primary transmitter and decode-andforward at the relay. Furthermore, using this general result and a novel converse analysis, we establish the capacity of the Gaussian degraded CIC-UDC, which had been open until this work.	hp utility data center;interference (communication);relay;transmitter	Mohammad Kazemi	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mathematics;transmitter;gaussian;converse;superposition principle;interference (wave propagation);cognition;communication channel;relay	Crypto	34.932102038571095	72.75237036129718	180629

However, using network coding usually incurs high computational and storage costs in the network devices and terminals. For example, some network coding schemes require the computational and/or storage capacities of an intermediate network node to increase linearly with the number of packets for transmission, making such schemes difficult to be implemented in a router-like device that has only constant computational and storage capacities. In this paper, we introduce batched sparse code (BATS code), which enables a digital fountain approach to resolve the above issue. BATS code is a coding scheme that consists of an outer code and inner code. The outer code is a matrix generation of a fountain code. It works with the inner code that comprises random linear coding at the intermediate network nodes. BATS codes preserve such desirable properties of fountain codes as ratelessness and low encoding/decoding complexity. The computational and storage capacities of the intermediate network nodes required for applying BATS codes are independent of the number of packets for transmission. Almost capacity-achieving BATS code schemes are devised for unicast networks and certain multicast networks. For general multicast networks, under different optimization criteria, guaranteed decoding rates for the destination nodes can be obtained.	concatenated error correction code;fountain code;linear code;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;multicast;network packet;neural coding;router (computing);routing;scheme;sparse matrix;telecommunications network;unicast	Shenghao Yang;Raymond W.

However, when source acquisition requires the block length to be small, collaboration between sensors can greatly reduce distortion. For a distributed acquisition network where sensors are allowed to “chat” using a side channel, we provide exact characterization of distortion performance and quantizer design in the high-resolution (low-distortion) regime using a framework called distributed functional scalar quantization (DFSQ). The key result is that chatting can dramatically improve performance even when the intersensor communication is at very low rate. We also solve the rate allocation problem when communication links have heterogeneous costs and provide examples to demonstrate that this theory predicts performance at practical communication rates.	block code;computation;data compression;distortion;emoticon;image resolution;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;quantization (signal processing);relevance;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;shannon (unit);side-channel attack;stochastic process	John Z.

She sends the signal beam to Bob, while retaining the idler. Bob imposes message modulation on the beam he receives from Alice, amplifies it, and sends it back to her. Alice then decodes Bob’s information by making a joint quantum measurement on the light she has retained and the light she has received from him. The basic performance analysis for this protocol—which demonstrates its immunity to passive eavesdropping, in which Eve can only listen to Alice and Bob’s transmissions—is reviewed, along with the results of its first proof-of-principle experiment. Further analysis is then presented, showing that secure data rates in excess of 1Gbps may be possible over 20-km-long fiber links with technology that is available or under development. Finally, an initial scheme for thwarting active eavesdropping, in which Eve injects her own light into Bob’s terminal, is proposed and analyzed.	alice and bob;eve;gigabit;man-in-the-middle attack;measurement in quantum mechanics;modulation;offset binary;quantum illumination;secure communication;signal beam;spontaneous order	Jeffrey H.

Using a checksum calculated with the help of a generator polynomial, CRC guarantees a low probability of undetected errors (residual error probability, Pre). The choice of an appropriate polynomial has significant impact on the quality of error detection. Since CRC itself is very efficient, it is obvious to embed safety-critical data protected by an additional CRC into the net data protected by the original CRC in order to increase the error detection of the safety-critical data. The paper introduces a method to determine the corresponding Pre by means of stochastic automata. Using the example of the fieldbus PROFIBUS-PA as embedding communication protocol, polynomials for the additional CRC were analyzed. As result, the impact of generator polynomials in the additional CRC on the Pre as well as the improvement of the error detection capabilities is shown.

We compare this to robustly-secret communication, in which each user must allow for other users to deviate unilaterally from an agreed-upon strategy to enable better overhearing, as long as that alternate strategy impairs neither the secrecy rate of its own link nor the reliability of any other communicating links. For a particular two-user binary expansion deterministic interference channel, we find and compare the semi-secret and robustly-secret capacity regions.	binary number;interference (communication);semiconductor industry;transmitter	Roy D.

In the context of sparse error correction, we perform numerical experiments that show that for a fixed number of measurements, errors of larger support can be corrected in the nonconvex case. We also provide a theoretical justification for why this should be so.	algorithm;basis pursuit;compressed sensing;error detection and correction;experiment;numerical analysis;sparse matrix	Rick Chartrand	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366823	signal reconstruction;mathematical optimization;basis pursuit;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;coding;compressed sensing;compression;measurement;statistics	Robotics	34.90415677103326	62.667329322092066	181198

In particular, if suitable encoders are employed, the use of decoding algorithm with manageable complexities is permitted. Maximum likelihood is an example of linear decoder. For a compound DMC, decoders that perform well without the channel’s knowledge are required in order to achieve capacity. Several such decoders have been studied in the literature. However, there is no such known decoder which is linear. Hence, the problem of finding linear decoders achieving capacity for compound DMC is addressed, and it is shown that under minor concessions, such decoders exist and can be constructed. This paper also develops a local geometric analysis, which allows in particular, to solve the above problem. By considering very noisy channels, the original problem is reduced, in the limit, to an inner product space problem, for which insightful solutions can be found. The local setting can then provide counterexamples to disproof claims, but also, it is shown how in this problem, results proven locally can be “lifted” to results proven globally.	approximation algorithm;computation;dynamic markov compression;encoder;geometric analysis;t-norm;utility functions on indivisible goods	Emmanuel Abbe;Lizhong Zheng	2008	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;inner product space;information theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;algorithm;statistics	ML	35.88653502377449	65.25597106711324	181311

da37ff04c8a8323ab54ce308dd47ddaa809c00a5	towards a general theory of source networks	source coding	A unified approach to multiterminal source coding problems not involving rate-distortion theory is presented. It is shown that, for determining file achievable rate region, attention may be restricted to source networks of a relatively simple structure. A product space characterizafion of the achievable rate region pinpoints the mathematical problem to be solved for getting a single letter characterization. The complexity of this problem depends on a structural condition, viz., the number of encoders of a certain kind in the source network. This approach yields all the known single-letter characterizations of achievable rate regions and a number of new ones for more complex networks. As a digression, for a class of source networks including that of Slepian and Wolf, exponential error bounds are derived which are attainable by universal codes. These bounds are tight in a neighborhood of the boundary of the achievable rate region.		Imre Csiszár;János Körner	1980	IEEE Trans.

The opponent is assumed to have access to Nc noisy copies of a genuine 2D-BC (noise being due to printing and scanning processes). A simple estimator of the 2D-BC based on copies averages is proposed, letting the opponent print a fake 2D-BC which aims at being declared as genuine by the system detector. Performance of the estimator in terms of error probability at the detector side is then derived with respect to Nc and compared with experimental results on real 2D-BC. It is shown that the opponent can produce a fake that successfully fools the detector with a reasonable number of genuine goods.	authentication;code;diffie–hellman key exchange;point of view (computer hardware company);printing	Cléo Baras;François Cayre	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		telecommunications;computer science;computer security;statistics	DB	30.88988252990273	66.84900591483643	181929

Given the total transmission bit budget, a joint source-channel coding problem is how to partition the input sequence and how to determine the coding rates of individual packets for minimum expected distortion when the sequence is sent over binary symmetric channel. Three methods are proposed to estimate the performance of a sequence when transmitted through the system, based on which we convert the joint source-channel coding problem into a shortest path problem in a weighted directed acyclic graph which can be solved by using dynamic programming. Simulation shows that the overall performance of the system can be improved by 10-30% compared with the performance of the fixed rate packetization scheme.	binary symmetric channel;channel capacity;convolution;directed acyclic graph;distortion;dynamic programming;forward error correction;markov chain;network packet;shortest path problem;simulation;vlc media player	Xiaohan Wang;Xiaolin Wu	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2005.1521531	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;convolutional code;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;psychological resilience;statistics	Robotics	38.38104744229638	63.795156907014764	182565

The agents interact to estimate their own states to a desired fidelity from their (sensor) measurements which are functions of both the local state and the states at the other agents. For a Gaussian state and measurement model, it is shown that the sum-rate achieved by a distributed protocol in which the agents broadcast to one another is a lower bound on that of a centralized protocol in which the agents broadcast as if to a virtual CEO converging only in the limit of a large number of agents. The sufficiency of encoding using local measurements is also proved for both protocols.	centralized computing;data compression;distributed computing;distributed source coding;local variable;multi-agent system;sensor;wave packet	Lalitha Sankar;H.

This gap, however, may not be acceptable for practical communication systems with multihop transmissions (e.g., a wireless backhaul operating at high frequencies).

In general, the optimization of the relay DF/QMF configuration is combinatorial. Nevertheless, we provide that a simple greedy algorithm finds an optimal configuration under some practically reasonable assumptions.

The goal of this paper is to investigate information-theoretic security even against active adversaries with complete control over the communication channel connecting the two parties who want to agree on a secret key. Several impossibility results are proved and some scenarios are characterized in which secret-key agreement secure against active adversaries is possible. In particular, when each of the parties, including the adversary, can observe a sequence of random variables that are correlated between the parties, the rate at which key agreement against active adversaries is possible is characterized completely: it is either 0 or equal to the rate achievable against passive adversaries, and the condition for distinguishing between the two cases is given.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;channel (communications);information theory;information-theoretic security;key (cryptography);key-agreement protocol;public-key cryptography;quantum cryptography	Ueli Maurer	1997		10.1007/3-540-69053-0_15	information-theoretic security;computer science;key-agreement protocol;mathematics;distributed computing;internet privacy;pre-shared key;key distribution;computer security;quantum cryptography	Crypto	33.14836326370604	68.26559473898782	183148

The proposed DoF achieving scheme ex ploits a particular combination of the space-time alignment protocol designed for fully outdated CSIT feedback channels (initially developed for the broadcast channel by Maddah-Ali et al, later extende d to the interference channel by Vaze et al. and Ghasemi et al.) together with the use of simple zero-forc ing (ZF) precoders. The essential ingredient lies in the quantization and feedback of the residual interf er nce left after the application of the initial imperfect ZF precoder.

11fcba900453d0f94a7648ef53da27647c000ef4	a new kind of selectors and their applications to conflict resolution in wireless multichannels networks		We investigate the benefits of using multiple channels of communications in wireless networks, under the full-duplex multi-packet reception model of communication. The main question we address is the following: Is a speedup linear in the number of channels achievable, for some interesting communication primitive? We provide a positive answer to this interrogative for the Information Exchange Problem, in which k arbitrary nodes have information they intend to share with the entire network. To achieve this goal, we devise and exploit a combinatorial structure that generalizes well known combinatorial tools widely used in the area of data-exchange in multiple access channels (i.e., strongly selective families, selectors, and related mathematical objects). For our new combinatorial structures we provide both existential results, based on the Lovasz Local Lemma, and efficient constructions, leveraging on properties of error correcting codes. We also prove non existential results, showing that our constructions are not too far from being optimal.

This problem is motivated by energy harvesting communications with wireless energy transfer, where an added goal is to deliver a minimum amount of energy to a receiver in addition to delivering secure data to another receiver. In this paper, we characterize the exact secrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and receiver-side power constraints. We first show that solving this problem is equivalent to solving the secrecy capacity of a wiretap channel with a double-sided correlation matrix constraint on the channel input. We show the converse by extending the channel enhancement technique to our case. We present two achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable scheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable scheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian codebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy transfer without sacrificing from the secure rate. This is the first instance of a channel model where either the use of a mean signal or use of channel prefixing via artificial noise is strictly necessary in the MIMO wiretap channel.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);codebook;interference (communication);mimo;maximum power transfer theorem;radio jamming;transmitter	Karim A.

This motivates a carefully chosen list of desired properties for upper and lower redundancies. The means to achieve these properties is to consider the maximum and minimum of a redundancy function, which is interesting in itself. The redundancy function is defined on the sphere of the Hilbert space and measures the concentration of frame vectors around each point. A complete characterization of functions on the sphere which coincide with a redundancy function for some frame is given. The upper and lower redundancies obtained from this function are shown to satisfy all of the intuitively desirable properties. In addition, the range of values they assume is characterized.	hilbert space;maxima and minima;redundancy (engineering)	Bernhard G. Bodmann;Peter G.

This suggests that for the scalar broadcast channel, the pre-log cannot exceed one. By contrast, in this note, we show that when the noises are anti-correlated and feedback is present, then a pre-log of two can be attained. In other words, in this special case, in the limit of high SNR, the scalar Gaussian broadcast channel turns into two parallel AWGN channels. Achievability is established via a coding strategy due to Schalkwijk, Kailath, and Ozarow.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);feedback;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio	Michele A.

However, if the involved relays independently choose which combinations of the messages to decode, there is no guarantee that the overall system of linear equations is solvable at the destination. In this article it is shown that, for a Gaussian fading channel model with two transmitters and two relays, always choosing the combination that maximizes the computation rate often leads to a case where the original messages cannot be recovered. It is further shown that by limiting the relays to select from carefully designed sets of equations, a solvable system can be guaranteed while maintaining high computation rates. The proposed method has a constant computational complexity and requires no information exchange between the relays.	channel (communications);computation;computational complexity theory;decision problem;information exchange;linear equation;relay;system of linear equations;transmitter	Amaro Barreal;Joonas Pääkkönen;David A.

37beeb6d6dadb04c753b683abdd9f784c058f7ac	secure detection: efficiency versus security		This paper studies binary hypothesis testing based on measurements from a set of sensors, a subset of which can be compromised by an attacker. The measurements from a compromised sensor can be manipulated arbitrarily by the adversary. The asymptotic exponential rate, with which the probability of error goes to zero, is adopted to indicate the detection performance of a detector. In practice, we expect the attack on sensors to be sporadic, and therefore the system may operate with all the sensors being benign for extended period of time. This motivates us to consider the trade-off between the detection performance of a detector, i.e., the probability of error, when the attacker is absent (defined as efficiency) and the worst-case detection performance when the attacker is present (defined as security). We first provide the fundamental limits of this trade-off, and then propose a detection strategy that achieves these limits. We then consider a special case, where there is no trade-off between security and efficiency. In other words, our detection strategy can achieve the maximal efficiency and the maximal security simultaneously. Two extensions of the secure hypothesis testing problem are also studied and fundamental limits and achievability results are provided: 1) a subset of sensors, namely “secure” sensors, are assumed to be equipped with better security countermeasures and hence are guaranteed to be benign; 2) detection performance with unknown number of compromised sensors. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results.	adversary (cryptography);best, worst and average case;heisenbug;maximal set;numerical method;sensor;time complexity	Xiaoqiang Ren;Jiaqi Yan;Yilin Mo	2017	CoRR		mathematics;mathematical optimization;statistical hypothesis testing;probability of error;real-time computing;adversary;special case;detector;exponential function;computer security;binary number;countermeasure	Security	30.49931846177564	68.50614044105632	185542

In the general case, colluders apply uniform linear averaging followed by additive colored Gaussian noise. For each user, the receiver computes the correlation between the attacked signal and a linear-transformed version of that user's fingerprint, and performs thresholding (focused detection). Assuming independent colluders with potentially unequal priors, we derive generic exact bit-error probability (BEP) expressions, together with tight bounds, for arbitrary FP codes. Then, we specialize our results to orthogonal, simplex and Gaussian codes in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise; under mean squared error distortion constraints on the embedder and the colluders, we analytically quantify the optimal detection rule, the resulting minimum BEP and its asymptotic behavior, the collusion resistance, and the error exponent for the aforementioned codes, and compare their performances. We show that the minimum BEP expressions for these codes obey the same functional form and that they can be ordered as simplex, orthogonal, and Gaussian in terms of increasing BEP.	a mathematical theory of communication;additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;channel (communications);clique (graph theory);code;code word;codebook;digital rights management;digital video fingerprinting;distortion;error exponent;error floor;fingerprint (computing);higher-order function;large-signal model;maxima and minima;mean squared error;multi-user;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;performance;sketch;theory;thresholding (image processing);user space;utility functions on indivisible goods;verification and validation	Ozgur Dalkilic;Ersen Ekrem;S.

It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field. The present note outlines a new approach to information theory which is aimed specifically at the analysis of certain communication problems in which there exist a number of information sources simultaneously in operation. A typical example is that of a simple communication channel with a feedback path from the receiving point to the transmitting point. The problem is to make use of the feedback information for improving forward transmission, and to determine the forward channel capacity when the best possible use is made of this feedback information. Another more general problem is that of a communication system consisting of a large number of transmitting and receiving points with some type of interconnection network between the various points. The problem here is to formulate the best systems design whereby, in some sense, the best overall use of the available facilities is made. While the analysis sketched here has not yet proceeded to the point or a complete solution of these problems, partial answers have been found and it is believed that a complete solution may be possible."""

Recently, nonadaptive group testing - where all the test pools must be decided on at the start - has been studied from an information theory point of view. Using techniques from channel coding, upper and lower bounds have been given on the number of tests required to accurately recover the defective set, even when the test outcomes can be noisy. In this paper, we give the first information-theoretic result on adaptive group testing - where the outcome of previous tests can influence the makeup of future tests. We show that adaptive testing does not help much, as the number of tests required obeys the same lower bound as nonadaptive testing. Our proof uses similar techniques to the proof that feedback does not improve channel capacity.	channel capacity;feedback;information theory	Matthew Aldridge	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283596	binary erasure channel;combinatorics;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;error exponent;channel capacity;algorithm;statistics	Theory	36.03148614962973	63.35555284816431	186487

The key steps are: The maxentropic stationary probability distribution on square configurations is considered. A set of linear equalities and inequalities is derived from this stationarity. The result is a concave program, which can be easily solved numerically.

First, we investigate the problem from a theoretical perspective, proposing lattice-coding instantiations of superposition block Markov encoding. Our encoding/decoding strategies recover the well-known decode-and-foward rates for the one-way relay channel and a previously-proven rate region for the two-way relay channel. Then, we construct practical, low-complexity implementations of these schemes using low-density lattice codes. Simulations show that our schemes achieve performance as close as 2.5 dB away from theoretical limits. Finally, we show that, due to features inherent to full-duplex relaying and practical codes, the gap to theoretical limits depends on the channel gains and transmit power of the relay relative to the source(s). We characterize this gap analytically, providing insight into the design of practical full-duplex relay systems.	code;computer simulation;decibel;duplex (telecommunications);markov chain;one-way function;relay channel;whole earth 'lectronic link	Nuwan S.

Nowadays most of the models for the land mobile satellite channel (LMSC) are based on Markov chains and rely on measurement data, rather than on pure theoretical considerations. A key problem lies in the determination of the model parameters out of the observed data. In this work we face the issue of state identification of the underlying Markov model whose model parameters are a priori unknown. This can be seen as a hiddem Markov model (HMM) problem. For finding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of such model parameters the Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm is adapted} to the context of channel modeling. Numerical results on test data sequences reveal the capabilities of the proposed algorithm. Results on real measurement data are finally presented.	baum–welch algorithm;esa;hidden markov model;msat;markov chain;numerical stability;r language;software transactional memory;state transition table;stochastic matrix;test data;welch's method	Balázs Matuz;Francisco Lázaro Blasco;Gianluigi Liva	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133807	simulation;speech recognition;computer science;maximum likelihood;markov process;markov model;hidden markov model;statistics	Robotics	24.91811781546684	73.92094453552144	187310

The WSN is tasked with the detection of an intruder transmitting an unknown signal over a fading channel. Existing distributed consensus-based fusion rules algorithms only ensure equal combining of local data and in the case of bandwidth-constrained WSNs, we show that their performance is poor and does not converge across the sensor nodes (SNs). Motivated by this fact, we propose a two-step distributed quantized fusion rule algorithm where in the first step the SNs collaborate with their neighbors through error-free, orthogonal channels (the SNs exchange quantized information matched to the channel capacity of each link). In the second step, local 1-bit decisions generated in the first step are shared among neighbors to yield a consensus. A binary hypothesis testing is performed at any arbitrary SN to optimally declare the global decision. Simulations show that our proposed quantized two-step distributed detection algorithm approaches the performance of the unquantized centralized (with a fusion center) detector and its power consumption is shown to be 50% less than the existing (unquantized) conventional algorithm.	1-bit architecture;centralized computing;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;channel capacity;computer simulation;consensus (computer science);converge;quantization (signal processing);transmitter	Edmond Nurellari;Desmond C.

We study different coding strategies in the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the decode- and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms of rate maximizing) for the decode-and- forward strategy. Since the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of the strategies on different routes.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;code word;heuristic (computer science);low-density parity-check code;parity bit;point-to-point protocol;polynomial;relay;routing;shortest path problem;theory;time complexity	Lawrence Ong;Mehul Motani	2007	2007 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292845	telecommunications;information theory;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	31.707096464691023	71.76784567254646	188615

This problem of secret communication and secret-key generation when two resources are available-correlated sources at Alice, Bob, and Eve, and a noisy broadcast channel from Alice to Bob and Eve which is independent of the sources is studied. The goal is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the rates of the secret message and secret key. An achievable solution and proof of its optimality for the parallel channels and sources case when each subchannel and source component satisfies a degradation order (either in favor of the legitimate receiver or the eavesdropper) is presented.

We show that the additional loss incurred in the worst case by any universal denoiser on a length- n sequence grows at least like Omega(ck/radicn) , where c is a constant depending on the channel parameters and the loss function. This shows that for fixed k the additional loss incurred by the Discrete Universal Denoiser (DUDE) is no larger than a constant multiplicative factor of the best possible. Furthermore, we compare universal denoisers to denoisers that are aware of the distribution of the transmitted noiseless sequence. We show that, even for this weaker target loss, for any universal denoiser there exists some distribution for the noiseless sequence corresponding to a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables whose optimum expected loss is lower than that incurred by the universal denoiser by Omega(1/radicn).	best, worst and average case;coefficient;loss function;noise reduction	Krishnamurthy Viswanathan;Erik Ordentlich	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.2011429	mathematical optimization;computer science;calculus;signal processing;noise reduction;mathematics;statistics	Theory	35.62987520114609	64.3529538530201	189104

The capacity of a noisy computation is defined and justified by companion coding theorems. Under some constraints on the encoding process, capacity is the upper bound of input rates allowing reliable computation, i.e. decodability of noisy outputs into expected outputs. A model of noisy computation of a perfect function f thanks to an unreliable device F is given together with a model of reliable computation based on input encoding and output decoding. A coding lemma (extending the Feinstein's theorem to noisy computations), a joint source-computation coding theorem and its converse are proved. They apply if the input source, the function f, the noisy device F and the cascade f−1F induce AMS and ergodic one-sided random processes.	algorithm;computation;ergodicity;stochastic process;turing machine;vhdl-ams	François Simon	2011	2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop	10.1109/ITW.2011.6089373	stochastic process;discrete mathematics;reliability theory;computer science;turing machine;noise measurement;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;computational model;encoding;statistics;source code	Theory	35.54447830516834	65.3249315741335	189421

Specifically, we assume the attacker can make a single guess after observing n independent executions of the system, throughout which the secret information is kept fixed. We show that the asymptotic behaviour of quantities (a) and (b) can be determined in a simple way from the channel matrix. Moreover, simple and tight bounds on them as functions of n show that the convergence is exponential. We also discuss feasible methods to evaluate the rate of convergence. Our results cover both the Bayesian case, where a prior probability distribution on the secrets is assumed known to the attacker, and the maximum-likelihood case, where the attacker does not know such distribution. In the Bayesian case, we identify the distributions that maximize the leakage. We consider both the min-entropy setting studied by Smith and the additive form recently proposed by Braun et al., and show the two forms do agree asymptotically. Next, we extend these results to a more sophisticated eavesdropping scenario, where the attacker can perform a (noisy) observation at each state of the computation and the systems are modelled as hidden Markov models.	information leakage;spectral leakage	Michele Boreale;Francesca Pampaloni;Michela Paolini	2015	Mathematical Structures in Computer Science	10.1017/S0960129513000613	probability distribution;econometrics;computer science;theoretical computer science;probability of error;mathematics;maximum likelihood;rate of convergence;information hiding;hidden markov model;statistics	Logic	31.518984945186137	68.1864813780462	189502

One of the most promising candidates for constructing such networks is to adapt and engineer specific types of bacteria that are capable of sensing, actuation, and above all, communication with each other. In this paper, we describe a new architecture for networks of bacteria to form a data collecting network, as in traditional sensor networks. The key to this architecture is the fact that the node in the network itself is a bacterial colony; as an individual bacterium (biological agent) is a tiny unreliable element with limited capabilities. We describe such a network under two different scenarios. We study the data gathering (sensing and multihop communication) scenario as in sensor networks followed by the consensus problem in a multinode network. We will explain as to how the bacteria in the colony collectively orchestrate their actions as a node to perform sensing and relaying tasks that would not be possible (at least reliably) by an individual bacterium. Each single bacterium in the colony forms a belief by sensing external parameter (e.g., a molecular signal from another node) from the medium and shares its belief with other bacteria in the colony. Then, after some interactions, all the bacteria in the colony form a common belief and act as a single node. We will model the reception process of each individual bacteria and will study its impact on the overall functionality of a node. We will present results on the reliability of the multihop communication for data gathering scenario as well as the speed of convergence in the consensus scenario.	british informatics olympiad;consensus (computer science);interaction;rate of convergence;telecommunications network	Arash Einolghozati;Mohsen Sardari;Ahmad Beirami;Faramarz Fekri	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM Workshops	10.1109/INFCOMW.2012.6193501	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics;data collection	Mobile	28.508043968184534	69.21510563178187	189697

This interpretation is a first step toward finding a stochastic mechanism for on-line channel input adaptation.	code word;codebook;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;online and offline;stochastic gradient descent	Sergey Tridenski;Ram Zamir	2015	2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2015.7133141	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	36.03691902765019	64.87416662599247	189728

Once the probability of the incorrect value of a bit becomes small compared to 1, therefore, the channel noise has no further effect on the variance of N. It continues to influence the average value of N, however, in accordance with the value of E in (2). If we assume that the asymptotic behavior governs the process from the time that the size of BI first exceeds 0.99, the experimental results also indicate that the asymptotic part of the process accounts for about $ of the total constraint length for P, = 10-15.

With quantization of these inner products, the encoding can be considered universal for sparse signals with known sparsity level. We analyze the operational rate-distortion performance of such source coding both with genie-aided knowledge of the sparsity pattern and maximum likelihood estimation of the sparsity pattern. We show that random measurements induce an additive logarithmic rate penalty, i.e., at high rates the performance with rate R + O(log R) and random measurements is equal to the performance with rate R and deterministic measurements matched to the source.	compressed sensing;data compression;distortion;genie;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Alyson K.

Generalizing the classical inner bounds shown by Marton and the recent quantum asymptotic version shown by Savov and Wilde, we obtain one-shot inner bounds in the quantum setting. Our bounds are stated in terms of hypothesis testing and one-shot max divergences. These results give a full justification of the claims of Savov and Wilde in the classical-quantum asymptotic iid setting; the techniques also yield similar bounds in the information spectrum setting. We obtain these results using a different analysis of the random codebook argument; our method yields a classical one-shot Marton bound with a common message and a classical one-shot mutual covering lemma based on rejection sampling.	codebook;quantum;rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing)	Jaikumar Radhakrishnan;Pranab Sen;Naqueeb Warsi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2531795	random variable;entropy;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;encoding;statistics	Theory	35.35204154186816	66.49388300333203	191358

Specifically, we model the sequential processing of qubits using a single server queue, and derive explicit expressions for the capacity of such a ‘queue-channel.’ We also demonstrate a sweet-spot phenomenon with respect to the arrival rate to the queue, i.e., we show that there exists a value of the arrival rate of the qubits at which the rate of information transmission (in bits/sec) through the queue-channel is maximized. Next, we consider a setting where the average rate of processing qubits is fixed, and show that the capacity of the queue-channel is maximized when the processing time is deterministic. We also discuss design implications of these results on quantum information processing systems.	information processing;physical information;quantum decoherence;quantum information science;quantum state;qubit;queueing theory;server (computing)	Avhishek Chatterjee;Krishna P.

In particular, the transport capacity under a multiple unicast traffic pattern is studied for a network of nodes placed on a hexagonal lattice. Different ways of handling broadcast and superposition lead to various communication models. In particular we consider models arising from the use of compute-and-forward/physical layer network coding. If neither broadcast nor superposition is exploited, the normalized transport capacity was previously shown to be between 1/3 and 2/5. In this work it is shown that exploiting either broadcast or superposition increases the capacity to at least 3/7, hence providing a strict improvement.	interference (communication);lattice model (physics);lattice network;linear network coding;quantum superposition;unicast	Jasper Goseling;Jos H.

5a88892142021201d867bcd5731f3bcc54b2c341	unified theory of source coding: part i -- two terminal problems	information theory;source code;first order	Since the publication of Shannon’s theory of one terminal source coding, a number of interesting extensions have been derived by researchers such as Slepian-Wolf, Wyner, Ahlswede-Körner, Wyner-Ziv and Berger-Yeung. Specifically, the achievable rate or rate-distortion region has been described by a first order information-theoretic functional of the source statistics in each of the above cases. At the same time several problems have also remained unsolved. Notable two terminal examples include the joint distortion problem, where both sources are reconstructed under a combined distortion criterion, as well as the partial side information problem, where one source is reconstructed under a distortion criterion using information about the other (side information) available at a certain rate (partially). In this paper we solve both of these open problems. Specifically, we give an infinite order description of the achievable ratedistortion region in each case. In our analysis we set the above problems in a general framework and formulate a unified methodology that solves not only the problems at hand but any two terminal problem with noncooperative encoding. The key to such unification is held by a fundamental source coding principle which we derive by extending the typicality arguments of Shannon and Wyner-Ziv. Finally, we demonstrate the expansive scope of our technique by re-deriving known coding theorems. We shall observe that our infinite order descriptions simplify to the expected first order in the known special cases.	convex function;data compression;distortion;distributed source coding;encoder;information theory;lz77 and lz78;lossless compression;markov chain;maxima and minima;multiseat configuration;norm (social);shannon (unit);slepian–wolf coding;unification (computer science);unified framework;z1 (computer)	Soumya Jana	2005	CoRR			Theory	36.37728165310889	65.7288107680747	192015

While the asymptotical fundamental limits of the problem-the minimal compression rate and the error exponent-were found in a previous work, in this paper, we focus on the nonasymptotic domain and on practical, implementable schemes. We first present a finite blocklength achievability bound based on shape-gain quantization: the gain (amplitude) of the vector is compressed via scalar quantization, and the shape (the projection on the unit sphere) is quantized using a spherical code. The results are numerically evaluated, and they converge to the asymptotic values, as predicted by the error exponent. We then give a nonasymptotic lower bound on the performance of any compression scheme, and compare to the upper (achievability) bound. For a practical implementation of such a scheme, we use wrapped spherical codes, studied by Hamkins and Zeger, and use the Leech lattice as an example for an underlying lattice. As a side result, we obtain a bound on the covering angle of any wrapped spherical code, as a function of the covering radius of the underlying lattice.	asymptote;compression;converge;error exponent;euclidean distance;mean squared error;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing);spherical code	Fabian Steiner;Steffen Dempfle;Amir Ingber;Tsachy Weissman	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2535172	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;shape;lattice;euclidean distance;reliability;mathematics;geometry	Crypto	37.35385736727751	63.75176594115056	192404

This study aims to study the speed-dependent packet error rate (PER) of wireless sensor radios on rotating mechanical structures. A series of rotating IEEE 802.15.4 sensor radio transmission experiments and vector network analyzer measurements have been conducted to derive and validate a predictive PER model for a fast rotating sensor radio channel based on channel impulse response measurements. The proposed predictive PER model, including power attenuation, bit error rate (BER) and PER sub-models, captures the channel property of rotating sensors based on the received signal strength and the radio receiving sensitivity. The PER model has accurately predicted the PER profile of sensors on a rotating machine tool spindle as well as a rotating plate of a prototype rotation system. The analysis provides an in-depth understanding of how multipath propagation causes the fast power variation and the resulting speed-dependent PER for wireless sensors on rotating mechanical structures.	algorithm;bit error rate;experiment;hard disk drive;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;network packet;packet analyzer;photographic plate;prototype;rotation system;sensor;sensor node;software propagation;stationary process;transmitter;x.690	Lei Tang;Kuang-Ching Wang;Yong Huang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2012.2209661	electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;statistics;computer network	Mobile	25.9728478455571	73.86355217442728	192471

We show that a similar result holds for the timing channel with feedback. We also show that if the server jams communication by adding an arbitrary amount of time to the nominal service time, then the rate 1 1 2 ( 1 + 2) nats per second is achievable with random codes, where the nominal service times are stationary and ergodic with mean 1 1 seconds, and the arithmetic mean of the delays added by the server does not exceed 1 2 seconds. This is a model of an arbitrarily varying channel where the current delay and the current input can affect future outputs. We also show the counterpart of these results for single-server discrete-time queues.	arbitrarily varying channel;code;decoding methods;ergodicity;server (computing);stationary process;time complexity;timing channel	Rajesh Sundaresan;Sergio Verdú	2000	IEEE Trans.

The first part considers the archetypical multiterminal source coding problem with logarithmic loss distortion constraints. A single-letter description of the achievable rate distortion region is given for finite-alphabet sources. In the course of doing so, the rate distortion region for the m-encoder CEO problem is also characterized. Several applications and examples are given, and a variety of related problems are discussed.The second part of this dissertation considers the combinatorial problem of Coded Cooperative Data Exchange. In this problem, data which is originally distributed in a network is exchanged among nodes until universal recovery is achieved (i.e., all terminals recover all data initially present in the network). This dissertation characterizes the minimum number of exchanges which must take place in order to permit universal recovery. Explicit algorithms and tight concentration results are given for several special cases of interest.Finally, three new lemmas are provided, each of which is interesting in its own right. Applications to multiterminal information theory are discussed.		Thomas A.

For both bandwidth expansion and compression regimes, novel hybrid digital/analog (HDA) coding schemes are proposed. With appropriate choice of parameters, our schemes are shown to specialize to separate source–channel coding studied by Gao and Tuncel, and is, therefore, superior to it in both bandwidth regimes. Our scheme for bandwidth expansion also outperforms the HDA coding scheme of Behroozi et al. On the other hand, if a proposed conjecture (supported by numerical observations) is indeed true, the same superiority follows for the bandwidth compression regime as well. Finally, when the bandwidth expansion/compression ratio approaches 1, both of our schemes become optimal as their performance approaches that of the bandwidth-matched scheme of Tian et al.	bandwidth expansion;bivariate data;channel capacity;forward error correction;hd radio;lossy compression;numerical analysis	Erman K&#x00F6;ken;Ertem Tuncel	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2698031	lossy compression;electronic engineering;bandwidth expansion;control theory;shannon–hartley theorem;distortion;bandwidth compression;context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding;bandwidth (signal processing);mathematics;communication channel	Theory	37.360385325001246	66.49002951610814	194365

Specifically, an efficient prediction procedure based on the incremental parsing procedure of the Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithm is shown to achieve asymptotically the FS predictability.

In this paper, we will first present the achievable rate region for this broadcasting scenario, and then extend the result to the case with retransmissions. With the proposed nonlinear network coding strategy, the achievable rate region can be achieved without requiring the exact knowledge of a priori information available at the receiver nodes. The broadcasting node simply performs retransmissions with independent codebooks until every receiver node has received the whole set of messages. Through the analysis of network throughput, we will show that each receiver node is able to effectively accumulate mutual information over the multiple transmissions thus achieving higher overall throughput than the conventional random linear network coding strategy.	code word;codebook;linear network coding;mutual information;nonlinear system;retransmission (data networks);throughput	Qiang Li;See Ho Ting;Chin Keong Ho	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205268	high-throughput screening;throughput;linear network coding;channel code;telecommunications;nonlinear system;computer science;wireless network;mathematics;distributed computing;mutual information;broadcasting;encoding;statistics;computer network	Arch	33.26383952837086	73.60579066814616	195588

For most purposes such a channel can be abstracted at the data link layer as a non-stationary binary symmetric channel transitioning randomly among a set of states { Sj), j = 0, ..., J I . Let qj denote the bit error probability in state j. The transmissions on the channel follow a familiar pattern of concatenated coding 121. Specifically the transmitter uses an (n, k) extended ReedSolomon (R-S) code CO with code words consisting of n=2b-1 symbols of b bits each, for some integer b. The symbols are elements belonging to the Galois field of 2b elements, and can be represented as b-bit vectors. There are k information symbols and n-k parity symbols in a code word in Co. An R-S decoder can correct up to t = n-k corrupted symbols if it has access to “side information” indicating whether each individual b-bit symbol has been received in error or not. One method for obtaining such side information consists of structuring the b-bit symbols to be error detecting code words in themselves. As an example, with b=8, we can have a (255,k) R-S code as an “inner” code where each 8-bit symbol is an (8,7) single-parity code, an (8,4) Hamming single-error-correcting/double-errordetecting code, or some such other code. The degree of reliability in the side information generated by each such “outer” code depends on its error-detecting capability. If we add an additional overall parity byte to the above code, we get an extended (n+l, k) R-S code.	8-bit;binary symmetric channel;bit array;bit error rate;byte;code word;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error detection and correction;hamming code;parity bit;randomness;sensor;stationary process;terrestrial television;transmitter	George Thomas	2000		10.1109/WCNC.2000.904827	communications protocol;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;probability of error;error exponent;fading;statistics	Theory	38.87752294059938	64.29731457650686	196156
eb4aa7b6a1790c414cfaed014e0e73a6091ecc31	improved remote estimation over a capacity-limited and lossy channel		This letter considers the problem of remotely estimating the state of a scalar dynamic system over a wireless channel that is capacity-limited and lossy. In this problem, the wireless channel suffers from quantization noise and packet loss while the data for remote estimation are transferred from the transmitter to the receiver; these phenomena degrade remote estimation of the system state. To determine the transmission strategy under these phenomena, we propose the remote estimation that is designed to minimize the estimate error variance (EEV) between the real state and the remote estimate of one. To achieve this goal, we design the linear encoder and the corresponding quantizer. Finally, we construct remote estimator recursions for the determined linear encoder and quantizer. In simulations, the proposed remote estimator is shown to achieve lower averaged time-tracking EEV than the existing scheme.	dynamical system;encoder;lossy compression;network packet;quantization (signal processing);recursion;simulation;transmitter	Jong-Hyeok Park;Soohee Han	2017	IEEE Control Systems Letters	10.1109/LCSYS.2017.2717865	lossy compression;quantization (signal processing);packet loss;estimator;wireless;transmitter;linear encoder;electronic engineering;communication channel;computer science	Mobile	37.8083564282029	67.39944839241596	196185

We illustrate the capacity region calculation with the example of the collective phase-flip channel which admits a single-letter characterization. On the way, we provide a first-principles proof of the EA coding theorem based on a packing argument. We observe that the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland theorem may be obtained from a modification of our EA protocol. We remark on the existence of a family hierarchy of protocols for multiparty scenarios with a single receiver, in analogy to the two-party case. In this way, we relate several previous results regarding QMACs.	coding theory;entanglement-assisted classical capacity;quantum entanglement;set packing	Min-Hsiu Hsieh;Igor Devetak;Andreas J.

We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem based on the maximization of the cut-off rate. The method is applied to a mono-bit transceiver MIMO system, and it is shown that the capacity can be approached within tenths of a dB by employing standard binary codes while avoiding the use of distribution shapers.	binary code;channel state information;dynamic markov compression;expectation–maximization algorithm;linear programming relaxation;mimo;norm (social);quantum fluctuation;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver;transmitter	Amine Mezghani;Michel T.

We evaluate the rate-distortion function for an independent identically distributed gamma source with respect to the absolute-log distortion measure. The logarithmic transformation reduces this rate-distortion problem to that under the absolute distortion measure. Extending the explicit evaluation of the rate-distortion function for the Gaussian sources, we obtain the parametric form of the rate-distortion function. We show that the optimal distribution of reconstruction consists of a continuous component enclosed by left and right discrete components, and the left discrete component vanishes when the acceptable distortion is small. We further extend the result for a wider class of source distributions.	distortion;electronic component;information source;key stretching;rate–distortion theory;shannon (unit)	Kazuho Watanabe;Shiro Ikeda	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2602100	database index;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;amplitude distortion;distortion;rate–distortion theory;telecommunications;computer science;speech;mathematics;phase distortion;rate–distortion optimization;statistics	Theory	35.74547103141118	64.1290817842772	196977

Our main result is a capacity theorem that gives a 3-D achievable rate region. Points in the region are rate triples, consisting of the classical communication rate, the quantum communication rate, and the entanglement consumption rate of a particular coding scheme. The crucial protocol in achieving the boundary points of the capacity region is a protocol that we name the classically enhanced father (CEF) protocol. The CEF protocol is more general than other protocols in the family tree of quantum Shannon theoretic protocols, in the sense that several previously known quantum protocols are now child protocols of it. The CEF protocol also shows an improvement over a timesharing strategy for the case of a qubit dephasing channel-this result justifies the need for simultaneous coding of classical and quantum information over an EAQ channel. Our capacity theorem is of a multiletter nature (requiring a limit over many uses of the channel), but it reduces to a single-letter characterization for at least three channels: the completely depolarizing channel, the quantum erasure channel, and the qubit dephasing channel.	binary erasure channel;channel capacity;chromium embedded framework;dephasing;family tree;quantum channel;quantum depolarizing channel;quantum entanglement;quantum eraser experiment;quantum information science;qubit;shannon (unit);theory;time-sharing;transmitter	Min-Hsiu Hsieh;Mark M.

9a579fa99e172a2ab7aa168d4b33be09a6b2b1db	performance analysis of integrated wireless sensor and multibeam satellite networks under terrestrial interference	integrated wireless sensor and multibeam satellite networks;haar approximation;optimal capacity;minimum mean square error;terrestrial interference;rician fading	This paper investigates the performance of integrated wireless sensor and multibeam satellite networks (IWSMSNs) under terrestrial interference. The IWSMSNs constitute sensor nodes (SNs), satellite sinks (SSs), multibeam satellite and remote monitoring hosts (RMHs). The multibeam satellite covers multiple beams and multiple SSs in each beam. The SSs can be directly used as SNs to transmit sensing data to RMHs via the satellite, and they can also be used to collect the sensing data from other SNs to transmit to the RMHs. We propose the hybrid one-dimensional (1D) and 2D beam models including the equivalent intra-beam interference factor β from terrestrial communication networks (TCNs) and the equivalent inter-beam interference factor α from adjacent beams. The terrestrial interference is possibly due to the signals from the TCNs or the signals of sinks being transmitted to other satellite networks. The closed-form approximations of capacity per beam are derived for the return link of IWSMSNs under terrestrial interference by using the Haar approximations where the IWSMSNs experience the Rician fading channel. The optimal joint decoding capacity can be considered as the upper bound where all of the SSs' signals can be jointly decoded by a super-receiver on board the multibeam satellite or a gateway station that knows all of the code books. While the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) capacity is where all of the signals of SSs are decoded singularly by a multibeam satellite or a gateway station. The simulations show that the optimal capacities are obviously higher than the MMSE capacities under the same conditions, while the capacities are lowered by Rician fading and converge as the Rician factor increases. α and β jointly affect the performance of hybrid 1D and 2D beam models, and the number of SSs also contributes different effects on the optimal capacity and MMSE capacity of the IWSMSNs.	approximation;arabic numeral 0;book;code;communications satellite;computer communication networks;computer simulation;converge;decoding methods;fetal monitoring;haar wavelet;interference (communication);mast radiator;mean squared error;mini-mental state examination;normal statistical distribution;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;return channel;satellite communications;sensor;telecommunications network;terrestrial television;utility functions on indivisible goods;disease transmission;hydroquinone 20 mg/ml topical lotion [rejuvaderm fading]	Hongjun Li;Hao Yin;Xiangwu Gong;Feihong Dong;Baoquan Ren;Yuanzhi He;Jingchao Wang	2016		10.3390/s16101711	minimum mean square error;electronic engineering;telecommunications;rician fading;statistics;remote sensing	Mobile	37.77683905354874	71.71393333372131	197342

A new concatenated coding scheme, comprising of an inner code of fixed block-length and an outer code of arbitrarily large block-length, is proposed. Its information theoretic performance is analyzed to derive a new set of sufficient conditions. An example is identified to demonstrate that the proposed coding technique can strictly outperform the current known best, which is due to Cover El Gamal and Salehi [1]. Our findings are based on Dueck’s ingenious coding technique proposed for the particular example studied in [2].	channel capacity;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;forward error correction;information theory;transmitter	Arun Padakandla	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	ML	35.659252627468994	67.56191057085343	197651

At each slot, each user transmits (is active) with a certain probability, independently of other users, and is heard by all base stations within the distance r. Both the users and base stations are placed uniformly at random over the (unit) area. We first consider a non-cooperative decoding where base stations work in isolation, but a user is decoded as soon as one of its nearby base stations reads a clean signal from it. We find the decoding probability and quantify the gains introduced by multiple base stations. Specifically, the peak throughput increases linearly with the number of base stations m and is roughly m=4 larger than the throughput of a single-base station that uses standard slotted Aloha. Next, we propose a cooperative decoding, where the mutually close base stations inform each other whenever they decode a user inside their coverage overlap. At each base station, the messages received from the nearby stations help resolve collisions by the interference cancellation mechanism. Building from our exact formulas for the non-cooperative case, we provide a heuristic formula for the cooperative decoding probability that reflects well the actual performance. Finally, we demonstrate by simulation significant gains of cooperation with respect to the non-cooperative decoding.	cooperative mimo;heuristic;interference (communication);maximal set;network packet;simulation;throughput	Dragana Bajovic;Dusan Jakovetic;Dejan Vukobratovic;Vladimir S.

Unfortunately, the implemented schemes are often operated in a regime which excludes unconditional security. We provide a thorough investigation of security issues for practical quantum key distribution, taking into account channel losses, a realistic detection process, and modifications of the “qubits” sent from the sender to the receiver. We first show that even quantum key distribution with perfect qubits might not be achievable over long distances when fixed channel losses and fixed dark count errors are taken into account. Then we show that existing experimental schemes (based on weak pulses) currently do not offer unconditional security for the reported distances and signal strength. Finally we show that parametric downconversion offers enhanced performance compared to its weak coherent pulse counterpart.	coherence (physics);entanglement distillation;eve;experiment;fock state;purification of quantum state;quantum cryptography;quantum entanglement;quantum key distribution;qubit;secure transmission	Gilles Brassard;Norbert Lütkenhaus;Tal Mor;Barry C.

Under the assumption that the instantaneous fading state informa tion is available at all nodes, the maximum sum-rate and the optimal user and relay power allocations (p olicies) are developed for a decode-andforward (DF) relay. With the observation that a DF relay resu lts in two multiaccess channels, one at the relay and the other at the destination, a single known lem ma on the sum-rate of two intersecting polymatroids is used to determine the DF sum-rate and the opt imal user and relay policies. The lemma also enables a broad topological classification of fading MA RCs into one of three types. The first type is the set ofpartially clusteredMARCs where a user is clustered either with the relay or with t he destination such that the users waterfill on their bottle-ne ck links to the distant receiver. The second type is the set of clusteredMARCs where all users are either proximal to the relay or to th e destination such that opportunistic multiuser scheduling to one of the r eceivers is optimal. The third type consists of arbitrarily clusteredMARCs which are a combination of the first two types, and for th is type it is L. Sankar and H. V.

Let e isin {0, 1}n be an error vector. A codeword X isin C is said to be disturbed by the error e if the closest codeword to X oplus e is no longer X. Let Ae be the subset of codewords in C that are disturbed by e. In this work we study the size of Ae in random codes C (i.e. codes in which each codeword Xi is chosen uniformly and independently at random from {0, 1}n). Using recent results of Vu [random structures and algorithms 20(3)] on the concentration of non-Lipschitz functions, we show that |Ae| is strongly concentrated for a wide range of values of N and parepar. We apply this result in the study of communication channels we refer to as oblivious. Roughly speaking, a channel W(y|x) is said to be oblivious if the error distribution imposed by the channel is independent of the transmitted codeword x. For example, the well studied binary symmetric channel is an oblivious channel. In this work, we define oblivious and partially oblivious channels and present lower bounds on their capacity.

A multisource, multirelay coding scheme is developed. In this scheme, each source's information is sent to its destination nodes via a multirelay route, with the multiple multirelay routes operating concurrently even when they intersect with each other, in the same spirit as code-division multiple access (CDMA). It is found that in the generalization to multiple sources, backward decoding achieves higher rates than sliding-window decoding. The routing structure where a joint backward decoding can be performed is characterized. The achievable rate region is found to combine aspects of both multiple relay and multiple access. Potential applications of this coding scheme to sensor networks are discussed. In particular, the exact capacity for the data downloading problem in sensor networks, where there are multiple sensor sources and one sink or collector node, is established for certain geometries when there is phase fading that is unknown to the transmitter.	download;multicast;relay;routing;transmitter	Liang-Liang Xie;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2007	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.904783	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.36793880715735	72.79943315477543	198622
d34b789bafc9e5ddb7cdd17561f2915286bd307f	bounds on the capacity of memoryless simplified fiber-optical channel models		A number of simplified models have been proposed for the fiber-optical channel and have been extensively used in the literature. Although these models are mainly developed for the low-power regime, they are used at moderate or high powers as well. It remains unclear to what extend the capacity of these models is affected by the simplifying assumptions under which they are derived. In this paper, the capacity of three memoryless channel models, which are obtained applying different simplifying assumptions to the same physical fiber-optical channel, is investigated. First, the capacity of a memoryless model that is obtained through a perturbation method is bounded tightly and its capacity pre-log is proven to be 3. Second, a channel model based on the logarithmic perturbation method is considered. The capacity is proven to be log(1 + SNR), where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. This implies that the capacity pre-log is one. Third, a memoryless nonlinear Schrödinger channel is studied. The capacity pre-log of this model is known to be 1/2.

It is shown that statistical dependence between the noise in a network's component channels is helpful for communication. In particular, the capacity region of a network whose component channels exhibit dependent noise is a superset of the capacity region of a network built from the same component channels when the noise in those channels is independent. It is also shown that delay has no impact on capacity. That is, the capacity of a network of memoryless channels is unchanged by the addition of finite delays anywhere in the network. Both results are proven for all possible networks of memoryless point-to-point and multi-terminal channels under multiple multicast connections. All other connection types (e.g., single unicast, multiple unicast, single multicast, and mixed unicast and multicast connections) are special cases of the multiple multicast problem, and are therefore included in the given results. The results also generalize from reliable communication of independent sources to lossy or lossy description of possibly dependent sources (i.e., joint source-channel coding) across the same network.	channel capacity;dependent source;fibre channel point-to-point;forward error correction;lossy compression;multicast;unicast	Michelle Effros	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214429	telecommunications;point-to-point;computer science;noise;probability of error;wireless network;encoding;statistics;computer network	Metrics	35.84405733740271	68.05879238036853	199694

Such a code minimizes P n i=1 wili among all pre x codes, where wi is the weight of ai and li is the number of bits used to encode ai. For data communication purposes, the initial parsing required by the static Hu man algorithm represents a big disadvantage. That happens because the data must be transmitted on-line. As soon as the symbol arrives to the transmitter, it must be encoded and transmitted to the receptor. For these situations, adaptive Hu man codes have been largely used. This method determines the mapping from symbol alphabets to codewords based upon a running estimate of the alphabet symbol weights. The code is adaptive, just changing to remain optimal for the current estimates. Two methods are presented in the literature for implementing dynamic Hu man coding. The rst one is the FGK algorithm [1] and the second one is the algorithm [2]. In [2], Vitter proved that the total number of bits Dt transmitted by the FGK algorithm for a message with t symbols is bounded below by St n + 1, where St is the number of bits required by the static Hu man method and bounded above by 2St+ t 4n+2. Furthermore, he conjectured that Dt is bounded above by St+O(t). We present an amortized analysis to prove this conjecture by showing that Dt St+ 2t 2k dlogmin(k+1; n)e, where k is the number of distinct symbols in the message [3]. We also present an example where Dt = St+2t 2k 3b(t k)=kc dlog(k+1)e, showing that the proposed bound is asymptotically tight. These results explain the good performance of FGK observed by some authors through practical experiments.	adaptive huffman coding;algorithm;amortized analysis;code word;encode;experiment;holographic principle;online and offline;parsing;transmitter	Ruy Luiz Milidiú;Eduardo Sany Laber;Artur Alves Pessoa	1999		10.1109/DCC.1999.785696	prefix code;algorithm design;transmitter;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics;huffman coding	Theory	38.05508268466256	61.488859233408824	199809
