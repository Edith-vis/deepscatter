In this paper, specifying the single secondary user (SU) with multiple primary user (PU) case, a novel power allocation scheme is developed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) – based cognitive radio networks designed to maximize the capacity of the SU while limiting the interference to the PUs. First, the mutual interference between the SU and the PUs is comprehensively formulated as the restrictions on the SU’s transmission power. Secondly, the power allocation problem is analyzed and formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is concluded to a peak-power constrained water-filling formulation. Finally, a novel low-complexity water-filling algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem and the optimal power allocation result is achieved. In a simplified scenario, numerical results are exhibited to confirm the efficiency of the proposed water-filling algorithm, and the influence of the mutual interference on the power allocation and the system capacity is further illustrated. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The system is formulated as a non-cooperative game. Based on the measured interference powers, the users maximize their own throughput by iteratively adjusting their power allocations. The Nash equilibrium in this game is a fixed point of such iterative algorithm. Both synchronous and asynchronous power update are considered. Some sufficient conditions under which the algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium are derived.	algorithm;channel use;data rate units;fixed point (mathematics);interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;nash equilibrium;statistical interference;throughput	Kenneth W.

The proposed power control algorithm differs from similar approaches in the literature in the sense that channel state information is not required in the power update. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated both analytically and numerically under a setup with non-ideal communication links. Simulation results demonstrate that optimum power allocation with respect to the QoS requirements of users is achieved when using the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;channel state information;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link	Kazım Şenel;Mehmet Akar	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963713	quality of service;power control;computer science;channel state information;heterogeneous network;algorithm design;small cell;real-time computing;signal-to-noise ratio	Robotics	28.79588418320386	91.72058796330992	179432

Although these schemes are proven effective in various real-life applications, they are inapplicable to deal with channels with matrix variables subjected to certain constraints. In this work, we present a new framework to estimate the capacity region of Gaussian multiple access channels with matrix inputs and outputs under weighted total power constraints. We propose an optimization model to address this issue and prove its concavity. By introducing an I-chain rule for matrix differentiation, the gradient of the objective function involving matrix variables can be obtained. An algorithm, named normalized projected gradient method (NPGM) is developed to find the global optimal solution for the proposed model. The convergence of NPGM is established by utilizing projection and normalization operators. Simulation results provide an interesting insight that NPGM can manage the existent situations within an unified framework, and provide a novel universal technical solution to optimize the capacity region under weighted total power constraints.

Recently developed methods are either unable to locate the global optimal solutions or prohibitively complex for practical applications. This paper exploits the d.c. (difference of two convex functions/sets) structure of either the objective function or constraint of the these global optimization problems to develop efficient iterative algorithms with very low complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the developed algorithms are able to locate the global optimal solutions by only a few iterations and they are superior to the previously-proposed methods in both performance and computation complexity.	computation;computational complexity theory;convex function;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;global optimization;interference (communication);iteration;mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem;numerical method;optimization problem;throughput;weight function	Ha Hoang Kha;Hoang Duong Tuan;Ha H.

2002eeb21f2ee28fad885c6e544154f778bba246	equivalent convex optimisation approach for green cognitive radio-based cooperative networks		Ensuring total rate maximisation whilst keeping Greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) at a minimum in green cooperative cognitive radio networks is key to achieving maximum network quality. This study employs the multi-objective lexicographic algorithm to a proposed multi-objective optimisation problem scheme to deal with these conflicting objectives through two consecutive steps. The challenge posed by maximum throughput – a complex non-convex optimisation problem – is first resolved through a mathematical manipulation resulting in a fractional programming model which is then converted to its simplified convex programming equivalent by applying the Charnes–Cooper transformation. Next, the GHGE minimisation issue is tackled effectively by applying a convex programming. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach offers superior performance compared to well-known schemes in terms of throughput gain and emission quality.	cognitive radio;convex optimization;mathematical optimization	Mohadeseh Soleimanpour;Shima Esmaeili;Siamak Talebi	2018	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2017.0870	real-time computing;mathematics;throughput;regular polygon;cognitive radio;mathematical optimization;lexicographical order;fractional programming;convex optimization;minimisation (psychology)	ML	34.50392316658792	92.11047961825676	179926
cb65e71471de6d653b3a3cdca5e1f5a820497a67	novel user scheduling algorithms for carrier aggregation system in heterogeneous network		In this paper, the carrier aggregation (CA) is applied to Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) consisting of a macro base station (MBS) and low-power pico base stations (PBSs). The PBSs are distributed in the outer space of the disk centered at the MBS and the closed-form solution of the radius of the disk is analyzed. In the CA based HetNet, firstly, a practical user association scheme is proposed to classify the users into macrocell user (MUs) and pico-cell users (PUs). Secondly, a PU-centric cooperative transmission strategy is proposed to increase the data rate of PUs. Then, in order to eliminate the cross-tier interference in HetNet, the MUs and PUs schedule different component carriers (CCs) according to different algorithms. For the MUs, an improved simulated annealing (SA) scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the sum rate of the MUs. Compared with the existing SA, the inner loop of the proposed SA is redesigned. Consequently, the best value can be obtained more quickly. For PUs, a location information based low-complexity maximize minimum distance (MMD) algorithm is proposed to reduce the interference from PBSs to PUs as much as possible. Overall, an integrated scheme is proposed to improve the performance. At last, numerical results demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes.	algorithm;data rate units;ibm systems network architecture;inner loop;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;mikumikudance;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;one-class classification;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulated annealing	Tiejun Lv;Chenchen Liu;Hui Gao	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925894	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;operating system;computer network	Mobile	28.25491238203511	90.93400708477726	180003

The goal is to support each user with a certain signal-to-interference level at the mobile. Several iterative algorithms have recently been proposed in the literature to solve this non-linear optimization problem. Obviously, no solution exists if the requirements are too demanding. This explains situations where the algorithms do not converge. On the other hand, the observation of convergence is only a necessary condition for the existence of a solution. We investigate the analytical structure of the problem and formulate a unifying framework. In particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition which can be used to judge whether or not a solution can be considered as valid. The results give new insights and may prove useful for the design of new fast convergent algorithms.	beamforming;telecommunications link	Martin Schubert;Holger Boche	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965190	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;iterative method	Theory	37.10407566317046	91.9509835158933	181089

Based on the game-theoretic concepts of coalition formation and bargaining, this scheduler follows a hybrid approach to allocate subcarriers and to satisfy the minimum rate requirement of the wireless users. In the first part of the allocation process, a greedy approach is used to provide users minimum data rate requirements. Then, in the game-theoretic part of the process, the remaining resources are split in a fair manner between the users by forming dynamically sized coalitions and by allowing users to bargain with each other, using the Nash bargaining solution. The novelty of this approach lies in the fact that it allows the distributed, partly-cooperative provision of QoS in a multiuser wireless channel. This new scheduler is compared against the proportional fair and greedy schedulers and the simulation results indicate that the proposed scheduler offers better QoS outage performance than others. It also offers fairness and sum rate that are comparable to the PF scheduler, while the comparison with the Greedy scheduler indicates significantly better fairness, but lower sum rate.	nash equilibrium;quality of service	Stefanos Vatsikas;Simon Armour;Tim Lewis;Marina De Vos	2013	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2012.0466	bargaining problem;real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	ECom	28.705231701045346	93.80446678072875	181200
5bfb9bc78f0359e6024a9a8daff5bbd4d333dabc	supporting mobile users in database-driven opportunistic spectrum access	opportunistic spectrum access;spectrum sharing;mobility management;geolocation database	In database-driven opportunistic spectrum access, location information of secondary users plays an important role. In a database query-and-update procedure, a secondary user reports to the geolocation database of its location information, so that the updated knowledgebase facilitates location-aided incumbent protection and network coexistence. However, such database-driven spectrum sharing becomes very challenging when the secondary users are mobile. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic coexistence framework that supports mobile users by incorporating the solutions to solve two core problems: (i) white space allocation (WSA) at the database and (ii) location update control (LUC) at the users. We frame the two problems such that they interact through dynamic control of the users' location uncertainty levels. For WSA, we derive a centralized real-time solution to mitigate mutual interference among secondary users and protect primary users against harmful interference. For LUC, we design a local two-level strategy to enable both movement-driven and interference-driven control of location uncertainty. This strategy makes an appropriate trade-off between the effectiveness of interference mitigation and the cost of database queries. To evaluate our algorithms, we have carried out both theoretical model-driven and real-world trace-driven simulation experiments. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework can determine and adapt the database query intervals of mobile users to achieve near-optimal interference mitigation with minimal location updates.	algorithm;centralized computing;coexist (image);computer simulation;database;experiment;geolocation;interference (communication);knowledge base;model-driven integration;national land and property gazetteer;real-time clock;regular expression;winsock	Bo Gao;Jung-Min Jerry Park;Yaling Yang	2014		10.1145/2632951.2632984	data mining;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	26.990022168354947	94.24698398899844	181241

In V2X systems, a series of applications (information transmission, in-car entertainment, etc.) rely on the limited vehicle battery, and the secrecy communication is a vital issue. However, most prior work limits to the automatic piloting, channel measurement/estimation and high speed transmissions, seldom study has been done on the battery-limited and secrecy communications for V2X. In light of this, here we investigate the V2X systems with a battery-limited perspective based on the multiple-input-single-output (MISO) secrecy channel in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The transmit beamformer and artificial noise (AN) are jointly designed. With the channel uncertainties, by subjecting to the battery constraints and secrecy rate, a robust energy harvesting (EH) balancing problem is constructed. The problem is further transformed into a two-level problem, in which we solve the inner-level problem by exploiting S-Procedure , and the outer-level problem with one-dimensional line search method. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the performance of our proposed scheme.

We first introduce an interference coordination strategy for D2D communication. Then we design an optimal channel reusing selection algorithm for single cell scenario which is based on Hungarian algorithm. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to reduce the computational complexity. Our simulation results show that the heuristic algorithm has a close performance as the optimal algorithm with a significant decreasing of computational complexity, and both of the proposed algorithms could improve the system performance.	computation;computational complexity theory;heuristic (computer science);hungarian algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;selection algorithm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Tao Han;Rui Yin;Yanfang Xu;Guanding Yu	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362848	algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;theoretical computer science;interference;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless	Mobile	31.185142938637195	91.50880903614978	181602

The authors consider the HetNets scenario of one macro-cell evolved-NodeB (eNB) and multiple femto-cell Home evolved NodeBs (HeNBs) cooperatively coexisting to provide better services. A specific HeNB allows macro-mobile station (macro-MS) previously associated with eNB to access to it for better signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) guarantee. As a reward, the macro-MS pays a certain of revenue to HeNB as the incentive mechanism for this HeNB's downlink extra power consumption, which is manifested in the design of the price function. The throughput bound of Macro-MSs in HeNB cell is given. Then, the authors select the SINR as the performance measure and formulate the power control of selected HeNBs as multi-constrained optimisation problem. Meanwhile, the authors derive the sub-optimal and closed-form power control of individual HeNB, based on which the authors design the distributed algorithm with the aid of eNB and HeNBs cooperatively to implement the pricing information exchange. Simulation results show the improved performance of the convergence, the energy-efficiency measured by ‘energy-per-bit’ and the throughput of the ‘Proposed-Cognitive-x’ power control algorithm.	cognitive radio;semantic network	C.

Sector cooperation is introduced in MU-MIMO (multi-user multiple input multiple output) systems. In the aspect of user pairing, both the system capacity and fairness among users are taken into consideration through pairing center and edge users. As for the inter-cell interference coordination, iterative sector cooperation on selecting pre-coders from codebooks is implemented, in order to avoid inter-cell interference and improve cell edge performance.

Ultra wideband (UWB) is one of these promising technologies that, despite its several outstanding benefits, can cause interference to other networks operating in the same frequency range because of its large bandwidth. In this study, the authors introduce a solution for interference management in heterogeneous UWB networks. The analysis can be generalised for other coexistence scenarios where we have wireless networks with different specifications. Game theory is used to study the joint power and rate control problem under mutual interference between two UWB standards, namely, multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing UWB and direct-sequence UWB. A non-cooperative joint rate and power control game with pricing (NRPGP) in which each node seeks to choose its possible transmit power and rate in order to maximise its own utility while satisfying its target signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio as quality-of-service requirement is introduced.

Particularly, multiple D2D pairs are allowed to reuse the same resource block (RB), and one D2D pair is allowed to use the spectrum of multiple RBs. Our objective is to maximize the system sum rate by satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints for both D2D and cellular user equipments. In order to solve this non-deterministic polynomial-time hard optimization problem, we propose a novel algorithm for obtaining a sub-optimal solution based on the many-to-many two-sided matching game with externalities. To characterize the properties of the proposed algorithm, we prove that it converges to the two-sided exchange stability within a limited number of iterations. Additionally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the near-optimal system sum rate and significantly outperforms a one-to-one matching algorithm.	algorithm;converge;interference (communication);iteration;many-to-many;mathematical optimization;one-to-one (data model);optimization problem;polynomial;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;stable marriage problem;time complexity	Jingjing Zhao;Yuanawei Liu;Kok Keong Chai;Yue Chen;Maged Elkashlan	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2016.2642099	games;cellular network;mathematical optimization;transmitter;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	31.471149702553067	92.91355540563819	182084
fc5ead0df56f4968b452366ac54315c27b333263	capacity analysis and resource allocation of layered multicast in scma networks		Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is considered as a promising technique for improving spectral efficiency. In this paper, we apply SCMA to wireless multicast communication with the purpose of taking the advantage of SCMA to expand multicast capacity. Particularly, the scheme of layered multicast based on SCMA network is studied. In this scheme, we first formulate the capacity of the system, which is no longer constrained by the user with the worst channel quality in the multicast group. Then, resource allocation for the system is optimized with the objective of maximizing the capacity of the system. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed by separating the power allocation and codebook assignment. Finally, simulation results are presented to estimate the performance of our algorithm in layered multicast based on SCMA network and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network.	algorithm;codebook;computational complexity theory;frequency divider;multicast;neural coding;simulation;sparse;spectral efficiency	Yibo Zhang;Xiaoxiang Wang;Dongyu Wang;Yufang Zhang;Yanwen Lan	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377144	computer network;multicast;computational complexity theory;codebook;distributed database;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;resource allocation;spectral efficiency;communication channel;computer science	HPC	33.03632571088013	90.77231303328405	182123
2faf5a98278ebe92fe4e602d42bf30b29c3224f9	evolutionary dynamics of cooperative sensing in cognitive radios under partial system state information		Cooperative sensing enables secondary users to combine individual sensing results in order to attain sensing accuracies beyond those achieved by consumer RF devices. However, due to sensing costs, secondary users may prefer not to cooperate to the sensing task, leading to higher false alarm probability. In this paper, we study how information about the presence of cooperators affects the dynamics of cooperative sensing schemes. We consider two scenarios, namely the case when SUs cannot detect the presence of other potential cooperators, and the case when SUs have prior information on the presence of other SUs in radio range. Using an evolutionary game framework, we demonstrate that protocols delivering such type of information to SUs reduce cooperation and ultimately lead to degraded network performance. Finally, a learning process based on the replicator dynamics is proposed which is capable to drive the system to the evolutionary stable solution. The results of the paper are illustrated through numerical simulations.	cognitive radio;combining rules;computer simulation;cooperative mimo;network performance;numerical analysis;radio frequency	Hajar Elhammouti;Rachid El Azouzi;Francesco De Pellegrini;Essaid Sabir;Loubna Echabbi	2017	2017 15th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.23919/WIOPT.2017.7959878	cognitive radio;distributed computing;computer science;false alarm;evolutionary dynamics;network performance;evolutionarily stable strategy;replicator equation;artificial intelligence	Mobile	33.19095775514388	96.14071104763957	182410

However, cognitive radio networks are vulnerable to various kinds of security attacks, among which the jamming attack has attracted great attention as it can significantly degrade spectrum utilization. In this article we model the jamming and anti-jamming process as a Markov decision process. With this approach, secondary users are able to avoid the jamming attack launched by external attackers and therefore maximize the payoff function. We first use a policy iteration method to solve the problem. However, this approach is computationally intensive. To decrease the computation complexity, Q-function is used as an alternate method. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the Q-function. The simulation results indicate that our approach can achieve better performance than existing approaches to defend against the jamming attack.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computation;electronic counter-countermeasure;game theory;iteration;markov chain;markov decision process;radio jamming;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Changlong Chen;Min Song;Chunsheng Xin;Jonathan D.

4cdae463ae3caa9a72ef7d82bc796e3c5e810707	fading-resistant link scheduling in wireless networks		In this paper, we study the link scheduling problem considering the fluctuating fading effect in transmissions. We extend the previous deterministic physical interference model to the Rayleigh-fading model that uses the stochastic propagation to address fading effects. Based on this model, we formulate a problem called Fading-Resistant Link Scheduling (Fading-R-LS) problem, which aims to maximize the throughput of all links in a single time slot. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. Based on the geometric structure of Fading-R-LS, we then propose two centralized schemes with O(g(L)) and O(1) performance guarantee, respectively, where g(L) is the number of magnitudes of transmission link lengths. Our experimental results show that the superior performance of our proposed schemes compared to previous schemes.	centralized computing;interference (communication);least squares;np-hardness;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;scheduling (computing);software propagation;throughput	Chenxi Qiu;Haiying Shen	2017	2017 46th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)	10.1109/ICPP.2017.40	throughput;fading;wireless network;distributed computing;job shop scheduling;scheduling (computing);computer science;computer network;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	34.31516506242311	91.3760517556266	182889

However, since the number of small cells in one cluster is increasing, the interference between small cells will increase significantly. As is well known, if the power level is reduced in a serving cell, the UEs in the same cell will experience throughput loss and UEs in neighboring cells will experience throughput improvement. In order to tradeoff the throughput loss and improvement, this paper presents a method to estimate accurately the loss and improvement. Then a transmission power decision method depending on loss and improvement is described.

In order to foster the opportunistic utilization of unexploited Internet connections of residential users, we propose a new marketplace where mobile network operators can rent the unused capacity of residential users' access devices (e.g., wireless access points or femtocells) when the traffic demand of their mobile customers exceeds the operator's network capacity. We formulate the allocation problem as a combinatorial reverse auction, which prevents market manipulation, and we further propose a greedy algorithm that finds efficient allocations in polynomial time, even for large-size network scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes well capture the economical and networking essence of the allocation problem, thus representing a promising approach to enhance the performance of next-generation wireless access networks.	access network;auction algorithm;greedy algorithm;internet;polynomial;software deployment;time complexity;value (ethics);web service;wireless access point	Stefano Paris;Fabio Martignon;Ilario Filippini;Antonio Capone	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364569	radio access network;cellular network;greedy algorithm;mobile search;the internet;wireless wan;heterogeneous network;imt advanced;internet access;public land mobile network;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;rogue access point;mobile computing;network access control;access network discovery and selection function;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network;network access point;network access device	Mobile	29.55310640917443	95.73558245899581	183450

In this work, we study a contract-based mechanism for sharing spectrum among primary licensed user (PU) and secondary unlicensed users (SUs). We assume that SUs cooperate in PU signal transmission. However, there are some challenges that the PU should overcome. First, considering the fact that nodes are selfish, brings the necessity of a reimbursement method to remunerate the helping SUs. Second, SU hides its private channel state information from other nodes, which results in asymmetry of information. The proposed contract-theory based framework provides a solution for spectrum allocation under asymmetric channel information. We compare the performance results with a benchmark scenario and we show through simulation results that both the PU and the SU gain positive revenue.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);channel state information;cognitive radio;design by contract;frequency allocation;ibm systems network architecture;one-class classification;programming paradigm;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density;superuser	Bahareh Nazari;Abbas Jamalipour	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036921	spectrum management;games;communications protocol;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;computer network	Mobile	32.389199546321784	94.79865767903047	183499

These limitations are related to the available spectrum and the capacity of the network. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), composed of macro cells (MCs) and small cells (SCs), are seen as the key solution to improve spectral efficiency per unit area and to eliminate coverage holes. Due to the large imbalance in transmit power between MCs and SCs in HetNets, intelligent user association (UA) is required to perform load balancing and to favor some SCs attraction against MCs. As long term evolution (LTE) cellular networks use the same frequency sub-bands, user equipment may experience strong intercell interference (ICI), especially at cell edge. Therefore, there is a need to coordinate the resource allocation (RA) among the cells and to minimize the ICI. In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm to optimize UA and RA in LTE networks. Our solution, based on game theory, permits to compute cell individual offset and a pattern of power transmission over frequency and time domain for each cell. Simulation results show significant benefits in the average throughput and also cell edge user throughput of 40% and 55% gains respectively. Furthermore, we also obtain a meaningful improvement in energy efficiency.	catastrophic interference;centralized computing;chief information officer;compaq lte;computation;computational complexity theory;computer user satisfaction;distributed computing;dynamical system;game theory;generic programming;greedy algorithm;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iteration;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;network utility;scheduling (computing);semantic network;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system;user agent	Nessrine Trabelsi;Chung Shue Chen;Rachid El Azouzi;Laurent Roullet;Eitan Altman	2017	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2017.2677778	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	26.52636784820966	90.30038347700244	183651

In this work, we study the optimal power split (power control) between the source and relay node in presence of an uncertainty in the CSI. The prime contribution is to solve the problem based on an uncertain long-term knowledge of both the first and second hop CSI (requiring less frequent updates), and under an aggregate network-level power constraint. We employ the minimax optimization methodology to arrive at the minimax robust optimal power split, that offers the best possible guarantee on the end-to-end signal to noise ratio (SNR). The derived closed form analytical expressions admit simple intuitive interpretations and are easy to implement in real-world AF relaying systems. Numerical results confirm the advantages of incorporating the presence of uncertainty into the optimization problem, and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed minimax robust optimal power split.	aggregate data;anisotropic filtering;best, worst and average case;channel state information;control theory;downtime;end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;minimax;optimization problem;relay;relevance;signal-to-noise ratio	Muhammad Danish Nisar;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093221	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;robust optimization;uncertainty;optimal control;power control;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;signal-to-noise ratio;robustness	Mobile	35.85028931273428	88.68169506416011	183716

These conflicts and their possible solutions have been observed by implementing standard-compliant relay functionalities on the Vienna simulator. As an original experimental approach, we model realistic RN operation, taking into account that transmitters are not active all the time due to half-duplex RN operation. We have rearranged existing elements in the simulator in a manner that emulates RN behavior, rather than implementing a standalone brand-new component for the simulator. We also study analytically some of the issues observed in the interaction between the network and the RNs, to draw conclusions beyond simulation observation. The main observations of this paper are that: i) Additional time-varying interference management steps are needed, because the LTE-A standard employs a fixed time division between eNB-RN and RN-UE transmissions (typical relay capacity or throughput research models balance them optimally, which is unrealistic nowadays); ii) There is a trade-off between the time-division constraints of relaying and multi-user diversity; the stricter the constraints on relay scheduling are, the less flexibility schedulers have to exploit channel variation; and iii) Thee standard contains a variety of parameters for relaying configuration, but not all cases of interest are covered.	compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);emulator;interference (communication);multi-user;relay;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;throughput;transmitter	Felipe Gómez-Cuba;Francisco Javier González-Castaño	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883673	telecommunications;computer network	Embedded	24.814681726066286	88.69701512144417	184217

D2D transmitter can harvest energy from ambient inter- ference and reuse the spectrum of the cellular users (CUs) to com- municate with corresponding receiver. The energy of transmitters comes form the mix of the harvested energy and its battery. To improve the spectrum utilization, one D2D pair should be enable to reuse the spectrum of multiple CUs. In our analysis, dynamic spectrum allocation is applied to minimize the total energy cost of the system with QoS guarantees for both cellular link and D2D link. We first propose a sub- optimal resource allocation scheme while the spectrum bands are static. Then by applying efficient iteration method, we propose the optimal resource management algorithm with dynamic spectrum allocation.

In uplink NOMA, more than one user can use the same subcarrier, which increases the system throughput and fairness. Due to the non-orthogonality among the users, joint processing is required at the receiver to retrieve the users' signals. In this paper, we propose solutions to optimize the receiver and the radio resource allocation of uplink NOMA. First, we propose an iterative multiuser detection and decoding (MUDD) to improve the performance of the multiuser detector by utilizing the information derived by the channel decoder. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is proposed for NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' weighted sum-rate. The link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed iterative MUDD approach brings about 4.5 dB and 9.8 dB performance improvements at block error rate equal to 10-2 comparing to conventional multiuser detection, for QPSK and 16QAM modulations, respectively. Furthermore, the system-level results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithm achieves the system spectral efficiency upper-bound, making NOMA significantly outperforms OFDMA in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness.	algorithm;fairness measure;iterative method;mud;mathematical optimization;multi-user;performance evaluation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput;weight function	Mohammed Al-Imari;Pei Xiao;Muhammad Ali Imran	2015	2015 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2015.7454317	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;spectral efficiency;computer network	Mobile	33.46240522308457	89.583078081978	184726
91e5a8df10199d4f2a0ac45d33c156d113ebdc0b	multiuser downlink hybrid analog-digital beamforming with individual sinr constraints		This paper deals with the problem of multiuser transmit hybrid analog-digital beamforming. Precisely, we tackle the problem of transmit power minimization under minimum signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) constraints. While the all-digital beamforming solution has been extensively studied in the recent years, little is known about the hybrid analog-digital optimization. This latter design is known to be a non-convex NP-hard problem as the analog part entails the optimization of a quadratically constraint quadratic program with several equality constraints. In order to solve this problem, we propose an alternating optimization with a successive convex approximation procedure. The conceived scheme is able to consider an arbitrary sub-array connectivity matrix (i.e. localized, interleaved, fully-connected,...). Through numerical simulations it is observed that the proposed framework yields to an efficient solution in few iterations providing a substantial gain compared to current heuristic approaches.	beamforming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Miguel Ángel Vázquez;Luis Blanco;Ana I.

However, it can only solve the single objective optimization problem. In this paper, we formulate the multi-objective optimization (MO) problem for bipartite matching, and propose a modified bipartite matching (MBM) algorithm to approach the Pareto set with a low computational complexity and to dynamically select proper solutions with given constraints among the reduced matching set. In addition, our MBM algorithm is extended to the case of asymmetric bipartite graphs. Finally, we illustrate the application of MBM to antenna assignments in wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios, where we consider the multi-objective optimization problem with the maximization of the system capacity, total traffic priority, and long-term fairness among all mobile users. The simulation results show that MBM can effectively reduce the matching set and dynamically provide the optimized performance with different quality of service (QoS) requirements.	assignment problem;channel capacity;computational complexity theory;entropy maximization;fairness measure;hungarian algorithm;mbm (file format);mimo;matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Fanglei Sun;Victor O.

Solving this problem under the physical signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) model has been demonstrated to be NP-hard. Previous studies focused, almost exclusively, on approximation algorithms with guaranteed performance ratios. Although such algorithms have tremendous theoretical value, their surprisingly low approximation ratios limit their practicality. This paper solves the problem using another alternative: the genetic algorithm meta-heuristics. The main challenge in using genetic algorithms is to successfully handle optimization constraints, because the original algorithm was designed for unconstrained problems. To this end, we devise a novel constraint handling mechanism that theoretically guarantees finding feasible and optimal solutions. Our numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, and its superiority over existing methods.	approximation algorithm;entropy maximization;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;numerical analysis;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Mohamed Saad	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248925	quality control and genetic algorithms;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;meta-optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;approximation algorithm	Robotics	36.81878620955299	91.2324310169553	184933

The problem is difficult as it has been proved to be nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard. While many previous studies provided various solutions to improve resource allocating efficiency of this NP-hard problem, they did not take user satisfaction into account. This study works for proposing a chunk-based frequency domain packet scheduling algorithm to improve resource allocating efficiency and user satisfaction at the same time. The proposed algorithm is based on the well-known mean enhanced greedy (MEG) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher user satisfaction as well as the best fairness between subscriber compared with the MEG and other related algorithms. Remarkably, the achieved improvement can be consistent regardless the similarity or difference of the desired uplink transmission rates between subscribers.	algorithm;chunking (computing);scheduling (computing)	Yu-Shun Liu;Jung-Shyr Wu	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3611-3	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	27.773316164149854	92.97021573114738	185147

By optimizing the different weights assigned on the statistic of each CR given a targeted probability of false alarm, the cooperative spectrum sensing optimization focuses on maximizing the probability of detection. Statistical characteristics of parameters in cooperative spectrum sensing for the PU with a single antenna and the CR with multiple antennas (SPMC) system, the PU with multiple antennas and the CR with a single antenna (MPSC) system, both the PU and the CR with multiple antennas (MPMC) system as well as the PU with Alamouti coding system have been investigated. Due to the non-convex characteristic of the cooperative spectrum sensing problem, an efficient parallel artificial bee colony (PABC) method motivated by the intelligent foraging behavior of a honeybee colony is introduced to address the problem without approximations and convexity constraints. Furthermore, classical benchmark functions are presented to validate the searching ability of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results showed that the PABC shows a superior ability when applied in both the typical test functions and the cooperative spectrum sensing scenario. Also, the reliability of spectrum sensing can be significantly promoted with the use of multiple antennas and Alamouti coding.	artificial bee colony algorithm;program optimization	Yongqiang Hei;Wentao Li;Weihong Fu;Xiaohui Li	2015	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-015-0028-2	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	HPC	36.261479992382085	90.70243662777877	185342
41ea7a2e3706dbab5b2b295a56970aa57a77d361	energy-efficient resource allocation for amplify-and-forward relaying in ofdm systems		In this paper, we study end-to-end energy efficiency of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing relay-based system under power constraints for the base station and relay node with system circuit power considerations. Using a two-phase amplify-and-forward relaying protocol, we assume that relay has a fixed power constraint and the source power can vary in transmission power interval where the source employs a selective relaying mechanism for each individual subcarrier. Therefore, in our model, the source is able to adaptively select some subcarriers to be relayed. The radio resource allocation is then formulated as an energy-efficient mixed binary integer programming, and then we propose a heuristic algorithm to find the suboptimal solution. The solution consists of the suboptimal transmit power of the source, the suboptimal set of subcarriers for relaying and the optimal transmit power of each subcarrier at the source and relay in the first and second time slots. The algorithm obtains energy-efficient transmission power for a given relay transmission power based on a gradient descent method. Then a two-step iterative scheme is proposed to obtain the subcarriers to be relayed as well as the optimal power allocation at the source and relay in the first and second time slots. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, we compare its efficiency through simulations with the cases without using selective subcarrier relaying and without circuit power consideration in low and high relay transmit power regimes. The simulation results indicate that using our proposed method results in a significant improvement in the energy efficiency.

We assume that each CR is equipped with a tunable bandpass filter (BPF) and is able to sense one frequency band (channel) at a time. The sensing interval consists of L sensing slots of length T . During each sensing slot, each of the collaborating CRs is assigned to sense one of the channels and report its observation to the other CRs. The occupancy of each channels is decided after L sensing slots based on a fusion rule that is fitted to a regulatory constraint or a coarse sensing task. We aim to maximize the expected number of identified idle channels by optimally choosing the index of the channel to be sensed by each collaborating CR at each sensing slot. We model this problem in its most general form as a finite horizon Markov decision process. We derive closed-form solutions for an optimal spectrum sensing policy and the associated value functions for the case of two collaborating CRs where individual sensing decisions are fused together according to the OR-rule. We show that the gain due to the optimal sensing policy is more significant when the spectrum utilization is high.	cognitive radio;frequency band;initial condition;map;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical induction;numerical analysis;recurrence relation;state transition table	Siavash Fazeli-Dehkordy;Konstantinos N.

They are randomly deployed by the end user, so only post deployment network planning is possible. Furthermore, this uncoordinated deployment creates severe interference to co-located femtocells, especially in dense deployments. This paper presents a new architecture using a generalised virtual cluster femtocell (GVCF) paradigm, which groups together FAP into logical clusters. It guarantees severely interfering and overlapping femtocells are assigned to different clusters. Since each cluster operates on different band of frequencies, the corresponding virtual cluster controller only has to manage its own FAPs, so the overall system complexity is low. The performance of the GVCF algorithm is analysed from both a resource availability and cluster number perspective. Simulation results conclusively corroborate the superior performance of the GVCF model in interference mitigation, particularly in high density FAP scenarios.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;design rationale;display resolution;face animation parameter;interference (communication);lookup table;multitier architecture;programming paradigm;randomness;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Faisal Tariq;Laurence Dooley;Adrian S.

Each cluster consists of a central user and a cell-edge user. The central user is an entrusted user, and the cell-edge user is a potential eavesdropper. We focus on the secure beamforming and power allocation design optimization problem which maximizes the sum achievable secrecy rate of central users subject to the transmit power constraint at the base station and transmission rate requirements at cell-edge users. The problem is nonconvex because of coupling optimization variables in the considered fractional quadratically constrained quadratic programming. We propose an alternating optimization-based solution and a constrained concave–convex procedure-based solution to the considered problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed NOMA schemes outperform the conventional orthogonal multiple access scheme.	beamforming;concave function;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;oma;optimization problem;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program;requirement;secure transmission;simulation;system analysis;telecommunications link	Yiqing Li;Miao Jiang;Qi Zhang;Quanzhong Li;Jiayin Qin	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2658563	transmitter power output;secure transmission;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;quadratic programming;computer science;beamforming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;base station;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	36.65960136708884	90.10033787623802	185897

The primary users are regarded as relay nodes of the secondary users and adopt amplify-and-forward relaying strategy. Physical-layer network coding is used when both secondary users select the same relay. The spectrum access problem in the considered system model is defined as joint relay selection and discrete power control. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game where the players are the secondary users and the common payoff function takes both transmission rate and power consumption into account. The proposed game falls into the framework of potential games where at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) exists. Furthermore, the social optimal solution is also a pure strategy NE of the proposed game. We then propose a distributed algorithm based on learning automata to achieve the pure strategy NE. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm has good convergence and near optimal performance.	anarchy;automata theory;best, worst and average case;converge;distributed algorithm;internet relay chat;learning automata;linear network coding;nash equilibrium;numerical method;selection algorithm;utility	Wei Zhong;Meixia Tao;Youyun Xu	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633668	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;communication	Mobile	32.96424780012544	93.51595202041376	186047

In this paper, a cognitive relay network is considered where the secondary users (users in Ad-Hoc network) are involved as cooperative relays in primary users' communication. The primary user owns a given bandwidth and can decide to lease it for a fraction of time to secondary users in exchange for appropriate remuneration. A group of secondary users in Ad-Hoc network are selected using potential game to maximize the primary user's transmission, so that primary user's buffer will be depleted faster, resulting in more channel idle time, namely more transmission opportunities for secondary users. We consider a baseline scenario with full channel state information and information theoretic transmission strategies. Feasibility and existence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) in potential game are proved, and an iterative algorithm of relay selection is designed. Moreover, the impact of different system parameters on primary user selection for secondary Ad-Hoc network is analyzed. Simulation results show that the primary user and secondary Ad-Hoc network can achieve higher utilities by spectrum leasing based on trading secondary spectrum access for cooperation.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);baseline (configuration management);channel state information;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;hoc (programming language);information theory;iterative method;nash equilibrium;relay;scanline rendering;simulation	Wei Xie;Wenfeng Ma;Peng Han;Wei Zhong;Hua Tian	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543000	cognitive radio;simulation;cognitive network;telecommunications;engineering;cooperative diversity;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	32.86534587993426	94.53016326781979	186080

In this paper, we consider joint power/rate optimization in the context of orthogonal modulation (OM) and investigate the additional performance gains achieved through adaptation of the OM order. We show that such adaptation can significantly increase network throughput, while simultaneously reducing the per-bit energy consumption relative to fixed-order modulation systems. The optimization is carried out under two different objective functions: minimizing the maximum service time and maximizing the sum of user rates. For the first objective function, we prove that the optimization problem can be formulated as a generalized geometric program (GGP). We then show how this GGP can be transformed into a nonlinear convex program, which can be solved optimally and efficiently. For the second objective function, we obtain a lower bound on the performance gain of adaptive OM (AOM) over fixed-modulation systems. Numerical results indicate that relative to an optimal joint rate/power control fixed-order modulation scheme, the proposed AOM scheme achieves significant throughput and energy gains.	associate-o-matic;convex optimization;general game playing;geometric programming;mathematical optimization;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical method;optimization problem;throughput	Alaa Muqattash;Marwan Krunz;Tao Shu	2006	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2005.862406	optimization problem;code division multiple access;real-time computing;geometric programming;link adaptation;telecommunications;power control;computer science;upper and lower bounds	Metrics	35.68161161878476	89.18295181178128	186200

Joint rate and power allocation problem is considered for secondary users (SUs) with homogeneous and heterogenous traffic subject to the QoS and interference threshold constraints. Two well-known fairness approaches [max–min and proportional fairness (PF)] are compared for the proposed optimization problem. Three scenarios are considered. The first scenario corresponds to elastic traffic in which all the SUs are elastic users. In the second, it is assumed that all the SUs are streaming users. Considering the proportional and max min fairness, it is observed that for both fairness criterion the streaming users achieving higher throughput and fairness, compared with the elastic users due to the fact that for streaming users, stringent transmission rate guarantees are necessary to ensure real-time communication. Moreover, considering the requirements of future wireless networks, a cross-layer resource-allocation is proposed for heterogeneous traffic in the third scenario. A combination of streaming traffic (which requires a maximum guaranteed average delay) and elastic traffic (with flexible rate requirements) is investigated. The optimization problem allocates the available resources to the streaming users such that the delay constraints of the streaming users are satisfied. Through extensive simulations, the effect of streaming traffic, Interference threshold, minimum processing gain, imperfect channel state information and signal-to-interference-noise ratio constraint on the total throughput of elastic users are investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that in all scenarios PF outperforms max min fairness. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing the number of streaming traffic results in lower throughput of elastic users for both PF and max min fairness. Introduction Cognitive radio which enables spectrum sharing between different wireless services attempts to overcome spectrum scarcity [1-4]. In cognitive radio networks, unlicensed user or secondary user (SU) is allowed to share spectrum with licensed user, known as primary user (PU). As defined clearly in [5], there are three basic techniques for spectrum sharing: overlay, interweaving, and underlay. In the overlay scheme, the SU detects the presence of the PUs, and changes its own transmitted signal so that it does not imposed harmful interference on the communication of the PUs. In the interweaving approach, the secondary detect and exploit portions of the spectrum that are not *Correspondence: dashtimina@ieee.org 1Department of Electrical Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran Full list of author information is available at the end of the article being occupied by licensed services are referred to as spectrum holes in order to avoid interference with the PUs. In the case of underlay principle, the SU is allowed to use the spectrum of the PUs only when the interference received from the SU is less than the interference level that is tolerable by the primary receiver. spectrum sharing in cognitive radio has recently attracted growing attention in the literature. The opportunistic spectrum sharing approach in the code-division multiple access (CDMA)-based uplinkMAC over the cognitive radio networks was proposed in [6] to achieve the tradeoff between the interference imposed into the PUs and overall spectrum utilization. Problems of channel sensing, data transmission, and power and rate allocations were considered.

An iterative least square based primary identification algorithm which could blindly detect the code channels utilized by PUs was developed. It was shown that this method did not require any prior knowledge about the primary networks. The authors of [8] presented a soft decision spectrally modulated, spectrally encoded framework to achieve synergistic CR benefits of overlay and underlay schemes. Analytic derivation of CR error probability for overlay and underlay applications for a family of SMSE signals, including OFDM and MC-CDMA was provided. It was shown that the underlay cognitive radio waveform was able to adapt its bandwidth based on user requirements and environmental conditions. Simulated performance analysis demonstrated that the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform could be utilized to improve spectrum efficiency. An algorithm for calculating the adaptive transmission parameters in a cognitive DS MC-CDMA system was proposed in [9] and it was shown that this algorithm combated interference in the channel effectively. This article specifically focuses on the underlay spectrum sharing approach. This approach has attracted significant attention (see, e.g., [10-13]). In wireless communications, radio resource allocation (RRA) is vital in controlling how scarce resources can be allocated. The studies related to RRA for SUs in the underlay spectrum sharing scheme are relevant to our work. The authors of [14] focused on the proportional fairness (PF) in a CDMA-based cognitive wireless network with spectrum underlay where the PUs could increase transmit power to counterbalance the harmful interference caused by the SUs. The authors of [15] presented a two-phase channel and power allocation approach for CDMA-based underlay cognitive radio networks to improve the system throughput. The authors of [12] focused on the CDMAbased underlay cognitive radio systems where channelaware access control algorithm was proposed to protect the primary transmission. In this article, the access probabilities of SUs were adjusted based on the channel-state information and the measured interference temperature. In [16], the problem of joint rate and power allocation was formulated by considering QoS constrains [in terms of minimum required signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR)] for different unlicensed users and also interference temperature constraints for the PUs. The main aim was to maximize the total transmission rate of the SUs by adjusting the transmit power of these users. Resource allocation for spectrum underlay in CDMA networks under QoS and interference constraints were presented in [17]. Joint power and rate allocation with max–min fairness and PF were considered. Coexistence of cognitive radio and CDMA networks were studied in [18], where a more flexible scheme that utilized the average channel gain was considered. In [16-18], resource allocation in underlay cognitive radio was conducted in each time slot of packet transmissions. In [19], PF was achieved over multiple time slots. In this article, we develop the joint rate and power allocation problem subject to Qos and interference threshold constraints.We also provide comparison analysis between two popular fairness concepts: max–min and PF. In max– min fairness, the minimum achievable data rate is maximized. Max–min fairness ignores revenue maximization for the network operators; but, rather the focus is on the satisfaction of service fairness from the users perspective. PF is defined in terms of maximizing total logarithmic user throughput. The PF improves the trade off between the total network performance in terms of throughput and fairness experience of individual users. We first consider homogeneous traffic for two cases; one in which we consider that all the SUs are elastic users with flexible rate requirements and one in which we assume that all the SUs are streaming users which correspond to the real-time transfer of various signals (e.g., voice, streaming audio/video) that requires a maximum guaranteed average delay. Simulation results show that streaming traffic achieve higher throughput than of the elastic traffic for both PF and max–min fairness. This results from the fact that, for streaming applications, stringent transmission rate guarantees are necessary to ensure real-time communication. Our results also indicate that resource allocation solutions are fairer for the streaming traffic in comparison to elastic users. In [16-19], resource allocation in underlay spectrum sharing is only conducted for homogeneous traffic. However, next-generation wireless networks are anticipated to support multimedia traffic. With heterogeneous traffic, quality of service provisioning and fairness support are also imperative. In this article, we further extend the related literature by incorporating a mixture of different traffic types. It is in line with the fact that in the next wireless networks, diversified services are provided for different traffic types with various delay requirements. The formulation is then extended to the case of heterogeneous traffic. The considered combination includes streaming traffic and elastic traffic. The main aim is to maximize the total throughput of elastic users where the average delay constraint for streaming traffic and the maximum transmission power, rate, and interference constraint are satisfied. Using simulations, we evaluate the impact of streaming traffic on the total throughput of elastic users. Simulation results are provided, which show the increase in throughput of elastic users achieved by decreasing number of streaming users.

Consider a cloud-radio access network (CRAN), where the central cloud is responsible for scheduling devices to the frames’ radio resources blocks (RRBs) of the single-antenna base-stations (BSs), adjusting the transmit power levels, and for synchronizing the transmit frames across the connected BSs. Previous studies show that the jointly coordinated scheduling and power control problem in the considered CRAN can be solved using an approach that scales exponentially with the number of BSs, devices, and RRBs, which makes the practical implementation infeasible for reasonably sized networks. This letter instead proposes a low-complexity solution to the problem, under the constraints that each device cannot be served by more than one BS but can be served by multiple RRBs within each BS frame, and under the practical assumption that the channel is constant during the duration of each frame. The paper utilizes graph-theoretical based techniques and shows that constructing a single power control graph is sufficient to obtain the optimal solution with a complexity that is independent of the number of RRBs. Simulation results reveal the optimality of the proposed solution for slow-varying channels, and show that the solution performs near-optimal for highly correlated channels.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;computational complexity theory;graph theory;radio access network;scheduling (computing);simulation	Ahmed Douik;Hayssam Dahrouj;Tareq Y.

The proposed scheme ensures a) significant gain in terms of coverage provided by relay deployment, b) boosted Signal to Interference and Noise Ratios (SINRs) at the second phase of the two hop transmission due to the positive superposition of synchronous transmissions, and c) the flexibility to switch to non-cooperative mode whenever cooperation is no longer beneficial. The new scheme showed considerable enhancement of both system throughput and user fairness and noticeable improvement in terms of energy efficiency compared to the non-cooperative multicast scheme.	algorithm;data compression;emoticon;fairness measure;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;interference (communication);multicast;one-to-many (data model);relay;scalability;scalable video coding;scheduling (computing);software deployment;throughput	Mahmoud Hadef;Apostolos Apostolaras;Jim O'Reilly;Alain Mourad;Belkacem Mouhouche	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952867	multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Mobile	29.584888435059735	89.38732011376486	187198

SUMMARY Besides avoiding inter-symbol interference and leading to high capacity, wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or other multicarrier systems provide fine granularity for resource allocation since they are capable of dynamically assigning sub-carriers to multiple users and adaptively allocating transmit power. The current dominate layered networking architecture, in which each layer is designed and operated independently, results in inefficient and inflexible resource use in wireless networks due to the nature of the wireless medium, such as time-varying channel fading, mutual interference, and topology variations. Thus, we need an integrated adaptive design across different layers. In this thesis, we focus on resource allocation and scheduling in wireless OFDM networks based on joint physical and medium access control (MAC) layer optimization. To achieve orders of magnitude gains in system performance, we use two major mechanisms in resource management: exploiting the time variance and frequency selectivity of wireless channels through adaptive modulation, coding, as well as packet scheduling and regulating resource allocation through network economics. With the help of utility functions that capture the satisfaction level of users for a given resource assignment, we establish a utility optimization framework for resource allocation in OFDM networks, in which the network utility at the level of applications is maximized subject to the current channel conditions and the modulation and coding techniques employed in the network.

This paper presents a cross-layer optimization approach that operates between the application and physical layers to achieve high fidelity downlink video transmission by optimizing with respect to a quality criterion termed “visual entropy” using Lagrangian relaxation. By utilizing the natural layered structure of wavelet coding, an optimal level of power allocation is determined, which permits the throughput of visual entropy to be maximized over a multi-cell environment. A theoretical approach to optimization using the Shannon capacity and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is explored when coupling the application with the physical layers. Simulations show that the throughput gain for cross-layer optimization by visual entropy is increased by nearly 80% at the cell boundary as compared with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).	channel capacity;ici (programming language);karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;maximal set;peak signal-to-noise ratio;program optimization;quality of service;shannon capacity of a graph;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;tucker decomposition;wavelet transform	Hyungkeuk Lee;Alan C.

A dynamic orthogonal spectrum sharing between macrocell and femtocell is utilized in the proposed allocation scheme to reduce the cross-tier interference. In order to mitigate the cotier interference, a graph-based clustering resource allocation (GCRA) scheme is presented. The interference graph of the femto-tier is built first based on the measurement reports of femtocell user equipments (FUEs). Then a coloring algorithm is implemented in a distributed way to construct disjoint clusters in which the frequency band can be reused to improve the spectrum efficiency. Finally, a dynamic orthogonal resource allocation is performed to avoid the inter-cluster interference. The simulation results reveal that the GCRA approach enhances the spectrum efficiency of the femtocell network, while mitigating the co-tier/cross-tier interference of the heterogeneous network.	cluster analysis;data rate units;downtime;fairness measure;frequency band;generic cell rate algorithm;graph coloring;graph theory;heuristic;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;simulation;spectral efficiency	Qian Zhang;Xinning Zhu;Leijia Wu;Kumbesan Sandrasegaran	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554644	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;graph theory;resource management;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;interference;cluster analysis;femtocell;bandwidth;statistics;spectral efficiency;computer network	Embedded	28.43533107954528	90.22220843141909	187951

The system consists of two energy-constrained source nodes which employ the power splitting (PS) to receive the information and the energy simultaneously from the power-supply relay. To maximize the weighted sum energy subject to the constraints of the quality of service and the transmit powers, three well-known relaying protocols, i.e., amplify-and-forward, bit level XOR-based decode-and-forward (DF), and symbol level superposition coding-based DF, are considered. For each relaying protocol, we formulate the joint relay beamforming, the source transmit power, and the PS ratios optimization as a nonconvex quadratically constrained problem. To solve the complex nonconvex problem, we decouple the objective problem into two subproblems in which one is to optimize the beamforming vectors while another is to optimize the remaining parameters. We show that the optimal solution of each subproblem can be obtained in the closed-form expressions. The solution is finally obtained with the proposed convergent iterative algorithm. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the advantage of adapting the different relaying strategies and weighted factors to harvest energy in TWR channels.	algorithm;ampersand;beamforming;bit-level parallelism;direction finding;exclusive or;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;power supply;quality of service;relay;symbol level;weight function	Wei Wang;Rui Wang;Hani Mehrpouyan;Nan Zhao;Guoan Zhang	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2701830	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	36.6284384086632	89.85090979813376	188062

It provides protection to primary users (PUs) from interference and creates opportunities of spectrum access for secondary users (SUs). It should be performed efficiently to reduce the number of false alarms and missed detections. Continuous sensing for a long time incurs cost in terms of increased energy consumption; thus, spectrum sensing ought to be energy efficient to ensure the prolonged existence of CR devices. This paper focuses on using of history to help achieve energy-efficient spectrum sensing in infrastructure-based CR networks. The scheme employs an iteratively developed history processing database that is used by CRs to make decisions about spectrum sensing, subsequently resulting in reduced spectrum scanning and improved energy efficiency. Two conventional spectrum sensing schemes, i.e., energy detection (ED) and cyclostationary feature detection (CFD), are enriched by history to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. System-level simulations are performed to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed history-based scheme by performing detailed energy consumption analysis for the aforementioned schemes. Results demonstrate that the employment of history ensued in improved energy efficiency due to reduced spectrum scanning. This paper also suggests which spectrum sensing scheme can be the best candidate in a particular scenario by looking into computational complexity before comparative analysis is presented with other states of the art.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;cyclostationary process;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);interference (communication);qualitative comparative analysis;quality of service;sensor;simulation;software portability	Tazeen S.

Previously, much of the literature discussed the user’ association problem for HetNets with conventional fixed small cells. The problem discussed in the existing literature is easy to analyze owing to fix nature of the small cells. In this paper, we focus on the mPC instead of fixed small cells, which complicates the user association problem due to its nature of mobility. In this paper, we propose the public safety (PS) users priority-based mPC user association (PS-UA) scheme for load balancing and interference reduction in highly fluctuating PS long-term evolution systems. The proposed scheme improves the user-association problem by minimizing call blocking probability (CBP) according to the network load conditions and PS user priority. Moreover, it further improves user signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio by implementing enhanced intercell interference coordination scheme to further reduce the interference to the offloaded users. System-level simulations confirmed the validity of the proposed PS-UA scheme, because it convincingly reduces the CBP for PS users as compared with the conventional static user association scheme.	blocking (computing);compaq lte;erlang (unit);interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multitier architecture;simulation;user agent	Zeeshan Kaleem;Kyunghi Chang	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2598198	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	26.80019606350186	90.02635840169063	188203

Without incentive mechanisms, selfish users transmit at their maximum power levels at the Nash equilibrium (NE), causing significant interference to each other. In order to induce users to transmit at desired power levels, existing works have proposed pricing and auctions as incentive mechanisms. With pricing or auctions, it is explicitly stated or implicitly assumed that the users are obedient, in that they adopt the utility functions designed by the system and accept the prices as control signals. In this paper, we use the intervention mechanism to incentivize selfish users to achieve efficient outcomes as the (unique) NE. In the intervention mechanism, a system designer prescribes a intervention rule and uses a intervention device to execute it. Depending on the monitoring technology and intervention capability of the intervention device, we propose two types of intervention rules with different performance and complexity tradeoffs. We study the performance achievable by the proposed intervention rules, as well as the design principles for different intervention rules. We prove that all the Pareto boundary can be achieved as the NE or even the unique NE of the game with intervention. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvement achieved when using different intervention rules and illustrate performance analysis on different intervention rules.	hoc (programming language);interference (communication);maximum power transfer theorem;nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;systems design	Yuanzhang Xiao;Jaeok Park;Mihaela van der Schaar	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134160	wireless ad hoc network;game theory;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	34.236829664736874	94.07948838839765	188375

The DCA algorithm determines paired radio channels that experience the least interference and are least likely to cause interference. The power control algorithm uses local estimations of signal to interference ratio (SIR) at a receiver to iteratively command power adjustment on the desired transmitter. A common control frequency, which is frame-synchronized among base stations, provides all necessary information for DCA without blind slots. Computer simulations are used to evaluate system performance. Results from computer simulations demonstrate good spectrum efficiency and robustness. Although studied under a specific set of parameters, this type of MAC protocols can be applied in different wireless communications environments. >	autonomous robot	Justin C.-I.

More specifically, a power management model is formulated as an integer linear program that the network planner can use in order to achieve power savings while maintaining an acceptable quality of service (QoS), measured by the signal to interference ratio (SIR) for interference limited WLAN. Furthermore, through a network simulation implemented in NS-2, it is shown that the adaptive power saving scheme can guarantee the same average throughput as the non-adaptive counterpart, while significantly reducing the total transmitted power. Considering a realistic scenario, we show that, using the proposed power management model, one can save about 55% of the transmitted power while the SIR is increased by 6 dB thus improving the QoS. Also, using a simple experiment with two access points it is shown that, in the case of users within the overlap of the two coverage areas, the throughput remains constant when the transmit power is changed from a low value to a high value although a minor degradation of the average delay is noticed. As a conclusion, the commonly assumed fact that increasing the transmit power results in better network performance is not necessarily true and can result as shown in this paper in energy waste.	decibel;elegant degradation;interference (communication);linear programming;maxima and minima;network performance;open-source software;power management;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;simulation;throughput;waste;wireless access point	Mohammed Boulmalf;Tarik Aouam;Mounir Ghogho;Syed Ali Raza Zaidi;N.

Existing solutions therefore assign orthogonal radio resources in frequency and spatial domains to each network, however, infeasible for dense femtocells deployments. It is also difficult to apply centralized resource managements facing challenges of scalability to the two-tier. Considering the infeasibility of imposing any modification on existing infrastructures, we leverage the cognitive radio technology to propose the cognitive radio resource management scheme for femtocells to mitigate cross-tier interference. Under such cognitive framework, a strategic game is further developed for the intra-tier interference mitigation. Through the concept of effective capacity, proposed radio resource management schemes are appropriately controlled to achieve required statistical delay guarantees while yielding an efficient radio resources utilization in femtocells. Performance evaluation results show that a considerable performance improvement can be generally achieved by our solution, as compared with that of state-of-the-art techniques, to facilitate the deployment of femtocells.	autonomous robot;centralized computing;cognition;cognitive radio;compaq lte;frame (networking);interference (communication);multitier architecture;norm (social);overhead (computing);performance evaluation;quality of service;radio resource management;randomized algorithm;real-time web;scalability;smoothing;software deployment	Shao-Yu Lien;Yu-Yu Lin;Kwang-Cheng Chen	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100737	cognitive radio;in situ resource utilization;scalability;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;autonomous system;sensor;radio resource management;resource management;software-defined radio;noise reduction;interference;spatial frequency;femtocell;computer security;service quality;radio frequency;computer network	Mobile	27.66342163045492	90.5835384978241	189660

Broadcasting is a multipoint delivery of transmission that sends data from a source to multiple destinations. The terminal is involved in cooperative transmission when the station broadcast video data. To enhance performance, the heterogeneity and forwarding capabilities should be considered. This work studies power control and allocation in a collaborative transmission based on game theory, which provides an effective strategy when network resources are limited. First, a novel power allocation model of the base station (BS) based on non-cooperative game theory and bidding is presented in this study. Additionally, we also propose the utility function of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) along with Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIRs). Subsequently, based on such non-cooperative game theory with a utility function, the model of the power distribution of terminal in cooperative transmission can be built. Experiments have proven the correctness of the designed model and superiority, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed power-control idea.	cooperative mimo;correctness (computer science);game theory;interference (communication);multipoint ground;signal-to-noise ratio;streaming media;utility;verification and validation	Shuili Zhang;Wen Ji;Bo-Wei Chen;Yiqiang Chen	2014	The 2014 5th International Conference on Game Theory for Networks	10.1109/GAMENETS.2014.7043731	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	33.24158116272474	94.14136939849395	189861

The optimal solution of joint subcarrier assignment (user and relay selections) and power allocation is obtained by solving a dual problem. We derive the necessary conditions for the optimal power allocation and propose a suboptimal algorithm with a closed-form based general power allocation solution. This suboptimal algorithm, as numerical results verify that, suffers from minor performance loss against that achievable by the optimal solution when SNR is high. It is observed that the corresponding closed-form power allocation yields 8% performance gain when compared with the equal power allocation.	duality (optimization);elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo;memory management;numerical analysis;numerical method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;weight function	Yuan-Bin Lin;Wu-Hsiu Wu;Yu Ted Su	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362837	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Embedded	34.76351149938932	90.21358207670993	190091
93a80aad9f00ae3a6e396a2d07cec04e6e8cf0fa	a joint time and frequency domains utility-based packet scheduler for mobile wimax networks		Mobile WiMAX represents a broadband wireless solution that enables the convergence of mobile and fixed broadband networks through a common wide area broadband radio access technology and flexible network architecture. IEEE802.16e standard for Mobile WiMAX system is based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme and allows sub-channelization in both uplink and downlink connections. Different sub-channelization schemes were proposed and implemented for Mobile WiMAX standard. Among them, AMC allows the exploitation of multi-user diversity over frequency domain, in that sub-channels may be allocated to users according to their frequency response over each band of sub-carriers comprising each sub-channel. This multi-user diversity can provide significant gains in overall system capacity if each sub-channel is opportunistically assigned to the user resulting in the highest gain, and therefore using the most efficient modulation and coding scheme. As the frequency diversity is lost with AMC this mode of channelization is more appropriate for fixed and low-mobility applications and/or with the use of Adaptive Antenna Systems (AAS) because these scenarios are associated to better SINR ratios.This article extends the work performed in by proposing a new joint scheduling and resource allocation algorithms for Mobile WiMAX system. The scheduler is based on the two degrees of freedom which results from the definition of radio resources over both time and frequency domains in the TDD OFDMA frame standardized by IEEE802.16e.	network scheduler	Alberto Nascimento;Jonathan Rodriguez	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-35155-6_15	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Metrics	27.71405435240323	88.96205760163608	190439

By deriving an equivalent form for the SINR constraints and an upper bound for the relay power, the problem can be tackled by solving a semi-definite program (SDP). Results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms significantly a conventional robust approach in terms of the transmitted power, and has only a mild increase in power if compared to the non-robust optimum which fails to meet the SINR targets.	beamforming;best, worst and average case;channel state information;coefficient;emoticon;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;peer-to-peer;relay;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications network;while	Dong Zheng;Ju Liu;Kai-Kit Wong;He Chen;Lei Chen	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.021612.111953	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;interference;channel state information;quadratic programming;statistics;robustness;satisfiability;technology	EDA	37.880747949070376	89.96398775075399	190476

In this paper, we formulate a max-min resource allocation problem for video traffic in NOMA-based cognitive wireless networks as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The max-min video transmission problem is subject to the constraints of maximum accessed user number at each subchannel, total available energy of each secondary user, video encoding characteristics, and interference power threshold. To solve the formulated MINLP problem, we divide it into two subproblems, i.e., a power allocation and secondary user scheduling subproblem, and a video packet scheduling subproblem. First, we apply a successive convex approximation to transform the joint power allocation and secondary user scheduling subproblem into a bi-convex programming problem. Second, the binary search and dual decomposition methods are combined to obtain the approximated optimal power allocation and secondary user scheduling solutions. Finally, we propose a heuristic packet scheduling algorithm. Simulation numerical results show that the proposed algorithm improves the video quality and guarantees the fairness among different secondary users.	approximation algorithm;binary search algorithm;cognitive network;concave function;convex optimization;data compression;digital subchannel;exptime;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;heuristic;interference (communication);lagrangian relaxation;linear programming;loss function;maxima and minima;network packet;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;power domains;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency	Lei Xu;Yong Zhou;Ping Wang;Wanli Liu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2854584	control theory;computer science;wireless network;network packet;real-time computing;resource allocation;approximation algorithm;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;cognitive radio;video quality	Mobile	32.005289412211404	91.8846172221832	190482

According to different degrees of information sharing within the engaged network, both a joint and a distributed solution are proposed respectively trying to determine the most appropriate power control strategy along with the user scheduling policy. The joint power control and user scheduling scheme with full access to the network information is capable of gaining considerable enhancement on the network capacity and also a performance improvement for users suffering from strong intercell interferences. The distributed scheme with the same purpose manages to adapt the power control and user scheduling strategy on the basis of dynamic programming with respect to both current and future utility of the network with only local information available. Numerical results have shown the advantages of the proposed schemes in achieving better spectral efficiency under both joint and distributed circumstances.	access network;catastrophic interference;control theory;dynamic programming;frequency divider;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency	Jia Zhang;Dongfeng Yuan;Haixia Zhang;Huimin Li	2013	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2012.0823	real-time computing;computer science;dynamic programming;mathematics;distributed computing	HPC	29.053830823854085	90.68368429885543	190613

Main objective is to maximize the utility of each secondary user (SU) making them more energy efficient. Quality of Service (QoS) levels of SUs are guaranteed by max-min fair signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) concept while maintaining QoS level of the primary user (PU), thus resulting in reliable operation by reducing the sum interference. Further, the applicability of the proposed novel pricing scheme and the algorithm is discussed with respect to a heterogeneous network with proper power and rate controlling. By reducing the sum power of SUs we explore the survival of cognitive users in a lowered interference threshold imposed by the primary network. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium and its Pareto efficiency is discussed. A novel power and rate control algorithm with a new pricing scheme is introduced to reach the Nash Equilibrium (NE). By using a common platform for rates and utilities, existing algorithms are compared through numerical analysis.	algorithm;coexist (image);cognitive radio;common platform;comparison sort;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);max-min fairness;maxima and minima;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical method;pareto efficiency;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	K.

A practical and promising architecture to achieve a better uplink throughput in the traditional CDMA cell is to locally aggregate mobile-generated traffic to some cluster heads through WLAN. Such an architecture opens up questions of the desired clustering structures as well as new uplink scheduling strategies. The scheduling of the aggregated traffic at the cluster heads (called relayed mobile terminals later) is investigated in this work. The proposed uplink scheduling algorithm takes the aggregated traffic nature into account. The scheduling goal is to achieve good throughput under the traffic QoS requirements (e.g. BER, bit-error-rates) and limited power budget at the mobile station. The proposed scheduling algorithm consists of two levels: (1) we use a proportional scheduling algorithm to coordinate the transmission among relaying mobile terminals (RMTs), where the main objective ...

The goal of the base stations is to jointly adjust the beamforming vectors so as to minimize the transmission powers while ensuring the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) requirement of individual users within the system, and keeping lower interference level to other systems which operate in the same frequency band and in the same region. This optimal beamforming problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratical programming (QCQP), and it is difficult to solve in general. In this paper, we give conditions under which strong duality holds, and propose an efficient algorithm for the optimal beamforming problem. First, we study rank-constrained solutions of a general separable semidefinite programming (SDP), and propose a rank reduction procedure to achieve a lower rank solution. Then we show that the SDP relaxation of a class of the optimal beamforming problem has a rank-one solution, which can be obtained by invoking the rank reduction procedure.	algorithm;beamforming;frequency band;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;quadratic equation;quadratically constrained quadratic program;semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;strong duality;telecommunications link	Yongwei Huang;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5206038	mathematical optimization;computer science;base station;control theory;mathematics;quadratic programming	Theory	36.28402338102949	89.82420505021484	190938

This introduces new challenges in bandwidth allocation among mobiles since the load characteristics of different networks must be taken into account to design efficient resource allocation algorithms. In this paper, we present bandwidth allocation and admission control algorithms based on bankruptcy game which is a special type of an N-person cooperative game. A coalition among the different wireless access networks is formed to offer bandwidth to a new connection. The stability of the allocation is analyzed by using the concept of the core and the amount of allocated bandwidth to a connection in each network is obtained by using Shapley value. Subsequently, an admission control algorithm is proposed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the behaviors of the proposed algorithms.	access network;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);game theory;load balancing (computing);memory management;microsoft outlook for mac;numerical analysis;numerical method;subject matter expert turing test;wireless access point	Dusit Niyato;Ekram Hossain	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255766	telecommunications;computer science;resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	29.063789337932572	95.21386052613256	191528

In such a case, there is a strong need for service differentiation, since the delay requirements of IoT applications may vary greatly from delay-tolerant metering applications to security applications with stringent requirements. This problem has been receiving significant interest from the research community in the context of the LTE-A random access channel. Most studies, however, consider load control schemes with few fixed service classes, which can provide limited service differentiation. We propose an alternative scheme where the load is controlled by the price announced by the base station. The proposed method controls the load effectively and provides negligible delay for messages with the highest priority. It also enables low-cost wireless access to delay-tolerant messages by generating most of the revenue from high-priority messages. We derive pricing-based load control schemes for throughput and revenue maximization, and present the relationship between delay, revenue, and cost in both schemes. Our results suggest that dynamic pricing is a promising solution for major problems associated with cellular M2M traffic.	compaq lte;differentiated service;ecosystem;expectation–maximization algorithm;giga-updates per second;machine to machine;network congestion;random access;requirement;semiconductor industry;smart device;throughput	Mehmet Koseoglu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2644667	pricing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;computer security;computer network	Mobile	29.3615303144695	95.86067176578129	191630

Then, these nonconvex and discontinuous constraints are dropped allowing for the realization of a pool of relaxed candidate solutions, from which various randomization techniques are utilized with the hope to recover the optimal solutions. However, it has been shown that such approach fails to deliver satisfactory outcomes in many practical settings, wherein the determined solutions are found to be unacceptably far from the actual optimality. On the contrary, we in this contribution tackle the aforementioned optimal beamforming problems differently by representing them as SDPs with additional reverse convex (but continuous) constraints. Nonsmooth optimization algorithms are then proposed to locate the optimal solutions of such design problems in an efficient manner. Our thorough numerical examples verify that the proposed algorithms offer almost global optimality whilst requiring relatively low computational load.	algorithm;beamforming;cognitive radio;computation;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;multicast;numerical analysis;numerical method;randomized algorithm;semidefinite programming;while	Anh Huy Phan;Hoang Duong Tuan;Ha Hoang Kha;Duy Trong Ngo	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2189857	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;quadratic programming	Visualization	38.11005925236108	90.79220125893447	191673

However, cellular usage is still increasing exponentially with hungry applications demanding higher data rates. As a result, designers are facing significant challenge in meeting the required demands. One promising solutions, being fostered by the 3GPP, is to increase the spectral efficiency through higher frequency reuse using smaller and denser network cells such as femto, pico and nano cells. One of the main challenges behind using smaller cells is managing interference. In this paper, we propose two novel solutions that alleviate the interference of femto-cells on macro-cell user equipment (MUEs). The solutions do not rely on any additional information exchange or signaling, nor do they rely on the backhaul and it’s delay. The first proposal is Femto-cell Power Control Scheme (FPCS) that utilizes an analytical approach to adapt the femto base station’s transmit power based on Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reports from affected MUEs. The second method is Random Physical Resource Block Selection Scheme (RPSS) that allocates the femto-cell’s resources from a random subset of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) so that the MUEs benefit from a reduced interference level. Our evaluations have shown that the two proposals do alleviate the femtocell interference significantly, increasing the SINR and enhancing the end performance. To the best of our knowledge, no similar work exist in literature that addresses the femto-cell’s interference without information exchange.	backhaul (telecommunications);best, worst and average case;gnu nano;information exchange;information theory;interference (communication);shannon (unit);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;video	Ramón Agüero;Thomas Zinner;Rossitza Goleva;Andreas Timm-Giel;Phuoc Tran-Gia	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-16292-8	internet privacy;computer science	Mobile	25.647857121748455	90.51237414507406	191830

However, the severe interference between D2D and cellular networks may lead to performance decrease of D2D and cellular communication. In this paper, we concentrate on suppressing the interference between D2D users and cellular networks when D2D communication reuses the cellular resources in downlink. An efficient resource allocation scheme is proposed to manage the interference between D2D and cellular networks. First, the mutual interference is restricted under the constraints by adopting the interference limited area control method. After that, the resources are assigned to D2D users to improve the sum rate of cellular communication and D2D communication. Besides, the simulation results are presented and analyzed. Finally, we conclude that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the total capacity of cellular and D2D communication, while at the same time suppressing the mutual interference.	interference (communication);mobile phone;overhead (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Xiaohang Chen;Li Chen;Mengxian Zeng;Xin Zhang;Dacheng Yang	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362746	throughput;telecommunications link;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	28.888407434633937	90.05054209853847	191841

This paper addresses the problem of load balancing (LB) for multi-hop cellular network (MCN) with fixed relays such as LTE-A network in the context of SON. The designed SON algorithm, namely RSPC-RL, is based on two ideas: relay node reference signal power control (RSPC) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). In the proposed RSPC-RL algorithm, the relay node is modeled as an agent that learns an optimal policy of reference signal power control from its interaction with environment to balance the load distribution of the network through dynamically changing its coverage area. Numerical results show the significant performance gain brought about by the proposed algorithm RSPC-RL.	access network;algorithm;compaq lte;lattice boltzmann methods;load balancing (computing);multi-agent system;next-generation network;numerical method;organizing (structure);rl (complexity);reinforcement learning;relay;self-organization;self-organizing map;software deployment;telecommunications link	Chuan Ma;Rui Yin;Guanding Yu;Jietao Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362829	algorithm design;throughput;real-time computing;next-generation network;telecommunications;power control;resource allocation;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	26.822706901681432	91.4659575214005	192143

For this three-node network, the beamforming design needs to suppress self-interference (SI). While a traditional way is to apply zero forcing (ZF) for SI mitigation, it may harm the desired signals. In this paper, a design that reserves a fraction of SI  is proposed by solving a quality-of-service (QoS) constrained beamforming design problem. Since the problem is challenging due to the loop SI, a convergence-guaranteed alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to jointly design the relay–user beamformers. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms ZF method and achieves a transmit power value close to the ideal case.	algorithm;ambient occlusion;beamforming;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical method;quality of service;relay channel;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Zhigang Wen;Shuai Wang;Xiaoqing Liu;Junwei Zou	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2583261	electronic engineering;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;wsdma;interference;silicon;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	36.072317142214985	90.28892389869927	192178
26bcd6ef4ab7041cd928d7b2e4f78d2531d7ea0a	user pre-scheduling and beamforming with imperfect csi in 5g fog radio access networks		We investigate the user-to-cell association (or userclustering) and beamforming design for Cloud Radio Access Networks (CRANs) and Fog Radio Access Networks (FogRANs) for 5G. CRAN enables cloud centralized resource and power allocation optimization over all the small cells served by multiple Access Points (APs). However, the fronthaul links connecting each AP to the cloud introduce delays and cause outdated Channel State Information (CSI). By contrast, FogRAN enables lower latencies and better CSI qualities, at the cost of local optimization. To alleviate these issues, we propose a hybrid algorithm exploiting both the centralized feature of the cloud for globally-optimized pre-scheduling using outdated CSIs and the distributed nature of FogRAN for accurate beamforming with high quality CSIs. The centralized phase enables to consider the interference patterns over the global network, while the distributed phase allows for latency reduction. Simulation results show that our hybrid algorithm for FogRAN outperforms the centralized algorithm under imperfect CSI, both in terms of throughput and delays.	beamforming;centralized computing;channel state information;cloud computing;cluster analysis;display resolution;global network;hybrid algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network packet;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;throughput	Nicolas Pontois;Megumi Kaneko;Thi Ha Ly Dinh;Lila Boukhatem	2018	CoRR		throughput;channel state information;local search (optimization);hybrid algorithm;cloud computing;scheduling (computing);access network;beamforming;computer network;computer science	Mobile	28.9806950504234	91.41345995492935	192293

Specifically, we focused on the delay constraints modeling in this paper, since it is a fundamental QoS requirement for all real-time services. To simultaneously meet the delay constraints of all users, we first modeled this resource allocation problem with specific delay restrictions as a bargaining game. Based on the Nash bargaining solution, we derived the system utility function that achieves delay constraints in a long term. Then, we formulated the resource allocation problem as an optimization problem through the weighted sum rate maximization, which can be solved by a modified iterative water-filling algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed resource allocation algorithm not only achieves delay requirements for different realtime services, but also obtains the Pareto optimal efficiency with acceptable complexity.	channel capacity;entropy maximization;game theory;iterative method;mathematical optimization;microwave;multi-user mimo;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;pf (firewall);pareto efficiency;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link;utility;water filling algorithm;weight function	Lei Zhong;Yusheng Ji	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6213981	bargaining problem;optimization problem;cellular network;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;quality of service;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;iterative method;wireless;mimo	Embedded	28.78893730699321	93.65798357640026	192322

The downlink resource allocation problem with different BS power constraints is studied for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system with adaptive MIMO transmission. Joint design of the linear transmit and receive beamformers in a MIMO multiuser transmission subject to per BS power constraints is considered. A solution for the weighted sum rate maximization problem is proposed. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide a very efficient solution despite of the fact that the global optimality cannot be guaranteed due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem. Moreover, efficient resource allocation method based on zero forcing transmission is provided. The impact of the size of a SHO region, the overhead from the increased resource utilization, and different inter-cell interference distributions due to the SHO are evaluated by system level simulations. Although the overhead from the SHO processing can be significant, it can be mitigated by using space division multiple access for users having an identical SHO active set composition. The users located at the SHO region may enjoy from greatly increased transmission rates. This translates to significant overall system level gains from the cooperative SHO processing.	active set method;catastrophic interference;cooperative mimo;downtime;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;global optimization;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;overhead (computing);region-based memory management;simulation;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;weight function;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Antti Tölli;Marian Codreanu;Markku J.

In this paper, we propose a multi-stage hybrid scheduling scheme for codebook-based precoding system, which applies different scheduling methods at different scheduling stages for selecting user equipments (UEs). In detail, we employ different scheduling algorithms when the appropriate UE or UE sets are selected within the same precoding vector, within the same precoding matrix, and within the codebook, respectively, so that we could finely adjust the balance between capacity and fairness. Computer simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively fills the performance gap between pure maximum carrier-to-interference (C/I) power ratio and pure proportional fairness (PF) methods, and provides an important means at the MAC layer to lever between aggregate cellular throughput and geometry-specific per-user fairness, in order to meet the requirements of more precise quality of service (QoS) provision for future mobile communication systems.	access control;aggregate data;algorithm;codebook;computer simulation;fairness measure;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;phy (chip);proportionally fair;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);spatial multiplexing;throughput;user interface	Jingxiu Liu;Xiaoming She;Lan Chen;Hidekazu Taoka	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.321	computer simulation;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;maximum throughput scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	30.366382080507716	89.51264689969616	192479

However, their autonomous movements, limited resources and security risks impact the quality of services. In this article, we propose a data acquisition model using stable matching of bipartite graph in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems, namely, DAS. Contents are distributed to roadside units, while vehicular nodes support supplementary storage. The original distribution problem is formulated as a stable matching problem of bipartite graph, where the data and the storage cells compose two sides of vertices. Regarding the factors relevant with the access ratio and delay, the preference rankings for contents and roadside units are calculated, respectively. With a multi-replica preprocessing algorithm to handle the potential one-to-many mapping, the matching problem is addressed in polynomial time. In addition, vehicular nodes carry and forward assistant contents to deliver the failed packets because of bandwidth competition. Furthermore, an incentive strategy is put forward to boost the vehicle cooperation and to achieve a fair bandwidth allocation at roadside units. Experiments show that DAS achieves a high access ratio and a small storage cost with an acceptable delay.	algorithm;allocation;autonomous robot;cell (microprocessor);data acquisition;download;drug vehicle;experiment;graph - visual representation;greater than;matching;movement;numerous;one-to-many (data model);one-to-one (data model);polynomial;preprocessor;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;stable marriage problem;time complexity;vehicle-to-vehicle;amsonic acid;contents - htmllinktype	Xiaolan Tang;Donghui Hong;Wenlong Chen	2017		10.3390/s17061327	time complexity;vehicular ad hoc network;network packet;data acquisition;bipartite graph;stable marriage problem;distributed computing;bandwidth allocation;bandwidth (signal processing);computer science	DB	29.84965648255324	97.0561660177773	192586

For the sum rate maximization problem under a total power constraint, the existing beamformer designs in the literature are based on the QR decomposition (QRD), which is used to satisfy the ZF constraints. However, the optimality of the QRD-based design has been unknown previously. In this paper, we prove that the QRD-based design is optimal for ZF-DPC for any performance measure under a sum power constraint. For the per-antenna power constraints, the QRD-based designs become suboptimal, and we propose an optimal design, using a convex optimization framework. Low-complexity suboptimal designs are also presented, and numerically shown to achieve a significant fraction of the sum rate provided by the optimal design.	beamforming;convex optimization;deferred procedure call;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;optimal design;qr decomposition;quantum well;system analysis;triangular matrix;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Le-Nam Tran;Markku J.

On the other hand, full-duplex transmission is an emerging technology which can theoretically double the data rate. and hence enhance the performance of wireless networks significantly. In this work, we address the problem of distributed power control in a two-tier network with full-duplex small cells underlaying one macro cell in a co-channel deployment scenario. We first formulate the corresponding distributed power control problem as a non-cooperative game and then extend it to a repeated game with imperfect public monitoring. The repeated game setting is used as it can withstand cheating. We show the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium of the formulated non-cooperative game and characterize the set of perfect public equilibrium for the repeated game. A two phase distributed algorithm is then proposed to achieve a power profile which is also a perfect public equilibrium. The power control algorithm is cheat-proof and needs only a small amount of information exchange among network nodes. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown using numerical results. Our proposed algorithm and analysis are also valid for a half-duplex system as it is a special case of the full-duplex model presented in the paper.	data rate units;distributed algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);information exchange;multitier architecture;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;operating point;organizing (structure);self-organization;simulation;software deployment	Prabodini Semasinghe;Ekram Hossain	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511568	simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	32.554509892336995	93.73230505375982	192893

We formulate the resource allocation and interference coordination problem as proportional fairness based utility maximization problem. Interference has been minimized through time, frequency, and space domain resource allocation. The proposed 3D scheme utilizes two time slots for intercell interference management, geometrical position based frequency resource allocation for intracell interference mitigation, and frequency domain orthogonality across UEs and relays for inter-UE and UE-relays interference management. The relaxed convex optimization problem has been solved through Lagrange multipliers and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulations have been performed according to the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) standard parameters for relay-enhanced LTE networks. Simulation results show the efficacy of proposed 3D scheme as compared to the already presented 3 slots time domain interference coordination (TD-IC) with round robin (RR-TD-IC) and proportional fairness (PF-TD-IC) schemes. It has been observed that proposed 3D scheme provides 81% increase in average individual throughput at the cost of only 13.8% degradation in fairness as compared to the PF-TD-IC.	algorithm;compaq lte;computer simulation;convex optimization;elegant degradation;entropy maximization;fairness measure;interference (communication);karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;proportionally fair;relay;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);statistical interference;telecommunications link;throughput;time–frequency analysis;tucker decomposition	Irfan Ahmed;Mohsin Khan	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952559	telecommunications;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	32.24291080565651	90.55488324553214	193055

The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem with non-convex feasible region and hence is difficult to solve. A primal-dual infeasible-interior-point method (IIPM) is applied to jointly optimize resources. With this method, simultaneously optimizing the Base Station Association (BSA) and Power Allocation (PA) is possible. Further to reduce the size, the problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The NP-hard Integer Programming (IP) BSA subproblem from the decomposition is solved by two different methods. One method uses the IIPM and other uses a Semidefinite Programming formulation. The PA subproblem is solved iteratively by IIPM. Simulation results converge to the optimum obtained by an existing exhaustive search. Apart from the sum-rate objective, the IIPM is applicable to broad class of utility functions and objectives and it also eliminates the requirement of an initial primal feasible point to begin the algorithm.	analysis of algorithms;brute-force search;converge;emoticon;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;feasible region;ip address blocking;integer programming;interior point method;iteration;iterative method;multi-user;np-hardness;natural language processing;nonlinear programming;quality of service;semidefinite programming;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Krishna Chitti;Quan Kuang;Joachim Speidel	2013	2013 IEEE 14th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2013.6612001	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;operations management;mathematics	Robotics	31.8921450918529	92.19902675799686	193112

A recent growing interest is the coordination among WLAN providers for efficient network management. When multiple WLANs co-locate in a small geographic vicinity, the lack of cooperative multi- domain resource management can cause significant performance degradation due to inter-domain interference. Moreover, since WLANs often operate in unlicensed frequency bands shared by various public and private networks, they must cope with the dynamic RF environment involving a diverse set of interference sources. This paper introduces a new cooperative resource management framework for multi-domain WLANs operating in an interference environment. Under the proposed scheme, resource utilization and co-channel interference can be adaptively balanced across the entire integrated system. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes without inter-domain cooperation or without the consideration of environmental interference.	cost efficiency;elegant degradation;frequency band;inter-domain;interference (communication);private network;radio frequency;simulation	Jiang Xie;Ivan Howitt	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.324	network management;integrable system;in situ resource utilization;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;co-channel interference;computer network	Mobile	26.85480691911244	90.30130258629083	193536

46d8612ee52a0d608a7e02a237db61ffd233a071	artificial noise aided secure cognitive beamforming for cooperative miso-noma using swipt		Cognitive radio (CR) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been deemed two promising technologies due to their potential to achieve high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. This paper studies a multiple-input single-output NOMA CR network relying on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer conceived for supporting a massive population of power limited battery-driven devices. In contrast to most of the existing works, which use an ideally linear energy harvesting model, this study applies a more practical non-linear energy harvesting model. In order to improve the security of the primary network, an artificial-noise-aided cooperative jamming scheme is proposed. The artificial-noise-aided beamforming design problems are investigated subject to the practical secrecy rate and energy harvesting constraints. Specifically, the transmission power minimization problems are formulated under both perfect channel state information (CSI) and the bounded CSI error model. The problems formulated are non-convex, hence they are challenging to solve. A pair of algorithms either using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or a cost function are proposed for solving these problems. Our simulation results show that the proposed cooperative jamming scheme succeeds in establishing secure communications and NOMA is capable of outperforming the conventional orthogonal multiple access in terms of its power efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that the cost function algorithm outperforms the SDR-based algorithm.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;cognitive radio;convex function;convex optimization;etsi satellite digital radio;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;linear programming relaxation;loss function;nonlinear system;oma;performance per watt;radio jamming;relaxation (approximation);secure communication;simulation;spectral efficiency;system analysis	Fuhui Zhou;Zheng Chu;Haijian Sun;Apostolos Papathanassiou;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2018	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2018.2824622	channel state information;real-time computing;cognitive radio;computer engineering;wireless;jamming;beamforming;population;computer science;artificial noise;spectral efficiency	Mobile	37.29963702267796	90.22625293800722	193831
087e13a3c788255274ec20dab13d96ec6b4a694f	energy-saving predictive resource planning and allocation		Predictive resource allocation is an emerging approach to improve the performance of mobile systems as human behavior is reported predictable by leveraging big data analytics. Yet what information can be predicted by big data, what information need to be predicted for wireless access optimization, how to translate the information, and how to exploit the synthetic knowledge for allocating radio resources are not well understood and largely explored. In this paper, we are concerned with the latter two issues. In particular, we devise an energy-saving resource planning and allocation policy for multiple base stations (BSs) to serve mobile users with non-real-time (NRT) traffic by exploiting the user, network, and application levels of context information, where RT traffic may occupy partial resources of each BS. Inspired by the solution from an energy minimization problem with future instantaneous information, a low complexity multi-timescale predictive policy is proposed. Upon the arrival of each NRT user request, the resource planning is made with the user and network level context information, defined as the average channel gains of the NRT users and the statistics of residual bandwidth after serving RT traffic, with which the scheduling, power allocation, and BS sleeping can be accomplished after instantaneous channel information and residual network resource are available at each BS in each time slot. Simulation results show that the proposed policy can dramatically reduce the energy consumed by the BSs for serving the NRT traffic.	big data;energy minimization;enterprise resource planning;flow network;information needs;mathematical optimization;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;synthetic intelligence	Chuting Yao;Chenyang Yang;Zixiang Xiong	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2608822	resource allocation	Mobile	25.64797924363399	94.77638468319707	193866

We first investigate two carrier load balancing methods for allocating the CCs to the users- Round Robin (RR) and Mobile Hashing (MH) balancing by means of a simple theoretical formulation, as well as system level simulations. At Layer-2 we propose a simple cross-CC packet scheduling algorithm that improves the coverage performance and the resource allocation fairness among users, as compared to independent scheduling per CC. The Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced is selected for the case study of a multi-carrier system. In such a system, RR provides better performance than MH balancing, and the proposed simple scheduling algorithm is shown to be effective in providing up to 90% coverage gain with no loss of the overall cell throughput, as compared to independent scheduling per CC.	algorithm;code coverage;compaq lte;elegant degradation;fairness measure;load balancing (computing);modified huffman coding;multi-user;multiplexing;network packet;next-generation network;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Yuanye Wang;Klaus I.

Recently, a new dimension for improving the system performance of TDD based wireless systems has been introduced to the 3GPP standards: Dynamic TDD, which allows cell-specific frame configurations and cell-specific control of the Transmit Order (TO). In this paper, we propose unleashing the TO options in the context of MCNs where base stations are coordinated via a central controller for effective base-station-to-base-station interference cancellation (B2B-IC), and we investigate the corresponding performance improvements. Simulation results for an MCN including macro, micro, pico, femto and small cell networks operating in the same spectrum show that the TO with B2B-IC in MCN provide remarkable performance improvements at the expense of an increase in the signal exchange among the centralized controller and the base stations.	algorithm;centralized computing;channel capacity;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;pico;simulation;test-driven development	Zekeriya Uykan;Riku Jäntti	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289129	single antenna interference cancellation;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;mobile station;computer network	Mobile	25.645394741770467	89.31421683708496	193994

In doing so, we utilize the worst case robust optimization to keep the interference caused by SUs to each primary base station below a given threshold, and satisfy each SU's quality of service in terms of its required SINR for all realizations of uncertain parameters. We model each uncertain parameter by a bounded distance between its estimated and exact values, and formulate the robust power allocation problem via protection values for constraints. We demonstrate that the convexity of our problem is preserved, and converts into a geometric programming problem, which we solve via a distributed algorithm by using Lagrange dual decomposition. To reduce the cost of robustness, defined as the reduction in the social utility of SUs and the increase in message passing, we utilize the D-norm approach to trade off between robustness and optimality, and propose a distributed power allocation algorithm with infrequent message passing.

Results have shown the feasibility of the proposed approach, superior improvements on network performance and a capacity increase of 23%.

7014ea49294111e41a65eb487d65ba3090b78da0	transfer learning and cooperation management: balancing the quality of service and information exchange overhead in cognitive radio networks		This paper introduces and studies a novel solution of transfer learning applied to spectrum management in cognitive radio networks in order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and convergence performance of conventional full distributed learning. Cooperation management has been investigated to enhance transfer learning as a novel way of reducing the need for control information exchange between distributed cognitive agents while providing the same effective QoS as that achieved in a fully coordinated network. A structured approach is taken to transfer learning, including a source agent selection function defining how the agents exchange learning information, and a target agent training function reinforcing the knowledgebase. It is demonstrated in simulation and analysis that transfer learning achieves a significantly higher QoS and throughput than distributed reinforcement learning. The cooperation management algorithm is shown to effectively reduce the need for information exchange by 90 per cent whilst still providing adequate QoS compared with a fully coordinated network.

This paper investigates the resource management problem with the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding for the distributed large-scale multiple-input multiple-output cloud radio access network (DLS MIMO C-RAN) which consists of a large number of spatially distributed remote radio heads (RRHs). The challenges of this power allocation problem arise from the presence of both interference and imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Therefore, the C-RAN based power allocation schemes are designed to efficiently allocate the transmit power of each RRH. Moreover, the large random matrix theory is applied to derive the asymptotic expressions for large number of antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can provide better energy efficiency with the consideration of quality-of-service (QoS) support.	approximation;c-ran;channel state information;dls format;interference (communication);mimo;quality of service;radio access network;remote radio head;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter	Pei-Rong Li;Tain-Sao Chang;Kai-Ten Feng	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952532	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;spatial multiplexing;precoding;computer network;mimo	Mobile	31.474640216472423	91.02512857589653	194698

They include maximizing throughput under the constraint of the overall transmit power, minimizing the overall transmit power while guaranteeing the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) requirements, and maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under the constraints of minimum SE requirements and overall transmit power. The optimization problems for the first two criteria are signomial programming (SP) problems when considering the interference among the mobile stations (MSs), which are nonlinear nonconvex and do not lead to the closed-form solutions directly. Exploiting the nature of geometric mean, we transform the SP problems into geometric programming (GP) problems, which can be solved by turning them into convex problems. For the third criterion, using the theorem of fractional programming, we first transform the fractional optimization problem into an equivalent optimization problem in a subtractive form, which is an SP problem. We then obtain its solution by transforming the SP to the GP problem as we have done for the previous two problems. Based on these design criteria, three power allocation algorithms are developed for the downlink multiuser DAS. Depending on the application environments, we can use the first and second criteria to achieve the highest throughput and to save energy, respectively, while balancing throughput and energy consumption using the third criterion.	algorithm;convex optimization;fractional programming;geometric programming;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;memory management;multi-user;nonlinear system;optimization problem;regular expression;requirement;signomial;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Chunlong He;Geoffrey Ye Li;Fu-Chun Zheng;Xiaohu You	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2382971	programming;design;mathematical optimization;throughput;electronic engineering;transmission;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Mobile	36.250701116163036	90.28626821479013	194764

Relays have been proposed as an energy-efficient alternative to network densification. However, deploying relays requires additional planning and infrastructure, which can be costly or even prohibitive for very dense networks. The Double Relay Communication Protocol (DRCP) [1] increases the spectral efficiency by combining spatial diversity and network coding principles. In contrast to other schemes based on relays, DRCP does not require deploying additional relays since it uses base stations as relays. However, its potential for providing an energy-efficient solution has not been explored yet. Therefore, in this paper we propose a power control mechanism that increases the energy efficiency of DRCP, while still achieving a larger spectral efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.	communications protocol;linear network coding;relay;spectral efficiency	Rodolfo Torrea Duran;Fernando Rosas;Sofie Pollin;Luc Vandendorpe;Marc Moonen	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536880	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	25.13748233141052	89.51589725283752	194953

We endow each device with the ability to learn its optimal cooperation strategy online in order to maximize its long-term utility in the dynamic network environment. We investigate the impact of the token exchange system on the overall downlink network performance and the performance of individual devices in various deployment scenarios involving mixtures of high and low mobility users. Our results suggest that devices have the greatest incentive to cooperate when the network contains many highly mobile users (e.g., users in motor vehicles). Moreover, within the token system, devices can effectively learn to cooperate online, and achieve over 20% higher throughput on average than with direct transmission alone, all while selfishly maximizing their own utility.	algorithm;compaq lte;decision problem;markov chain;markov decision process;network performance;relay;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput	Nicholas Mastronarde;Viral Patel;Jie Xu;Mihaela van der Schaar	2013	2013 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824980	simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;lte advanced;operating system;computer network	Mobile	31.280489520238472	95.32098363134435	195274

The objectives are to provide quality of service (QoS) to both real-time and non-real-time services for SUs, and optimize the system throughput. Based on aggressive sharing method, we quantify these goals by analyzing (i) a joint power control and interference cancellation to guarantee the performance in primary system; (ii) a cross-layer and dual problem method to transform MAC-layer QoS requirements to PHY-layer; (iii) the convex optimization to solve the problem of the system.

The proposed cross-layer design takes into account the effects of imperfect channel-state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) in slow fading. The rate, power, and subcarrier allocation policies are optimized to maximize the system goodput (in bits per second per hertz successfully received by the users). The optimization problem is solved by using dual decomposition, resulting in a highly scalable distributed iterative resource-allocation algorithm. We also investigate the asymptotic performance of the proposed scheduler with respect to (w.r.t.) the numbers of users and relays. We find that the number of relays should grow faster than the number of users to fully exploit the multiuser diversity (MUD) gain. On the other hand, diversity from multiple relays can be exploited to enhance system performance when the MUD gain is saturated due to noise amplification at the AF relays. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback-reduction scheme to reduce the computational burden and the required amount of CSI feedback from the users to the relays. Simulation results confirm the derived analytical results for the growth of the system goodput and illustrate that the proposed distributed cross-layer scheduler only requires a small number of iterations to achieve practically the same performance as the optimal centralized scheduler, even if the information exchanged between the base station (BS) and the relays in each iteration is quantized, and the proposed CSI feedback reduction scheme is employed.	anisotropic filtering;centralized computing;channel state information;convex optimization;data rate units;distributed algorithm;duality (optimization);goodput;iteration;lagrangian relaxation;mud;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;relay;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;transmitter	Derrick Wing Kwan Ng;Robert Schober	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378812	radio repeater;optimization problem;electronic engineering;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;base station;resource management;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;fading;computer network	Mobile	35.60022094908042	89.84487766696206	195559

A large number of applications demand for primary user behavior correlation in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the statistical relationship of primary users by introducing a Bayesian network (BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing issue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community. To solve such an issue in CR, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme which incurs significantly lower computational complexity compared with previous ones. Thus, with this scheme, cognitive users could efficiently understand the statistical pattern of primary networks.	bayesian network;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;machine learning;requirement	Weijia Han;Huiyan Sang;Min Sheng;Jiandong Li;Shuguang Cui	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249094	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;statistics	Robotics	27.831651999702732	99.2145749873789	195922

108c2a5e28a4bd55ad4d1cf8ac6de587cb003aca	energy efficiency and capacity tradeoff in cloud radio access network of high-speed railways		To meet the increasing demand of high-data-rate services of high-speed railway (HSR) passengers, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is proposed. This paper investigates the tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) performance and capacity in C-RAN of HSR. Considering that the train location can be predicted, we propose a predictable path loss based time domain power allocation method (PPTPA) to improve EE performance of HSR communication system. First, we consider that the communication system of HSR only bears the passenger information services (PISs). The energy-efficient power allocation problem with delay constraint is studied. The formulated problem is nonconvex. To deal with it, an equivalent convex problem is reformulated. Based on PPTPA, we propose an iterative algorithm to improve the EE performance. Second, we consider that the PISs and the train control services (TCSs) are all bore. A capacity optimization problemwith joint EE and services transmission delay constraints is formulated. Based on PPTPA, we propose a hybrid power allocation scheme to improve the capacity of the system. Finally, we analyze the effect of small-scale fading on EE performance. The effectiveness of the proposed power allocation algorithm is validated by HSR channel measurement trace based emulation results and extensive simulation results.	algorithm;c-ran;capacity optimization;channel capacity;convex optimization;emulator;entropy maximization;hierarchical state routing;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;radio access network;regular expression;simulation;social inequality	Shichao Li;Qian Yang;Siyu Lin;Qian Gao;Lei Xiong;Weiliang Xie;Xiaoyu Qiao	2017	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2017/5816862	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	30.482109418164015	91.88573841395115	196232

In order to encourage primary users (PUs) to share their idle spectrum resources with secondary users (SUs), spectrum trading frameworks are developed. In this paper, the investment problem of spectrum service provider (SSP) is considered which obtains spectrum from PUs and provides service to multiple SUs. The SUs' actions are estimated according to statistical data. A estimation method for channels number is proposed basing on maximizing the SSP's investment income. A Markov chain model is used to analyze the SSP's state transition and calculate the SU's waiting time and queuing size by queuing theory. The optimal number of channels is deduced with marginal analysis theory. In either spectrum purchase or auction, the SSP could adjust its investment strategy timely and flexibly according to these parameters.	cognitive network;cognitive radio;experiment;global serializability;marginal model;markov chain;queueing theory;simulation;spectrum reallocation;user experience	Lu Wang;Zhong Zhou;Wei Wu	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6953091	telecommunications	Metrics	27.802790167033034	98.17103458244296	196333

Most existing works either propose myopic solutions for multi-user video transmission, in which the resource allocation and packet scheduling is designed to maximize the short-term video quality, or propose foresighted packet scheduling solutions for single-user video transmission which maximize the long-term video quality. In this work, we propose foresighted resource allocation and packet scheduling solutions for multi-user video transmission. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity algorithm in which the BS updates the prices of resources for each user and the users make individual packet scheduling decisions based on the prices. The algorithm can be implemented by the BS and the users in a decentralized manner, and converges to the optimal prices under which the users' optimal decisions maximize the long-term total video quality subject to per-user minimum video quality guarantees. Simulation results show 7 dB and 3 dB improvements in PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) over myopic solutions and existing foresighted solutions, respectively.	algorithm;decibel;multi-user;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling (computing);simulation;video	Yuanzhang Xiao;Mihaela van der Schaar	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853688	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	25.308625843272164	95.79332018621763	196734

We refer to this approach as overlay paradigm for cognitive radio and we compare this to the underlay paradigm, according to which cooperation techniques among primary and secondary users are not exploited. To model these schemes we make use of theory of exact potential games. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed games and we evaluate the outputs in terms of quality of service perceived by both primary and secondary users, outage probability and interference temperature, showing that the overlay paradigm for cognitive radio is a promising framework.	cognitive radio;downtime;interference (communication);programming paradigm;quality of service	Lorenza Giupponi;Christian Ibars	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073501	game theory;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	32.17791162132157	94.50003923523975	196865

Due to utilize OFDMA in downlink and SC-FDMA in uplink, the LTE system is expected to provide significantly high throughput with 20 MHz spectrum allocation. To increase the cell throughput and multi-user diversity gain, channel dependent scheduling (CDS) is implemented for the OFDMA-based multi-user scenario to allocate resource blocks (RBs) to users experiencing better channel conditions. Nevertheless, CDS may not perform well in SC-FDMA due to its two inherent constraints¿|one is contiguous RB assignment and the other is robust modulation and coding mode. In this paper, the formulation of resource allocation for a SC-FDMA system upon considering two inherent constraints is proposed. Since the optimization problem of resource allocation in SC-FDMA is NP-hard, we further propose two heuristic algorithms to find feasible solutions. We evaluate the proposed formulation and heuristic algorithms by conducting simulation. The simulation results show that our methods achieve significant performance improvement not only in system sum throughput but also in transmission delay.	algorithm;compaq lte;fairness measure;frequency allocation;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);icl;mathematical optimization;modulation;multi-user;multitier architecture;np-hardness;national supercomputer centre in sweden;optimization problem;scenario (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;ultraedit	Ching-Hsu Chang;Hsi-Lu Chao;Chia-Lung Liu	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093138	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	28.448461582507704	92.16031420692596	196971

We formulate the CSS problem as a programming problem, whose optimal solution is proved to exist but takes considerable time and energy to reach. We then propose two heuristic algorithms, i.e., Centralized Algorithm and Multi-oligarch Algorithm, to obtain sub-optimal solutions. A Revised Initialization algorithm is also presented to improve the performance of these two algorithms. Simulation results show that the two algorithms achieve sub-optimal solutions with efficiency and effectiveness.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;centralized computing;channel capacity;cognitive radio;heuristic;ibm systems network architecture;linear programming;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);simulation;vii	Xin Huang;Xinxin Feng;Hang Qiu;Xinbing Wang;Zhiyong Feng	2012	2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356853	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;probability;distributed computing;scheduling;channel capacity;statistics;computer network	Mobile	30.141102696927817	92.60565853644208	197028

The signal transmission from the base station to the single antenna users is completed in two time slots, where the relay receives the signal from the base station in the first time slot, and it then forwards the received signal to different users based on amplify and forward (AF) protocol. We propose a robust beamforming technique for a sum-power minimization problem with an imperfect channel state information (CSI) between the relay and the users. This robust scheme is developed based on the worst-case optimization framework and the Nemirovski Lemma by incorporating uncertainties in the CSI. The original optimization problem is divided into three subproblems due to joint nonconvexity in terms of beamforming vectors at the base station, the relay amplification matrix, and receiver coefficients. These subproblems are formulated into a convex optimization framework by exploiting the Nemirovski Lemma, and an iterative algorithm is developed by alternatively optimizing each of them with channel uncertainties. In addition, we provide an optimization framework to evaluate the achievable worst-case mean square error (MSE) of each user for a given set of design parameters. Simulation results are provided to validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm.		Kanapathippillai Cumanan;Zhiguo Ding;Yogachandran Rahulamathavan;Mehdi M.

In this context, the Cognitive Radio paradigm with opportunistic spectrum sharing has been proposed to overcome the limitations of a static spectrum allocation. A dynamic frequency assignment, however, is quite challenging especially for non-linear analog radio transmitters like professional wireless microphone systems with very high audio quality requirements. In this paper, we solve the future need of a dynamic resource allocation for such systems while taking into account internal and external constraints, like intermodulation products or emerging interference from other users. We formulate an optimization problem and propose a meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing that considers these constraints and minimizes received interference by our system. We evaluate the performance for a static and dynamic radio spectrum situation to demonstrate the strength of our approach.	algorithm;cognitive radio;data (computing);frequency allocation;heuristic;interference (communication);intermodulation;link distance;mathematical optimization;microphone;nonlinear system;offset (computer science);optimization problem;programme making and special events;programming paradigm;requirement;simulated annealing;spectral efficiency;transmitter;utility	Christoph König;Tobias Linde;María Dolores Pérez Guirao	2015	2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158088	channel allocation schemes;embedded system;cognitive radio;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;interference;co-channel interference;wireless;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Embedded	30.051105114239935	92.02771738305195	197373

In the system formulation, multi-cell co-channel interference as one of the critical factors in multi-cell processing has been taken into account and its effect on system performance is evaluated. It has been shown that the problem is in the form of combinatorial non-convex optimisation problems (NP-hard). Avoiding to solve NP-hard problem, the authors have made suboptimal solutions according to iterative methods to satisfy the system requirements in the best way. In this way, the resulting non-convex optimisation problem has been solved by dual Lagrangian decomposition, and iterative resource allocation algorithms are proposed to find solutions which satisfy Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. Two resource allocation strategies based on centralised and distributed scenarios are derived to maximise the average system throughput (bit/s/Hz) considering partial fairness. Simulation results indicate that the authors’ proposed methods work better than interference threshold methods and other conventional algorithms such as single cell methods which use local information processing.	algorithm;centralisation;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);fairness measure;frequency divider;information processing;interference (communication);iterative method;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mathematical optimization;memory management;np-hardness;relay;requirement;simulation;system requirements;throughput;tucker decomposition;weight function	Mohammad Hossein Moghaddam;Kamal Mohamed-Pour;Seyed Mehdi Hosseini Andargoli	2016	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0549	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;telecommunications;np-hard;mathematics;iterative method;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions	HPC	34.570948967639836	90.89535426594277	197583

At the beginning of each time slot, the algorithm allocates all available channels to the users, and each user can choose to transmit in different modes. After characterizing the transmission rates and defining the utility for each possible scheduling decision, we propose power optimization algorithms to maximize the utility for each type of decision. Our scheduling algorithm allocates each channel according to the decision that provides the maximum utility value, and it manages mode selection, channel allocation and power optimization. Via simulation results, we discuss the parameter selection for our algorithm and verify the performance improvements by allowing D2D users to share channels with other users.	algorithm;loss function;mathematical optimization;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;power optimization (eda);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link	Yi Li;Mustafa Cenk Gursoy;Senem Velipasalar	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881211	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;telecommunications link;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	28.55798614754567	93.45469434987073	197643

It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) for all relevant channels is imperfectly known, and the imperfectness of the CSI is modeled using a Euclidean ball-shaped uncertainty set. Our design objective is to minimize the transmit power of the SU-Transmitter (SU-Tx) while simultaneously achieving a lower bound on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the SUs and imposing an upper limit on the interference power (IP) at the PUs. The design parameters at the SU-Tx are the beamforming weights, and the proposed methodology to solve the problem is based on the worst-case design scenario through which the performance metrics of the design are immune to variations in the channels. The original problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic problem (QCQP), which is an NP-hard problem, even for uncertain CSI. We reformulate our original design problem to a relaxed semidefinite program (SDP) and then investigate three different approaches based on convex programming. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the robustness of the proposed methods.	beamforming;best, worst and average case;catastrophic interference;channel state information;coexist (image);cognitive radio;convex optimization;interference (communication);multi-user;multiuser dos;np-hardness;quadratic equation;quadratically constrained quadratic program;semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;superuser;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter	Ebrahim A.

However, interference between different tiers of HetNets is the main bottleneck for high spectral efficiency. Spectrum access, including spectrum deployment and channel access, is one of the most powerful methods to manage the interference. Unfortunately, the optimal spectrum access scheme for macro-femto HetNets remains unknown. By allowing femtocells to dynamically access the available macro-tier spectrum in addition to their dedicated femto-tier spectrum through cognitive spectrum sensing, we propose a novel spectrum access scheme, which takes the existing schemes as special cases. By jointly optimizing three important system parameters, we maximize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) and determine the optimal spectrum access scheme for macro-femto HetNets. Analytical results imply that the optimal spectrum access scheme is determined by the optimum number of active links per unit area, which governs the interference level in each unit area. Simulation results validate the obtained analytical results and show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of ASE.	adaptive server enterprise;aloha editor;cognition;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);multitier architecture;semantic network;simulation;software deployment;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency	Lu Hong Yang;Shenghui Song;Khaled Ben Letaief	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247162	cognitive radio;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;radio resource management;interference;spectral efficiency;computer network	Mobile	27.449265676601723	89.88644885275491	197905

Since the underlying optimization problem is non-convex, we resort to semidefinite programming relaxation and we analytically prove that the relaxation is in fact tight and yields optimal beamforming solution.	beamforming;cognitive radio;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;semidefinite programming;system analysis;telecommunications link	Lina S.

This paper highlights the potential of using Simulated Annealing (SA) to solve the channel selection problem in single-hop multi-AP 802.11b/g networks. The objective is to develop a framework to gauge how well the SA performs in a wireless communication environment. This involves the design of neighboring state transition scheme, annealing schedule selection and the analysis of their impact on the system performance.

By adopting the optimal relay amplifying matrix, the MMSE cost function behaviors are analytically and numerically studied.	anisotropic filtering;channel state information;convex cone;deferred procedure call;emoticon;global optimization;loss function;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;radio jamming;relay;simulation;tip (unix utility)	Kanghee Lee;Hyuck M.

In this concept, downlink data is transmitted to a user terminal at the border of two cells from one or both of the cells. The cells may belong to same NodeB or to two different NodeBs. The data flows are separated by different scrambling codes used by each associated cell, thus the flows can be treated independently. This provides increased multi-user diversity by means of flexibility in downlink resource management, in addition to the spatial diversity of multiple transmission locations. Another important gain mechanism for this scheme is realized by short-term load balancing between neighboring cells. We evaluate the performance of Multiflow by semi-static system level simulations. The presented results reveal high throughput gains for users in handover areas and also a slight improvement to overall network performance.	code;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multi-user;multiflow;network performance;requirement;semiconductor industry;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Vesa P.

Interference alignment (IA) achieves maximum degrees of freedom (DoF) in a  ${K}$ -user interference channel. In this letter, we propose a novel transceiver to improve rate-energy tradeoff for EH in IA networks, the design of which is a non-convex problem. The proposed transceiver, designed using an iterative algorithm and semidefinite relaxation approach, relaxes the perfect IA condition to improve the rate-energy tradeoff. We also analyze the performance of the proposed transceiver for different antennas configurations and show the existence of a diversity-energy tradeoff for the large EH constraint when there are excess antennas. In this antenna regime, this letter shows that the potential diversity gains can be sacrificed to allow the additional DoF provided by excess antennas to be utilized for EH (to satisfy the large EH constraint) without compromising IA.	algorithm;convex optimization;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;offset binary;radio frequency;transceiver	Rishabh Gupta;Ajit K.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Ubiquitous support of heterogeneous services with prescribed QoS requirements is an ever-increasing demand in the fourth generation of wireless communication systems. Unpredictable and variable nature of environment and scarcity of resources necessitate exploiting efficient adaptive resource allocation strategies in operating the emerging networks. Recent growth in popularity of high-data rate-applications and the need for larger bandwidths for transmission of multimedia content have also made the ideas of """" resource sharing """" and """" cognitive radio """" very attractive. Again sharing or allocation of resources should be dynamic and adapted to the network condition. On the other hand, for attaining the optimal perceived quality, QoS requirements and the respective resource allocation techniques for the new wireless applications should be considered across the open system interconnection (OSI) layers. For example, quality of video streaming application is best measured at higher layers, while this quality is affected by resource allocation within lower layers. This special issue aims to shed light on the above concepts from a number of perspectives. The first paper """" Particle swarm optimization (PSO) for adaptive resource allocation in communication networks """" focuses on adaptive centralized and distributed resource allocation strategies in communication networks. For a low-complexity design, a generalized model of particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used. By deploying the concept of PSO for subcarrier allocation, the required computational complexity and traffic overheads are significantly lowered. The next three papers study adaptive cross-layer schemes in cognitive radio (CR) systems. The paper """" A cross-layer approach in sensing and resource allocation for multimedia transmission over cognitive UWB networks """" studies medium access control (MAC) centric cross-layer approach to address the problem of multime-dia transmission over cognitive ultra wideband (C-UWB) networks. This paper proposes a cross-layer design while considering UWB wireless channel conditions, time slot allocations at the MAC layer, and MPEG-4 video at the APP layer. Then, the performance of the proposed approach is investigated.

For secondary users, sensing co sts are incurred as the result of primary users’ activity. Furth ermore, each secondary user pays the cost of transmissions upo n successful bidding for a channel. Knowledge regarding othe r secondary users’ activity is limited due to the distributednature of the network. The resulting formulation is thus a dynamic game with incomplete information. In this paper, an efficient bidding learning algorithm is proposed based on the outcome of past transactions. As demonstrated through extensive simulati ons, the proposed distributed scheme outperforms a myopic one-stag e algorithm, and can achieve a good balance between efficiency and fairness.	algorithm;cognitive radio;fairness measure	Zhu Han;Rong Zheng;H.

The proposed scheme, namely, successive bandwidth division (SBD), NOMA, is a hybrid approach exploiting the characteristics of both the conventional NOMA system and the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Power allocation is being performed in successive bandwidth division NOMA to maximize the sum rate using a divide-and-allocate approach such that all users are allocated with optimal transmission power. Under Rayleigh fading, the probability density function (PDF) of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is derived, and closed-form expressions for the outage probability are presented when channel state information (CSI) is available at the base station. The performance evaluation is carried out in terms of receiver complexity, average sum rate, and outage probability. Simulations results are provided to access and compare the performance of the proposed scheme with other contemporary approaches.	approximation algorithm;battle of midway;channel state information;computer simulation;downtime;epas;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;network packet;oma;operator overloading;performance evaluation;portable document format;quality of service;rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;smart battery;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;user requirements document	Soma Qureshi;Syed Ali Hassan;Dushantha Nalin K.

7b49341c84dfee62d85c0fc46a90e05382deb9a3	resource management in multi-hop mobile small cell networks		The deployment of mobile small cells has been identified as an effective strategy in delivering high data rates and providing seamless connectivity to a group of vehicular users. Although this approach can facilitate high data rates and ubiquitous wireless access, it introduces a new set of challenges, for instance, frequent changes in the interference set, requirements for more spectrum, high energy consumption and frequent handover. In this paper, we present a multi-hop mobile small cell network (SCN) that can facilitate wireless access to mobile nodes that do have direct transmission links to small cell base stations. We then formulate a solution to the frequency allocation problem for a multi-hop mobile SCN based on an optimization model. Considering the complexity of the optimization solution, we present a backhaul- aware frequency allocation solution based on the time-varying graph coloring concept. Simulation results confirm that the proposed solution outperforms an existing greedy solution by a significant margin in terms of throughput, spectral efficiency and fairness index.	backhaul (telecommunications);coexist (image);fairness measure;frequency allocation;graph coloring;greedy algorithm;hop;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network performance;real-time clock;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;throughput;virtual reality	Ade Syaheda Wani Marzuki;Iftekhar Ahmad;Daryoush Habibi;Quoc Viet Phung	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254651	throughput;hop (networking);computer network;frequency allocation;computer science;backhaul (telecommunications);mobile computing;small cell;spectral efficiency;base station	Mobile	25.889890800205794	90.79820810858149	198824

In this letter, we propose one graph theory-based pattern division (GT-PD) scheme to deal with the ASR overlapping with a limited number of sub-channels. First, we depict the ASR overlapping as an undirected weighted graph, where the weight of each edge indicates the strength of the ASR overlapping between two connected clusters. Then, we separately denote each user cluster and pattern as a vertex and a color, and transform the pattern division into a graph coloring problem with limited colors. In addition, the GT-PD scheme is developed with the help of the Dsatur algorithm.

At source node, THP is adopted to mitigate the spatial intersymbol interference. However, due to its nonlinear nature, THP is very sensitive to channel estimation errors. In order to reduce the effects of channel estimation errors, a joint Bayesian robust design of THP at source, linear forwarding matrices at relays and linear equalizer at destination is proposed. With novel applications of elegant characteristics of multiplicative convexity and matrix-monotone functions, the optimal structure of the nonlinear transceiver is first derived. Based on the derived structure, the transceiver design problem reduces to a much simpler one with only scalar variables which can be efficiently solved. Finally, the performance advantage of the proposed robust design over non-robust design is demonstrated by simulation results.	anisotropic filtering;catastrophic interference;channel state information;equalization (communications);interference (communication);mimo;nonlinear system;relay;simulation;transceiver;zero-forcing precoding;monotone	Chengwen Xing;Minghua Xia;Feifei Gao;Yik-Chung Wu	2012	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2012.120907	monotonic function;telecommunications;information theory;control theory;precoding;intersymbol interference;statistics	Mobile	39.1492881996289	88.90992392124684	199017

This paper presents reinforcement learning strategies for self-organized coverage and capacity optimization through antenna downtilt adaptation. We analyze different learning strategies for a Fuzzy Q-Learning based solution in order to have a fully autonomous optimization process. The learning behavior of these strategies is presented in terms of their learning speed and convergence to the optimal settings. Simultaneous actions by different cells of the network have a great impact on this learning behavior. Therefore, we study a stable strategy where only one cell can take an action per network snapshot as well as a more dynamic strategy where all the cells take simultaneous actions in every snapshot. We also propose a cluster based strategy that tries to combine the benefits of both. The performance is evaluated in all three different network states, i.e. deployment, normal operation and cell outage. The simulation results show that the proposed cluster based strategy is much faster to learn the optimal configuration than one-cell-per-snapshot and can also perform better than the all-cells-per-snapshot strategy due to better convergence capabilities.	autonomous robot;capacity optimization;cluster analysis;downtime;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;q-learning;reinforcement learning;self-organization;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);software deployment	Muhammad Naseer ul Islam;Andreas Mitschele-Thiel	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214281	fuzzy logic;cellular network;self-organization;simulation;convergence;computer science;artificial intelligence;lte advanced;machine learning;antenna;communication complexity;interference;reinforcement learning;normal operator	Robotics	26.824198097888864	91.52194413480866	199282

Due to the nonconvexity of the capacity problem, only suboptimal solutions can be found. In the previous works, a Gradient Projection (GP) algorithm [1] and a Quasi-Newton (QN) method [2] were proposed to provide suboptimal solutions subject to the constant power constraint. In this paper, we derive the capacity for MIMO links decomposed via SVD and interfered from other links. Then, each eigenchannel of MIMO link is represented by a set of logical links with a set of discrete data rates and discrete powers. An Integer Programming based algorithm (named as IP) is presented to solve the capacity optimization problem. The solution specifies the set of logical links that can transmit simultaneously. Numerical results show that GP and QN methods achieve better performance than IP method for the case of weak interference because of the convexity of the optimization problem when INR is sufficiently small. In the case of strong interference, IP method achieves better performance than GP and QN methods, which means that transmitting one link at a time is better than transmitting all links simultaneously with full power. In other words, scheduling links to transmit is more important for the case of strong interference.		John D. Matyjas;Michael J.

In this paper, a novel, backhaul-aware approach to interference management in wireless small cell networks is proposed. The proposed approach enables macrocell user equipments (MUEs) to optimize their uplink performance, by exploiting the presence of neighboring small cell base stations. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game among the MUEs that seek to optimize their delay-rate tradeoff, given the conditions of both the radio access network and the - possibly heterogeneous - backhaul. To solve this game, a novel, distributed learning algorithm is proposed using which the MUEs autonomously choose their optimal uplink transmission strategies, given a limited amount of available information. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown and its properties are studied. Simulation results show that, under various types of backhauls, the proposed approach yields significant performance gains, in terms of both average throughput and delay for the MUEs, when compared to existing benchmark algorithms.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);benchmark (computing);cell (microprocessor);interference (communication);radio access network;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Sumudu Samarakoon;Mehdi Bennis;Walid Saad;Matti Latva-aho	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.092413.130221	radio access network;games;game theory;heterogeneous network;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;interference;scattering;reinforcement learning;wireless;computer network	Mobile	27.34675736524987	91.30858716697848	199459

Furthermore, relay nodes may not be willing to reveal their channel state information to others, which will result in asymmetry of information. This paper integrates contract theory and auction mechanism to stimulate relays to cooperate and maximize utility of both the source node and the relay node. In the presence of asymmetric information, a novel power allocation and price assignment algorithm is proposed which takes into account the individual power constraint of nodes. The proposed solution is distributed and easy to implement with negligible signaling overhead.

78105c56a9aec8455a206af1bb26a80b9cc7f3fc	cellular v2x communications in unlicensed spectrum: harmonious coexistence with vanet in 5g systems		With the increasing demand for vehicular data transmission, limited dedicated cellular spectrum becomes a bottleneck to satisfying the requirements of all cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) users. To address this issue, unlicensed spectrum is considered to serve as the complement to support cellular V2X users. In this paper, we study the coexistence problem of cellular V2X users and vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) users over the unlicensed spectrum. To facilitate the coexistence, we design an energy sensing-based spectrum sharing scheme, where cellular V2X users are able to access the unlicensed channels fairly while reducing the data transmission collisions between cellular V2X and VANET users. In order to maximize the number of active cellular V2X users, we formulate the scheduling and resource allocation problem as a two-sided many-to-many matching with peer effects. We then propose a dynamic vehicle-resource matching algorithm and present the analytical results on the convergence time and computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of the performance of the cellular V2X system when the unlicensed spectrum is utilized.	coexist (image);computational complexity theory;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);iteration;list of programming languages by type;many-to-many;requirement;revolution in military affairs;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;sorting;stable marriage problem;the times;xfig	Pengfei Wang;Boya Di;Hongliang Zhang;Kaigui Bian;Lingyang Song	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2839183	vehicular ad hoc network;spectrum management;computer network;scheduling (computing);data transmission;mathematics;bottleneck;resource allocation;convergence (routing);communication channel	Mobile	29.888565333246827	93.7067404462129	199650

In this paper, we present a linear-programming based framework for the calculation the resources assigned to each enhanced uplink user in the multi-cell environment, in order to account for the unnecessary outage problem. The interference and load models under such resource allocation schemes, both non-iterative and iterative, are built to characterize the system behavior and evaluate the system performance. The 'down grants'feature of HSUPA, which is to suppress the interference from soft handover area is also included in the analysis. The system performance under various resource allocation schemes are analyzed and compared by Monte-Carlo simulations, which shows the proposed framework may serve as a good estimation to study performance for the network operators.	algorithm;computation;data access;downtime;glossary of computer graphics;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;linear programming;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;network packet;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;performance evaluation;radio resource management;simulation;telecommunications link	Tuo Liu;Andreas Mäder;Dirk Staehle	2007	Third IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob 2007)	10.1109/WIMOB.2007.13	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	Embedded	30.12415898959494	90.42769778741	199703

Recently, game theory has been proposed as a powerful tool for dealing with the jamming problem, which can be considered as a player (jammer) playing against a user (transmitter). Different from existing results, in this paper, a bimatrix game framework is developed for modeling the interaction process between the transmitter and the jammer, and the sufficient and necessary conditions for Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy of the game are obtained under the linear constraints. Furthermore, the relationship between the NE solution and the global optimal solution of the corresponding quadratic programming is presented. In addition, a special analysis case is developed based on the continuous game framework in which each player has a continuum of strategies. Finally, we show that the performance can be improved based on our game theoretic framework, which is verified by numerical investigations.	apache continuum;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;game theory;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;quadratic programming;radio frequency;radio jamming;transmitter	Yulan Gao;Yue Xiao;Mingming Wu;Ming Xiao;Jinliang Shao	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2841921	real-time computing;game theory;quadratic programming;wireless;spread spectrum;transmitter;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;continuous game;mathematics;nash equilibrium;distributed computing	Mobile	37.44346886600678	91.46416761491166	199752
