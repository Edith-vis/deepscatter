The new computation schemes deal: (i). with the geometrical optimization of each newly created bifurcation; and (ii). with the recalculation of blood pressures and radii of vessels in the whole tree. A significant decrease of the computation time is obtained by replacing the global optimization by the fast updating algorithm allowing more complex structure to be simulated. A comparison between the new algorithms and the previous one is illustrated through the hepatic arterial tree.	algorithm;bifurcation theory;blood vessel;blood capillaries;colette rolland;computation (action);computer simulation;coronary artery;dimensions;fractal;global optimization;hemodynamics;hypertensive disease;mathematical optimization;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;myocardial blood flow;pathologic neovascularization;performance;population parameter;post-traumatic stress disorder;psychological techniques;radiology;reverse mathematics;structure of arteriole;time complexity;trees (plant);ventricular hypertrophy;algorithm;physiological aspects	Marek Kretowski;Yan Rolland;Johanne Bézy-Wendling;Jean-Louis Coatrieux	2003	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/S0169-2607(01)00200-0	computer simulation;three-dimensional space;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;blood pressure;generalized complex structure;mathematics;global optimization	Graphics	30.83692655377297	-86.04580477997982	156490

Treatment of hepatic cancer often requires removal or destruction of large volume lesions. Using multiple antennas offers a potential solution for creating ablation zones with larger dimensions, as well as varied geometrical shapes. We performed both 3-D FE analyses and in vitro experiments using three identical open-tip MW antennas simultaneously, placing them in three types of configurations-ldquolinear array,rdquo ldquotriangular,rdquo and ldquoT-shapedrdquo arrangements. We compared coagulation volumes created, as well as temperature distribution characteristics, from the three-antenna arrangements after power delivery of 50 W for 60 s. We also performed additional tests using nonidentical antennas (open tip, slot, and slot with insulating jacket) for the three configurations. The results illustrate that arranging antennas in the ldquoT-shapedrdquo pattern destroyed more unwanted tissues than those found when using ldquolinear arrayrdquo and ldquotriangularrdquo arrangements, with maximum coagulation width and depth of 46 and 81 mm, respectively, and coagulation volume of 30.7 cm3 . In addition, using nonidentical triple antennas caused variations in coagulation zone characteristics, and thus, the technique could be applied to treatment situations where nonsymmetric coagulation zones are required.	ablation;antenna device component;blood vessel;body tissue;cyclosporine;dimensions;experiment;finite element method;in vitro [publication type];large;largest;liver and intrahepatic biliary tract carcinoma;video-in video-out;microwave electromagnetic radiation;milliliter;width	Pattarapong Phasukkit;Supan Tungjitkusolmun;Manas Sangworasil	2009	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2009.2027128	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;finite element method;mathematics;surgery	Visualization	27.17755453548527	-85.21897248783608	157143

Typical healthcare facility utilizes spectrally untunable broadband white light with luminance level being the only control available. Unfortunately, such illumination may not result in the best accessible visibility between features-of-interest. In this study, we have developed and presented a research prototype which allows to perform rapid exploration of various optimized illuminations designed for desired medical purposes. Optimized spectral power distribution of an illuminator can enhance contrast between tissues while in vivo examination. Furthermore, obtained light can significantly improve medical imaging what leads to more robust automatic detection and may boost computer-aid diagnosis. To determine possible enhancement provided by our system, spectral information of the skin on the hand and skin section over a vein are used as example of features-of-interest. Calculated optimal illumination is implemented using the LED-based light source and computational example images were calculated and are presented. The results show that the LED-based optimal illuminants improved the contrast between skin and veins by 65% compared to the traditional daylight illumination available in every healthcare facility.	computation;daylight;illumination (image);illuminator (backlight);medical imaging;prototype;video-in video-out	Piotr Bartczak;Ana Gebejes;Pauli Fält;Markku Hauta-Kasari	2016	2016 IEEE 29th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)	10.1109/CBMS.2016.33	computer vision;medicine;computer science;lighting;skin;light-emitting diode	Vision	39.09287442768959	-86.51851708344535	157371

While the first two allow a detailed examination of only one vessel or a few segments of the coronary artery tree at a time, the VR techniques are not considered suitable for a thorough clinical assessment. An innovative concept of visualization aimed at revealing the entire coronary tree in a CPR-type environment is presented. The new approach uses a sphere or an ellipsoid as a base surface to map the coronary tree. Using the spherical (or ellipsoidal) coordinate system a """"true"""" surface running through the centerlines of all the vessels is defined. Resampling the volume data with this (preferably thick) surface and using a maximum-intensity projection will produce three possible modes of visualization. In one mode the """"true form"""" surface is texture-mapped with the resampled volume data, while in another the data is projected onto the sphere that served as a base surface, forming the """"Globe"""" mode of visualization. Peeling the data to form a 2D """"map"""" of the entire coronary tree in its context in the heart constitutes the third mode.© (2004) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

be76140484eb9ea5450107ecffe42abcb1fabe80	draw and cut: intuitive 3d osteotomy planning on polygonal bone models	computer-assisted surgery;cutting surface models;3d osteotomy planning	We present a novel approach on computer-assisted 3D planning of arbitrarily shaped osteotomies on polygonal bone models. Osteotomy lines can be drawn ‘free-hand’ onto a 3D geometry, either by stroke projection or by the use of several control points, that are automatically connected in a shortest way, approximating osteotomy lines across a triangulated surface representation. Polygonal surface models are cut and retriangulated accordingly. In cases where inner structures have to be cut as well, cut surfaces are generated from closed contour lines. These surfaces again serve as an additional input for a downstream surface cut algorithm. Although focussed on cranio-maxillofacial surgery planning, the method presented herein is well suited for cutting any (manifold or non-manifold) polygonal model in a free-form manner.

The subjects in group H were taking rosuvastatin (20mg/d) for 12 months before the second scan. The calcifications in the arteries were determined by CT imaging and the artery PET images were analyzed slice by slice. The standard uptake values (SUVs) for 18F-FDG uptake were classified in two main groups: calcified and non-calcified arteries and each main group comprises six sub-groups for the three subject groups N, H and A, and for the two measurements 12 months apart. Although the calcifications were present at some portions of the arteries in all subjects (23%, 36% and 44% of calcified sites to total sites analyzed, respectively, in groups N, H and A), the results show the most noticeable SUV changes after 12 months was in group N of non-calcified arteries. In the three groups, the calcified arteries showed no significant differences between T0 and T12 while significant differences were observed for the non-calcified arteries. However, there were no significant changes at T12 between groups N and H following rosuvastatin intake in group H. In conclusion, the quantitative analysis with 18F-FDG-PET/CT could be efficient in the localization of the inflammation and evaluation of its progression in atherosclerosis instead of global evaluations with systemic inflammation biomarkers.

80267eb39c31df00b970ee07e191ba081ec8404d	toward automated classification of acetabular shape in ultrasound for diagnosis of ddh: contour alpha angle and the rounding index	developmental dysplasia of the hip ddh;acetabular coverage;2d ultrasound;classification of ddh;rounding index;alpha angle	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The diagnosis of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) in infants is currently made primarily by ultrasound. However, two-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS) images capture only an incomplete portion of the acetabular shape, and the alpha and beta angles measured on 2DUS for the Graf classification technique show high inter-scan and inter-observer variability. This variability relates partly to the manual determination of the apex point separating the acetabular roof from the ilium during index measurement. This study proposes a new 2DUS image processing technique for semi-automated tracing of the bony surface followed by automatic calculation of two indices: a contour-based alpha angle (αA), and a new modality-independent quantitative rounding index (M). The new index M is independent of the apex point, and can be directly extended to 3D surface models.   METHODS We tested the proposed indices on a dataset of 114 2DUS scans of infant hips aged between 4 and 183 days scanned using a 12MHz linear transducer. We calculated the manual alpha angle (αM), coverage, contour-based alpha angle and rounding index for each of the recordings and statistically evaluated these indices based on regression analysis, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and analysis of variance (ANOVA).   RESULTS Processing time for calculating αA and M was similar to manual alpha angle measurement, ∼30s per image. Reliability of the new indices was high, with inter-observer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) 0.90 for αA and 0.89 for M. For a diagnostic test classifying hips as normal or dysplastic, AUC was 93.0% for αA vs. 92.7% for αM, 91.6% for M alone, and up to 95.7% for combination of M with αM, αA or coverage.   CONCLUSIONS The rounding index provides complimentary information to conventional indices such as alpha angle and coverage. Calculation of the contour-based alpha angle and rounding index is rapid, shows potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of DDH diagnosis from 2DUS, and could be extended to 3D ultrasound in future.

Most pancreatic cancer patients will die within the first year of diagnosis, and just 6% will survive five years. Currently, surgery is the only treatment that offers a chance of cure for pancreatic cancer patients. Accurately identifying the tumors margins in real-time is a significant difficulty during pancreatic cancer surgery and contributes to the low 5-year surv ival rate. We are developing a hyperspectral imaging system based on compressive sampling for real-time tumor margin detection to facilitate more effective removal of diseased tissue and resu lt in better patient outcomes. Recent research has shown that optical spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue and will likely become an important minimally invasive diagnostic tool for a range of diseases. Reflectance spectroscopy provides information about tissue morphology, while laser-induced autofluorescence spectra give accurate information about the content and molecular structure of the emitting tissue. We are developing a spectral imaging system that targets emission from collagen and NAD(P)H as diagnostics for differentiating healthy and diseased pancreatic tissue. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of our camera system to acquire hyperspectral images and its potential application for imaging autofluorescent emission from pancreatic tissue.

Values of R 50 and the ECW resistance extrapolated at zero frequency R e were measured in a first group of 57 healthy volunteers, using a Xitron 4200 multifrequency impedancemeter and mean values (b) of the ratio R 50/R e in men and women were used to determine individual values of R e50, the ECW resistance extrapolated from R 50, which were substituted to R e in the BIS-Hanai equation. For validation, the method was compared against ECW measured with the Xitron (V ex) in a second group of 31 healthy volunteers, using values of b of first group. Values of R e50 in this second group were found to be not significantly different from corresponding values of R e with p-values of Student test of 0.346 for men and 0.300 for women. ECW volumes (V e50) calculated from R e50 were also found not significantly different from those of the Xitron with Student paired test p values of 0.277 in men and 0.393 in women. Our method gave a better agreement with V ex than two bioimpedance analysis methods from the literature, especially in women. It was also tested on a 50 kHz single frequency impedancemeter (BodyExplorer, Juwell Medical) on a third group of 21 subjects and gave ECW volumes not significantly from those of the Xitron with p = 0.531 for men and 0.096 for women.	arabic numeral 0;ecw (file format);emoticon;extrapolation;kilohertz;value (computer science);water cooling;biphenyl synthase activity	Michel Y.

Our FEM was based on a realistic prostate geometry obtained from ultrasound images from a human patient subject, including the geometry of the urethra and prostate capsule. The model was used to investigate pin cushion deformation that occurs during brachytherapy just prior to puncture of the capsule. A 2D FEM was used previously to validate the approach. The 2D FEM employed non-linear element basis functions and the model predictions were compared to those reported in the literature. The current study employed a 3D FEM model with code developed in Matlab and using linear combinations of cubic Hermite finite element basis functions. The material properties for the prostate were those obtained from the literature. The base mesh was defined as an ellipsoidal prostate and capsule, with 48 nodes defining the prostate surface. The urethra was modelled as a paraboloid running through the prostate. The nodal parameters of the prostate base mesh were then optimized to match the unique anatomy of the representative human prostate under investigation. The surface fitting error after optimization was 1.4 mm. Finally, a 10 N axial force was applied to an apical capsule node and the deformed mesh satisfying force balance equilibrium was converged to in approximately 1 hour. A 8% reduction was found for the overall axial displacement of the node at which the force was applied when the results using the encapsulated prostate model was compared to previous results where the capsule was not included. This finding suggests that the capsule plays a prominent mechanical role in brachytherapy needle insertion and warrants a more in-depth study of capsule mechanical properties.	basis function;cubic function;displacement mapping;finite element method;matlab;mathematical optimization;multivariate interpolation;nonlinear system	Anitha Priya Krishnan;Walter O'Dell	2005	ROMAN 2005.

c6babe5d6d634b02d45f2e7c44a9552b3a434cec	towards understanding the aetiology of high myopic strabismus using mechanical analysis and finite element modelling		It has been widely accepted that the pathology of high myopic esotropia, a special form of strabismus, is still not fully understood. In this study, the mechanical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA) of the oculomotor system was based on clinical MRI data and applied to examine the physiological hypotheses of extraocular muscle obliquity and deformation respectively. Our mechanical analysis indicated that the muscular obliquity is not the dominated cause of high myopic strabismus. Next, by simulating the effect of different forces applied to the cross section of each extraocular rectus muscles, the corresponding eyeball rotations were quantified on normal eyes, and high myopic eyes with and without strabismus. The model suggests that the limitation of rotation in high myopic strabismic eyes is mainly caused by the extraocular muscle deformation instead of, but related with ,its obliquity, providing a better understanding of the etiology of high myopic strabismus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mechanical and FEA model developed from clinical data to investigate the etiology of high myopic strabismus, providing important tools for future studies.	finite element method	Haipeng Liu;Yinglan Gong;Zhiqing Chen;Shahina Pardhan;Rajshree Mootanah;Ling Xia;Dingchang Zheng	2018	IJMEI	10.1504/IJMEI.2018.10013911	etiology;extraocular muscles;strabismus;finite element method;esotropia;ophthalmology;medicine	HPC	28.571541768897465	-84.87830965134297	160120

A realistic three-dimensional (3D) fiber orientation has not been implemented in modeling fluid flow-dependent response of articular cartilage; thus the detailed mechanical role of the collagen network may have not been fully understood. In the present study, a previously developed fibril-reinforced model of articular cartilage was extended to account for the 3D fiber orientation. A numerical procedure for the material model was incorporated into the finite element code ABAQUS using the “user material” option. Unconfined compression and indentation testing was evaluated. For indentation testing, we considered a mechanical contact between a solid indenter and a medial femoral condyle, assuming fiber orientations in the surface layer to follow the split-line pattern. The numerical results from the 3D modeling for unconfined compression seemed reasonably to deviate from that of axisymmetric modeling. Significant fiber orientation dependence was observed in the displacement, fluid pressure and velocity for the cases of moderate strain-rates, or during early relaxation. The influence of fiber orientation diminished at static and instantaneous compressions.	3d computer graphics;3d modeling;3d printing;collagen diseases;collagen fiber;condyle of femur;displacement mapping;fibril - cell component;finite element method;linear programming relaxation;medial graph;mental orientation;nerve compression syndrome;numerical analysis;optical fiber;psychologic displacement;structure of articular cartilage;structure of condyle;tissue fiber;velocity (software development);fluid flow	LePing Li;J.

Traditionally, visual and photographic assessment of bruise color is used to determine age, but this substantially subjective technique has been shown to be inaccurate and unreliable. The purpose of this study was to develop a technique to spectrally-age bruises using a reflective multi-spectral imaging system that minimizes the filtering and hardware requirements while achieving acceptable accuracy. This approach will then be incorporated into a handheld, point-of-care technology that is clinically-viable and affordable. Sixteen bruises from elder residents of a long term care facility were imaged over time. A multi-spectral system collected images through eleven narrow band (~10 nm FWHM) filters having center wavelengths ranging between 370-970 nm corresponding to specific skin and blood chromophores. Normalized bruise reflectance (NBR)defined as the ratio of optical reflectance coefficient of bruised skin over that of normal skinwas calculated for all bruises at all wavelengths. The smallest mean NBR, regardless of bruise age, was found at wavelength between 555 & 577nm suggesting that contrast in bruises are from the hemoglobin, and that they linger for a long duration. A contrast metric, based on the NBR at 460nm and 650nm, was found to be sensitive to age and requires further investigation. Overall, the study identified four key wavelengths that have promise to characterize bruise age. However, the high variability across the bruises imaged in this study complicates the development of a handheld detection system until additional data is available.

a2e7058c57d563cb0209cc661cf479252c7d0246	voidd: automatic vessel of intervention dynamic detection in pci procedures		In this article, we present the work towards improving the overall workflow of the Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) procedures by capacitating the imaging instruments to precisely monitor the steps of the procedure. In the long term, such capabilities can be used to optimize the image acquisition to reduce the amount of dose or contrast media employed during the procedure. We present the automatic VOIDD algorithm to detect the vessel of intervention which is going to be treated during the procedure by combining information from the vessel image with contrast agent injection and images acquired during guidewire tip navigation. Due to the robust guidewire tip segmentation method, this algorithm is also able to automatically detect the sequence corresponding to guidewire navigation. We present an evaluation methodology which characterizes the correctness of the guide wire tip detection and correct identification of the vessel navigated during the procedure.

6106d8b99d6e5ca95ac52048693b9354a8f7d963	quantitative comparison of 21 protocols for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions in in vivo mri: towards a harmonized segmentation protocol	journal_article;ca1;entorhinal cortex;hippocampus;segmentation;magnetic resonance imaging;medial temporal lobe;unified protocol;parahippocampal gyrus;subiculum;ca2;perirhinal cortex;hippocampal subfields;ca3;dentate gyrus	OBJECTIVE An increasing number of human in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have focused on examining the structure and function of the subfields of the hippocampal formation (the dentate gyrus, CA fields 1-3, and the subiculum) and subregions of the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices). The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions. Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents. This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure segmentation protocol.   METHOD MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired both at 3 T and 7 T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of agreement.   RESULTS The differences between the 21 protocols include the region within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and tail.   CONCLUSIONS The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between published studies.	body space;ct scan;communications protocol;contribution;hippocampal replay;hippocampus (brain);landmark point;magnetic resonance imaging;parahippocampal gyrus;protocols documentation;rule (guideline);scientific publication;segmentation action;silo (dataset);spatial variability;structure of dentate gyrus;structure of subiculum hippocampi;table cell;video-in video-out;biologic segmentation;citation	Paul A.

Axial gripping force was optimized by changing hole size, number, and spacing. A 10 kg pig and a rabbit esophagus were used to simulate a neonatal esophagus. Maximum axial forces of up to 7.2 N were achieved. Hole pattern spacing had little to no impact on force while suction area was very significant. Additionally, there was a preference for a greater number of holes versus larger holes for relatively large hole sizes. Lastly, smaller holes resulted in smoother loss of gripping force when beyond maximum holding force was applied.	diameter (qualifier value);douady rabbit;esophageal diseases;esophagus;greater;simulation;small;suction drainage;viscera;antineoplaston a10	Robert J.

We have developed a novel metastasis sizing algorithm based on 3-D template matching with spherical tumor appearance models that were created to match the expected geometry of the tumors of interest while accounting for potential spatial offsets of nodules in the slice thickness direction. The spherical template that best-fits the overall volume of each lung metastasis was determined through the optimization of the 3-D normalized cross-correlation coefficients (NCCC) calculated between the templates and the nodules. A total of 17 different lung metastases were extracted manually from real patient CT datasets and reconstructed in 3-D using spherical harmonics equations to generate simulated nodules for testing our algorithm. Each metastasis 3-D shape was then subjected to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% scaling of its volume to allow for 5 possible volume change combinations relative to the original size per each reconstructed nodule and inserted back into CT datasets with appropriate blurring and noise addition. When plotted against the true volume change, the nodule volume changes calculated by our algorithm for these 85 data points exhibited a high degree of accuracy (slope = 0.9817, R2 = 0.9957). Our results demonstrate that the 3-D template matching method can be an effective, fast, and accurate tool for automated sizing of metastatic tumors.© (2009) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The eddy current distribution is induced by the time-varying magnetic field of the magnetic coil used in the TMS. The brain neurons can be excited by the eddy current stimulation. The figure-of-eight coil in the TMS is used for the focal stimulation. The brain site beneath the central point of the figure-of-eight coil is conventionally determined as the stimulating site. However, it is difficult to find the optimal position to be stimulated by changing the coil. In this study, we propose an optimization method of the current distribution using a magnetic substance, without varying the coil's position. We verify our method by a computer simulation.

Neurosurgeons must have thorough procedural, anatomical, and functional knowledge to plan electrode trajectories and thus ensure treatment efficacy and patient safety. Developing this knowledge requires extensive training. We propose a training approach with objective assessment of neurosurgeon proficiency in DBS planning. To assess proficiency, we propose analyzing both the viability of the planned trajectory and the manner in which the operator arrived at the trajectory. To improve understanding, we suggest a self-guided training course for DBS planning using real-time feedback. To validate the proposed measures of proficiency and training course, two experts and six novices followed the training course, and we monitored their proficiency measures throughout. At baseline, experts planned higher quality trajectories and did so more efficiently. As novices progressed through the training course, their proficiency measures increased significantly, trending toward expert measures. We developed and validated measures which reliably discriminate proficiency levels. These measures are integrated into a training course, which quantitatively improves trainee performance. The proposed training course can be used to improve trainees’ proficiency, and the quantitative measures allow trainees’ progress to be monitored.	amendment;arrival - action;baseline (configuration management);consent forms;declaration (computer programming);deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;education, medical;fits;gabor atom;helsinki declaration;natural science disciplines;neurodegenerative disorders;procedural programming;real-time locating system;seizures;standards characteristics	Matthew S.

We report a real-time strain mapping approach that provides displacement vectors and principal strain directions during the mechanical characterization of heart valve tissues. The strain maps reported in the current study allows an individual to quickly identify the approximate strain imposed on a location of the sample. The result shows that when samples are biaxially stretched under 18% strain, less anisotropy is observed in both aortic and pulmonary valve leaflet samples. Moreover, when samples are stretched from 28% to 35%, pulmonary valves leaflet samples exhibits a stronger anisotropic effect than aortic valve. Therefore, a higher degree of straightening is required for collagen fibers to be fully aligned. This work provides an easy approach to quantify mechanical properties with the corresponding strain maps of heart valve tissues and potentially facilitates the developments of tissue engineering heart valves.	alignment;approximation algorithm;body tissue;collagen diseases;displacement mapping;exhibits as topic;heart valves;leaflet;map;psychologic displacement;pulmonary valve structure;real-time clock;real-time transcription;tissue engineering;tissue fiber	Hsiao-Ying Shadow Huang;Siyao Huang	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347520	medicine;biomechanics;biological engineering;tissue engineering;physiology;anatomy;cardiology	Robotics	26.99121857576465	-85.50249242468962	161905

The technique inserts a special needle into a tumor and produces heat from Radiofrequency at the needle tip to ablate the tumor. Open configure MR system can take MR images almost real time and now is applied in liver cancer treatments. During a surgery, surgeons select images in which liver tumors are seen clearly, and use them to guide the surgery. However, in some cases with severe chirrhosis, the tumors can't be visualized in the MR images. In such cases, the combination of preoperative CT images will be greatly helpful, if CT images can be registered to the position of MR images accurately. It is a difficult work since the shape of the liver in the MR image is different from that of CT images due to the influent of the surgery. In this paper, we use Bspline based FFD nonrigid image registration to attack the problem. The method includes four steps. Firstly the MRI inhomogeneity is corrected. Secondly, parametric active contour with the gradient vector flow is used to extract the liver as region of interest (ROI) because the method is robust and can obtain satisfied results. Thirdly, affine registration is use to match CT and MR images roughly. Finally, Bspline based FFD nonrigid registration is applied to obtain accuracy registration. Experiments show the proposed method is robust and accuracy.© (2007) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

a6936a9cbc50fb41bd7e618d2402144fd791781d	development and evaluation of a semi-automated segmentation tool and a modified ellipsoid formula for volumetric analysis of the kidney in non-contrast t2-weighted mr images	clinical application;ellipsoid;evaluation research;image analysis;kidney;magnetic resonance imaging;radiology workflow;segmentation;semi-automated	Volumetric analysis of the kidney parenchyma provides additional information for the detection and monitoring of various renal diseases. Therefore the purposes of the study were to develop and evaluate a semi-automated segmentation tool and a modified ellipsoid formula for volumetric analysis of the kidney in non-contrast T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR)-images. Three readers performed semi-automated segmentation of the total kidney volume (TKV) in axial, non-contrast-enhanced T2-weighted MR-images of 24 healthy volunteers (48 kidneys) twice. A semi-automated threshold-based segmentation tool was developed to segment the kidney parenchyma. Furthermore, the three readers measured renal dimensions (length, width, depth) and applied different formulas to calculate the TKV. Manual segmentation served as a reference volume. Volumes of the different methods were compared and time required was recorded. There was no significant difference between the semi-automatically and manually segmented TKV (p = 0.31). The difference in mean volumes was 0.3 ml (95% confidence interval (CI), −10.1 to 10.7 ml). Semi-automated segmentation was significantly faster than manual segmentation, with a mean difference = 188 s (220 vs. 408 s); p < 0.05. Volumes did not differ significantly comparing the results of different readers. Calculation of TKV with a modified ellipsoid formula (ellipsoid volume × 0.85) did not differ significantly from the reference volume; however, the mean error was three times higher (difference of mean volumes −0.1 ml; CI −31.1 to 30.9 ml; p = 0.95). Applying the modified ellipsoid formula was the fastest way to get an estimation of the renal volume (41 s). Semi-automated segmentation and volumetric analysis of the kidney in native T2-weighted MR data delivers accurate and reproducible results and was significantly faster than manual segmentation. Applying a modified ellipsoid formula quickly provides an accurate kidney volume.	accident and emergency department;amendment;body tissue;confidence intervals;consent forms;declaration (computer programming);dimensions;ellipsoid method;fastest;genetic heterogeneity;helsinki declaration;kidney diseases;kidney volume;magnetic resonance imaging;parenchyma;renal tissue;review board;segmentation action;semiconductor industry;algorithm;biologic segmentation;standards characteristics;width	Hannes Seuss;Rolf Janka;Marcus Prümmer;Alexander Cavallaro;Rebecca Hammon;Ragnar Theis;Martin Sandmair;Kerstin Amann;Tobias Bäuerle;Michael Uder;Matthias Hammon	2016	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-016-9936-3	mathematical optimization;computer science;anatomy	HCI	38.743311241044665	-81.52734445629132	163876

In general, the ultrasonography using conventional handheld probe is operator-dependent, therefore, the quality of imaging depends on the operator technique, and the ultrasound images have less objectivity. Moreover, it is difficult for radiologists to interpret using comparison of left and right breast ultrasound images, comparison of previous ultrasound images, and double reading because ultrasound images are poor reproducibility and it is difficult to record entire breast images. In order to improve such problems, we have developed whole breast viewing system with computer-aided detection approach. All of the whole breast images were obtained by the AUS-1004 (ALOKA Co., Ltd., Japan). The detection performance was 80% with 3.8 FP marks per breast. The diagnostic effectiveness of the detection results and the possible browsing methods were implied.

This paper presented a whole body digital model framework of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism based on the segmented Visible Human Project (VHP) data set as the anatomical structure framework. First, the blood time-activity curve (BTAC) and the tissues time-activity curves (TTAC) were obtained from kinetic analysis. According to the obtained BTAC and TTACs, a set of corresponding values were assigned to the segmented VHP image frames. Thus a set of dynamic volume data were derived to show the 18F distribution in human body for the predetermined sampling schedule. Finally, the simulated FDG distribution was visualized by coronal, axial, and sagittal slices and volume rendering method. The model established here was especially for the metabolism of FDG; however, the modeling method is general for all tracers. The proposed model represented functional information of dynamical process of human metabolism with high visualization resolution. The results of modeling and visualization provide a useful tool for education and research on nuclear imaging, and may provide a novel technical platform for the study of pharmacokinetics.

In this study, a rabbit ventricular finite element conductor model containing blood perfusion in ventricular cavities was developed. The electric field was solved on the model by using 95% myocardial volume potential gradient higher than 5 V/cm as the successful defibrillation threshold (DFT). Multiple epicardial electrodes (MEE) protocols and a SCAN protocol were used to identify the optimum defibrillation method. Results showed that when using the SCAN protocol, DFT energy reduced to 4.3% that of the control group which had the traditional implantable cardioverter defibrillator current path. Rapidly switching scanning stimuli generated using MEE pairs is a promising low-energy defibrillation method. For multiple electrodes defibrillation, the distribution of the electrode pairs determine the defibrillation efficacy, and the counteraction effect has negative effect on defibrillation. These findings can provide suggestions for clinical applications.	defibrillation threshold;defibrillators;electric countershock;electroconvulsive therapy;finite element method;gradient;greater than;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;implants;master of electrical engineering;multiple endocrine neoplasia;optimizing compiler;protocols documentation;defibrillator/cardioverters;electrode	Jianfei Wang;Lian Jin;Xiaomei Wu;Biao Song;Li Qian;Weiqi Wang	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591300	communications protocol;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrode;finite element method;biological engineering;physics;electric potential;quantum mechanics;cardiology	Visualization	27.720116126166058	-84.58463119555663	164147
746f9ec510888607c769692ce4be8556b3e89e83	real-time sensitivity analysis of blood flow simulations to lumen segmentation uncertainty		Patient-specific modeling of blood flow combining CT image data and computational fluid dynamics has significant potential for assessing the functional significance of coronary artery disease. An accurate segmentation of the coronary arteries, an essential ingredient for blood flow modeling methods, is currently attained by a combination of automated algorithms with human review and editing. However, not all portions of the coronary artery tree affect blood flow and pressure equally, and it is of significant importance to direct human review and editing towards regions that will most affect the subsequent simulations. We present a data-driven approach for real-time estimation of sensitivity of blood-flow simulations to uncertainty in lumen segmentation. A machine learning method is used to map patient-specific features to a sensitivity value, using a large database of patients with precomputed sensitivities. We validate the results of the machine learning algorithm using direct 3D blood flow simulations and demonstrate that the algorithm can predict sensitivities in real time with only a small reduction in accuracy as compared to the 3D solutions. This approach can also be applied to other medical applications where physiologic simulations are performed using patient-specific models created from image data.	algorithm;arteriopathic disease;ct scan;computation (action);computational fluid dynamics;computer graphics (computer science);computer simulation;coronary artery disease;feature selection;hydrodynamics;machine learning;navier–stokes equations;patients;precomputation;quantity;real-time clock;real-time locating system;solutions;structure of lumen of body system;biologic segmentation	Sethuraman Sankaran;Leo J.

1dc118eff4ccf1970a5fa6055299b25acbe12463	evaluation of design parameters for a reflection based long-term pulse oximetry sensor	long term monitoring;spo2;reflexion;sensor;ppg;pulse oximetry;hypoxia	Pulse oximetry is a standard parameter for many years in clinical patient monitoring. There are also sensors that can be used at home. But all these sensors use the transmission based method to measure the oxygen saturation which require finger or ear clips that are uncomfortable and confining and therefore not fit for long-term monitoring. Sleep-related breathing disorders or breathing thin air in high altitudes can lead to insufficient oxygen intake. Insufficient oxygen supply can cause permanent damage to the tissue and in some cases even death. For early ambulatory diagnosis, a reflection based longterm pulse oximetry sensor would be the best solution. There are no available devices on the market, even so many studies showed promising results. That why, we evaluated design parameters for a reflection based long-term pulse oximetry sensor, located at the wrist. The prototype we developed consists of two LEDs (one red and one infrared), a photodiode and the evaluation board SLAU480B from Texas Instruments. We tested three sensor layouts and discovered that the distance between the LEDs and the photodiode, the contact pressure and motion artefacts were the most important signal influencing parameters. After the Signal processing we obtained a signal to noise ratio of 22 dB (red) and 30 dB (infrared) and a AC/DC ratio of 1-3 %, which should be more than enough to calculate the SpO2 value. Also motion artifacts were tested and seem to affect the measurement at the lower wrist strongly. In conclusion we found some reasons why there is no such device on the market yet.

c23dcf4d09b0297ec3ca401ef3926a1c027f66b4	rapt: a parallel radiotherapy treatment planning code	treatment planning;high performance computer;software package	We describe the RAPT prototype software package for stereotactic radiotherapy treatment planning, which has been developed as part of the ESPRIT EUROPORT project for creating parallel high-performance computing (HPC) versions of commercially significant codes. This paper focuses on the parallel high-performance simulation kernel, and describes its implementation, and performance measurements for both accuracy and computation time. These show that a fully 3-D Monte-Carlo simulation, taking account of tissue inhomogeneities can be performed in around 1 hour an acceptable delay for clinical use. Every year 700,000 Europeans die of cancer, and 1.2 million contract the disease. About a quarter of the new cases each year receive radiosurgery, but 20 per cent of these treatments fail either because the tumours are not precisely located, or the irradiation does not reach every part of them. By making available an accurate simulation on a platform which is affordable by a typical, medium-sized hospital radiotherapy department, RAPT has the potential to improve treatment in many of these cases, and so to make a direct impact on patient care.	network address translation	Amarjit Gill;Mike Surridge;Giuseppe Scielzo;Robert Felici;Mario Modesti;Giuseppe Sardu	1996		10.1007/3-540-61142-8_546	simulation;radiation treatment planning	Robotics	38.541688524177985	-87.92297443051051	165719

Models can take different forms, including mock circulatory constructs with physical components, mathematical representations of parameter space relations employing constitutive equations, or closed form representations of electrical circuit analogs described in the time or frequency domain. This investigation describes the use of cardiovascular models based on electrical analogs of mechanical hydrodynamic systems to elucidate two different physiologic concepts: (i) the use of distributed vascular impedance to investigate comparative physiology of optimal design and features related to body size across a broad range of animal species; (ii) use of lumped parameter models to assess the role of arterial stiffness in blood pressure variability. The impedance model shows that an allometric relationship between body weight and aortic effective length can be determined by using the frequency of minimum input impedance and aortic pulse wave velocity. This concept provides a background for optimal matching of body size and hemodynamic load on the heart. The lumped parameter model indicates that arterial stiffness, simulated by the total arterial compliance term, has a significant impact on variability of arterial pressure when changes are due to dynamic alterations of peripheral resistance. In addition, the known pressure dependency of arterial stiffness results in a curvilinear relationship between blood pressure variability and mean pressure. This has implications in hypertensive treatment where there are marked changes in arterial stiffness, as occurs with aging.	analog;arterial occlusive diseases;arterial stiffness;blood pressure;body dysmorphic disorders;body size;cardiovascular diseases;cardiovascular system;cerebrovascular disorders;characteristic impedance;heart rate variability;hemodynamics;human body weight;hydrodynamics;hypertensive disease;input impedance;lumped element model;mathematics;mock object;optimal design;optimal matching;physiology, comparative;population parameter;pulse wave velocity:vel:pt:arterial system:qn;quantitative impedance;simulation;total peripheral resistance;velocity (software development);physiological aspects	Alberto P.

The model is used to explore the effect of limb geometry on surface-detected muscle fiber action potentials. The model was based on magnetic resonance images of the subject's upper arm and includes both resistive and capacitive material properties. To validate the model geometry, experimental and simulated potentials were compared at different electrode sites during the application of a subthreshold sinusoidal current source to the skin surface. Of the material properties examined, the closest approximation to the experimental data yielded a mean root-mean-square (rms) error of the normalized surface potential of 18% or 27%, depending on the site of the applied source. Surface-detected action potentials simulated using the realistic volume conductor model and an idealized cylindrical model based on the same limb geometry were then compared. Variation in the simulated limb geometry had a considerable effect on action potential shape. However, the rate of decay of the action potential amplitude with increasing distance from the fiber was similar in both models. Inclusion of capacitive material properties resulted in temporal low-pass filtering of the surface action potentials. This effect was most pronounced in the end-effect components of action potentials detected at locations far from the active fiber. It is concluded that accurate modeling of the limb geometry, asymmetry, tissue capacitance and fiber curvature is important when the specific action potential shapes are of interest. However, if the objective is to examine more qualitative features of the surface EMG signal, then an idealized volume conductor model with appropriate tissue thicknesses provides a close approximation.	action potentials;action potential;anatomic structures;approximation;capacitive sensing;computational anatomy;current source device component;electric capacitance;electromyography;excitation;low-pass filter;mean squared error;muscle fibers;resonance;simulation;tissue fiber;tooth root structure;upper arm;anatomical layer	Madeleine M.

Such a system is essential for site-specific drug delivery in order to treat diseases in the gastrointestinal tract in a non-invasive way. Despite different attempts to magnetically actuate DDS, two main problems remain with such systems. The first one is related to the operating distance and the second one is concerned with the miniaturization of mechanisms inside the capsule endoscope (CE). In this paper, we present an optimization of external permanent magnets to address both problems. An array of magnets is optimally designed to compensate the loss of magnetic link due to longer operating distances and miniaturization of components in the CE.	airport time capsule;known-plaintext attack;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;next-generation network;radial (radio);tract (literature)	Fredy Munoz;Gürsel Alici;Weihua Li	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878227	materials science;electrical engineering;biological engineering;surgery	Robotics	27.50522854413086	-87.75537275388955	166556

However, the supply of kidneys is far short of the fast-growing demand. Kidney paired donation (KPD) programs provide an innovative approach for increasing the number of available kidneys. In a KPD program, willing but incompatible donor-candidate pairs may exchange donor organs to achieve mutual benefit. Recently, research on exchanges initiated by altruistic donors (ADs) has attracted great attention because the resultant organ exchange mechanisms offer advantages that increase the effectiveness of KPD programs. Currently, most KPD programs focus on rule-based strategies of prioritizing kidney donation. In this paper, we consider and compare two graph-based organ allocation algorithms to optimize an outcome-based strategy defined by the overall expected utility of kidney exchanges in a KPD program with both incompatible pairs and ADs. We develop an interactive software-based decision support system to model, monitor, and visualize a conceptual KPD program, which aims to assist clinicians in the evaluation of different kidney allocation strategies. Using this system, we demonstrate empirically that an outcome-based strategy for kidney exchanges leads to improvement in both the quantity and quality of kidney transplantation through comprehensive simulation experiments.	asea irb;allocation;bit-paired keyboard;cns disorder;decision support system;diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent;expected utility hypothesis;experiment;feedback;graph - visual representation;kidney failure, chronic;kidney transplantation;licensure, institutional, personnel;logic programming;mathematical optimization;memory management;nitric oxide donors;optimization problem;organ;patients;polycystic kidney diseases;regulation;resultant;review board;simulation;stochastic optimization;transplanted tissue;web site;widget toolkit;algorithm	Yanhua Chen;Yijiang Li;John D.

Static tests are applied to sheep common carotid arteries. Considering a thick-walled cylindrical model of orthotropic material under large deformations, a classical 3-D approach based on strain energy density is used to calculate the resulting mechanical behavior law in radial and circumferencial directions and stresses distribution throughout the wall thickness. Results are presented with reference to unloaded and zero-stress initial state thanks to simple measurements of inner and outer circumferences. A particular ratio relating the two main stresses (circumferential and longitudinal) is calculated that put into the forth the progressive modifications in the direction of the predominant stress in the wall and the specific radial location where these changes occur. The authors observe that this point location is a function of the test conditions of the specimen, i.e., stretching length and level of pressure.	arabic numeral 0;arterial system;biological specimen;blood vessel;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;carotid arteries;circumference;common carotid artery;in vitro [publication type];performance;point location;radial (radio);thickness (graph theory)	Walter Blondel;Jacques Didelon;Gérard Maurice;Jean-Pierre Carteaux;Xiong Wang;Jean-François Stolz	2001	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/10.915710	three-dimensional space;strain energy density function;rheology;index term;computer science;orthotropic material;engineering;biomechanics;hemodynamics;circulatory system;point location;in vitro;mathematics;capacitive sensing;stress;test method;physiology;system testing;anisotropy;engineering drawing;instrumentation;physics;anatomy;surgery	Visualization	27.43214495651409	-85.49067764419324	167077

For example, bronchoscopy is often performed to diagnose lung cancer. The current practice for planning endoscopic procedures requires the physician to manually scroll through the slices of a three-dimensional (3D) medical image. When doing this scrolling, the physician must perform 3D mental reconstruction of the endoscopic route to reach a specific diagnostic region of interest (ROI). Unfortunately, in the case of complex branching structures such as the airway tree, ROIs are often situated several generations away from the organ's origin. Existing image-analysis methods can help define possible endoscopic navigation paths, but they do not provide specific routes for reaching a given ROI. We have developed an automated method to find a specific route to reach an ROI. Given a 3D medical image, our method takes as inputs: (1) pre-defined ROIs; (2) a segmentation of the branching organ through which the endoscopic device will navigate; and (3) centerlines (paths) through the segmented organ. We use existing methods for branching-organ segmentation and centerline extraction. Our method then (1) identifies the closest paths (routes) to the ROI; and (2) if necessary, performs a directed search for the organ of interest, extending the existing paths to complete a route. Results from human 3D computed tomography chest images illustrate the efficacy of the method.© (2007) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

A nonintrusive optical measurement technique, 3-D particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV), has been applied to anatomically accurate phantoms under clinically realistic conditions. A compliant silicon phantom was used to mimic the healthy aorta, and a rigid model was used to imitate the pathological case that appears in aortas for example as a result of aging. The realistic models are transparent which allows optical access to the investigation domain, and the index of refraction was matched to avoid optical distortions. Our results revealed that the aortic stiffness leads to an increase in systolic velocity and a decrease in the Windkessel effect, which is associated with the diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, we found that the turbulent kinetic energy is about an order of magnitude higher for the rigid aorta, that is, an increase in aortic stiffness increases the magnitude of turbulent fluctuating velocities. The spatial distribution of the flow velocity showed that the flow is more organized and coherent spiraling patterns develop for the compliant aorta which helps to dampen the influence of disturbed flow. Finally, we observed higher Lagrangian acceleration and hence higher instantaneous forces acting on blood particles in the stiff case which implies that aging and hence arterial stiffening provokes distinctive alterations in blood flow, and these alterations may cause pathological symptoms in the cardiovascular system.	aortic valve insufficiency;aortic coarctation;ascending aorta structure;coherence (physics);compliance behavior;distortion;hemodynamics;imaging phantom;kinetics;muscle rigidity;phantoms, imaging;planning target volume;silicon;stiffness matrix;turbulence kinetic energy;velocity (software development)	Utku Gulan;Beat Lüthi;Markus Holzner;Alexander Liberzon;Arkady Tsinober;Wolfgang Kinzelbach	2014	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2014.2322934	anatomy;surgery	Robotics	27.528561967906793	-85.19592224328146	167459

While numerous approaches are adopted to address the segmentation problem including collecting annotations from domain-experts and automated algorithms, the lack of comparative benchmarking makes it challenging to determine the current state-of-art, recognize limitations of existing approaches, and identify relevant future research directions. To provide practical guidance, we evaluated and compared the performance of trained experts, crowd sourced non-experts, and algorithms for annotating 305 objects coming from six datasets that include phase contrast, fluorescence, and magnetic resonance images. Compared to the gold standard established by expert consensus, we found the best annotators were experts, followed by non-experts, and then algorithms. This analysis revealed that online paid crowd sourced workers without domain-specific backgrounds are reliable annotators to use as part of the laboratory protocol for segmenting biomedical images. We also found that fusing the segmentations created by crowd sourced internet workers and algorithms yielded improved segmentation results over segmentations created by single crowd sourced or algorithm annotations respectively. We invite extensions of our work by sharing our data sets and associated segmentation annotations (http://www.cs.bu.edu/~betke/Biomedical Image Segmentation).	algorithm;benchmark (computing);crowdsourcing;display resolution;image segmentation;resonance	Danna Gurari;Diane H.

Design of accurate/approximate digital cerebro-vascular phantoms is a complex and difficult task, especially due to its complex geometry and interconnections. In this work, we have developed a 2-D/3-D interface for mathematical reconstruction of both approximate and accurate carotid arterial tree. Theory and methods related to the design of 3-D mathematical models are also discussed in details. The approximate phantoms are designed using sphere-based tubular structures, with a help of a custom-designed 2-D/3-D user interface. Accurate phantoms are designed from the patient's CTA images using an interactive mapping interface. In both the cases, multiple tubular structures with varying diameters are combined using piecewise cubic Bèzier Curves to generate the complete arterial phantom, around the Circle of Willis. Multi-level bifurcation phantoms with varying diameters are also presented with a qualitative analysis of the findings.	approximation algorithm;bifurcation theory;cubic function;experiment;hemodynamics;mathematical model;phantom reference;synthetic intelligence;user interface	Ankita Banerjee;Sudipta Dey;Shubhankar Parui;Mita Nasipuri;Subhadip Basu	2013	2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637147	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;computer science;hemodynamics;mathematics;biological engineering;user interface;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	36.98128948736399	-86.56734173339773	168438

The finite element method (FEM) was used for the simulations. The method allowed mapping of the anatomical origin of the microdialysis data and the electric stimulation for each patient. It was seen that the sampling and stimulation targets differed among the patients, and the results will therefore be used in the future interpretation of the biochemical data.	basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;computer simulation;deep brain stimulation;electric stimulation technique;electroconvulsive therapy;finite element method;functional electrical stimulation;microdialysis;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;sampling (signal processing)	Elin Diczfalusy;Nil Dizdar;Peter Zsigmond;Anita Kullman;Dan Loyd;Karin Wårdell	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347468	neuroscience;medicine;finite element method;mathematics;biological engineering;surgery	Visualization	27.295612608741283	-84.66818474821385	168707

For instance, it often reaches to more than 1000 slices of X-ray CT and MRI images in a single examination. This is mainly due to improvement in spatial and temporal resolution of images, and acquisition of multi-modal information from various imaging physics. In contrast to such rich information, image-reading workload for radiologists becomes extremely heavier. In some cases, radiologists can take only less than one second per slice image in average and oversights of abnormalities may possibly occur. Therefore, full or partial automation of such image-reading tasks is a natural demand. Generally, image-reading task includes visual search of abnormalities in images such as tumors, deformation or degeneration of tissues. The computational support technology for assisting radiologists, so-called “Computer-Assisted Diagnosis/Detection (CAD)”, based on image analysis and pattern recognition have a long history over 30 years. In the early phases of CAD technology development, simple schemes such as search of round-shaped structures were employed to obtain limited success due to lack of anatomical information. Recently, information of shape and structure of the inner organs as image analysis priors becomes indispensable for reliable results. That is, computational image understanding with anatomical knowledge is a certain standard of medical image analysis. Especially, thanks to machine learning approaches with high computational powers and large database, studies on statistical analysis and mathematical description of anatomical structures opened a new discipline called “Computational Anatomy”. In this lecture, several examples of state-of-the-art techniques and systems are introduced and discussed with the practical problems in clinical situations.	computation;computational anatomy;computer vision;computer-aided design;image analysis;machine learning;medical image computing;medical imaging;modal logic;pattern recognition;radiology	Yoshitaka Masutani	2015	2015 IEEE 8th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)	10.1109/IWCIA.2015.7449449	medical imaging;computer vision;image analysis;computer science;image registration;magnetic resonance imaging	Vision	34.69423995961493	-85.6330855008972	169363

The results from this field are now used in a variety of medical applications, including quantitative analysis of organ shapes, interventional assistance, surgical navigation, and population analysis. Several anatomical models have also been used in computational anatomy, and these mainly target millimeter-scale shapes. For example, liver-shape models are almost completely modeled at the millimeter scale, and shape variations are described at such scales. Most clinical 3D scanning devices have had just under 1 or 0.5 mm per voxel resolution for over 25 years, and this resolution has not changed drastically in that time. Although Z-axis (head-to-tail direction) resolution has been drastically improved by the introduction of multi-detector CT scanning devices, in-plane resolutions have not changed very much either. When we look at human anatomy, we can see different anatomical structures at different scales. For example, pulmonary blood vessels and lung lobes can be observed in millimeter-scale images. If we take 10-µm-scale images of a lung specimen, the alveoli and bronchiole regions can be located in them. Most work in millimeter-scale computational anatomy has been done by the medical-image analysis community. In the next two decades, we encourage our community to focus on micro-scale computational anatomy. In this perspective paper, we briefly review the achievements of computational anatomy and its impacts on clinical applications; furthermore, we show several possibilities from the viewpoint of microscopic computational anatomy by discussing experimental results from our recent research activities.	3d scanner;achievement;alveolus;anatomic structures;axis vertebra;biological specimen;blood vessel;bronchioles;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;ct scan;computation;computational technique;computational anatomy;detectors;image analysis;models, anatomic;numerous;optic axis of a crystal;published comment;structure of parenchyma of lung;voxel;lobe;millimeter	Kensaku Mori	2016	Medical image analysis	10.1016/j.media.2016.06.034	computer vision;simulation	Vision	35.99822940267338	-85.38481380484053	169414

Evaluating their strengths and limitations to predict nerve activation is fundamental to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and computation time. However, there are no studies aimed at clarifying the following questions. (1) Does the nerve activation differ between CM and PM? (2) How well do CM and PM approximate an AM? (3) What is the effect of the presence of blood vessels and nerve trunk on nerve activation prediction? Therefore, in this study, we addressed these questions by comparing nerve activation between CM, PM, and AM models by FES. The activation threshold was used to evaluate the models under different configurations of superficial electrodes (size and distance), nerve depths, and stimulation sites. Additionally, the influences of the sciatic nerve, femoral artery, and femoral vein were inspected for a human thigh. The results showed that the CM and PM had a high error rate, but the variation of the activation threshold followed the same tendency for electrode size and interelectrode distance variation as AM.	activation function;anisotropy;approximation algorithm;blood vessel;body tissue;computation (action);electric stimulation technique;femoral vein;functional electrical stimulation;lateral thinking;mathematical optimization;nerve fibers;nerve tissue;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;shin megami tensei: persona 3;stimulation (motivation);structure of femoral artery;structure of femoral nerve;structure of sciatic nerve;the superficial;thickness (graph theory);time complexity;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;electrode;interest	José Gómez-Tames;José González-Vargas;Wenwei Yu	2014		10.1155/2014/489240	computational biology;medical imaging;medicine;computer science;electrode;anisotropy;algorithm;anatomy;surgery	ML	26.64152526691126	-85.07339958530439	169446
874c86cbb4f0348e532345184583e5c734c99ab3	modelling of the current density distributions during cortical electric stimulation for neuropathic pain treatment		In the last two decades, motor cortex stimulation has been recognized as a valuable alternative to pharmacological therapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Although this technique started to be used in clinical studies, the debate about the optimal settings that enhance its effectiveness without inducing tissue damage is still open. To this purpose, computational approaches applied to realistic human models aimed to assess the current density distribution within the cortex can be a powerful tool to provide a basic understanding of that technique and could help the design of clinical experimental protocols. This study aims to evaluate, by computational techniques, the current density distributions induced in the brain by a realistic electrode array for cortical stimulation. The simulation outcomes, summarized by specific metrics quantifying the efficacy of the stimulation (i.e., the effective volume and the effective depth of penetration) over two cortical targets, were evaluated by varying the interelectrode distance, the stimulus characteristics (amplitude and frequency), and the anatomical human model. The results suggest that all these parameters somehow affect the current density distributions and have to be therefore taken into account during the planning of effective electrical cortical stimulation strategies. In particular, our calculations show that (1) the most effective interelectrode distance equals 2 cm; (2) increasing voltage amplitudes increases the effective volume; (3) increasing frequencies allow enlarging the effective volume; and (4) the effective depth of penetration is strictly linked to both the anatomy of the subject and the electrode placement.	adrenal cortex diseases;anatomic structures;cerebral cortex;computation;electric stimulation therapy;functional electrical stimulation;neuralgia;pain;pharmacology;protocols documentation;simulation;soft tissue injuries;voltage	Serena Fiocchi;Emma Chiaramello;Paolo Ravazzani;Marta Parazzini	2018		10.1155/2018/1056132	computer vision;current density;artificial intelligence;amplitude;stimulus (physiology);motor cortex;electronic engineering;computer science;neuropathic pain;stimulation;electrode array	ML	25.96297475045561	-83.47116854554348	169906

There are some commercial hip protectors which has both energy absorbing and energy shunting properties. In this study, a novel hip protector using shear thickening polymer (STP) is studied. The purpose of this work is to determine the optimal thickness of STP needed for maximum force attenuation. A mechanical test rig to simulate a person falling with sufficient impact energy to fracture the greater trochanter if unprotected was used together with biofidelic femur model which simulates the layer of flesh with skin. 8mm of STP together with 5mm foam gives the best force attenuation. When comparing the overall thickness with commercial hip protectors, STP hip protectors tested have much less thickness. Reduced thickness increases the compliance and comfort of STP hip protectors.	accidental falls;hip dislocation, congenital;hip fractures;maximum force;polymer;protector device component;simulation;structure of greater trochanter of femur;thickness (graph theory);waist–hip ratio;negative regulation of protein depolymerization	Taeyong Lee;Dong-Gyu Hwang;Naomichi Ogihara;Kohta Ito	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037152	attenuation;femur;hip protector;hip fracture;computer science;forensic engineering;greater trochanter;dilatant	Visualization	27.533588644080904	-86.17114697012111	170014

The morphology can be analyzed in many ways, in particular by the fractal analysis. Apart from the fractal dimension, an important part of the fractal analysis is the lacunarity measurement which, roughly speaking, characterizes the distribution of gaps in the fractal: a fractal with high lacunarity has large gaps. In this paper, we present an extension of the lacunarity measure to objects with nonregular shapes that enables us to provide a successful discrimination of cancer cell lines. The cell lines differ in the shape of vacuole (the gaps in their body) which is perfectly suited for the lacunarity analysis.		Przemyslaw Borys;Monika Krasowska;Zbigniew J. Grzywna;Mustafa B. A.

Its etiology remains enigmatic despite intense research efforts over many decades. By use of empirically well-constrained computer models describing the coupled function of the baroreceptor reflex and mechanics of the circulatory system, we demonstrate quantitatively that arterial stiffening seems sufficient to explain age-related emergence of hypertension. Specifically, the empirically observed chronic changes in pulse pressure with age and the impaired capacity of hypertensive individuals to regulate short-term changes in blood pressure arise as emergent properties of the integrated system. The results are consistent with available experimental data from chemical and surgical manipulation of the cardio-vascular system. In contrast to widely held opinions, the results suggest that primary hypertension can be attributed to a mechanogenic etiology without challenging current conceptions of renal and sympathetic nervous system function.	baroreflex;cns disorder;cerebrovascular accident;chronic disease;computer simulation;conception;digital single-lens reflex camera;emergence;essential hypertension;heart failure;hypertensive disease;intracranial hypertension;kidney diseases;mechanics;morbidity - disease rate;nervous system physiological phenomena;pulmonary hypertension;sympathetic nervous system	Klas H.

The non-Newtonian models chosen are characterized by the Carreau and Cross-Williamson models incorporating the effect of tapering due to the pulsatile nature of blood flow. The flow mechanism in the stenosed artery subject to a pulsatile pressure gradient arising from the normal functioning of the heart has been considered. An improved shape of the time-variant stenoses present in the tapered arterial lumen is given mathematically in order to update resemblance to the in vivo situation. Results were compared with powerlaw model and the differential approximation for the heat flux is invoked in the energy equation. The effect of heat transfer on the velocity is computed and discussed.	approximation;gradient;velocity (software development);video-in video-out	Mostafa Esmaeili;Ashkan Javadzadegan;Seid Ehsan Marashi	2008	2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/EMS.2008.109	pulsatile flow;diabetes mellitus;surgery;cardiology	Graphics	28.65390905178986	-85.4444146354556	170910

We illustrated the techniques using data from hearts under normal conditions (four embryos), and hearts in which blood flow conditions are altered through OFT banding (four embryos). The overall goal is to create quantitative measures of the temporal heart-shape change both within a single subject and between multiple subjects. These measures will help elucidate how altering hemodynamic conditions changes the shape and motion of the OFT walls, which in turn influence the stresses and strains on the developing heart, causing it to develop differently. We take advantage of the tubular shape and periodic motion of the OFT to produce successively lower dimensional visualizations and quantifications of the cardiac motion.	chinese wall;colour banding;computer vision;embryo;embryonic development;heart failure;hemodynamics;imagery;microsoft outlook for mac;optic nerve glioma, childhood;temporal logic;tract (literature);walls of a building;algorithm	Ly Phan;Sandra Rugonyi;Cindy Grimm	2015	Advances in visual computing : 11th International Symposium, ISVC 2015, Las Vegas, NV, USA, December 14-16, 2015, Proceedings.

This information is, however, interesting for studying the biomechanical properties of these organs as well as for modelling the relations between measurement modalities such as MRI and electromagnetic articulography. We have therefore attached fiducial markers made of MRI-visible polymers to a speaker’s articulators, and recorded a corpus of MRI midsagittal images. We then determined and analyzed the articulators’ contours and the markers’ centre coordinates. We found that the “apparent sliding” of markers with respect to lips and tongue contours ranges between 0.6 and 1.5 cm. Specifically, the curvilinear distances between two tongue flesh points relative to the total length varied up to about ±20%, confirming a non longitudinal elasticity of the contours. However, we have also found that the markers and jaw coordinates can predict the articulators’ contours with a variance explanation of about 85 %, and an RMS reconstruction error between 0.08 and 0.15 cm, compared with 74 to 95 % of variance and 0.07 to 0.14 cm of RMS error for the original articulatory models.	articulatory synthesis;elasticity (data store);fiducial marker;geographic coordinate system;tract (literature)	Pierre Badin;Julián Andrés Valdés Vargas;Arielle Koncki;Laurent Lamalle;Christophe Savariaux	2013			speech recognition;artificial intelligence;curvilinear coordinates;pattern recognition;tongue;electromagnetic articulography;computer science;vocal tract;fiducial marker	Vision	32.249782520830976	-88.52788724794003	172105

Automatic detection of the WMH can be valuable in diagnosing and monitoring of treatment effectiveness. T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images provided good contrast between the lesions and other tissue; however the signal intensity of gray matter tissue was close to the lesions in FLAIR images that may cause more false positives in the segment result. We developed and evaluated a tool for automated WMH detection only using high resolution 3D T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images. We use a high spatial frequency suppression method to reduce the gray matter area signal intensity. We evaluate our method in 26 MS patients and 26 age matched health controls. The data from the automated algorithm showed good agreement with that from the manual segmentation. The linear correlation between these two approaches in comparing WMH volumes was found to be Y = 1.04X + 1.74  (R (2) = 0.96). The automated algorithm estimates the number, volume, and category of WMH.	estimated;fluid attenuated inversion recovery;gray matter;hearing loss, high-frequency;hyperintensity of cerebral white matter on mri;image resolution;multiple sclerosis;patients;wolff-parkinson-white syndrome;zero suppression;algorithm	Yi Zhong;David Utriainen;Ying Wang;Yan Kang;E.

As an alternative approach to a bolus injection, binding can simply be measured as a ratio of tissue to metabolite-corrected plasma at a single time point under equilibrium conditions achieved by administering the radioligand with a bolus injection followed by a constant infusion. The purpose of this study was to validate the equilibrium method as an alternative to the standard kinetic method for measuring 18F-SP203 binding in the brain. Nine healthy subjects were injected with 18F-SP203 using a bolus plus constant infusion for 300 min. A single ratio of bolus-to-constant infusion (the activity of bolus equaled to that of infusion over 219 min) was applied to all subjects to achieve equilibrium in approximately 120 min. As a measure of ligand binding, we compared total distribution volume (VT) calculated by the equilibrium and kinetic methods in each scan. The equilibrium method calculated VT by the ratio of radioactivity in the brain to the concentration of 18F-SP203 in arterial plasma at 120 min, and the kinetic method calculated VT by a two-tissue compartment model using brain and plasma dynamic data from 0 to 120 min. VT obtained via the equilibrium method was highly correlated with VT obtained via kinetic modeling. Inter-subject variability of VT obtained via the equilibrium method was slightly smaller than VT obtained via the kinetic method. VT obtained via the equilibrium method was ~10% higher than VT obtained via the kinetic method, indicating a small difference between the measurements. Taken together, the results of this study show that using the equilibrium method is an acceptable alternative to the standard kinetic method when using 18F-SP203 to measure mGluR5. Although small differences in the measurements obtained via the equilibrium and kinetic methods exist, both methods consistently measured mGluR5 as indicated by the highly correlated VT values; the equilibrium method was slightly more precise, as indirectly measured by the smaller coefficient of variability across subjects. In addition, when using 18F-SP203, the equilibrium method is more efficient because it requires much less data.	administration procedure;anatomical compartments;bolus tracking;coefficient;dynamic data;editorial;gary kimura;glutamic acid;image analysis;intramural research program;kind of quantity - equilibrium;kinetics;ligands;maxima and minima;multi-compartment model;plasma active;polyethylene terephthalate;quantitation;radioactivity;snap25 wt allele;scanning;small;spatial variability;starling;sturnidae;subtype (attribute);switzerland;tachycardia, ventricular;density;drug distribution volume	Yasuyuki Kimura;Fabrice G.

We developed a system that allows diagnosis with a virtual microscope using digital images from complete slides under highest magnification. The major technical challenges were the large data volumes and the necessary visualisation speed. Using image streaming technologies, we developed a system that solves those problems. We present our system and its advantages. Fast access to reference cases, easy integration of telepathology and an uninterrupted digital workflow may, in the long-term, convince pathologists of the digital virtual microscope (DVM) as a realistic alternative to light microscope.	physics and astronomy classification scheme	Kai Saeger;Karsten Schlüns;Thomas Schrader;Peter Hufnagl	2003			magnification;computer vision;digital image;artificial intelligence;virtual microscope;picture archiving and communication system;visualization;optical microscope;telepathology;digital pathology;pathology;computer science	Robotics	38.04793199957089	-86.935178968185	172787

One of the major challenges during this procedure is to determine the correct prosthesis length intraoperatively, which specifies the tension on the tissues. A suboptimal tension on the tissues may decrease the sound conduction, cause prosthesis luxation and even injure the tympanic membrane or inner ear. Furthermore, the tissue deformations after the operation and variations in the ambient pressure may cause the same problems even if the prosthesis length was set correctly during the operation. However, the state of the art prostheses can only be adjusted during the operation and they cannot adapt themselves after the operation. In this paper, we present a new middle ear prosthesis that can adapt its length to changes occurring after the operation such as tissue swelling or unbalanced middle ear pressure.	reconstruction filter;unbalanced circuit;vii	Ismail Kuru;Johannes A.

Today this planning is done primarily in 2D, and the clinician places the iso-centres onto the current medical image. The images used are usually acquired by MRl, CT or angiography. In This work we investigate the use of interactive 3D visualization and haptics to perform the dose planning. In a pilot implementation we provide the user with a virtual environment with real-time graphics to visualize the target, surrounding tissue and iso-dose surfaces as well as an integrated graphical user interface. The overall aim of the implementation is to increase the efficiency and precision of the planning process by adding haptic feedback to represent various constraints and opportunities in the planning process and so guide the user to an optimal placement of the iso-centres. Preliminary feedback from potential users has been very positive.	feedback;graphical user interface;graphics;haptic technology;media resource locator;real-time clock;virtual reality	Ida Olofsson;Karljohan E.

No feedback from the outcome of the detection operation is provided. The quality of the resulting edge image, thus, tends to be uncontrollable. The performance of edge detection carI be improved by conducting the operation in a closed-loop system. This system performs an on-line objective edge evaluation. The evaluation process computes a set of edge metrics for the resulting image. An overall edge strength measurement of the image is obtained. No a @on knowledge about the edge distributions in the image is required for the measurement. Feedback of the evaluation adjusts, or guides the adjustment of, the edge opaator parameters, thus improving the quality of the resulting edge images.	edge detection;edge enhancement;feedback;online and offline	Qiuming Zhu	1992		10.1145/143559.143676	computer vision;medicine;data mining;biological engineering	Vision	36.77878602649177	-80.64327656122586	173937

The effects of variation of reaction of the subject during sneezing were also investigated. That is, the impacts of holding the nose or closing the mouth during sneezing on the pressure and velocity distributions were studied. Few works have studied the sneeze and therefore different aspects of this phenomenon have remained unknown. To cover more possibilities about the inlet condition of trachea in different sneeze scenarios, it was assumed that the suppressed sneeze happens with either the same inlet pressure or the same flow rate as the normal sneeze. The simulation results showed that during a normal sneeze, the pressure in the trachea reaches about 7000Pa, which is much higher than the pressure level of about 200Pa during the high activity exhalation. In addition, the results showed that, suppressing the sneeze by holding the nose or mouth leads to a noticeable increase in pressure difference in the tract. This increase was about 5 to 24 times of that during a normal sneeze. This significant rise in the pressure can justify some reported damage due to suppressing a sneeze.	anterior nares;assumed;burnett schwartz berberian syndrome;closing (morphology);computation;computational fluid dynamics;computational model;computer simulation;dental caries;eighteen;expiration, function;flow rate;fold (higher-order function);geforce 7 series;hydrodynamics;kilopascal;maxima and minima;meter per second;nasal cavity;nasal congestion (finding);nasopharynx;oral cavity;trachea;tract (literature);turbulence;velocity (software development)	Mohammad Rahiminejad;Abdalrahman Haghighi;Alireza Dastan;Omid Abouali;Mehrdad Farid;Goodarz Ahmadi	2016	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.01.022	text mining;simulation;medicine;pathology;computational fluid dynamics;computer science	HCI	27.517363042277754	-86.22128137952625	174019
dc2ba10cbf251f83215e7eaf896281b577195bf8	a novel mathematical method based on urea kinetic modeling for computing the dialysis dose	kinetic model;end stage renal disease;urea kinetic;standard deviation;limits of agreement;hemodialysis;kt v;clinical study;urea rebound;mathematical model;hemodialysis adequacy;mathematical modeling;clearance;kinetics	A novel normalized single pool urea kinetic model (nspUKM) for the quantification of the urea removal, dialyzer urea clearance and urea generation rate during a dialysis session, is presented. Its major goal is the computation of an accurate estimate of the fractional dialyzer urea clearance (dKt/V), which is denoted nKt/V, in contrast to the equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V). This work clarifies the significance of dKt/V as a complement to eKt/V in hemodialysis (HD) prescription and quantification. This new model emerges from a generalization of the standard single pool urea kinetic model (spUKM) of the US National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS), identified as gspUKM. Due to their significance, the standard single pool Kt/V (spKt/V) and the eKt/V are also analyzed from gspUKM in this work, with the aim of achieving a better interpretation of the results. Indices nKt/V, eKt/V and spKt/V have been compared with the dKt/V computed from a published and validated two-pool urea kinetic model (2pUKM). We present the results obtained from a clinical study carried out on a group of 30 end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The limits of agreement (mean+/-2S.D. (standard deviation) of the difference) between nKt/V and 2pKt/V were -0.077+/-0.72% (percentage of the dKt/V mean), while between eKt/V and 2pKt/V were -13.75+/-17.39% and between spKt/V and 2pKt/V were -1.61+/-6.54%. These scores prove that the nspUKM model is able to provide a very accurate estimate of 2pKt/V and thus dKt/V, even with high flux (HF) HD. The presented method joins the simplicity of single-pool models to the accuracy of double-pool models, when the target is the identification of the dialyzer urea clearance, urea removal and urea generation rate, although it does not provide a good prediction of the urea dynamics. Finally, we think that our analytical and experimental findings throw light on the behavior and applicability of the different Kt/V indices analyzed.	complement system proteins;computation (action);dialyzer;generalization (psychology);hemodialysis;inter-rater reliability;kidney diseases;kidney failure, chronic;kinetics;mathematics;patients;quantitation;scientific publication;urea	Manuel Prado-Velasco;Laura M.

For creation of initial three dimensional FE models of preoperative gastroduodenal region we used data from Multi Slice Computer Tomography (MSCT). Using the initial model we performed virtual gastric surgery. All post operational models were examined separately in order to find correlation between post operational geometry and pressure in duodenal stump.

We included deformation of the myocardial surface to achieve accurate modeling. For perpendicular catheter contact, we measured the side view of myocardial deformation using X-ray projection imaging. We averaged the deformation contour from nine samples, and then incorporated the contour information into our FEM model. We measured the resistivity of the bovine myocardium using the four-electrode method, and then calculated the resistance change as the catheter penetrated into the myocardium. The FEM result of resistance versus catheter penetration depth matches well with our experimental data.	bos taurus;cardiac ablation;characteristic impedance;contour line;dispersive partial differential equation;finite element method;myocardium;nominal impedance;quantitative impedance;radio frequency	Hong Cao;Michael A.

2cec57c86c3d8d95805a827bb8535d79837f2688	rapid cartesian versus radial acquisition: comparison of two sequences for hepatobiliary phase mri at 3 tesla in patients with impaired breath-hold capabilities	breathing artifact reduction;hepatobiliary mri;liver-specific contrast agent;radial vibe	BACKGROUND Hepatocyte-specific gadolinium based contrast agents (HSCA) provide substantial information for the classification of liver lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, breathing artifacts which reduce image quality and diagnostic confidence of hepatobiliary phase acquisitions are regularly observed in clinical routine. The aim of this study was to evaluate two approaches to reduce breathing artifacts for hepatobiliary phase imaging.   METHODS Twenty minutes after administration of a HSCA (gadoxetic acid), a T1-weighted VIBE sequence with radial k-space sampling (radialVIBE, 180 s acquisition time in free breathing) and a highly accelerated Cartesian VIBE with Dixon fat separation (CD-VIBE, CAIPIRINHA acceleration with r = 2 × 2, breath-hold 8-10 s) were acquired in 35 patients (12 female, 57 ± 13 years), who showed breath-holding difficulties in early phases of the examinations. Image quality (image sharpness, noise, artifacts, homogeneity of fat saturation, bile duct delineation and overall image quality) as well as conspicuity and liver-to-lesion signal intensity (SI) ratios of focal liver lesions were assessed for both radial- and CD-VIBE.   RESULTS Overall image quality was rated good to excellent for both sequences, while CD-VIBE was preferred in most cases. Though radialVIBE received better results regarding image noise and artifacts, both sequences were rated equally regarding bile duct delineation and sharpness. Focal liver lesion (n = 42) conspicuity was rated significantly better and SI-ratios were significantly higher on CD-VIBE (2.45 ± 1.44 vs. 1.61 ± 0.70 in radialVIBE, p = 0.0001). In three patients, CD-VIBE was rated non-diagnostic due to severe breathing artifacts, while radialVIBE was diagnostic in those patients.   CONCLUSION Both highly accelerated Cartesian as well as radial acquisition techniques provide good to excellent image quality in hepatobiliary phase MRI. In comparison, CD-VIBE offered better overall image quality and liver lesion conspicuity. However, radialVIBE was a valuable alternative in patients unable to sustain even short breath-hold intervals. Further studies including lager patient cohorts are desirable to allow a transfer of these results to a general patient population.	artifact (software development);bile duct structure;breath tests;cd-rom;cartesian closed category;contrast media;dixon's factorization method;focal (programming language);gadolinium;gadoxetic acid;hepatobiliary system;image noise;image quality;liver diseases;magnetic resonance imaging;morphologic artifacts;patients;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;population;radial (radio);rating (action);sampling (signal processing);silicon;tesla - unit;lager	Johannes Budjan;Philipp Riffel;Melissa M.

Nanoparticle formulations are advantageous over conventional chemotherapy because they can incorporate multiple diagnostic and therapeutic agents and are associated with significantly less adverse effects due to selective accumulation to tumor tissue. Despite their great promise, however, only a few nanoparticle formulations have been approved for clinical use in oncology. The failure of nano-scale drugs to enhance cancer therapy is in large part due to inefficient delivery. Indeed, physiological barriers posed by the tumor micro-environment inhibit homogeneous distribution of drugs to the interstitial space of tumors and compromise the efficacy of the treatment. To overcome this outstanding problem, a better understanding of how the physical properties (i.e., size, and surface charge) of nanoparticles affect their transport in tumors is required. Here we use a mathematical model to provide basic design guidelines for the optimal delivery of nanoparticle formulations.	gnu nano;interstitial webpage;mathematical model;tree accumulation	Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos;Konstantinos Soteriou;Dai Fukumura;Rakesh K.

However, the extensive resection remains controversial because the tumor margin is difficult to be distinguished from surrounding normal and/or edematous brain. It has been established that photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) induced by 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is used as a fluorescence detection marker for photodiagnosis of malignant gliomas. We tried to study whether or not the location of fluorescence detection using 5-ALA is compatible with image-guided tumor location and whether or not the fluoresce-positive tissue contained tumor cell by histological staining. Patients with malignant gliomas received oral doses of 5-ALA before anesthesia. During surgery, an MR image was scanned and registered for navigation system. Tumor fluorescence was visualized under Ultra-violet (UV) light illumination. The locations of fluorescence detection were confirmed by the real-time navigation. The marked fluorescing tissues were removed and used for following histological analysis. The locations of fluorescence detection were confirmed to be in agreement with Gd-enhanced region indicated by real-time navigation, whereas the area was macroscopically impossible to distinguish from the regions in which there was no radiological enhancement. Histological study showed that the tissues from fluorescence positive regions contained tumor cells.	real-time clock	Takashi Maruyama;Yoshihiro Muragaki;Hiroshi Iseki;Osami Kubo;Makoto Mochizuki;Shinichirou Seo;Ichiro Sakuma;Tomokatsu Hori;Kintomo Takakura	2001			medicine;pathology;computer science;surgery;medical physics	Robotics	35.710826590485674	-81.35369778802796	175270

Some of these applications include chronic wound healing, electrical stimulation of cardiac tissue and medical imaging among others. The effectiveness of these applications strongly relies on the uniformity of the field, a feature closely related to the arrangement of the coils that generates it. In this paper, genetic algorithms are used to create appropriate arrangements of coils in order to generate a field with a wide volume of uniformity. Results show that the proposed methodology is an effective tool for designing coil arrangements capable of generating magnetic field within an arbitrary volume of interest in which field uniformity is higher than in designs using a traditional approach.	circuit complexity;coil device component;electric stimulation technique;functional electrical stimulation;genetic algorithm;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;region of interest;wound infection	Ruben Gaitan-Ortiz;Juan Gonzalez-Suarez;Carlos Sanchez-Villarreal;Alejandro Nunez-Priego	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346143	medical imaging;biomagnetism;genetic algorithm;medicine;magnetic field;computer science;engineering;biological engineering;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics;quantum mechanics;medical physics	EDA	27.171124978394822	-83.82590765284353	176658

Experimental data on the plantar pressure for treadmill walking of a subject were obtained using the Pedar® system. The plantar pressure resultant was monitored during walking and adopted to define the loading conditions for a subsequent static numerical analysis. Geometrical configuration of the foot model is provided on the basis of biomedical images. Because the mechanical behaviour of adipose tissues and plantar fascia is the determinant factor in affecting the paths of the plantar pressure, specific attention was paid to define an appropriate constitutive model for these tissues. The numerical model included sole and insole, providing for friction contact conditions between foot–insole and insole–sole pairs as well. Two different numerical analyses were performed with regards to different loading conditions during the gait cycle. The plantar pressure peaks predicted by the numerical model for the two loading conditions are 0.16 and 0.12 MPa, and 0.09 and 0.12 MPa in the posterior and anterior regions of the foot, respectively. These values are in agreement with experimental evidence, showing the suitability of the model proposed.	3-mercaptopropionic acid;adipose tissue;body tissue;entity name part qualifier - adopted;friction;mathematical model;numerical analysis;pedobarography;plantar - anatomical location;plantar fascia structure;resultant;sole of foot;treadmill, device	Arturo N.

0d6c4abb19ce3ebd7d27df3d19e39d91b92b587e	animated-tem: a toolbox for electron microscope automation based on image analysis	target selection;fully automated electron microscope;specimen characterization;transmission electron microscope	To automate electron microscopy tasks, the main challenge is to integrate image interpretation. This article presents a first achievement in the domain of electron microscopy. ANalysis of IMages for Automatic Targeting and Extraction of Data in Transmission Electron Microscopy (ANIMATED-TEM) is a software toolbox composed of a set of image analysis algorithms and an examination scenario. Combined with microscope software, it runs all the microscope tasks and manages the exploration strategy of the carbon-coated grids on which the sample of interest (viruses, proteins, bi-dimensional crystal of membrane proteins, etc.) has been deposited. ANIMATED-TEM realizes the automatic examination of biological samples, working at several magnifications without human intervention. Online image analysis of micrographs is an essential part both to extract characteristic data and to manage automation, as interesting regions need to be identified to trigger new acquisitions at higher magnifications. This toolbox has been developed to perform high-throughput screening of 2D-crystallization experiments. It is operational on a microscope equipped with an automatic grid loading system, allowing the continuous and automatic analysis of up to 96 samples. Intensive testing over a period of several months confirms that ANIMATED-TEM achieves full automation with an efficient target selection and in a suitable computational time.	algorithm;automation;charge-coupled device;control theory;electron;experiment;high-level programming language;high-throughput computing;image analysis;image processing;multistage interconnection networks;region of interest;throughput;time complexity	Gilles Hermann;Nicolas Coudray;Jean-Luc Buessler;Daniel Caujolle-Bert;Hervé-William Rémigy;Jean-Philippe Urban	2011	Machine Vision and Applications	10.1007/s00138-011-0357-5	computer vision;transmission electron microscopy	Graphics	31.076701541895414	-81.40455454359979	176753
4f3f4a9f9644ece8a04af95e5ab5a36b67e61f14	feasibility of photoplethysmography imaging of the sole of the foot		In photoplethysmography imaging the blood volume pulse is extracted from subtle skin color variations recorded with a camera. In most works, the camera is oriented towards the face or the palm of the hand. Recently, it has been shown that applying contact force to the skin, e.g. through contact with a glass plate, increases signal strength. However, this approach is prohibitive for the face and there are applications where the hands are not accessible. In this paper, we address this issue by applying photoplethysmography imaging to the sole of the foot, which is placed on a glass plate and exposed to controlled illumination. We investigate (1) whether this setup acquires signals with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio and (2) whether the feet can be used as a replacement for the more commonly used hands. Additionally, we analyze (3) whether using a carefully selected pixel subset instead of all pixels improves signal-to-noise ratio. We report on experimental data from $\mathrm {N} = 21$ healthy subjects that we make publicly available 1. We applied photoplethysmography imaging to the sole of the foot and the palm of the hand and used a commercial finger photoplethysmography unit as ground truth. It is problematic that there is no established best practice for signal-to-noise estimation in PPGi research; hence we use five different metrics with three from literature. Additionally, we compare the agreement of these metrics using the experimental data. Our results show that (1) the proposed setup acquires signals with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, (2) using all pixels from foot videos results in slightly inferior performance compared to the hand, but (3) using pixel subsets improves signal quality at the foot to the level of the hand. These results pave the way for the development of a photoplethysmography imaging setup applied at the sole of the foot for different medical applications.1All data used in this study is freely available online: http://www.github.com/nspi/rise/	best practice;ground truth;photographic plate;pixel;pulse;signal-to-noise ratio	Nicolai Spicher;Tyler Lovelace;Markus Kukuk	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2018.8438656	experimental data;signal strength;computer vision;pixel;artificial intelligence;ground truth;pulse (signal processing);photoplethysmogram;computer science	Vision	25.48958569669607	-88.93633722900715	176899

This can in part be attributed to the lack of a solid and open quality assurance framework to assess and compare their performance. Building upon our previous work, we present here a new pipeline for the benchmarking of such algorithms making use of realistic 2D synthetic sequences. While the synthetic motion is fully controlled by a computational heart model, the visual appearance is extremely similar to a real ultrasound recording. The pipeline is used to generate an initial library of four sequences.	algorithm;computation;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Martino Alessandrini;Brecht Heyde;Sophie Giffard-Roisin;Hervé Delingette;Maxime Sermesant;Pascal Allain;Olivier Bernard;Mathieu De Craene;Jan D'hooge	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163982	computer vision;simulation;pipeline transport;strain;solid modeling;computational model;heart	Vision	36.34528719698202	-86.40664376002366	177027

To find coherent structures within the dataset is the most important part of analyzing dSPECT data. Usually the observer focuses on a certain structure or an organ, which is to be identified and outlined. We use a user-guided method where a starting point is interactively selected whcih is also used to identify the object or structure. To find the starting point for segentation we search for the voxel having the maximum intensity in the dataset along the eye beam. In the situation where the data is segmented by region growing, we render both, the segmentation result and the original data in one view. The segmentation result is displayed as a wire mesh and fades over the voluem rendered original data. We use this hybrid rendering method in order to enable the user to validate the correctness of the sementation process. So it is possible to compare the two objects in one rendition.© (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Microarray image processing is an essential aspect of microarray experiment, of which gridding is thought to be the most important step of spot recognition. Many times, microarray image gridding requires assisted intervention to achieve the acceptable accuracy. In this paper, an automatic microarray image gridding algorithm was presented by using image projection vectors together with power spectrum model. For obtaining grid position, the image projection vectors were utilized by adequately considering the grid parameters. On the other hand, as a preprocessing procedure of microarray gridding, detection of the grid rotation was involved in our study by using power spectrum analyses of the image projection vectors. Our approach has been evaluated by three different microarray datasets. Experimental comparisons with up-to-date approaches by using both synthetic and real image data are demonstrated. The gridding result was shown to be very accurate, and able to provide correct gridding dataset for the downstream microarray analyses. In summary, our study demonstrated the combination of image projection vectors with power spectrum model as a powerful strategy for microarray image gridding.	microarray;projector;spectral density	Ning Deng;Huilong Duan	2010	IJPRAI	10.1142/S021800141000810X	computer vision;computer science;bioinformatics;microarray;data mining;image segmentation;spectral density;automatic transmission	Vision	32.14594742304383	-80.49472523079156	177753

Physicians commonly use sketches as part of their note taking in patient records and to help convey diagnoses and treatments to patients. Medical students frequently use sketches to help them think through clinical problems in individual and group problem solving. Applications ranging from automated patient records to medical education software could benefit greatly from the richer and more natural interfaces that would be enabled by the ability to understand sketches. In this paper we take the first steps toward developing a system that can understand anatomical sketches.   METHODS Understanding an anatomical sketch requires the ability to recognize what anatomical structure has been sketched and from what view (e.g. parietal view of the brain), as well as to identify the anatomical parts and their locations in the sketch (e.g. parts of the brain), even if they have not been explicitly drawn. We present novel algorithms for sketch recognition and for part identification. We evaluate the accuracy of the recognition algorithm on sketches obtained from medical students. We evaluate the part identification algorithm by comparing its results to the judgment of an experienced physician.   RESULTS The sketch recognition algorithm achieves a recognition accuracy of 75.5%, far above the baseline random classification accuracy of 6.7%. Comparison of the results of the part identification algorithm with the judgment of an experienced physician shows close agreement in terms of location, orientation, size, and shape of the identified parts.   CONCLUSIONS The performance of our prototype in terms of accuracy and running time provides strong evidence that development of robust sketch understanding systems for medical domains is an attainable goal. Further work needs to be done to extend the approach to sketches containing multiple and partial anatomical structures, as well as to be able to interpret sketch annotations.

However, nerve stimulation should be avoided. Here, we show that a microstructured electrode array can significantly confine the electric field to the nerve-free SC. The prototype electrode-reservoir device (ERD) contains field-confining electrodes and a fluorescent drug surrogate [sulphorhodamine (SR)]. In vivo human experiments at the forearm with approximately rectangular voltage pulses up to 500 V and 1-ms duration cause electroporation as measured by skin resistance change but only rarely caused sensation. Human skin in vitro experiments with such pulses up to 300 V transported SR across the SC.

For surgeons it is paramount to know the location of surgically relevant nerves and vessels. Especially in surgery of the lateral (outside) foot, the anatomy is not always completely clear since the location of nerves and vessels is highly variable. Therefore CASAM is developed by students in Delft and Rotterdam (Netherlands). This web-application is based on the Django-framework and is a useful tool for three usergroups: 1) Researchers: After photographing dissected specimen a Thin Plate Spline transformation is used to compute an average foot and the pictures of individual specimen are warped to match this reference, average-foot. Renditions can be made to depict relevant surgical anatomy. Finally the researchers can define a zone in the lateral foot in which it is safe to approach the operation site. 2) Surgeons: Relevant anatomy (gathered by the researcher) can be warped over the picture of the patient. This pre-operative planning using CASAM assists the surgeon in determining a ‘tailor made’ safe-zone for each patient. 3) Students: For educational purposes, a drawn incision line can be compared to the computed location of nerves and vessels, thus providing personal	biological specimen;django;image;lateral computing;lateral thinking;thin plate spline;web application	A.

To date, the modeling work has concentrated on the myocardium with periodic spatial structure; this paper investigates potentials arising in cardiac fibers with random spatial structure. Ten different random fibers consisting of cells with varying length (l/sub c/=100/spl plusmn/50 /spl mu/m), diameter (d/sub c/ 20 /spl plusmn/ 10 /spl mu/m), thickness of extracellular space (t/sub e/=1.18/spl plusmn/0.59 /spl mu/m), and junctional resistance (R/sub j/=2/spl plusmn/1 M/spl Omega/) are studied. Simulations demonstrate that randomizing spatial structure introduces to the field-induced potential (V/sub m/) a randomly varying baseline, which arises due to polarization of groups of cells. This polarization appears primarily in response to randomizing t/sub e/; R/sub j/, l/sub c/, and d/sub c/ have less influence. The maximum V/sub m/ increases from 3.5 mV in a periodic fiber to 20.5/spl plusmn/4.7 mV in random fibers (1 V/cm field applied for 5 ms). Field stimulation threshold E/sub th/ decreases from 6.9 to 1.59/spl plusmn/0.43 V/cm, which is within the range of experimental measurements. Thresholds for normal and reversed field polarities are statistically equivalent: 1.59/spl plusmn/0.43 versus 1.44/spl plusmn/0.41 V/cm, (p value = 0.453). Thus, V/sub m/ arising due to random structure of the myocardium may play an important role in field stimulation and defibrillation."""	baseline (configuration management);diameter (protocol);polarization (waves);randomness;sawtooth (cellular automaton);thickness (graph theory)	Wanda Krassowska Neu	2003	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2002.807324	electronic engineering;neuroscience;gap junction;membrane potential;engineering;electrical engineering;electric field;biological engineering;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	26.486987300210817	-84.3892699187122	179232

As the diagnostic ability of this tool is unproven, we evaluated the ability to diagnose acute appendicitis on abdominal CT using a mobile DICOM viewer. This HIPAA compliant study was IRB-approved. Twenty-five abdominal CT studies from patients with RLQ pain were interpreted on a handheld device (iPhone) using a DICOM viewer (OsiriX mobile) by five radiologists. All patients had surgical confirmation of acute appendicitis or follow-up confirming no acute appendicitis. Studies were evaluated for the ability to find the appendix, maximum appendiceal diameter, presence of an appendicolith, periappendiceal stranding and fluid, abscess, and an assessment of the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Results were compared to PACS workstation. Fifteen cases of acute appendicitis were correctly identified on 98% of interpretations, with no false-positives. Eight appendicoliths were correctly identified on 88% of interpretations. Three abscesses were correctly identified by all readers. Handheld device measurement of appendiceal diameter had a mean 8.6% larger than PACS measurements (p = 0.035). Evaluation for acute appendicitis on abdominal CT studies using a portable device DICOM viewer can be performed with good concordance to reads performed on PACS workstations.	asea irb;abscess;acute appendicitis nos (disorder);appendix;atrial premature complexes;compliance behavior;concordance (publishing);dicom;diameter (qualifier value);handheld game console;health insurance portability and accountability act;interpretation process;large;mobile computing;mobile device;osirix;pain;patients;physics and astronomy classification scheme;picture archiving and communication system;workstation;confirmation - responselevel	Asim F.

0d7bb6ca81aa693498afce583fbe8172fdfbca0b	hybrid simulation of brain-skull growth	surgical simulation;hybrid deformation model;craniosynostosis;brain skull growth	This paper describes a hybrid model that includes both a standard finite element model and also volume-preserving structural modeling for a clinical application involving skull development in infants, with particular application to craniostosis modeling. To accommodate the growing brain, the skull needs to grow quickly in the first few months of life, and most of the growth of the skull at that time occurs at the sutures. Craniosynostosis, which is a developmental abnormality, occurs when one or more sutures are fused early in life (even in utero) while the skull is growing, resulting in an abnormal skull shape. To study normal brain–skull growth and to develop a model of craniosynostosis, we have developed a hybrid computational model to simulate the relationship between the growing deformable brain and the rigid skull. Our model is composed of the nine segmented skull plates as rigid surfaces, deformable sutures, and a volumetrically controllable deformable brain. The Cranial Index (ratio of biparietal width to fronto-occipital length) is measured during the simulation, showing a characteristic peak during development. Measures of linear growth along each dimension show characteristic increases over time. The hybrid simulation framework shows promise to support further investigations into abnormal skull development. By varying the properties of the sutures in our model, we can now simulate different craniosynostosis models, such as scaphocephaly and trigonocephaly. In this paper, we show results on the evolution of the Cranial Index as calculated using standard landmarks and compare to the normal index, and thereby evaluate our model by comparing it with patient data.	class diagram;computation;computational model;craniometry;finite element method;graphics;interaction;linear function;mac os x 10.3 panther;measure-preserving dynamical system;new media;simulation	Jing Jin;Sahar Shahbazi;John E.

Moreover, some of the diagnoses that are given to classify a footprint deformity are based on a qualitative interpretation by the physician; there is no quantitative interpretation of the footprint. The importance of providing a correct and accurate diagnosis lies in the need to ensure that an appropriate treatment is provided for the improvement of the patient without risking his or her health. Therefore, this article presents a smart sensor that integrates the capture of the footprint, a low computational-cost analysis of the image and the interpretation of the results through a quantitative evaluation. The smart sensor implemented required the use of a camera (Logitech C920) connected to a Raspberry Pi 3, where a graphical interface was made for the capture and processing of the image, and it was adapted to a podoscope conventionally used by specialists such as orthopedist, physiotherapists and podiatrists. The footprint diagnosis smart sensor (FPDSS) has proven to be robust to different types of deformity, precise, sensitive and correlated in 0.99 with the measurements from the digitalized image of the ink mat.	anthropometry;appropriate treatment;computation;congenital abnormality;graphical user interface;image processing;ink (substance);interface device component;isoelectric point;memory footprint;patients;prenatal diagnosis;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);smart transducer;spinal deformities	J.

In this paper, the in vivo static and dynamic mechanical behavior of the liver and lower esophagus of pigs were presented both in linear and nonlinear regions under compressive and shear indentations. A robotic device was programmed to function as a mechanical stimulator with a 2-mm flat-tipped cylindrical probe attached to its tip. A series of ramp and hold stimuli, as well as sinusoidal indentation stimuli, were delivered to the organs and reaction forces were measured. The conditions for these indentation stimuli were designed such that they were similar to conditions in an operating room. Experiments were also carried out on the organs for ex vivo and in vitro conditions. Results show that the breathing and pulse rate significantly affect the measured force responses of the organs. From the obtained force-displacement relationships, steady-state impedances as well as dynamic impedances of both organs were calculated. The results also show that in vivo steady-state impedance of the lower esophagus is significantly higher than that of the liver. The in vivo steady-state response of the liver, however, exhibits a greater degree of nonlinearity than that of the lower esophagus. The in vivo steady-state response of the lower esophagus in the three orthogonal directions also indicates that the lower esophagus is not significantly anisotropic. The impedance of both organs under sinusoidal indentations (0-5 Hz) are fairly similar each other. Magnitudes of the impedance over the stimulus frequencies are fairly constant. The impedance phase angles decrease over the range of stimulus frequencies applied. Comparison of the measurements obtained from the in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro experiments shows that the mechanical properties of the biological tissues change significantly after the death of the animal. The tissues generally become stiffer and exhibit greater nonlinearity. The degree of change in their mechanical properties is dependent on the amount of time after the death of the animal. These data can be further utilized in the computing of the material parameters of tissue models for laparoscopic surgery simulators as well as open surgery simulators	abdomen;behavior;body tissue;cessation of life;characteristic impedance;computation (action);curve fitting;displacement mapping;erewhon;esophagus;euthanasia;exhibits as topic;experiment;hertz (hz);in vitro [publication type];interaction;mathematical model;musculoskeletal diseases;nominal impedance;nonlinear system;open surgical procedure;operating room;organ measurement domain;psychologic displacement;quantitative impedance;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;robot;simulators;steady state;surgery simulator;surgical procedures, laparoscopic;video-in video-out;virtual reality;recurrent childhood visual pathway glioma	Boon K.

The SD-OCT data acquisition is performed directly on the tissue block, diminishing the need for cutting, mounting and staining. We utilized SD-OCT to visualize the laminar structure of the isocortex and compared cortical cytoarchitecture with the gold standard Nissl staining, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In histological processing, distortions routinely affect registration to the blockface image and prevent accurate 3D reconstruction of regions of tissue. We compared blockface registration to SD-OCT and Nissl, respectively, and found that SD-OCT-blockface registration was significantly more accurate than Nissl-blockface registration. Two independent observers manually labeled cortical laminae (e.g. III, IV and V) in SD-OCT images and Nissl stained sections. Our results show that OCT images exhibit sufficient contrast in the cortex to reliably differentiate the cortical layers. Furthermore, the modalities were compared with regard to cortical laminar organization and showed good agreement. Taken together, these SD-OCT results suggest that SD-OCT contains information comparable to standard histological stains such as Nissl in terms of distinguishing cortical layers and architectonic areas. Given these data, we propose that SD-OCT can be used to reliably generate 3D reconstructions of multiple cubic centimeters of cortex that can be used to accurately and semi-automatically perform standard histological analyses.	3d reconstruction;accident and emergency department;autistic disorder;blueprint;brainfuck;cerebrovascular accident;cortical implant;cubic function;data acquisition;distortion;dyslexia;human connectome project;imaging techniques;medicine, east asian traditional;micron;neocortex;neuroscience discipline;physiological sexual disorders;policy;sd, rat strain;snord24 gene;sectioning technique;semiconductor industry;software release life cycle;staining method;stains;tissue fiber;tomography, optical coherence;tracer;united states national institutes of health;women's health services;anatomical layer;biomedical engineering field;centimeter;nervous system disorder;observers;registration - actclass;research grants;tomography	Caroline Magnain;Jean Augustinack;Martin Reuter;Christian Wachinger;Matthew P.

Planar and DBT images were created from mathematical models of breasts with and without inserted clusters of 5 identical calcifications. Regions of interest from the images were used in a series of 4-alternative forced choice human observer experiments using the clusters as targets. Three calcification diameters were used for each imaging condition. The threshold diameter required for micro-calcification detection was determined for a detection rate of 92.5i¾?% at mean glandular doses of 1.25, 2.5, and 5i¾?mGy. The measured threshold micro-calcification diameter was lower for planar mammography than for the DBT modality. The threshold micro-calcification diameter decreased with increasing dose for planar and DBT imaging. The image modality used had a larger effect on the threshold diameter than the dose change considered.	tomosynthesis	Alistair Mackenzie;Andria Hadjipanteli;Premkumar Elangovan;Padraig T.

Development of image-based modeling technologies for simulating patient-specific local blood flows is introducing a novel approach to risk prediction for coronary plaque growth and progression. In this study, we developed 3-D model of plaque formation and progression that was tested in a set of patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for anginal symptoms. The 3-D blood flow is described by the Navier-Stokes equations, together with the continuity equation. Mass transfer within the blood lumen and through the arterial wall is coupled with the blood flow and is modeled by a convection-diffusion equation. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) transports in lumen of the vessel and through the vessel tissue (which has a mass consumption term) are coupled by Kedem-Katchalsky equations. The inflammatory process is modeled using three additional reaction-diffusion partial differential equations. A full 3-D model was created. It includes blood flow and LDL concentration, as well as plaque formation and progression. Furthermore, features potentially affecting plaque growth, such as patient risk score, circulating biomarkers, localization and composition of the initial plaque, and coronary vasodilating capability were also investigated. The proof of concept of the model effectiveness was assessed by repetition of CTA, six months after the baseline evaluation. Besides the low values of local shear stress, plaque characteristics, risk profile, pattern of circulating adhesion molecules, and reduced coronary flow reserve at baseline appeared to affect plaque progression toward flow-limiting lesions at follow-up evaluation. Although preliminary, our multidisciplinary approach to a “personalized” prediction of coronary plaque progression suggests that incorporation in atherosclerotic models of systemic and local hemodynamic features may better predict evolution of plaques in coronary artery disease stable patients.	3d modeling;arteriopathic disease;atherosclerosis;baseline (configuration management);biological markers;blood vessel tissue;ct scan;cancer/testis antigen;cell proliferation;cerebrovascular disorders;color gradient;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computed tomography angiography;computer simulation;convection;coronary artery disease;dental plaque;endothelial cells;flow;hemodynamics;hydrodynamics;internationalization and localization;intravascular ultrasound;low-density lipoproteins;mobility aid;muscle cells;muscle, smooth, vascular;myocytes, smooth muscle;navier–stokes equations;patients;personalization;progressive disease;quantitation;scott continuity;senile plaques;smooth muscle (tissue);structure of lumen of body system;triune continuum paradigm;vasodilation;video-in video-out;x-ray computed tomography;angiogram;molecular modeling;shear stress	Oberdan Parodi;Themis P.

The more accurate the skull model is the more reliable the identification decision will be. Usually, forensics are obliged to perform a manual and time consuming process in order to obtain the model of the scanned forensic object. At least semiautomatic methods are demanded by these experts to assist them with this task. Our contribution aims to propose an evolutionary-based image registration methodology for the skull 3D model building problem. Experiments are performed over thirty two problem instances corresponding to a semiautomatic and fully automatic real skull model reconstruction.	3d modeling;computer forensics;image registration;supra, inc.

However, the interelectrode spacing of common clinical brain surface electrodes still remains around 10 mm. Here, we present details on development of electrodes for attaining higher quality electrocorticographic signals for use in functional brain mapping and brain-machine interface (BMI) technologies. Methods: We used platinum-plate-electrodes of 1-mm diameter to produce sheet electrodes after the creation of individualized molds using a 3-D printer and a press system that sandwiched the electrodes between personalized silicone sheets. Results: We created arrays to fit the surface curvature of the brain and inside the central sulcus, with interelectrode distances of 2.5 mm (a density of 16 times previous standard types). Rat experiments undertaken indicated no long term toxicity. We were also able to custom design, rapidly manufacture, safely implant, and confirm the efficacy of personalized electrodes, including the capability to attain meaningful high-gamma-band information in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient. Conclusion: We developed cortical sheet electrodes with a high-spatial resolution, tailor-made to match an individual's brain. Significance: This sheet electrode may contribute to the higher performance of BMI's.	3d computer graphics;3d printing;adverse reaction to drug;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;brain mapping;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;diameter (qualifier value);distance;experiment;filamentous fungus;groove;ion implantation;lateral thinking;patients;personalization;platinum;printer (computing);printer device component;silicones;structure of central sulcus;electrode	Shayne Morris;Masayuki Hirata;Hisato Sugata;Tetsu Goto;Kojiro Matsushita;Takufumi Yanagisawa;Youichi Saitoh;Haruhiko Kishima;Toshiki Yoshimine	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2014.2329812	neuroscience;electrical engineering;electrode;biological engineering;surgery	Visualization	24.773798009340055	-83.53202749251302	184415

However, due to cardiac motion pulsation artefacts arising from the beating heart might affect images of pericardial lung areas and mediastinal vessels. We developed a gated thoracic imaging technique to avoid these pulsation artefacts. The temporal correlation to the stream of projection data can be provided either by the ECG of the patient or by the Cardiac Motion Function which can be computed directly from CT raw data. Due to multi-slice detector technology the conical shape of projection data has to be taken into account. This is achieved using stacks (booklets) of double-oblique reconstructi on planes (pages) at different positions of the spiral path. The slope of the pages is adapted to the spiral geometry and optimized for utilization of almost all of the detector data. Only those booklets are contributing to final image slices that are related to the diastolic phase of the beating heart. Volume coverage of half the detector height per rotation can be achieved. Using the leading-edge 16 -slice detector technology with 0.4s gantry rotation the entire thorax can be scanned with 0.75mm sampling within less than 25s. It will be shown, that the Cardiac Motion Function can be used as an adequate substitute for the ECG of the patient. In addition it is shown, that pericardial lung areas are depicted much sharper using gated reconstruction and that motion artefacts in mediastinal vessels are effectively suppressed.

The treatment options include surgical repair, stent implantation, and balloon angioplasty. In order to evaluate the physiological significance of the pre-operative coarctation and to assess the post-operative results, the hemodynamic analysis is usually performed by measuring the pressure gradient (deltaP) across the coarctation site via invasive cardiac catheterization. The measure of success is reduction of the (deltaP > 20 mmHg) systolic blood pressure gradient. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive method based on Computational Fluid Dynamics and MR imaging to estimate the pre- and post-operative hemodynamics for both native and recurrent coarctation patients. High correlation of our results and catheter measurements is shown on corresponding pre- and post-operative examination of 5 CoA patients.	angioplasty, balloon;aorta;aortic arch structure;aortic coarctation;computation;computational fluid dynamics;gradient;ion implantation;patients;software bug;hemodynamics (procedure);torr	Kristof Ralovich;Lucian Mihai Itu;Viorel Mihalef;Puneet Sharma;Razvan Ioan Ionasec;Dime Vitanovski;Waldemar Krawtschuk;Allen Everett;Richard Ringel;Nassir Navab;Dorin Comaniciu	2012	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

One major limitation of commercial DBS systems is the inability to control the distribution of the electric field around the target region, resulting in the activation of both target and non-target neural clusters. The authors have previously proposed a method to provide controlled stimulation by the adoption of phased array technology. A model was developed to study the behavior of wavefronts, generated by phased arrays, in tissue. This study represents an improvement to this model, where the frequency-dependence of the dielectric properties of brain tissue is taken into account. Results have shown that the applicability of phased array stimulation depends on the frequency of stimulation, with frequencies in the region of GHz providing the best trade-off between field steering, focusing and tissue penetration.	deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;phased array	Virgilio Valente;Andreas Demosthenous;Richard H.

Young's modulus of soft tissue can be calculated from the force-deformation data with known tissue thickness and Poisson's ratio using Hayes' equation. Our group previously developed a noncontact indentation system using a water jet as a soft indenter as well as the coupling medium for the propagation of high-frequency ultrasound. The novel system has shown its ability to detect the early degeneration of articular cartilage. However, there is still lack of a quantitative method to extract the intrinsic mechanical properties of soft tissue from water jet indentation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the loading-unloading curves and the mechanical properties of soft tissues to provide an imaging technique of tissue mechanical properties. A 3D finite element model of water jet indentation was developed with consideration of finite deformation effect. An improved Hayes' equation has been derived by introducing a new scaling factor which is dependent on Poisson's ratios v, aspect ratio a/h (the radius of the indenter/the thickness of the test tissue), and deformation ratio d/h. With this model, the Young's modulus of soft tissue can be quantitatively evaluated and imaged with the error no more than 2%.	aspect ratio;bone structure of radius;elastic modulus;finite element method;greater than;hayes microcomputer products;image scaling;imaging techniques;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;preclinical imaging;software propagation;structure of articular cartilage;takayasu arteritis;test scaling;thickness (graph theory);soft tissue	Minhua Lu;Rui Mao;Yin Lu;Zheng Liu;Tianfu Wang;Siping Chen	2012		10.1155/2012/979847	computer simulation;elastic modulus;water;connective tissue;computer science;finite element method;mathematics;poisson distribution;compressive strength;elasticity	Robotics	28.411495457914125	-84.15881451485575	185573

In general, the fixed plate for medial care is selected from lineup of the maker. Therefore, the surgery is adapted to each plate due to limitation of the lineup. However, the surgery should be naturally adapted to each patient. To overcome this problem, this paper set the goal to develop a system which can proposed appropriate fixed plate model according to patient information, and make a prototype of the selected fixed plate with low cost. After evaluation of the prototype, the prototype is remade for practical use by the maker which has a license for medical device. By doing so, the longtime purpose of this study is to realize patient-oriented medicine (tailor-made medicine).	integrated development environment;medial graph;prototype;session fixation;thin plate spline	Kouki Nagamune;Yasuro Kokubo;Hisatoshi Baba	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277095	bone healing;simulation;shape;biomechanics;accuracy and precision;solid modeling	Robotics	38.520986129440765	-85.2913630389273	185855

However, disagreement between annotators may be informative, and thus removing it may not be the best strategy. As a proof of concept, we predict whether a skin lesion from the ISIC 2017 dataset is a melanoma or not, based on crowd annotations of visual characteristics of that lesion. We compare using the mean annotations, illustrating consensus, to standard deviations and other distribution moments, illustrating disagreement. We show that the mean annotations perform best, but that the disagreement measures are still informative.

As in lung cancer screening where 3d volumetry methods have already been  developed by other groups, computer assistance would be beneficial to improve speed and reliability of growth assessment.  We propose a new morphology and model based approach for the fast and reproducible volumetry of pulmonary nodules that was  explicitly developed to be applicable to lung metastases which are frequently large, not necessarily spherical, and often  complexly attached to vasculature and chest wall. A database of over 700 nodules from more than 50 patient CT scans from various  scanners was used to test the algorithm during development. An in vivo reproducibility study was conducted concerning the  volumetric analysis of 105 metastases from 8 patients that were subjected to a low dose CT scan twice within several minutes.  Low median volume deviations in inter-observer (0.1%) and inter-scan (4.7%) tests and a negligible average computation time  of 0.3 seconds were measured. The experiments revealed that clinically significant volume change can be detected reliably  by the method.

782b4135d47408ca68f76efc21f7868a12753064	a new approach for corticospinal tract reconstruction based on navigated transcranial stimulation and standardized fractional anisotropy values		PURPOSE To establish a novel approach for fiber tracking based on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) mapping of the primary motor cortex and to propose a new algorithm for determination of an individualized fractional anisotropy value for reliable and objective fiber tracking.   METHODS 50 patients (22 females, 28 males, median age 58 years (20-80)) with brain tumors compromising the primary motor cortex and the corticospinal tract underwent preoperative MR imaging and nTMS mapping. Stimulation spots evoking muscle potentials (MEP) closest to the tumor were imported into the fiber tracking software and set as seed points for tractography. Next the individual FA threshold, i.e. the highest FA value leading to visualization of tracts at a predefined minimum fiber length of 110 mm, was determined. Fiber tracking was then performed at a fractional anisotropy value of 75% and 50% of the individual FA threshold. In addition, fiber tracking according to the conventional knowledge-based approach was performed. Results of tractography of either method were presented to the surgeon for preoperative planning and integrated into the navigation system and its impact was rated using a questionnaire.   RESULTS Mapping of the motor cortex was successful in all patients. A fractional anisotropy threshold for corticospinal tract reconstruction could be obtained in every case. TMS-based results changed or modified surgical strategy in 23 of 50 patients (46%), whereas knowledge-based results would have changed surgical strategy in 11 of 50 patients (22%). Tractography results facilitated intraoperative orientation and electrical stimulation in 28 of 50 (56%) patients. Tracking at 75% of the individual FA thresholds was considered most beneficial by the respective surgeons.   CONCLUSIONS Fiber tracking based on nTMS by the proposed standardized algorithm represents an objective visualization method based on functional data and provides a valuable instrument for preoperative planning and intraoperative orientation and monitoring.	action potential;area striata structure;brain neoplasms;cerebral cortex;corticospinal tracts;diffusion tensor imaging;eighty;electric stimulation technique;exanthema;folic acid;fractional anisotropy;functional electrical stimulation;imagery;muscle;myalgia;patients;rating (action);tissue fiber;tract (literature);transcranial magnetic stimulation;algorithm;primary motor cortex	D.

The next measurement is selected in accordance with an entropy-base d criterion. In order to simplify its evaluation additional assumptions have been imposed. They result in easy to evaluate, but only suboptimal solutions. In the paper we show how to reduce unnecessary comput ation so that the original criterion can be calculated efficiently. Properties of diagnoses with re spect to their capacity to predict values are analysed. All diagnoses which do not predict any value for a v ariable can be represented by the set of the smallest diagnoses with this property and the rest of the diagnostic space can be organised so that it is searched efficiently. An algorithm is outlined which makes use of these results.		Zdenek Zdráhal	1993		10.1007/3-540-57234-1_43	computer science	Vision	33.03521576590381	-89.33835192296598	187986

SLS seeks to produce improved clinical IMRT treatment plans by (1) shortening their treatment times and (2) minimizing their machine delivery errors. Our SLS software is implemented using the C programming language on Linux workstations and is designed as a separate module to complement the current commercial treatment planning systems. The input to SLS is discrete radiation intensity maps computed by current planning systems, and its output is (modified) optimized control sequences for the radiotherapy machines. Our SLS approach is very different from the commonly used planning methods in medical literature in that it is based on graph algorithms and computational geometry techniques. Comparisons of SLS with the CORVUS commercial planning system indicated that for the same set of discrete radiation intensity maps, treatment times can be shortened by over 30% by our SLS plans while maintaining the same treatment quality. We have used SLS in clinical applications at two cancer treatment centers.

8496e281fc1fdbc919175f400a0d6b4de0aa81ec	crowdsourcing labels for pathological patterns in ct lung scans: can non-experts contribute expert-quality ground truth?		This paper investigates what quality of ground truth might be obtained when crowdsourcing specialist medical imaging ground truth from non-experts. Following basic tuition, 34 volunteer participants independently delineated regions belonging to 7 pathological patterns in 20 scans according to expert-provided pattern labels. Participants’ annotations were compared to a set of reference annotations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and found to range between 0.41 and 0.77. The reference repeatability was 0.81. Analysis of prior imaging experience, annotation behaviour, scan ordering and time spent showed that only the last was correlated with annotation quality. Multiple observers combined by voxelwise majority vote outperformed a single observer, matching the reference repeatability for 5 of 7 patterns. In conclusion, crowdsourcing from non-experts yields acceptable quality ground truth, given sufficient expert task supervision and a sufficient number of observers per scan.	coefficient;crowdsourcing;ground truth;medical imaging;repeatability	Alison Q.

As a first step, a validation of the thermal model and method used is carried out by comparison with in vivo measurements of intraocular heating performed in the eyes of dogs. Induced temperature increase in the eye and surrounding tissues is then estimated for several different operational conditions of the implanted chip. In the vitreous cavity, temperature elevation of 0.26/spl deg/C is observed after 26 min for a chip dissipating 12.4 mW when positioned in the mid-vitreous cavity while it is 0.16/spl deg/C when the chip is positioned in the anterior portion between the eye's ciliary muscles. Corresponding temperature rises observed on chip are 0.82/spl deg/C for both the positions of the chip. A comprehensive account of temperature elevations in different tissues under different operational conditions is presented.	3d modeling;body cavities;body tissue;british informatics olympiad;cpu power dissipation;canis familiaris;chemical vapor deposition;ciliary muscle structure;computation;degree unit of plane angle;dental caries;eye;fever;finite-difference time-domain method;heating;implants;integrated circuit;large;maxima and minima;megahertz;multistage interconnection networks;numerical analysis;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;prosthesis implantation;retina;simulation;steady state;stimulation (motivation);telemetry;thermal grease;video-in video-out;virtual retinal display;visual prosthesis;degree - temperature	Keyoor Gosalia;James D.

Skill evaluation today is predominantly based on manual evaluations by expert surgeons-which is time-consuming, non-uniform, and cumbersome to work into the natural flow of training or testing events. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automated recognition of surgical procedural steps using video analysis for the objective assessment of technical skills during surgical training. We employ a bouquet of computer vision techniques, such as template matching, for the automated detection of correct and incorrect surgical procedural steps during tracheoesophageal fistula repair. We consider specifically a simulated model of human infant anatomy used to train surgeons to perform the tracheoesophageal fistula repair procedure. Using a simulated model is key for gaining expertise in repairing this relatively rare but deadly abnormality. Our automated detection approach provides an appropriate, clinically-relevant scenario using a well-designed and validated simulator and produces a uniform, manageable and verifiable solution. The algorithm was validated on nine performances of thoracoscopic tracheoesophageal fistula ligation from surgeons with a broad range of surgical skills. The algorithm result imitates the groundtruth for the evaluations, and thus demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed work for efficient, practical and objective assessment of surgical skill during training.	algorithm;computer vision;formal verification;performance;requirement;simulation;template matching;video content analysis	Siddarth Jain;Katherine A.

Existing approaches involving numerical techniques to obtain the reachable space are generally computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a resource-friendly approach to determine and quantify the bidimensional reachable space of the finger. The fundamental idea of the approach connects to a set of arc formulae for the boundary of the reachable space. These formulae of the boundary result a unique description to calculate the area of the reachable space using Green's theorem. Adopting this novel approach, reachable spaces can be visualised and quantified to effectively evaluate the functionality of different subjects and their therapeutic conditions. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach against the popular kinematic feedforward approach and Monte Carlo simulation separately. The exclusive description of the reachable space boundary resulted in significant improvement to the execution time while delivering more accurate quantification values.	analysis of algorithms;body position;bone tissue;cumulative trauma disorders;feedforward neural network;fingertip dosing unit;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;personalization;poor posture;quantitation;read-only memory;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;volume rendering	Trieu H.

In this paper, we present the general framework of the inversion process applied to guided waves measurements performed on test cases and on one in vitro sample of human long cortical bone (forearm). Test cases were flat plates of bone mimicking material. Cortical thickness and direction dependent elastic properties of a long cortical bone were identified from ultrasound guided waves measurements. While the results need to be confirmed on a large set of bone specimens, this study opens new perspectives for axial transmission technique, due to the fact that measurements were performed under actual conditions of clinical measurements, i.e. with a probe and a signal processing dedicated to clinical use.	bone tissue;compact bone;cortical implant;in vitro [publication type];signal processing;skeletal bone;specimen;structure of long bone;test case;thickness (graph theory);ultrasonics (sound)	Josquin Foiret;Jean-Gabriel Minonzio;Maryline Talmant;Pascal Laugier	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346132	pathology;biomechanics;mathematics;biological engineering;elasticity;physiology;singular value decomposition;guided wave testing;surgery	Robotics	26.762323062801567	-85.67761417971334	191036

Assessment can be provided by 3D computer models created by segmenting tissues from 2D cross-sectional images. We present a statistical evaluation of manual segmentation applied to a case of percutaneous cryotherapy. Pre- and post-procedural MR images of a treated soft-tissue metastasis were analyzed. Tumor and cryonecrosis regions were segmented 5 times each by 3 observers. These 45 3D models were then evaluated using an algorithm (STAPLE: Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation), yielding a measure of the sensitivity and specificity of the models. Data were analyzed to assess both the variability of an individual observer and the inter-observer variability. The intra-observer sensitivities for the 3 observers for the pre-procedural tumor were 0.91, 0.94, 0.90. Similar results were found for post-procedural tumor and cryonecrosis. The mean overall inter-observer sensitivity (bias removed) for the pre-procedural tumor was 0.95; it was 0.96 and 0.97 for the post-procedural tumor and the cryonecrosis, respectively. A single estimate of the “true segmentation” 3D model is likely closest to reality. This method is effective for the validation of multi-observer repeated 3D segmentations and may be especially significant in clinical practice.		Christian P.

Since metabolic heat generation values show differences from tissue to tissue, thermal imaging has started to play an important role in medical diagnoses. Temperature differences of healthy and cancerous tissue may be changed by means of frequency dependent current stimulation within medical safety limits, and thus, depth dependent imaging performance can be increased. In this study, a three-dimensional realistic model of a woman breast and malignant tissue is generated and frequency dependent feasibility work for the proposed method is implemented. Temperature distributions are obtained by solving Pennes Bio Heat Equation (using finite element method). Temporal and spatial temperature distribution images are obtained at desired depths for two cases; with and without current application. Different temperature distributions are imaged by altering the frequency of the applied current and the corresponding conductivity value. Improvement in the imaging performance can be provided by current stimulation, and the temperature difference generated by 40 mm3 tumor at 1.5 cm depth can be detected on breast surface with the state-of-the-art thermal imagers.	assumed;electric conductivity;electricity;finite element method;metabolic process, cellular;neoplasms;simulation;state of health;electrode;heat generation;tumor tissue	H.

The implantable device is capable of providing a chronic recording array for use with technology designed to compensate for a loss of motor function. The SPNI offers a good route to establishing an effective interface to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as the signals are enclosed within an insulating array that amplifies the axon signals for the neural recording, and reduces the amount of current necessary for stimulation. This paper presents an updated fabrication process that addresses the problems of previous designs and allows for an easier integration to external electronics via a ball-bonding technique. The updated device has been tested electrically in vitro, to show that it is capable of providing a reliable electrical interface to the regenerated tissue.	abducens nerve diseases;addresses (publication format);axon;ball bonding;cns disorder;congenital neurologic anomalies;implants;in vitro [publication type];interface device component;peripheral nerves;peripheral nervous system;peripheral nerve interface;pyschological bonding;semiconductor device fabrication	Richard Barrett;Samia Benmerah;Andreas Frommhold;Edward Tarte	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609614	neuroscience;engineering;electrical engineering;biological engineering;neurophysiology	Robotics	25.82019629253494	-85.74900002789462	191888
a27cba094aa88109d6b3e13cd01b56cda8bdc435	digital techniques in experimental medicine	experimental surgery;intravenous angiography;. color doppler	Color Doppler and intravenous angiography (digital technique) can widely be used in experimental medicine. Their wide clinical application, availability, simplicity and small cost impose their importance. Color Doppler analysis of the vascular activity of certain region is more precise than the classic intravenous angiography, but requires contact of highly sophisticated equipment with the experimental animal. Intravenous angiography gives somewhat rougher image, but is more available and does not require the potentially unwanted contact. In this research, we used both methods to mark the vein bypass of the modified infrahyoid lobe dissected from the dog (used as experimental animal). We marked the horizontally placed vein bypass at the level of the thong bone using Color Doppler and intravenous angiography. Applied vein bypass performed the vein drainage of the modified infrahyoid lobe. Results obtained with these two diagnostic methods were compared with the pathohistological (PH) analysis. Results obtained using Color Doppler (using the probe GE Vivid 3 frequency of 5 to 12 MHz) were somewhat closer to the results of PH analysis which we consider as the most objective. Result obtained using intravenous angiography (digital technique using the Siemens Siregraph machine) were satisfactory in marking the required blood vessel for the experiment. Color Doppler and intravenous angiography as digital diagnostic procedures in experimental surgery are usable and as such significantly objective, widely available and do not require additional financial investments.	acoustic lobing;animals, laboratory;bone tissue;experimental medicine;ge-600 series;hematological disease;investments;item unique identification;medicine, east asian traditional;units of measure - siemens;angiogram;bypass;diagnostic procedure	Tarik Masic	2009	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-044-5-871	vein;doppler effect;lobe;angiography;radiology;blood vessel;medicine	EDA	36.1466277542054	-82.51977941112663	191907

The surgeon selects the appropriate treatment by considering the degree of stability, the chronicity of the injury, functional demands of the patient and former patient's outcomes as well. However there are not many studies regarding the load distribution provided by the treatment. So, the purpose of this study is to analyze the load distribution through the wrist joint with an arthrodesis treatment and compare the results with a normal wrist.   METHOD To this end the rigid body spring model (RBSM) method was used on a three-dimensional model of the wrist joint. The cartilage and ligaments were simulated as springs acting under compression and tension, respectively, while the bones were considered as rigid bodies. To simulate the arthrodesis, the fused bones were considered as a single rigid body.   RESULTS The changes on the load distribution for each arthrodesis agree with the treatment objective, reducing load transmission through a specific articular surface. For example, for SLAC/SNAC II most of the treatments reduced the load transmitted through the radioscaphoid fossae, almost by 8%. However, the capitolunate (CL) arthrodesis was the treatment that managed to keep the load transmitted through the radiolunate joint closer to normal conditions. Also, in treatments where the scaphoid was excised (3-corner, 4-corner and capitolunate arthrodesis), the joint surface between the lunate surface compensates by doubling the transmitted force to the radius.   CONCLUSIONS The common arthrodesis for treating SLAC/SNAC II-III, reduces, in fact, the load on the radioscaphoid joint. Alternative treatments that reduce load distribution on the radiocarpal joint should be three corner and capitolunate arthrodesis for treating SLAC/SNAC-II; and for SLAC/SNAC-III four corners with scaphoid excision. On Kienbock's disease. Scaphocapitate (SC) arthrodesis is more effective on reducing the load transmission through the radiolunate and ulnolunate joints. All arthrodesis treatment should consider changes on the load transmission, and also bones' fusion rates and pain reduction on patient's outcomes.

c283d3562ee3826927904d510c338f00db36bcd6	predictive haemodynamics in a one-dimensional human carotid artery bifurcation. part ii: application to graft design	r medicine	A Bayesian surrogate modeling technique is proposed that may be able to predict an optimal bypass graft configuration for patients suffering with stenosis in the internal carotid artery (ICA). At the outset, this statistical technique is considered as a means for identifying key geometric parameters influencing haemodynamics in the human carotid bifurcation. This methodology uses a design of experiments (DoE) technique to generate candidate geometries for flow analysis. A pulsatile one-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver incorporating fluid-wall interactions for a Newtonian fluid which predicts pressure and flow in the carotid bifurcation (comprising a stenosed segment in the internal carotid artery) is used for the numerical simulations. Two metrics, pressure variation factor (PVF) and maximum pressure (p*m ) are employed to directly compare the global and local effects, respectively, of variations in the geometry. The values of PVF and p*m  are then used to construct two Bayesian surrogate models. These models are statistically analyzed to visualize how each geometric parameter influences PVF and p* . Percentage of stenosis is found to influence these pressure based metrics more than any other geometric parameter. Later, we identify bypass grafts with optimal geometric and material properties which have low values of PVF on Ave test cases with 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, and 90% stenosis in the ICA, respectively.	bifurcation theory;carotid arteries;common carotid artery;computer simulation;data-flow analysis;design of experiments;experiment;grafting (decision trees);hemodynamics;independent computing architecture;interaction;internal carotid artery structure;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;patients;population parameter;solver;stenosis;surrogate model;test case;transplanted tissue;bypass	Vijaya B.

Typically, the arterial input function (AIF) required for this methodology is estimated from the left ventricle (LV). Dispersion of the contrast agent bolus might occur between the LV and the myocardial tissue. Negligence of bolus dispersion could cause an error in MBF determination. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of bolus dispersion in a simplified coronary bifurcation geometry including one healthy and one stenotic branch on the quantification of MBF and MPR. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were combined with MMID4. Different inlet boundary conditions describing pulsatile and constant flows for rest and hyperemia and differing outflow conditions have been investigated. In the bifurcation region, the increase of the dispersion was smaller than inside the straight vessels. A systematic underestimation of MBF values up to -16.1% for pulsatile flow and an overestimation of MPR up to 7.5% were found. It was shown that, under the conditions considered in this study, bolus dispersion can significantly influence the results of quantitative myocardial MR-perfusion measurements.	anatomic bifurcation;bifurcation theory;blood vessel;bolus tracking;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer simulation;computer-aided design;contrast media;coronary artery disease;dvd region code;greater;heart ventricle;homeostasis;hydrodynamics;hyperemia;kinetics;left ventricular structure;limited stage (cancer stage);logical volume management;mbf transcription complex;magnetic resonance imaging;minkowski portal refinement;myocardial blood flow;myocardial infarction;myocardial ischemia;myocardium;obstructive ureterocele;pgrmc1 protein, human;patients;perfusion scanning;quantitation;small;tracer	Regine Schmidt;Dirk Graafen;Stefan Weber;Laura Maria Schreiber	2013		10.1155/2013/513187	computer simulation;pulsatile flow;radiology;medicine;perfusion;magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear medicine;heart;surgery	Comp.	30.380662698527797	-85.63701749438776	192334

The purpose here was to develop a simple DTI protocol using readily available standard single-shot EPI at 3T, capable of yielding much higher spatial resolution images (1 x 1 x 1 mm3) of the human hippocampus in a 'clinically feasible' scan time of ~6 min. A thin slab of twenty 1 mm slices oriented along the long axis of the hippocampus enabled efficient coverage and a shorter repetition time, allowing more diffusion weighted images (DWIs) per slice per unit time. In combination with this strategy, a low b value of 500 s/mm2 was chosen to help overcome the very low SNR of a 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 EPI acquisition. 1 mm isotropic mean DWIs (averaged over 120-128 DWIs) showed excellent detail of the hippocampal architecture (e.g. morphology and digitations, sub-regions, stratum lacunosum moleculare - SLM) that was not readily visible on 2 mm isotropic diffusion images. Diffusion parameters within the hippocampus were consistent across subjects and fairly homogenous across sub-regions of the hippocampus (with the exception of the SLM and tail). However, it is expected that DTI parameters will be sensitive to microstructural changes associated with a number of clinical disorders (e.g. epilepsy, dementia) and that this practical, translatable approach for high resolution acquisition will facilitate localized detection of hippocampal pathology.	apache axis;axis vertebra;congenital abnormality;cubic millimeter;dementia;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion tensor imaging;diffusion weighted imaging;epilepsy;itil;long-term potentiation;mathematical morphology;maxima and minima;medical imaging;mental disorders;neurogenesis;protocols documentation;sensitivity and specificity;signal-to-noise ratio;sirolimus;slab allocation;spatial light modulator;video-in video-out;voxel;chemosensitization/potentiation;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Sarah Treit;Trevor A.

Methods: The time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) acquisition in combination with a new decomposition method allows the separation of signal and background from transcutaneous measurements of GFR. Results: The performance of LTDM is compared versus the commercially available NIC-kidney patch-based system for transcutaneous GFR measurement. Measurements are performed in awake Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Using the standard concentration required for the NIC-kidney system [7-mg/100-g body weight (b.w.) FITC-Sinistrin] as reference, the mean difference (bias) of the elimination curves GFR between LTDM and NIC-kidney was 4.8%. On the same animal and same day, the capability of LTDM to measure GFR with a FITC-Sinistrin dose reduced by a factor of 200 (35-μg/100-g b.w.) was tested as well. The mean differences (half lives with low dose using LTDM compared with those using first, the NIC-Kidney system and its standard concentration, and second, LTDM with the same concentration as for the NIC-Kidney system) were 3.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Conclusion: We demonstrate that with the LTDM strategy substantial reductions in marker concentrations are possible at the same level of accuracy. Significance: LTDM aims to resolve the issue of the currently necessary large doses of fluorescence tracer required for transcutaneous GFR measurement. Due to substantially less influences from autofluorescence and artifacts, the proposed method outperforms other existing techniques for accurate percutaneous organ function measurement.	corneal pachymetry;excretory function;fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate;fluorescence;glomerular filtration rate;human body weight;morphologic artifacts;network interface controller;nicotine;photons;renal tissue;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;tracer;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation;weighing patient;fluorescein isothiocyanate-wisteria lectin	Anatoli Shmarlouski;Daniel Schock-Kusch;Yury Shulhevich;Volker Buschmann;Tino Rohlicke;Deborah Herdt;Matthias Radle;Jürgen Hesser;Dzmitry Stsepankou	2016	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2501544	photonics;pathology;fluorescence;optical fiber;histogram;skin;biological engineering;optics;physics	Visualization	28.145036648308018	-83.41316587498369	194186

Current research shows that a significant part of diagnostic imaging, including e.g. of coronary arteries, is still difficult to automatically assess using computer analysis techniques aimed at extracting information having semantic meaning. This mainly applies to images that show many structures simultaneously, as well as 3D images. In this context, this publication presents new capabilities to formulate semantic descriptions of 3D structures of coronary vascularisation using graph formalisms. The proposed syntactic semantic description makes it possible to intelligently model the examined structure and then to automatically find the locations of significant stenoses in coronary arteries and identify their morphometric diagnostic parameters. In this research, images originating from diagnostic examinations with 64-slice spiral computed tomography were used.		Miroslaw Trzupek;Marek R. Ogiela;Ryszard Tadeusiewicz	2011	Eng.

78d02eb017ce4e53544552a8cd70f8410ed7a2e2	evaluation of local pulse wave velocity using an image free ultrasound technique		Pulse wave velocity (PWV) measured over small arterial sections provide localized elastic characteristics, which helps assessment of the subtle progressions of various cardiovascular diseases. Several ultrasound-based techniques that are reported, require high frame rate imaging for performing accurate measurements of local PWV. In this work, an image free ultrasound method for evaluation of local PWV is proposed. The technique uses a novel dual element ultrasound probe for simultaneous capturing of A-scan frames (frame rate = 10 kHz) from two arterial sites located 35 mm apart. Our clinically validated ARTSENS technology was used to obtain high fidelity of distension waveforms by processing the acquired frames. The high frame rate acquisition enabled measurement of pulse transit time with a resolution of 0.1 ms for reliable evaluation of local PWV. The functionality of the developed prototype system was initially verified by conducting experiments on physiological flow-phantom setup. The phantom study results demonstrated that the proposed system could reliably perform local PWV measurements over short arterial segments. The performance of the measurement system was further validated by an in-vivo studied conducted on a pool of 10 young healthy subjects. The mean local PWV measured from the carotid artery for all subjects was 4.8±0.8 The prototype system could perform reliable and repeatable local PWV measurements on both phantom and human subjects over continuous cardiac cycles with the coefficient of variation less than 2.6% and 5% respectively. The proposed image-free ultrasound measurement method greatly eliminates the complexity and computational overhead associated with processing images or 2D RF data acquired at high frame rates.	city of heroes;coefficient;computational human phantom;experiment;imaging phantom;overhead (computing);phantom reference;prototype;radio frequency;repeatability;system of measurement;test case;velocity (software development);video-in video-out	V.

80476f085e502798b4f4df9f280dfd412d34ba54	automated segmentation of visceral adiposity in mri in obese children		Children obesity is a growing concern in the healthcare system, because a life of dependence and cronic health problems results in the adult phase of life. Non-alcoholic liver fat and visceral adiposity are two biomarkers of the health status of the child. Some studies try to measure the impact of exercise and improved habits in the reduction of these biomarkers. The studies use a fat enhancing magnetic resonance imaging sequence, but visceral fat is difficult to segment manually. In this paper we describe the automated process that we have devised, providing some visual results. The process has three main phases: (a) image inhomogeneity correction, (b) removal of spurious features such as arms and navel, (c) identification of the peripheral and visceral volumes, (d) localization of the intervertebral disks, which need to be removed. As there is no manual tracing to use as gold standard, we can not provide quantitative performance measures.

Unlike magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT), ultrasound offers interactive visualization of underlying anatomy in real time. Additionally, ultrasound equipment costs far less and does not use ionizing radiation or require specialized facilities. The different methods for multidimensional medical imaging and scientific visualization are reviewed. Several volume visualization algorithms are discussed. They are multiplexer slicing, surface fitting, volume rendering, data classification, and viewing and shading. Three-dimensional ultrasound data display methods are also discussed.<<ETX>>	algorithm;array slicing;ct scan;data acquisition;interactive visualization;medical imaging;multiplexer;multivariate interpolation;resonance;scientific visualization;shading;tomography;volume rendering	Thomas R.

Towards this objective, we propose a range estimator leveraging the use of ultra-wide band signaling and neural networks. Our results indicate the feasibility of obtaining a ranging accuracy in the neighborhood of 21 mm. We also model the statistics of the ranging error, and demonstrate that the error is accurately modeled by a Weibull distribution.	artificial neural network;network architecture;ultra-wideband	Muzaffer Kanaan;Memduh Suveren	2016	2016 10th International Symposium on Medical Information and Communication Technology (ISMICT)	10.1109/ISMICT.2016.7498882	electronic engineering;pathology;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	25.094271592863855	-90.97251639890128	196503

Using our previously the reported segmented method with a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) super-pixels and manifold ranking (SLIC_MR), the ten intra-retinal layers were fast and exactly segmented in 3-D OCT dataset, includes 55 B-scan images from 11 different healthy adult subjects. By our definitions of the sensitivity and specificity, we compared the segmented results with the recent graph-based method for the main layers in dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the SLIC_MR method outperformed the graph-based method. The thickness maps were plotted in the ten intra-retinal layers and the overall layer, the ETDRS charts were depicted in the 9 sectors of each intra-retinal layer and the overall layer, and the bar graph displayed the mean and standard deviation of macular thickness in 9 sectors for ten retinal layers and the overall layer. The mean thickness of the central foveal area displayed the minimum thickness in layers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the overall, and the maximum thickness in the central foveal area of the 6th layer. Both layers 4 and 5 have the similar mean thickness in each sector.	ct scan;chart;cluster analysis;coherence (physics);iterative method;map;newton's method;pixel;sensitivity and specificity;thickness (graph theory);tomography	Zhijun Gao;Wei Bu;Xiangqian Wu;Yalin Zheng	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852930	computer vision;manifold;sensitivity;computer science;mathematics;image segmentation;optics	Vision	38.73257814606864	-81.48079305648973	198320

Highly detailed modeling of tool-tissue interactions is therefore vital in optimising performance and design. At high resolution, discontinuous failure of soft tissue phantoms has not been demonstrated. An iterative procedure, making incremental additions to the failure path in an otherwise continuous finite element mesh, is presented to achieve this goal. The procedure's efficacy was demonstrated in two materials including a soft tissue phantom. Failure path is shown to respond well to different and evolving shear and normal stress states. The iterative procedure would thus be ideal for analysing and optimising complex tool-tissue interactions, for instance in needle steering systems, where the path taken by the needle also depends on the progression of a tear which develops ahead of the tip during the insertion process. With the method presented here, this behaviour could be modeled and analysed at an unprecedented resolution.	color gradient;computation;connective tissue diseases;finite element method;fundamental interaction;gelatin;image resolution;increment;insertion mutation;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;simulation;soft tissue	Matthew J.

A TCFA has a trombogenic soft lipid core, shielded from the blood stream by a thin, possibly inflamed, stiff cap. The majority of atherosclerotic plaques resemble a TCFA in terms of overall structural composition, but have a more complex, heterogeneous morphology. An assessment of the material distribution is vital for quantifying the plaque's mechanical stability and for determining the effect of plaque-stabilizing pharmaceutical agents. We describe a new automated inverse elasticity method, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) modulography, which is capable of reconstructing a heterogeneous Young's modulus distribution. The elastogram (i.e., spatial strain distribution) of the plaque is the input for the method, and is measured using the clinically available technique, IVUS elastography. Our method incorporates a novel divide-and-conquer strategy, allowing the reconstruction of TCFAs as well as heterogeneous plaques with localized regions of soft, weakened tissue. The method was applied to ex vivo elastograms, which were simulated from the cross sections of postmortem human coronary plaques. To demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the method, measured elastograms from human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were analyzed. One elastogram was measured in vitro; the other, in vivo . The method approximated the true Young's modulus distribution of all simulated plaques, while the in vitro reconstruction was in agreement with histology. In conclusion, the IVUS modulography in combination with the IVUS elastography has strong potential to become an all-encompassing modality for detecting plaques, for assessing the information related to their rupture-proneness, and for imaging their heterogeneous elastic material composition.	approximation algorithm;arterial system;atherosclerosis;autopsy;computed tomography of the heart;coronary artery;dental plaque;elastic modulus;elasticity (data store);elastography;estimated;galaxy morphological classification;genetic heterogeneity;in vitro [publication type];intravascular ultrasound;modality (human–computer interaction);modulus robot;myocardial rupture;self-stabilization;senile plaques;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulated annealing;simulation;steam rupture;takayasu arteritis;video-in video-out;benefit	Radj A.

In particular, 3D detailed model of residual limb, that includes not only the external skin but also bones and soft tissues, is needed for socket design and finite element analysis to study the socket-residual limb interaction. In this paper, we present a procedure for 3D automatic reconstruction of the residual starting from MRI images. The output is a 3D geometric model, in a neutral format (IGES), which permits CAD information exchange among the modules composing the design platform. The reconstruction procedure consists of three different phases: image pre-processing, voxel segmentation, 3D models generation.

The interpretation of the image data relies on accurate determination of anatomical location, which is frequently obstructed by the lack of structural information in the data sets. Positron emission tomography (PET) generally yields images with low spatial resolution and little structural contrast, and many experimental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) paradigms give specific signal enhancements but often limited anatomical information. Side-by-side comparison of image data with conventional atlas diagram is hampered by the 2-D format of the atlases, and by the lack of an analytical environment for accumulation of data and integrative analyses. We here present a method for reconstructing 3-D atlases from digital 2-D atlas diagrams, and exemplify 3-D atlas-based analysis of PET and MRI data. The reconstruction procedure is based on two seminal mouse and brain atlases, but is applicable to any stereotaxic atlas. Currently, 30 mouse brain structures and 60 rat brain structures have been reconstructed. To exploit the 3-D atlas models, we have developed a multi-platform atlas tool (available via The Rodent Workbench, http://rbwb.org) which allows combined visualization of experimental image data within the 3-D atlas space together with 3-D viewing and user-defined slicing of selected atlas structures. The tool presented facilitates assignment of location and comparative analysis of signal location in tomographic images with low structural contrast.	atlases;brain;cdisc sdtm anatomical location terminology;diagram;electron tomography;exemplification;imagery;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroimaging;numerous;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;qualitative comparative analysis;tomography, emission-computed;tree accumulation;workbench	Trine Hjornevik;Trygve B.
