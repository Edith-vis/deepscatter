Firstly we seek them as quotients of regular polytopes arising from the Atlas of Small Regular Polytopes (http://www.abstractpolytopes.com/atlas/); the resulting atlas of chiral polytopes is available on the website http://www.abstract-polytopes.com/chiral/. Secondly, for each almost simple group Γ such that S ≤ Γ ≤ Aut(S) where S is a simple group and Γ is a group of order less than 900,000 listed in the Atlas of Finite Groups, we give, up to isomorphism, the number of abstract chiral polytopes on which Γ acts regularly. The results have been obtained using a series of Magma programs. All these polytopes are made available on the third author's website, at http://math.auckland.ac.nz/~dleemans/CHIRAL/.

526622f7cb61e1a3b79293463f17437cc93ca909	on completely normal (0, 1)-matrices and symmetrizability		Abstract   If  S  1 ,…,  S   m   are subsets of a set  S , there exists a partition of  S  into basic sets  A   I  , defined by Boolean operations on the  S   i  , of which the latter are sums. If  S  is a finite-measure space, and the  S   i   are measurable, the measures of the  A   I   are uniquely determined by those of all the products of the  S   i  . An  n  ×  n (0, 1)-matrix A  is called “completely normal” (c.n.) if  all  its 2  n   corresponding row and column inner products are identical, and “completely normalizable” in case  AQ  is c.n. for some permutation matrix  Q . It follows that  A  is c.n. iff its rows are identical with its columns in some order, and is completely normalizable iff  A   τ   =  PAQ  for permutation matrices  P ,  Q . An algorithm is given for construction of all c.n. matrices, and examples show there are normal matrices not completely normalizable, and c.n. matrices not symmetrizable. Whether every ( n ,  k ,  λ ) matrix is symmetrizable, or even completely normalizable, is not known. It is shown at least that every finite projective plane based on a commutative Veblen-Wedderburn system has a symmetrizable incidence matrix.		C. J. Everett;Nicholas C. Metropolis	1972	J. Comb.

This definition is based on local vertex functionals obtained by calculating j-spheres via the algorithm of Dijkstra. We prove that the graph entropy and, hence, the local vertex functionals can be computed with polynomial time complexity enabling the application of our measure for large graphs.

30bf4e45ffae021076f74bc9a83f5db8d31d680d	single change neighbor designs		A singl~ change neighbor design SCN(v, k) is a way of selecting a sequence of cycles of length k from a complete graph on v vertices with the properties: any cycle is derived from the preceding one by changing one vertex; and every· edge is covered in at least one cycle. Some properties of these designs are investigated. In particular, designs with the smallest possible number of cycles are constructed for all v when k 4. We shall define a general block design (V, B) with parameters (v, k) to consist of a v-set V together with a family B of subsets of size k (called blocks) of V. A covering design of index .\ is a block design such that, given two members x and y of V, there are at least .\ blocks in B which contain {x,y}. A general discussion of is found in [1]. Single-change covering designs are discussed, for example in [3]. A single-change covering design SC(v, k) consists of a covering design of index 1 with parameters (v,k), together with an ordering B = (B 1 ,B 21 • • ,Bb) of the block-set B, such that for 1 ::; i < b, Bi+l \Bi has exactly one element.

440485377f93e60fa9cff28ef856b2a0b5ea1d5a	the double riordan group		The Riordan group is a group of infinite lower triangular matrices that are defined by two generating functions, g and f . The kth column of the matrix has the generating function gfk. In the Double Riordan group there are two generating function f1 and f2 such that the columns, starting at the left, have generating functions using f1 and f2 alternately. Examples include Dyck paths with level steps of length 2 allowed at even height and also ordered trees with differing degree possibilities at even and odd height(perhaps representing summer and winter). The Double Riordan group is a generalization not of the Riordan group itself but of the checkerboard subgroup. In this context both familiar and far less familiar sequences occur such as the Motzkin numbers and the number of spoiled child trees. The latter is a slightly enhanced cousin of ordered trees which are counted by the Catalan numbers.	column (database);dyck language;ordered pair;the matrix;triangular matrix	Dennis Davenport;Louis W.

We also require that no two columns are identical in the matrix. The author solved this problem in 1986 by introducing a type of recursively balanced matrices. However, since the paper was published in Chinese, the solution for such an important problem was not known by international researchers in coding theory. In this note, we focus on how to practically generate the check matrix of Hsiao codes. We have modified the original algorithm to be more efficient and effective. We have also corrected an error in algorithm analysis presented in the earlier paper. The result shows that the algorithm attained optimum in average cases if a divide-and-conquer technique must be involved in the algorithm.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;coding theory;column (database);dedicated hosting service;entity–relationship model;hamming code;international standard serial number;parity-check matrix;recursion (computer science);the matrix;whole earth 'lectronic link	Li Chen	2008	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;divide and conquer algorithms;computer science;mathematics;algorithm;coding theory	Theory	38.151600446061686	42.677816433233005	81911
9a9f809c7aa68a874cf7e1ee6fe21533c1d73cbe	on walks in molecular graphs		Walks in molecular graphs and their counts for a long time have found applications in theoretical chemistry. These are based on the fact that the (i, j)-entry of the kth power of the adjacency matrix is equal to the number of walks starting at vertex i, ending at vertex j, and having length k. In recent papers (refs 13, 18, 19) the numbers of all walks of length k, called molecular walk counts, mwc(k), and their sum from k = 1 to k = n - 1, called total walk count, twc, were proposed as quantities suitable for QSPR studies and capable of measuring the complexity of organic molecules. We now establish a few general properties of mwc's and twc among which are the linear dependence between the mwc's and linear correlations between the mwc's and twc, the spectral decomposition of mwc's, and various connections between the walk counts and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the molecular graph. We also characterize the graphs possessing minimal and maximal walk counts.

These bunkbeds are defined through two standard graph operators: the join G + H and the Cartesian product G ⊕ H of graphs G and H . Our results include the following: • The quantum walk is average uniform mixing on circulants with bounded eigenvalue multiplicity. This extends a known fact about the cycles Cn. • Explicit analysis of the probability distribution of the quantum walk on the join of circulants. This explains why complete partite graphs are not average uniform mixing, using the fact Kn = K1 +Kn−1 and Kn,...,n = Kn + . . .+Kn. • The quantum walk on the Cartesian product of am-vertex path Pm and a circulant G, namely, Pm ⊕G, is average uniform mixing if G is. This highlights a difference between circulants and the hypercubes Qn = P2 ⊕Qn−1. Our proofs employ purely elementary arguments based on the spectra of the graphs.	carrier-to-noise ratio;cartesian closed category;circulant matrix;continuous-time quantum walk;graph theory;magma;mixing (mathematics)	Peter Lo;Siddharth Rajaram;Diana Schepens;Daniel Sullivan;Christino Tamon;Jeffrey Ward	2006	Quantum Information & Computation		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;quantum walk;physics;quantum mechanics;algebra	Theory	34.95912137363683	32.968461754241915	82940

6b54f2e2cfded0f9b8ea52919d05d763fad9f5d2	a comprehensive theory of cascading via-paths and the reciprocal pointer chain method		In this paper, we consolidate and expand upon the current theory and potential applications of the set of k best cascading via-paths (CVPs) and the reciprocal pointer chain (RPC) method for identifying them. CVPs are a collection of up to |V | paths between a source and a target node in a graph G = (V,E), computed using two shortest path trees, that have distinctive properties relative to other path sets. They have been shown to be particularly useful in geospatial applications, where they are an intuitive and efficient means for identifying a set of spatially diverse alternatives to the single shortest path between the source and target. However, spatial diversity is not intrinsic to paths in a graph, and little theory has been developed outside of application to describe the nature of these paths and the RPC method in general. Here we divorce the RPC method from its typical geospatial applications and develop a comprehensive theory of CVPs from an abstract graph-theoretic perspective. Restricting ourselves to properties of the CVPs and of the entire set of k-best CVPs that can be computed in O(|E|+ |V | log |V |), we are able to then propose, among other things, new and efficient approaches to problems such as generating a diverse set of paths and to computing the k shortest loopless paths between two nodes in a graph. We conclude by demonstrating the new theory in practice, first for a typical application of finding alternative routes in road networks and then for a novel application of identifying layer-boundaries in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data.

While achieving this, we bijectively prove that the number of indecomposable 1342avoiding permutations of length n equals that of labeled plane trees of a certain type on n vertices recently enumerated by Cori, Jacquard and Schaeffer, which is in turn known to be equal to the number of rooted bicubic maps enumerated by Tutte in 1963. Moreover, H(x) turns out to be algebraic, proving the first nonmonotonic, longer-than-three instance of a conjecture of Zeilberger and Noonan. We also prove that n √ Sn(1342) converges to 8, so in particular, limn→∞(Sn(1342)/Sn(1234)) = 0.	bicubic interpolation;linear algebra;list of code lyoko characters;map	Miklós Bóna	1997	J. Comb.

The representation allows complex arithmetic to be performed with very simple logic, but it suffers from high latency and poor precision. Furthermore, the results are always somewhat inaccurate due to random fluctuations. The random or pseudorandom sources required to generate the representation are costly, consuming a majority of the circuit area (and diminishing the overall gains in area). In this paper, we show that randomness is not a requirement for this computational paradigm. If properly structured, the same arithmetical constructs can operate on deterministic bit streams, with the data represented uniformly by the fraction of 1's versus 0's. This paper presents three approaches for the computation: relatively prime stream lengths, rotation, and clock division. The three methods are evaluated on a collection of arithmetical functions. Unlike stochastic methods, all three of our deterministic methods produce completely accurate results. The cost of generating the deterministic streams is a small fraction of the cost of generating streams from random/pseudorandom sources. Most importantly, the latency is reduced by a factor of 1/2n, where n is the equivalent number of bits of precision.	bitwise operation;computation;convolution;johnson–nyquist noise;operand;programming paradigm;pseudorandomness;randomness;sampling (signal processing);stochastic computing	Devon Jenson;Marc Riedel	2016	2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)	10.1145/2966986.2966988	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;discrete mathematics;logic gate;computer science;theoretical computer science;deterministic system;mathematics;convolution;correlation;algorithm;multiplexing;encoding;statistics	EDA	25.444229107624345	46.342227174412294	85236

In the first part of this article we translate the problem into a question about certain subgroups of plane crystallographic groups. In the second part, we indicate how this question can be answered efficiently by a computer. In fact, we have implemented our algorithm on a personal computer and, as an illustration of our method, we have determined all homeochromatic classes of k-chromatic tilings for k ? 12 and the classes of all perfectly k-colored isohedral tilings which admit a proper rotation as a symmetry preserving all colors.

Let nλ be the number of nonisomorphic STDλ[3λ, 3]’s. It is known that n1 = 1, n2 = 1, n3 = 4, n4 = 1, and n5 = 0. We classify STD6[18, 3]’s and STD7[21, 3]’s which have a semiregular noncyclic automorphism group of order 9 on both points and blocks containing an elation of order 3 using this characterization. The former case yields exactly twenty nonisomorphic STD6[18, 3]’s and the latter case yields exactly three nonisomorphic STD7[21, 3]’s. These yield n6 > 20 and n7 > 5, because B. Brock and A. Murray constructed two other STD7[21, 3]’s in 1991.

We consider tilings of a torus T, (=R/r,Z X R/r,Z for a pair of positive integers r = (r,, rz)) with translated copies of finitely many rectangles whose sides have integer lengths (several copies of the same rectangle can be used); if the horizontal or the vertical sides have length 1, then such a rectangle is called a rod. We give a simple criterion for the tilability of a torus T, with rods provided that T, is large with respect to the rods, i.e., r, and r, are large. The proof uses a coloring argument so it also yields a necessary condition for the existence of an integer tiling. For this generalized notion of tilability we prove a result with arbitrary rectangles as tiles, namely, we present an explicit criterion for integer tilability of a torus with finitely many rectangles. Both criteria can be formulated in every dimension.	discrete mathematics;eisenstein's criterion;graph coloring;tiling window manager	A.

They are simultaneously scale-free and small-world. A labeling of the vertices for them are proposed here. All of the shortest paths between any two vertices in these two graphs can be determined only on their labels. The number of shortest paths between any two vertices is the product of two Fibonacci numbers; it is increasing almost linearly with the order or size of the graphs. However, the label-based routing algorithm runs in logarithmic time O(logn). Our efficient routing protocol for Farey-type models should help contribute toward the understanding of several physical dynamic processes.	algorithm;attachments;conceptualization (information science);european film gateway;graph labeling;iteration;routing;shortest path problem;time complexity;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Wenchao Jiang;Yinhu Zhai;Zhigang Zhuang;Paul Martin;Zhiming Zhao;Jia-Bao Liu	2018	Symmetry	10.3390/sym10090407	fibonacci number;combinatorics;farey sequence;vertex (geometry);logarithm;complex network;routing protocol;mathematics;graph	Theory	25.99864856961747	34.46449483632722	87755

To nd generalized cycles with small diameter for given values of their maximum out-degree and order. A bound is given for both problems. It is proved that the rst bound can only be attained for small values of the diameter. We present two new families of generalized cycles that provide some solutions to these problems.

In developing this generalization, we identify multiple types of isomorphisms. For example, in multilayer networks with a single aspect, permuting vertex labels, layer labels, and both vertex labels and layer labels each yield different isomorphism relations between multilayer networks. Multilayer network isomorphisms lead naturally to defining isomorphisms in any of the numerous types of networks that can be represented as a multilayer network, and we thereby obtain isomorphisms for multiplex networks, temporal networks, networks with both of these features, and more. We reduce each of the multilayer network isomorphism problems to a graph isomorphism problem, where the size of the graph isomorphism problem grows linearly with the size of the multilayer network isomorphism problem. One can thus use software that has been developed to solve graph isomorphism problems as a practical means for solving multilayer network isomorphism problems. Our theory lays a foundation for extending many network analysis methods—including motifs, graphlets, structural roles, and network alignment—to any multilayer network.	apollonian network;graph isomorphism problem;multiplexing;semantic network;sequence motif	Mikko Kivel&#x00E4;;Mason A.

Let A(G) or A be the adjacency matrix of a graph G. Since A is symmetric and real, its eigenvalues are real and can be arranged as: λ1(G) ≥ λ2(G) ≥ · · · ≥ λn(G). The largest eigenvalue λ1(G) is exactly the spectral radius of A(G), denoted by ρ(G). If G is connected, then A(G) is irreducible and by the Perron–Frobenius theorem, ρ(G) is simple and there exists a unique (up to multiples) positive eigenvector corresponding to ρ(G). Such eigenvector is referred to the Perron vector of G, and ρ(G) is referred to the spectral radius of G. The investigation on the spectral radii of graphs is an important topic in the spectral graph theory. Recently, the problem concerning graphs with maximal or minimal spectral radius of a given class of graphs has been studied extensively. Berman and Zhang [1] studied the spectral radii of graphs with n vertices and k cut vertices. Liu et al. [12] studied the spectral radius of graphs with n vertices and k cut edges. Unicyclic graphs are connected graphs in which the number of edges equals the number of vertices. The spectral radius of unicyclic graphs has also been studied by many authors; see [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15].

0ac84da3d3c0c9ae860e0caa78306b819dbcba7d	signed tilings with squares		In [1] Dehn proved that an a_b rectangle R can be tiled with finitely many nonoverlapping squares if and only if b a is rational. This result may be proved as follows (cf. [3, 4, 5, 7]): If b a is rational then clearly R can be tiled with squares. To prove the converse, define the tensor invariant of an a_b rectangle to be a b # R Z R. Since the tensor invariant of a square is symmetric, every region which can be tiled with squares also has a symmetric tensor invariant. In particular, if the a_b rectangle R can be tiled with squares then a b is a symmetric element of R Z R. This is the case if and only if b a # Q. More generally, suppose we allow the squares to have weights from Z. An arrangement of finitely many weighted squares is called a tiling of R if the sum of the weights of the squares covering each point P is 1 for P # R and 0 for P R. Note that the squares are not required to lie inside R. If there exists such an arrangement of Z-weighted squares we say that R can be Z-tiled with squares. The argument above applies in this more general setting, and shows that R can be Z-tiled with squares if and only if b a is rational. In this paper we generalize this result by showing that a region in the plane built from finitely many rectangles can be Z-tiled with squares if and only if the tensor invariant of the region is symmetric.

This is an infinite completely distributive lattice but it is not a Boolean lattice. We show the subword complexity and the growth function create machine invariant classes. 1 Motivation In different areas of mathematics, people consider a lot of hierarchies which are typically used to classify some objects according to their complexity. Here we formulate and discuss some hierarchies of machine invariant classes. We are inspired by Yablonski's result [11]. Theorem 1 Every initial Mealy machine an ultimately periodic word transforms to an ultimately periodic word. The invention and financial explotation of enciphering and deciphering machines is a lucrative branch of cryptography. Until the 19th century they there mechanical; from the beginning of the 20th century automation made its appearance , around the middle of the century came electronics and more recently microelectronic miniaturiziation. Today's microcomputers — roughly the size, weight, and price of a pocket calculator — have a performance as good as the best enciphering machines from the Second Word War. That restores the earlier significance of good methods, which had been greatly reduced by the presence of 'giant' computers in cryptanalysis centres [1]. A cryptosystem [10] is a five–tuple P, C, K, E, D, where the following conditions are satisfied: • P is a finite set of possible plaintexts, • C is a finite set of possible ciphertexts,	cipher;complexity;computer;cryptanalysis;cryptography;cryptosystem;encryption;fuzzy mathematics;mealy machine;microcomputer;pocket pc;substring	Janis Buls	2005	CoRR		distributive lattice;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;congruence lattice problem;mathematics;complemented lattice;stream cipher;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Theory	37.31387836408287	38.60051685128669	92296

The classic Wiener index was proposed in biochemistry and defined to be the sum of distances between all pairs of vertices. The sum of distances between all pairs of leaves, named the Gamma index and the terminal Wiener index respectively, was motivated from both biochemistry and phylogenetic reconstruction. The studies of such distance-based graph invariants include, for instance, the ''middle part'' of a tree, the extremal structures with given constraints, the extremal values of ratios of the distance function at the ''middle part'' and leaves. In particular, when considering the extremal structures, correlations between the Wiener index and other graph invariants have been discovered and general methods have been developed. Other related graph invariants include the number of subtrees or leaf containing subtrees (corresponding to the ''acceptable residue configurations''), subforests, root-containing subtrees (in relation to the antichains in a Hasse diagram with the structure of a rooted tree), to name a few. As has been repeatedly mentioned in earlier works, it is of both mathematical interests and practical importance to generalize the current studies to other distance-based graph invariants. The sum of distances between internal vertices has been considered and many similar results have been obtained. On the other hand, a natural similar concept is the sum of distances between internal vertices and leaves. It has been proposed in different literatures. In this paper we conduct a relatively comprehensive study of this concept, providing results analogous to those of the aforementioned studies. We start with identifying the ''middle part'' of a tree with respect to the total distance from leaves. Then the extremal ratios with respect to the distance from leaves are examined and the structures achieving the extremal ratios are characterized. Lastly, we provide extremal trees under different constraints that maximize or minimize the sum of all such distances.	tree (data structure);vertex (graph theory)	Hua Wang	2014	Eur. J.

(For details on Laplacian matrix, see [5, 6].) Since A(G), L(G) and L+(G) are all real symmetric matrices, their eigenvalues are real numbers.

For every natural k¿ 2 there exists graph G such that (G) = 2 and / (G) = k. So it is interesting to 3nd out whether there is an upper bound on / (G) in terms of r(G).

By implementing this algorithm, minimal critical sets for all the latin squares of order six have been found. In addition, this algorithm is used to prove that the size of the minimal critical set for a back circulant latin square of order seven is twelve, and for order nine is twenty. These results provide further support for the conjecture that the back circulant latin square of odd order n has minimal critical set of size (n 2 1)/4.	algorithm;circulant matrix	Adelle Howse	1998	Australasian J.

Let GA and GB be two directed graphs with respectively nA and nB vertices. We de ne a nB nA similarity matrix S whose real entry sij expresses how similar vertex j (in GA) is to vertex i (in GB) : we say that sij is their similarity score. The similarity matrix can be obtained as the limit of the normalized even iterates of S(k+1) = BS(k)AT +BT S(k)A where A and B are adjacency matrices of the graphs and S(0) is a matrix whose entries are all equal to one. In the special case where GA = GB = G, the matrix S is square and the score sij is the similarity score between the vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg’s \hub and authority"""" method to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case of our de nition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a non-negative matrix.

Applications in experimental and theoretical computer science, communications, cryptography and networking have also emerged in recent years. In this paper, we focus on a new application of combinatorial design theory in experimental design theory. E(fNOD) criterion is used as a measure of non-orthogonality of U-type designs, and a lower bound of E(fNOD) which can serve as a benchmark of design optimality is obtained. A U-type design is E(fNOD)-optimal if its E(fNOD) value achieves the lower bound. In most cases, E(fNOD)-optimal U-type designs are supersaturated. We show that a kind of E(fNOD)-optimal designs are equivalent to uniformly resolvable designs. Based on this equivalence, several new in<nite classes for the existence of E(fNOD)-optimal designs are then obtained. c © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This survey focuses on block designs with the properties of connectedness, classification and balancing, resolvability, and inequality and characterization from a combinatorial point of view.	discrete mathematics;social inequality	Sanpei Kageyama	1993	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(93)90393-8	block design;combinatorial design;combinatorics;biological classification;social connectedness;combinatorial principles;combinatorial explosion;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Theory	30.64003173800197	40.32878026663421	97712

We use one such finder to study a large collection of modern networks emanating from biological, social, and technological domains. We show inter-relationships between maximum cliques and several other common network properties, including network density, maximum core, and number of triangles. In temporal networks, we find that the largest temporal strong components have around 20-30% of the vertices of the entire network. These components represent groups of highly communicative individuals. In addition, we discuss and improve the performance and utility of the maximum clique finder itself.	apollonian network;clique (graph theory);strongly connected component	Ryan A. Rossi;David F.

It embeds multiple properties that facilitate solving several problems that found to be hard in the general graph form. Interestingly, not only that δ-hyperbolicity provides an idea about the structure of the graph, but also it explains how information navigates throughout the network. Therefore, δ-hyperbolicity has several applications in diverse applied fields. My PhD dissertation focuses on analyzing and exploiting structural properties of hyperbolic networks for different applications.	apollonian network;graph theory	Hend Alrasheed	2016		10.1145/2872518.2888602	loop;graph power;mathematical optimization;null graph;graph property;regular graph;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;biconnected graph;butterfly graph;quartic graph;complement graph;string graph;strength of a graph	ML	28.14124820914706	37.069097841488386	98708

cd3095fdda7fe96dca40538ba59037a7fadf5b6f	on indices of wiener and anti-wiener type		Abstract In this paper we define Wiener and anti-Wiener type of indices, so that we first introduce ordering of tree graphs, and then define that a topological index is of Wiener type if it is an increasing function with respect to the introduced order. Similarly, we define that a topological index is of anti-Wiener type if it is a decreasing function with respect to the introduced order. The introduced order of tree graphs has the star S n for minimal graph, while the path P n is the maximal graph. Therefore, all indices of Wiener type obtain minimum value for S n and maximum value for P n , while the reverse holds for indices of anti-Wiener type. Then we introduce a simple criterion on edge contribution function of a topological index which enables us to establish if a topological index is of Wiener or anti-Wiener type. Finally, we apply our result to several generalizations of Wiener index, such as modified Wiener indices, variable Wiener indices and Steiner k -Wiener index.

The known proof is somewhat complicated when  v  ≡ 2 (mod 6), and this paper provides a simpler proof for this case. Proofs are also given for all other values of  v  by reviewing known constructions or providing new ones.	block size (cryptography)	C. St. J. A. Nash-Williams	1972	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

For certain $\Delta$ and $K$, the Stanley--Reisner rings have a {\em homogeneous system of parameters}, $\Theta$, such that $K[\Delta]/\langle \Theta \rangle$ is finite-dimensional, and coefficients of its Hilbert series are the $h$-vector of $\Delta$. The previous constructions of $\Theta$ were noncombinatorial. In the special case of cographic matroids, we give (for {\em any} field $K$) a combinatorial description of a homogeneous system of parameters in terms of the graph structure, as well as an explicit basis for the resulting quotient algebra. The results have applications to a central problem of reliability, namely the association of a multicomplex to a connected graph, such that the reliability is a simple function of the rank numbers.	macaulay	Jason I.

In special issues from conferences, most problems come from themeeting and are collected by the guest editors. In regular issues, the Research Problems collect problems submitted individually. Older problems are acceptable if they are not widely known and the exposition features a new partial result. Concise definitions and commentary (such as motivation or known partial results) should be provided to make the problems accessible and interesting to a broad cross-section of the readership. Problems are solicited from all readers; they should be presented in the style below, occupy at most one journal page, and be sent to Douglas B.

Some problems contributed after the session were added. The problems are ordered according to subject matter. Several of the problems presented at themeeting have been solved and hence have been removed, resulting in some gaps in the BCC numbering. One solved problem remains: it is a problem on on-line sorting proposed by Nicolas Lichiardopol whose solution by Adam Philpotts and Rob Waters appears in this volume.

Partition X into n/r subsets S1, . . . , Sn/r , each of cardinality r .

Conjecture 1: Let A denote the family of all k-sets A such that A ∩ S1 6= ∅. If k < drn(1 − r(n)), where dr = 1 − 2−1/r and r(n) = o(1), then N(n, r, k) = |A| = ( n k ) − ( n− r k ) . Comment: For r = 1, the truth of the conjecture is the well-known Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem [1]. The conjecture has also been proved for r = 2 (Johnson–Talbot, [2]). If n/r is odd and k > drn(1+δr(n)), where δr(n) = o(1), thenN(n, r, k) = |Am|, where Am = {A: Ameets more than half of the sets Si}. A similar construction holds when n/r is even and k is in this range. A more speculative question is open even for r = 2: Question 2: Is it true that N(n, r, k) = max{|A|, |Am|} for all k?

The worst-case assembly time of our system is Θ(nA(nA − nB)) and the best-case assembly time is Θ(nA). Although the pre-existing division system which computes A/B can also be used to compute A mod B, the assembly time of this system is not ideal in some cases. Compared with the pre-existing division system, we achieved improved time complexity in our system.

From a heap of n tokens, each player can move either to a heap of n − s tokens for some s ∈ S, or to a heap of n/d tokens for some d ∈ D if d divides n. Such games can be considered as an integral variant of Mark-type games, introduced by Elwyn Berlekamp and Joe Buhler and studied by Aviezri Fraenkel and Alan Guo, for which it is allowed to move from a heap of n tokens to a heap of ⌊n/d⌋ tokens for any d ∈ D. Under normal convention, it is observed that the Sprague-Grundy sequence of the game i-Mark(S, D) is aperiodic for any sets S and D. However, we prove that, in many cases, this sequence is almost periodic and that the set of winning positions is periodic. Moreover, in all these cases, the Sprague-Grundy value of a heap of n tokens can be computed in time O(log n). We also prove that, under misère convention, the outcome sequence of these games is purely periodic.	almost periodic function;grundy number	Éric Sopena	2016	Theor. Comput.

This notion was introduced by Broder, Charikar, Frieze and Mitzenmacher and is motivated by an algorithm for filtering near-duplicate web documents. Linear permutations are an important class of permutations. Let p be a (large) prime and let Fp = {πa,b : 1 ≤ a ≤ p − 1, 0 ≤ b ≤ p − 1} where for x ∈ [p] = {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}, πa,b(x) = ax + b mod p.

Recently, some authors have addressed the problem of studying their connectivity parameters. In this direction, it was conjectured by Fu, Huang and Rodger that every (δ, g)-cage is maximally connected, i.e., it is δ-connected, and they proved this statement for δ = 3. We provide a new contribution to the proof of that conjecture, by showing that every (δ, g)-cage, with g = 6, 8, is maximally connected, and by assuring either maximal connectivity or superconnectivity for some (δ, 5)-cages.	girth (graph theory);maximal set	Xavier Marcote;Camino Balbuena;Ignacio M.

In other words, it is the directed Cayley graph whose generators are σk := (1 2 · · · k) for 2 ≤ k ≤ n and these rotations are applied to the indices of a permutation. In a restricted rotator graph the allowable rotations are restricted from k ∈ {2, 3, . . . , n} to k ∈ G for some smaller (finite) set G ⊆ {2, 3, . . . , n}. We construct Hamilton cycles for G = {n−1, n} and G = {2, 3, n}, and provide efficient iterative algorithms for generating them. Our results start with a Hamilton cycle in the rotator graph due to Corbett (IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 3 (1992) 622–626) and are constructed entirely from two sequence operations we name ‘reusing’ and ‘recycling’.	algorithm;hamiltonian path;iterative method;magma	Brett Stevens;Aaron Williams	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25011-8_26	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	36.63338890305637	34.336947125592715	101240

The 2-factor closure of a graph is uniquely determined and the closure operation turns a claw-free graph into the line graph of a graph containing no cycles of length at most 5 and no cycles of length 6 satisfying a certain condition. A graph has a 2-factor if and only if its closure has a 2factor; however, the closure operation preserves neither the minimum number of components of a 2-factor nor the hamiltonicity or nonhamiltonicity of a graph.	claw-free graph;claw-free permutation;graph factorization;hamiltonian path;line graph	Zdenek Ryjácek;Liming Xiong;Kiyoshi Yoshimoto	2010	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2010.02.004	claw-free graph;outerplanar graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;graph product;null graph;graph property;regular graph;clique-width;simplex graph;forbidden graph characterization;comparability graph;cycle graph;closure;cubic graph;symmetric graph;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;butterfly graph;vertex-transitive graph;complement graph;line graph;string graph;closure problem;coxeter graph;closure operator;satisfiability	Theory	27.847565911223274	32.4210165089555	102037

To find new asymptotically fast algorithms for matrix multiplication, it seems to be important to understand those tensors whose border rank is as small as possible, so called tensors of minimal border rank. We investigate the connection between degenerations of associative algebras and degenerations of their structure tensors in the sense of Strassen. It allows us to describe an open subset of n× n× n tensors of minimal border rank in terms of smoothability of commutative algebras. We describe the smoothable algebra associated to the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor and prove a lower bound for the border rank of the tensor used in the “easy construction” of Coppersmith and Winograd. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.2.1 Numerical Algorithms and Problems	coppersmith–winograd algorithm;low-rank approximation;matrix multiplication algorithm;numerical linear algebra;strassen algorithm;time complexity	Markus Bläser;Vladimir Lysikov	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2016.19	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;rank;invariants of tensors;computer science;mathematics;algebra	Theory	38.44674685009879	34.01110402644268	102925

We also prove that the maximal number ψ( n ) of cyclic interpretations in a submonoid C ∗ of a word w of length n and the maximal number ξ( n ) of prefix interpretations in C ∗ of w are equal to ϕ ( n +1). Moon and Moser (1965) have proved directly that the maximal number of cliques in a graph having n vertices is also equal to ϕ ( n +1). We give here a new proof of this result by using a bijection from the set of prefix interpretations of a word into the set of cliques in an associated graph. By the same bijection we determine all the graphs having a maximal number of cliques. Moreover, we obtain two new NP-complete problems by using the same bijection.		Jean-Claude Spehner	1994	Theor.

d576b38c52a25f31fc573e632332b031d9d585d3	topological classification of rna structures via intersection graph		We introduce a new algebraic representation of RNA secondary structures as a composition of hairpins, considered as basic loops. Starting from it, we define an abstract algebraic representation and we propose a novel methodology to classify RNA structures based on two topological invariants, the genus and the crossing number. It takes advantage of the abstract representation to easily obtain two intersection graphs: one of the RNA molecule and another one of the relative shape. The edges cardinality of the former corresponds to the number of interactions among hairpins, whereas the edges cardinality of the latter is the crossing number of the shape associated to the molecule. The aforementioned crossing number together with the genus permits to define a more precise energy function than the standard one which is based on the genus only. Our methodology is validated over a subset of RNA structures extracted from Pseudobase++ database, and we classify them according to the two topological invariants.

The spectrum of these matrices gives some informations about the structure of the graph and the question “Which graphs are determined by their spectrum?” remains a difficult problem in algebraic graph theory. In this article we enlarge the known families of graphs determined by their spectrum by considering some unicyclic graphs. An odd (resp. even) sun is a graph obtained by appending a pendant vertex to each vertex of an odd (resp. even) cycle. A broken sun is a graph obtained by deleting pendant vertices of a sun. In this paper we prove that a sun is determined by its Laplacian spectrum, an odd sun is determined by its adjacency spectrum (counter-examples are given for even suns) and we give some spectral characterizations of broken suns. keywords: Graphs, algebraic graph theory, spectral graph theory, unicyclic graphs, Laplacian matrix, adjacency matrix, graphs determined by their spectrum, sun graphs.	adjacency matrix;algebraic graph theory;graph (discrete mathematics);laplacian matrix;linear algebra;planar graph;pseudoforest;spectral graph theory;stellar classification;vertex (graph theory)	Romain Boulet	2009	Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science		graph power;graph energy;integral graph;adjacency list;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;degree matrix;laplacian matrix;regular graph;distance-regular graph;graph theory;comparability graph;algebraic graph theory;symmetric graph;mathematics;voltage graph;graph homomorphism;butterfly graph;vertex-transitive graph;spectral graph theory;line graph;circulant graph;coxeter graph;adjacency matrix	Theory	29.483926731233126	33.478539472991635	107069

Let an edge exist between two vertices  a  and  b  in  G ( n,k ) if and only if  a  can be transformed into  b  by the interchange of two adjacent coordinate values, with the first and last coordinates considered adjacent. This paper shows that a Hamiltonian circuit exists in  G ( n,k ) if and only if neither  n  and  k  are both even, nor  k =2 or  n −2 for  n >7. It is also shows that a Hamiltonian path exists in  G ( n,k ) if and only if  n  and  k  are not both even.

In an attempt to prove the conjecture, many graph invariants have been shown to be recon-structible from the vertex-deleted deck, and in particular, some prominent graph polynomials. Among these are the Tutte polynomial, the chromatic polynomial and the characteristic polynomial. We show that the interlace polynomial, the U-polynomial, the universal edge elimination polynomial ξ and the colored versions of the latter two are reconstructible. We also present a method of reconstructing boolean graph invariants, or in other words, proving recognizability of (possibly colored) graph properties, using first order logic.	characteristic polynomial;chromatic polynomial;first-order logic;graph property;interlaced video;kelly criterion;reconstruction conjecture;tutte polynomial	Tomer Kotek	2009	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2009.07.062	integral graph;chromatic polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;bracket polynomial;symmetric polynomial;topology;alternating polynomial;stable polynomial;algebraic graph theory;degree of a polynomial;graph coloring;mathematics;monic polynomial;tutte polynomial;matrix polynomial;homfly polynomial;characteristic polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;polynomial remainder theorem;strong orientation;square-free polynomial;tutte 12-cage;polynomial	Theory	30.95241326809046	32.33483865805907	109041

These counts can be “added” and/or “multiplied.” A subword history gives an instruction of what words to be counted and how these counts to be added and multiplied with other counts or integer constants, and hence, determines its unique value in a given word. Mateescu, Salomaa, and Yu asked: “is it decidable whether the value of a given subword history is non-negative in all words over a given alphabet?” (absoluteness problem). Another important problem is of whether there exists a word in which the value of a given subword history becomes 0 (equality problem). In this paper, we prove the undecidability of equality problem and show that the equality problem is polynomial-time Karp reducible to the absoluteness problem; thus, the absoluteness problem is also undecidable. This approach solves the open problem actually under stronger conditions than supposed originally.	halting problem;social inequality;substring;time complexity;undecidable problem	Shinnosuke Seki	2012	Theor.

This model follows the laws of the electrical circuit theory and we can potentially use all the existing theory and tools of this field to derive other approximate techniques for graph matching. In the present work, we use the proposed circuital model to derive approximated graph isomorphism solutions.	approximation algorithm;conductance (graph);graph (discrete mathematics);graph isomorphism;matching (graph theory);network analysis (electrical circuits)	Manuel Igelmo;Alberto Sanfeliu;Miquel Ferrer	2010	2010 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ICPR.2010.240	resistor;outerplanar graph;block graph;graph power;topological graph theory;electrical network;folded cube graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;level structure;null graph;graph property;network analysis;computer science;clique-width;pancyclic graph;machine learning;comparability graph;graph automorphism;mathematical model;mathematics;voltage graph;graph;graph isomorphism;modular decomposition;butterfly graph;computational model;line graph;strength of a graph;coxeter graph;matching	DB	25.003594817348596	39.31232703567141	109520

Additionally our algorithm, the Grammar Transform Analysis and Compression (GTAC) entropy estimator, uses a novel data structure to repeatedly solve the longest non-overlapping pattern problem in linear time. GTAC beats all known competitors in running time, in the low values of its entropy estimates, and in the properties that have been proven about it. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n With the complete DNA sequences of many organisms already known, and the goal of completely sequencing the human genome making steady progress, the challenge of using this wealth of genetic information beneficially presents a new series of problems to be solved. One such problem is recognizing and characterizing the different regions of DNA and their different functions. Information theoretic entropy is one tool that can be used to help solve these types of problems. DNA stores the information for creating and organizing an organism. It can be thought of as a string over the alphabet {A, C, G, T }, which represents the four chemical components that make it up. In order to synthesize protein, the cell creates a transient copy of a portion of DNA, called mRNA. The sequence of mRNA is read, three symbols at a time, and this triplet specifies a single component of the protein called an amino acid. The components are strung together in the order their code appears in the mRNA sequence. Although made as a linear structure, many types of protein can ~ r e s s : Dept. of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ont. N2L 3G1, Canada.

No all of the sequence information that gets copied from the DNA ends up specifying a protein. In higher eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) much of the mRNA is cut out before the cell translates it into protein. The portions that are translated are called exons and the portions that are removed are called introns. Random changes in a sequence are thought to be more deleterious if they take place in a n exon rather than in an intron so these two regions should have different information theoretic entropy. Since the alphabet of DNA, and mRNA have four symbols, if these sequences were totally random, it would take two bits per symbol to represent the sequence. However, only a small fraction of DNA sequences result in a viable organism, therefore there are constraints on those sequences which appear in a living organism. Common compression algorithms, such as Huffman, and various Lempel-Ziv based algorithms fail to compress DNA sequences at all (for an example using UNIX compress, see Table 2), and low order arithmetic encoding algorithms only compress to around 1.96 bits per base [4]. With only 61 of the 64 possible mRNA triplet combinations being used to code for protein, that property alone suggests an encoding of 1.977 bits per symbol for exons, so the arithmetic encoding is providing only a slight improvement.	algorithm;arithmetic coding;binaural beats;computer engineering;computer science;context-free grammar;data compression;data structure;entropy (information theory);ergodicity;huffman coding;information theory;lempel–ziv–welch;organizing (structure);time complexity;triplet state;unix;waterloo;while	J.

We compare here the number of Slater orders that a tournament can have with its number of Hamiltonian paths. More precisely, we specify a lower bound (got from some special tournaments) and an upper bound (given by the maximum number of Hammiltonian paths that a tournament can have) of the maximum number of Slater orders that a tournament can have. Then, we study two special classes of tournaments for which we compute or estimate the number of Slater orders and Hamiltonian paths.

To make the main theorem more flexible, we will introduce a lower bound based on induced matchings of hypergraph of qualified sets. As an application, we present an algebraic proof for the fact that the pixel expansion of basis matrices of any k out of k scheme is at least 2. In the sequel, we present a lower bound for the pixel expansion of a given graph access structure in term of maximum number of edges in an induced matching. Finally, we show that the minimum pixel expansion of basis matrices of graph access structure Pn is exactly ⌈ n+1 2 ⌉ and this shows the lower bound mentioned in the main theorem is sharp.	access structure;basis function;linear algebra;pixel;visual cryptography	Abbas Cheraghi;Hossein Hajiabolhassan	2007	CoRR		arithmetic;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	31.827318615692192	36.77558535706355	110866

Convolving two polynomials of length L on the ring of the polynomials with M coefficients takes a total number of operations of ML(log M + log L) + ML = Nlog N + N. The inverse transform takes again Nlog N element operations. This gives 2Nlog N + N element operations. If we operate in a finite ring such that ω, the root of the unity of order N is a power of 2, then all the multiplications by powers of ω become shifts. Transforming a one dimensional convolution into a bidimensional one permits to increase the sequence length without increasing the word length. If we perform acyclic convolutions then we must partially overlap and add the resulting sequences in order to obtain the final sequence(polynomial). We overlap always the second dimension minus 1. When the length of the sequences is 2M-1(padding zeros to be able to perform cyclic convolution), the overlapping is M-1. This can be shown easily by considering that the total length 2N-1 = 2ML-1 = (2L-2)(2M-1-(M-1))+2M-1. This procedure can be generalized for more dimensions in the same way. Let us suppose that N = 2P=4M.2&sgr;. We can apply M dimensional convolution of length 4, followed by one or zero convolution of length 2.	circular convolution;coefficient;directed acyclic graph;multidimensional discrete convolution;nl (complexity);polynomial;power of two	Ricardo Ferré	1987		10.1145/322917.322988	frame;ada;computer science;artificial intelligence;object-oriented design;programming language;inference engine;algorithm;convolution power	Theory	37.674366529084686	34.13390503171031	111349

c893a8866ee50e5d56423a130d6a6382171a3952	what is the meaning of the graph energy after all?		For a simple graph G = (V,E) with eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn, the energy of the graph is de ned by E (G) = ∑n j=1 |λj |. Myriads of papers have been published in the mathematical and chemistry literature about properties of this graph invariant due to its connection with the energy of (bipartite) conjugated molecules. However, a structural interpretation of this concept in terms of the contributions of even and odd walks, and consequently on the contribution of subgraphs, is not yet known. Here, we nd such interpretation and prove that the (adjacency) energy of any graph (bipartite or not) is a weighted sum of the traces of even powers of the adjacency matrix. We then use such result to nd bounds for the energy in terms of subgraphs contributing to it. The new bounds are studied for some speci c simple graphs, such as cycles and fullerenes. We observe that including contributions from subgraphs of sizes not bigger than 6 improves some of the best known bounds for the energy, and more importantly gives insights about the contributions of speci c subgraphs to the energy of these graphs.	adjacency matrix;cycle (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph energy;graph property;ibm notes;megabyte;tracing (software);utility functions on indivisible goods;weight function	Ernesto Estrada;Michele Benzi	2017	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2017.06.007		Theory	29.144001624398935	35.6917184572891	112037

Let ≺ denote the order relation induced by the classical Gray code for the product set (the natural extension of the Binary Reflected Gray Code to k-ary tuples). The restriction of ≺ to the set of compositions and bounded compositions gives known Gray codes for those sets. Here we show that ≺ restricted to the set of bounded compositions of an interval yields still a Gray code. An n-composition of an interval is an n-tuple of integers whose sum lies between two integers; and the set of bounded n-compositions of an interval simultaneously generalizes product set and compositions of an integer, and so ≺ put under a single roof all these Gray codes. As a byproduct we obtain Gray codes for permutations with a number of inversions lying between two integers, and with even/odd number of inversions or cycles. Such particular classes of permutations are used to solve some computational difficult problems.	code;inversion (discrete mathematics)	Vincent Vajnovszki;Rémi Vernay	2011	Inf. Process.

A P-invariant is a |P|-dimensional vector Y with Yt · A = Ō for the place-transition incidence matrix A of N. The Fourier-Motzkin method is well-known for computing all such invariants. This method, however, has a critical deficiency such that, even if a given Perti net N has any invariant, it is likely that no invariants are output because of memory overflow in storing intermediary vectors as candidates for invariants. In this paper, we propose an algorithm STFM_N for computing minimal-support nonnegative integer invariants: it tries to decrease the number of such candidate vectors in order to overcome this deficiency, by restricting computation of invariants to siphon-traps. It is shown, through experimental results, that STFM_N has high possibility of finding, if any, more minimal-support nonnegative integer invariants than any existing algorithm.	petri net	Akihiro Taguchi;Atsushi Iriboshi;Satoshi Taoka;Toshimasa Watanabe	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.4.964	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;petri net;algorithm	Visualization	35.69372505264275	35.1130182988373	112816

In the case where each Pi has rank three, the construction yields a combinatorial description of some terms of the complete cd-index as a sum of ordinary cd-indices of Eulerian posets obtained from each of the Pi.

Because there are so many balls-in-bins instances, it is typically not possible to enumerate all. So, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed instead. In this paper, we show how to improve the balls-in-bins estimates by using a weighted approach. An exact enumeration approach is also proposed that allows for the exhaustive enumeration of decomposition charts for the same analysis as in a previous paper. It is based on the enumeration of integer partitions.	chart;enumerated type;monte carlo method;simulation	Jon T.

1c4f9f0a2f00f74466097d23cd5ea0864270ae7b	unavoidable sets of partial words	combinatorics;combinatorics on words;unavoidable sets;partial words	The notion of an unavoidable set of words appears frequently in the fields of mathematics and theoretical computer science, in particular with its connection to the study of combinatorics on words. The theory of unavoidable sets has seen extensive study over the past twenty years. In this paper we extend the definition of unavoidable sets of words to unavoidable sets of partial words. Partial words, or finite sequences that may contain a number of “do not know” symbols or “holes,” appear naturally in several areas of current interest such as molecular biology, data communication, and DNA computing. We demonstrate the utility of the notion of unavoidability of sets of partial words by making use of it to identify several new classes of unavoidable sets of full words. Along the way we begin work on classifying the unavoidable sets of partial words of small cardinality. We pose a conjecture, and show that affirmative proof of this conjecture gives a sufficient condition for classifying all the unavoidable sets of partial words of size two. We give a result which makes the conjecture easy to verify for a significant number of cases. We characterize many forms of unavoidable sets of partial words of size three over a binary alphabet, and completely characterize such sets over a ternary alphabet. Finally, we extend our results to unavoidable sets of partial words of size k over a k-letter alphabet.	dna computing;theoretical computer science	Francine Blanchet-Sadri;Naomi C Brownstein;Andy Kalcic;Justin Palumbo;T.

ff0e6de7787692d1fa603503208a436484192b0f	on the orientable regular embeddings of complete multipartite graphs	journal	Let Km[n] be the complete multipartite graph with m parts, while each part contains n vertices. The regular embeddings of complete graphs Km[1] have been determined by Biggs (1971) [1], James and Jones (1985) [12] and Wilson (1989) [23]. During the past twenty years, several papers such as Du et al. (2007, 2010) [6,7], Jones et al. (2007, 2008) [14,15], Kwak and Kwon (2005, 2008) [16,17] and Nedela et al. (2002) [20] contributed to the regular embeddings of complete bipartite graphs K2[n] and the final classification was given by Jones [13] in 2010. Since then, the classification for general cases m ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2 has become an attractive topic in this area. In this paper, we deal with the orientable regular embeddings of Km[n] for m ≥ 3. We in fact give a reduction theorem for the general classification, namely, we show that if Km[n] has an orientable regular embeddingM, then eitherm = p and n = pe for some prime p ≥ 5 or m = 3 and the normal subgroup Aut+0 (M) of Aut(M) preserving each part setwise is a direct product of a 3-subgroup Q and an abelian 3-subgroup, where Q may be trivial. Moreover, we classify all the embeddings when m = 3 and Aut+0 (M) is abelian. We hope that our reduction theoremmight be the first necessary approach leading to the general classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.		Jun-Yang Zhang;Shao-Fei Du	2012	Eur. J.

It turns out that DOL and PDOL systems behave in different ways with respect to these sets. Especially, it follows that all DOL length sets— contrary to PDOL length sets—are not generated unambiguously, i.e. without repetitions, by DOL systems. Moreover it is proved that the number of axioms used determines an infinite hierarchy of length set families both in DOL and PDOL case.

When s and t are relatively prime, Olsson and Stanton have determined the size of the maximal (s, t)-core κs,t. When k > 2, a conjecture of Amdeberhan on the maximal (2k − 1, 2k, 2k + 1)-core κ2k−1,2k,2k+1 has also recently been verified by numerous authors. In this work, we analyze the relationship between maximal (2k−1, 2k+ 1)-cores and maximal (2k − 1, 2k, 2k + 1)-cores. In previous work, the first author noted that, for all k > 1, |κ2k−1,2k+1 | = 4|κ2k−1,2k,2k+1 | and requested a combinatorial interpretation of this unexpected identity. Here, using the theory of abaci, partition dissection, and elementary results relating triangular numbers and squares, we provide such a combinatorial proof.	disk partitioning;maximal set	Rishi Nath;James A.

This is a natural description of an array of inductances and capacities, of fluid flow in a network of ducts and of a system of masses and springs. The structure of the graph influences strongly the dynamics which is naturally described using the basis of the eigenvectors. In particular, we show that if two outer nodes are connected to a common third node with the same coupling, then this coupling is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Assuming the graph is forced and damped at specific nodes, we derive the amplitude equations. These are analyzed for two simple non trivial networks: a tree and a graph with a cycle. Forcing the network at a resonant frequency reveals that damping can be ineffective if applied to the wrong node, leading to a disastrous resonance and destruction of the network. These results could be useful for complex physical networks and engineering networks like power grids.	graph (discrete mathematics);laplacian matrix;numerical analysis;pipeline (unix);resonance;tree (data structure)	Jean-Guy Caputo;Arnaud Knippel;Elie Simo	2011	CoRR		algebraic connectivity;mathematical optimization;resistance distance;combinatorics;wave equation;discrete mathematics;flow network;laplacian matrix;resonance;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;spatial network;mathematics;random geometric graph;oscillation;artificial neural network;quantum mechanics	ML	28.720623217490296	37.15568423356714	116171
94ddafaebf5fc564f1d764d17996f565777323ce	on the decomposition of cayley color graphs into isomorphic oriented trees	mathematics	We prove that if Δ is a minimal generating set for a nontrivial group Γ and T is an oriented tree having |Δ| edges, then the Cayley color graph DΔ(Γ) can be decomposed into Absolute value of |Γ| edge-disjoint subgraphs, each of which is isomorphic to T; we say that DΔ(Γ) is T-decomposable. This result is extended to obtain a result concerning H-decompositions of Cayley graphs for weakly connected oriented graphs H. The first result is then used to derive several theorems concerning decompositions of Cayley color graphs into prescribed families of oriented trees. Applications of some of these theorems to the verification of statements about decompositions of the n-dimensional hypercube Qn are also discussed.		John Frederick Fink	1994	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

We consider possible locations of empty quadrics with respect to vertices of the cube, which is a particular case of a discrete optimization problem for a quadratic polynomial on the set of vertices of the cube. We demonstrate existence of a large number of pairs of parallel hyperplanes such that each pair contains a large number of points of a prescribed set.	vertex (geometry)	Konstantin Yu.

They determine 1+ 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 nonisomorphic affine planes of order 9, that is, 7 nonisomorphic transversal designs T(10, 9). These yield 7 x (10/5) = 1764 transversal designs T(5,9), each of which defines a strongly regular graph on 81 vertices, and a conference matrix of order 82. We show that these constructions reduce to 26 nonequivalent conference matrices of order 82, which give rise to 175 nonisomorphic strongly regular graphs (81, 40, 19, 20). Our tools are considerations of symmetry, use of a computer, and general results such as the following. For any strongly regular graph (4µ+ 1,2µ, µ - 1, µ) the number of 4-cliques equals the number of 4-cocliques. Section 2 recalls the definitions of a transversal design T(k, n), the corresponding strongly regular graph and, in the case 2k = n + I, the conference matrix of order n2+ 1. Section 3 adds some new results to the general theory of conference matrices (Theorems 3.3 and 3.4). Section 4 explains the tables, which lead to the results mentioned above. Table 1 copies the 7 alline planes of order 9 from [4], Table 2 mentions some useful permutations, and Table 3 lists the 26 nonisomorphic graphs (81, 40, 19, 20).

64c6e348a0b0b895505193d74a001ffd54ab3e8c	scalar solvability of network computation problems and representable matroids		We consider the following network computation problem. In an acyclic network, there are multiple source nodes, each generating multiple messages, and there are multiple sink nodes, each demanding a function of the source messages. The network coding problem corresponds to the case in which every demand function is equal to some source message, i.e., each sink demands some source message. Connections between network coding problems and matroids have been well studied. In this work, we establish a relation between network computation problems and representable matroids. We show that a network computation problem in which the sinks demand linear functions of source messages admits a scalar linear solution if and only if it is matroidal with respect to a representable matroid whose representation fulfills certain constraints dictated by the network computation problem. Next, we obtain a connection between network computation problems and functional dependency relations (FD-relations) and show that FD-relations can be used to characterize network computation problem with arbitrary (not necessarily linear) function demands as well as nonlinear network codes.	code;computation;computational problem;directed acyclic graph;functional dependency;linear function;linear network coding;matroid representation;nonlinear system;scalar processor	Anindya Gupta;B.

The subword complexity function of a partial word w over a finite alphabet A assigns to each positive integer, n, the number, pw(n), of distinct full words over A that are compatible with factors of length n of w. In this paper, with the help of our so-called hole functions, we construct infinite partial words w such that pw(n) = Θ(n ) for any real number α > 1. In addition, these partial words have the property that there exist infinitely many non-negative integers m satisfying pw(m + 1) − pw(m) ≥ m. Combining these results with earlier ones on full words, we show that this represents a class of subword complexity functions not achievable by full words. We also construct infinite partial words with intermediate subword complexity, that is between polynomial and exponential. ∗This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DMS–0754154.

More specifically, for any k, we provide a characterization of the set of permutations having distance ≤ k from the identity (which is known to be a permutation class) in terms of what we call generating permutations and we describe some properties of its basis, which allow to compute such a basis for small values of k.	hybrid genome assembly;permutation pattern	Giulio Cerbai;Luca Ferrari	2018			combinatorics;discrete mathematics;permutation;permutation pattern;transposition (music);genome;mathematics;prefix	Theory	35.57806595476556	39.54684318595409	123263

However the Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph is still a challenge. In this work we provide the Moore–Penrose inverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph obtained adding new pendant vertices to an initial graph, in terms of the Moore–Penrose inverse of the Laplacian matrix of the original graph. As an application we can compute the effective resistances and the Kirchhoff index of the new network.	graph (discrete mathematics);kirchhoff's theorem;laplacian matrix;moore–penrose pseudoinverse;resistance distance;vertex (geometry)	Angeles Carmona;Andrés M.

This result finds applications in various algebraic contexts where more general patterns than squares are considered. On the other hand, Erdős raised the question as to whether there exists an infinite word that avoids abelian squares, i.e., a word with no two adjacent factors being permutations of one another. Although this question was answered affirmately years later, knowledge of abelian pattern avoidance is rather limited. Recently, (abelian) pattern avoidance was initiated in the more general framework of partial words, which allow for undefined positions called holes. In this paper, we show that any pattern p with n > 3 distinct variables of length at least 2 is abelian avoidable by a partial word with infinitely many holes, the bound on the length of p being tight. We complete the classification of all the binary and ternary patterns with respect to non-trivial abelian avoidability, in which no variable can be substituted by only one hole. We also investigate the abelian avoidability indices of the binary and ternary patterns.	binary pattern (image generation);bitwise operation;electron hole;erdős number;linear algebra;omega language;partial word;permutation pattern;thue (programming language);unary operation;undefined behavior	Francine Blanchet-Sadri;Benjamin De Winkle;Sean Simmons	2014	RAIRO - Theor.

These new measures for the cohesion of networks can be used in case a dissimilarity value is given between nodes in a network or a graph. It is illustrated how a set of weights between connected nodes can be transformed into a set of dissimilarity measures for all nodes. The new compactness measure for the cohesion of weighted graphs has several desirable properties related to the disjoint union of two networks. Finally, an example is presented of the calculation of the new compactness measures for a co-citation and a bibliographic coupling network.	brs/search;bibliographic coupling;co-citation;graph (discrete mathematics);weighted network;whole earth 'lectronic link;wiener index	Leo Egghe;Ronald Rousseau	2003	JASIST	10.1002/asi.10155	formula;wiener index;information science;bibliometrics;artificial intelligence;graph theory;cohesion;structural cohesion;weighting;compact space;measurement	Theory	28.375289304065337	35.83108621536289	124885

Such a proof estimates the probability for a random object to violate the requirements and shows that it is small (or at least strictly less than 1). Let us look at a toy example. Consider a n × n Boolean matrix and its k × k minor (the intersection of k rows and k columns chosen arbitrarily). We say that the minor is monochromatic if all its elements are equal (either all zeros or all ones). Proposition. For large enough n and for k = O(log n), there exists a (n×n)matrix that does not contain a monochromatic (k × k)-minor. Proof. We repeat the same simple proof three times, in three different languages. (Probabilistic language) Let us choose matrix elements using independent tosses of a fair coin. For a given k colums and k rows, the probability of ∗LIRMM CNRS & University of Montpellier. On leave from IITP RAS, Moscow, Russia. E-mail address: alexander.shen@lirmm.fr.

(Both zerominor and one-minor have probability 2−k 2 .) There are at most n choices for columns and the same number for rows, so by the union bound the probability of getting at least one monochromatic minor is bounded by n × n × 2−k2+1 = 2 logn−k2+1 = 2 logn−k)+1 and the last expression is less then 1 if, say, k = 3 log n and n is suffuciently large. (Combinatorial language) Let us count the number of bad matrices. For a given choice of columns and rows we have 2 possibilities for the minor and 2 2−k2 possibilities for the rest, and there is at most n choices for raws and columns, so the total number of matrices with monochromatic minor is n × n × 2× 2n2−k2 = 2n2+2k logn−k2+1 = 2n2+k(2 logn−k)+1, and this is less than 2 2 , the total number of Boolean (n× n)-matrices. (Compression language) To specify the matrix that has a monochromatic minor, it is enough to specify 2k numbers between 1 and n (rows and column numbers), the color of the monochromatic minor (0 or 1) and the remaining n − k bits in the matrix (their positions are already known). So we save k bits (compared to the straightforward list of all n bits) using 2k log n+ 1 bits instead (each number in the range 1 . . . n requires log n bits; to be exact, we may use dlog ne), so we can compress the matrix with a monochromatic minor if 2k log n+ 1 k, and not all matrices are compressible. Of course, these three arguments are the same: in the second one we multiply probabilities by 2 2 , and in the third one we take logarithms. However, the compression language provides some new viewpoint that may help our intuition. 2 A bit more interesting example In this example we want to put bits (zeros and ones) around the circle in a “essentially asymmetric” way: each rotation of the circle should change at least a fixed percentage of bits.

Therefore its extension to cycle-containing structures is not unambiguous; there are several possibilities, some of which have already been realized. In this paper, we proposed an “all-path” version of W and showed that its maximal value is equal to N2(N − 1)2N-4, where N denotes the number of vertices in a graph. In contrast, the maximal values of W and its close analogues, the detour index, w(G), and the Szeged index, Sz(G), are polynomials of order 4 or less in terms of N, and therefore, it may be expected that the new version will discriminate cycle-containing structures more efficiently than W(G), w(G), or Sz(G).	wiener index	István Lukovits	1998	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci9700541	wiener index;chemistry;computer science	Theory	29.629941535277165	35.597337033171556	125770
72d036dfd4e9040ccf16ac61aadc339eb01fd38c	betweenness centrality in cartesian product of graphs		Abstract Betweenness centrality is a widely used measure in various graphs and it has a pivotal role in the analysis of complex networks. It measures the potential or power of a node to control the communication over the network. The computation is based on the assumption that information primarily flows over the shortest paths between the nodes of the network. In a graph, the power of a vertex is not an individual attribute, it depends on the influence of other vertices present. Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a vertex becomes part of the shortest paths between pairs of other vertices in a graph. In this paper, we establish expression for betweenness centrality in Cartesian product of graphs. And investigate the same on certain graphs such as grid, Hamming graphs, hypercubes, Cartesian product of cycles etc.	betweenness centrality	R.

The immanant of an n x n matrix A = [-a•] with respect to X is Zw~snZ(w)al,,~(t)...an, w~,). Goulden and Jackson conjectured, and Greene recently proved, that immanants of Jacobi-Trudi matrices are polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients. This led one of us (Stembridge) to formulate a series of conjectures involving immanants , some of which amount to stronger versions of the original Goulden-Jackson conjecture. In this paper, we prove some special cases of one of the stronger conjectures. One of the special cases we prove develops from a generalization of the theory of permutat ions with restricted position which takes into account the cycle structure of the permutations. We also present two refinements of the immanant conjectures, as well as a related conjecture on the number of ways to partition a partially ordered set into chains. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.	coefficient;jackson system development;jacobi method;kazhdan–lusztig polynomial	Richard P.

Our approach is motivated by techniques developed by Warren and others during the study of cycle-free partial orders. We give several new families of previously unknown countably infinite locally-2-arc-transitive graphs, each family containing continuum many members. These examples are obtained by gluing together copies of incidence graphs of semilinear spaces, satisfying a certain symmetry property, in a tree-like way. In one case we show how the classification problem for that family relates to the problem of determining a certain family of highly arc-transitive digraphs.

When s < k 2 , G k , s is always odd-bipartite. It is known that G k , k 2 is non-odd-bipartite if and only if G is non-bipartite, and G k , k 2 has the same adjacency (respectively, signless Laplacian) spectral radius as G . In this paper, we prove that, regardless of multiplicities, the H -spectrum of A ( G k , k 2 ) (respectively, Q ( G k , k 2 ) ) consists of all eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices (respectively, the signless Laplacian matrices) of the connected induced subgraphs (respectively, modified induced subgraphs) of G . As a corollary, G k , k 2 has the same least adjacency (respectively, least signless Laplacian) H -eigenvalue as G . We also discuss the limit points of the least adjacency H -eigenvalues of hypergraphs, and construct a sequence of non-odd-bipartite hypergraphs whose least adjacency H -eigenvalues converge to - 2 + 5 .

A latin square of order n is an n x n matrix such that each of n given symbols occurs exactly once in each row and once in each column. To avoid triviality we assume that n t> 3. We shall take the symbols to be the first n natural numbers. A latin square of order n may also be considered as an n x n array of cells into which symbols have been inserted. Let (i, j) denote the cell in row i and column j of the array. We define the distance between two cells (i, j) and (k, l) to be l i k l + Ijl l . Two cells, not in the same row or column, are said to be diagonally adjacent when their distance apart is 2 and a knight's move apart when it is 3. A sequence of cells such that every two successive cells are a knight's move apart is called a knight's path. Following Preece [6], we distinguish two types of knight's move squares as follows. A strict knight's move square is a latin square such that every two cells which contain the same symbol are joined by a knight's path composed of cells which contain that symbol. A weak knight's move square is similar, except that opposite edges of the n x n square are considered to be identified so that, for example, the cells (2, 1) and (4, n) are a knight's move apart, since 1 n --= 1 (rood n). Discussion of knight's move squares, especially in connection with the design of field experiments, started over a hundred years ago. Several references may be found in [6]. The latin square KV5 of order 5, shown on the right in Fig. 1, is a Knut Vik square. The same square (to within choice of symbols) appears in [6] and also (several times) in [1], the main reference work on latin squares (see [1, Figs. 5.3.1, 6.1.5, 6.2.4]). For any odd n, a Knut Vik square KVn of order n may	array data structure;experiment;international journal of lexicography;reference work;square-free word	Peter J.

(By convention, wj is a letter of the underlying alphabet if j < 0.) Clearly, addition chains are exactly word chains over a one-letter alphabet. The word chain is said to compute a word w if w belongs to the chain. The chain length of w is the smallest length of a word chain computing w. Besides the idea of generalizing addition chains, the interest of this notion comes from the intuitively clear fact that it lakes into account regularities in words, much better than for instance finite automata can do. This claim will be supported by some of the subsequent examples.

879bbc7cceb6b695251d7aa807d9606ba0a70554	automatic constructibility checking of a corpus of geometric construction problems		Straightedge and compass constructions play a special role in geometry. First, for a very long time, they were used in practice by land surveyors or architects in order to solve concrete problems. Second, they are an inexhaustible source of exercises used to learn concepts in geometry. And finally, some famous impossible problems related to straightedge and compass constructions waited centuries before being solved using algebra. In addition, not knowing if a well-constrained problem is constructible with straightedge and compass or not, make that kind of problems more difficult to address: should we synthesize a program or on the contrary find a counterexample has to be found and treated using algebra or reduction on it? In this paper, we perform a systematic checking of a whole corpus of problems proposed by William Wernick. We expose our methodology and the algorithm we used. For each problem, its constructibility status is computed and either an algebraic argument or a geometric construction is given.	powerset construction	Pascal Schreck;Pascal Mathis	2016	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-016-0247-3	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;computer science;pure mathematics;mathematics;geometry;algorithm;algebra	Theory	38.67570173239251	38.78805005741415	128235

The resonance energy in these models is expressed by a truncated cluster expansion in terms of acyclic subgraphs. In order to efficiently perform the complete expansion, one needs to know the Mobius function for the pertinent partially ordered set. In the present paper a formula for the Mobius function in the poset is derived and discussed.	directed acyclic graph	Darko Babic;Nenad Trinajstic	1996	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/0166-218X(95)00007-E	partially ordered set;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Crypto	29.746332052818843	35.63114328971046	129201

It has been shown that for any finite set/co-finite set of prime numbers, there exists a sum-network which has a rate 1 linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set. It has also been shown that for any positive rational number k/n, there exists a sum-network which has capacity equal to k/n. It is a natural question whether, for any positive rational number k/n, and for any finite set/co-finite set of primes {p1, p2, …, pl}, there exists a sum-network which has a capacity achieving rate k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set.

The maximum number of elements in an admissible sequence in an interval of length x is denoted by %∗(x). Hensley and Richards showed that %∗(x) > π(x) for large enough x. We increase the known bounds on the set of x satisfying %∗(x) ≤ π(x) and find smaller values of x such that %∗(x) > π(x). We also find values of x satisfying %∗(x) > 2π(x/2). This shows the incompatibility of the conjecture π(x+y)−π(y) ≤ 2π(x/2) with the prime k-tuples conjecture.	admissible heuristic;modulo operation;software incompatibility	David A. Clark;Norman C.

However, in 2012 Umeo and Kubo introduced a very simple variation of this type and pointed out that its minimal-time solutions are unknown. In that variation, a problem instance is a square array of n columns and n rows and the position of the general is arbitrary. For this variation they constructed a solution that fires at time 2n-2 for any position of the general and wrote that it is not known whether this solution is minimal-time or not. We determine the exact value of the minimum firing time of this variation. For some problem instances this value is smaller than 2n-2 and hence the 2n-2 time solution is not minimal-time. Our result does not solve the problem of existence or non-existence of minimal-time solutions of the variation. However the result gives one necessary condition for solutions to be minimal-time.	firing squad synchronization problem	Kojiro Kobayashi	2014	Theor. Comput.

More specifically, the paper places emphasis on the star-relevant graph, which means adding certain edges on peripheral vertices of star graph. Initially, we provide the spectrum of the density matrices corresponding to star-like graph (i.e., adding an edge on star graph) and present that the Von Neumann entropy increases under the graph operation (adding an edge on star graph) and the graph operation cannot be simulated by local operation and classical communication (LOCC). Subsequently, we illustrate the spectrum of density matrices corresponding to star-alike graph (i.e., adding one edge on star-like graph) and exhibit that the Von Neumann entropy increases under the graph operation (adding an edge on star-like graph) and the graph operation cannot be simulated by LOCC. Finally, the spectrum of density matrices corresponding to star-mlike graph (i.e., adding m nonadjacent edges on the peripheral vertices of star graph) is demonstrated and the relation between the graph operation and Von Neumann entropy, LOCC is revealed in this paper.	laplacian matrix;quantum state	Jianqiang Li;Xiubo Chen;Yi-Xian Yang	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-015-1134-6	graph power;edge-transitive graph;petersen graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;topology;graph bandwidth;null graph;regular graph;distance-regular graph;simplex graph;cubic graph;mathematics;voltage graph;butterfly graph;quartic graph;complement graph;line graph;physics;string graph;strength of a graph;quantum mechanics;coxeter graph;adjacency matrix;von neumann entropy	ML	29.451921172804244	36.61497326719478	133878

Sloane has also hinted at a generalized box stacking problem which is closely related to generalized non–squashing partitions. We solve this generalized box stacking problem by obtaining a generating function for the number of such stacks and discuss partition functions which arise via this generating function.	disk partitioning;focus stacking	George E.

Therefore, the string (1) contains all possible substrings of length n. The original formulation of the de Bruijn sequence problem is connected to the number of Eulerian paths in a directed graph in which the nodes are labeled with substrings of length n 1 of our m + 1 symbols. The graphical interpretation is, however, not useful in finding algorithms for generating de Bruijn sequences. Thus, all published algorithms use either an approach based on the theory of finite fields or, as we do here, a direct combinatorial approach. For the case m = 1 the finite field approach leads to a simple algorithm based on a shift register approach (see, for example, [ 5, pp. 28-291). For m > 1, the finite field approach requires a knowledge of the coefficients of primitive polynomials of the fields of characteristics p for each prime p which divides m. Given these, however, the algorithm to generate de Btijn sequences is reasonably straightforward [8]. With the exception of the algorithm of Fredricksen and Maiorana [4] and the related algorithm for the case m = 1 of Fredricksen and Kessler [3] (see also Fredricksen[ 2]), all combinatorial algorithms require a storage of at least Mbits to record whether or not a given substring of length n has appeared in the sequence as it is generated.

If a subset is representable, how long a word do we need to represent it? How many such subsets are represented by words of length t? For the first problem, we give upper and lower bounds of the form α 2 n in the binary case. For the second problem, we give a weak upper bound and some experimental data. For the third problem, we give a closed-form formula in the case where n ≤ t < 2n. Algorithmic variants of these problems have previously been studied under the name “shortest common superstring”.

In particular, in the former, Terao’s open problem asking whether freeness depends only on combinatorics is true. A long standing problem whether all free arrangements are recursively free or not was settled by the second author and Hoge very recently, by giving a free but non-recursively free plane arrangement consisting of 27 planes. In this paper, we construct free but non-recursively free plane arrangements consisting of 13 and 15 planes, and show that the example with 13 planes is the smallest in the sense of the cardinality of planes. In other words, all free plane arrangements consisting of at most 12 planes are recursively free. To show this, we completely classify all free plane arrangements in terms of inductive freeness and three exceptions when the number of planes is at most 12. Several properties of the 15 plane arrangement are proved by computer programs. Also, these two examples solve negatively a problem posed by Yoshinaga on the moduli spaces, (inductive) freeness and, rigidity of free arrangements. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	computer program;recursion	Takuro Abe;Michael Cuntz;Hiraku Kawanoue;Takeshi Nozawa	2016	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2015.12.017	arrangement of lines;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;moduli space;algebra	Theory	38.77090550624555	33.041828879129625	136628

Such networks are more general than the widely studied irredundant cascade, but less general than a universal network based on, for example, the Shannon decomposition. The analysis is facilitated by the introduction of three cell-network interconnections, whose functions are characterized by certain attributes of the partition matrix of the realized function. Partition matrices have been used to significant advantage in characterizing disjunctive decompositions. They are also important in the analysis of nondisjunctive decompositions, but their application is cumbersome in such cases. It is shown that certain nondisjunctive decompositions can be handled easily as operations on partition matrices. A counting technique is developed which shows that the number of functions realized by tandem networks is significantly larger than that realized by cascades. In addition, a synthesis technique is shown for constructing a tandem network to realize a given function.	disjunctive normal form;interconnection;partition type;shannon (unit);tandem computers	Jon T.

de56cb2797b375e9b97158e43d9c3e3cabd47235	on long words avoiding zimin patterns		A pattern is encountered in a word if some infix of the word is the image of the pattern under some non-erasing morphism. A pattern p is unavoidable if, over every finite alphabet, every sufficiently long word encounters p. A theorem by Zimin and independently by Bean, Ehrenfeucht and McNulty states that a pattern over n distinct variables is unavoidable if, and only if, p itself is encountered in the n-th Zimin pattern. Given an alphabet size k, we study the minimal length f(n, k) such that every word of length f(n, k) encounters the n-th Zimin pattern. It is known that f is upper-bounded by a tower of exponentials. Our main result states that f(n, k) is lowerbounded by a tower of n − 3 exponentials, even for k = 2. To the best of our knowledge, this improves upon a previously best-known doubly-exponential lower bound. As a further result, we prove a doubly-exponential upper bound for encountering Zimin patterns in the abelian sense. 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.2.1 Combinatorics, F.4.3.

As such they are structural invariants which may be of interest in discussions of similarities and differences among unsaturated compounds. Brute force enumeration of valence structures is already impractical for graphs having  n  = 10 vertices (e.g. naphthalene C 10 H 8 ). Here we outline a computer program which enumerates valence structures of any degree of excitation. The results are illustrated on linear chains, cycles, and smaller benzenoid systems. Some properties of the derived polynomials are discussed. The recursive relation for the generalized Wheland polynomials is given. Because of the nonpolynomial character of the problem the computer application is practical only for graphs having  n  = 16 and less vertices.	polynomial	Kenneth J.

It is called regular if its automorphism group acts regularly on the dart set. A regular Cayley map M=CM(G,S,p) is called t-balanced if p(x)^-^1=p^t(x^-^1) for every x@?S. In this paper, we classify the regular t-balanced Cayley maps on dicyclic groups for all t. As a result, all such maps are 1-balanced.	magma;map	Jin Ho Kwak;Young Soo Kwon;Rongquan Feng	2006	Eur. J.

43c5db04ce037d30c994d879c4ecd249118516ed	plethysm for wreath products and homology of sub-posets of dowling lattices	representation theory;wreath product	We prove analogues for sub-posets of the Dowling lattices of the results of Calderbank, Hanlon, and Robinson on homology of sub-posets of the partition lattices. The technical tool used is the wreath product analogue of the tensor species of Joyal. Introduction For any positive integer n and finite group G, the Dowling lattice Qn(G) is a poset with an action of the wreath product group G o Sn. If G is trivial, Qn({1}) can be identified with the partition lattice Πn+1 (on which Sn acts as a subgroup of Sn+1). If G is the cyclic group of order r for r ≥ 2, Qn(G) can be identified with the lattice of intersections of reflecting hyperplanes in the reflection representation of G o Sn. For general G, the underlying set of Qn(G) can be thought of as the set of all pairs (I, π) where I ⊆ {1, · · · , n} and π is a set partition of G × ({1, · · · , n} \ I) whose parts G permutes freely; see Definition 1.1 below for the partial order. In Section 1 we will define various sub-posets P of Qn(G), containing the minimum element 0̂ and the maximum element 1̂, which are stable under the action of G o Sn. For completeness’ sake we include the cases of Qn(G) itself and two other sub-posets which have been studied before, but the main interest lies in two new families of sub-posets, defined using a fixed integer d ≥ 2: Q mod d n (G), given by the congruence conditions |I| ≡ 0 mod d and |K| ≡ 1 mod d for all parts K of π, and Q mod d n (G), given by the condition |K| ≡ 0 mod d for all parts K of π. These definitions are modelled on those of the sub-posets Π (1,d) n and Π (0,d) n of the partition lattice studied by Calderbank, Hanlon, and Robinson in [4]. We will prove that all our sub-posets P are pure (i.e. graded) and ∗This work was supported by Australian Research Council grant DP0344185 the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R87 1 Cohen-Macaulay, so the only non-vanishing reduced homology group of P \ {0̂, 1̂} is the top homology H̃l(P )−2(P \ {0̂, 1̂}; Q). We take rational coefficients so that we can regard this homology as a representation of G o Sn over Q. The main aim of this paper is to find in each case a formula for the character of this representation, analogous to the formulae proved in [4]. The last paragraph of that paper hoped specifically for a Dowling lattice analogue of [4, Theorem 6.5], but our Theorem 2.7 casts doubt on its existence. (In the cases of the previously-studied posets, we recover Hanlon’s formula from [7] and other results which were more or less known.) In [14], Rains applied [4, Theorem 4.7] to compute the character of Sn on the cohomology of the manifold M0,n(R) (the real points of the moduli space of stable genus 0 curves with n marked points). In subsequent work he has generalized this, giving a description of the cohomology of any real De Concini-Procesi model in terms of the Whitney homology of an associated poset; the posets which arise in types B and D are closely related to our Q mod 2 n ({±1}). This application to algebraic topology, which was the original motivation for studying such sub-posets of Dowling lattices, will be explained in a forthcoming joint paper; for a sample, see (5.11) below. In Section 2 we recall the combinatorial framework used by Macdonald to write down characters of representations of wreath products, and state our main results. In Section 3 we introduce the functorial concept of a (G o S)-module, a generalization of Joyal’s notion of tensor species; this concept comes from [8], and we recall the connection proved there with generalizations of plethysm. In Section 4 we use this technology, and the ‘Whitney homology method’ of Sundaram, to prove our results. In Section 5 we extend the results to the setting of Whitney homology, thus computing the ‘equivariant characteristic polynomials’ of our posets. 1 Some Cohen-Macaulay sub-posets of Dowling lattices In this section we define the Dowling lattices and the sub-posets of interest to us, and prove that they are Cohen-Macaulay. A convenient reference for the basic definitions and techniques of Cohen-Macaulay posets is [16]; the key result for us is the Björner-Wachs criterion, [16, Theorem 4.2.2] (proved in [2]), that a pure bounded poset with a recursive atom ordering is Cohen-Macaulay. For any nonnegative integer n, write [n] for {1, · · · , n} (so [0] is the empty set), and Sn for the symmetric group of permutations of [n]. For any finite set I, let Π(I) denote the poset of partitions of the set I, where a partition π of I is a set of nonempty disjoint subsets of I whose union is I. These subsets K ∈ π are referred to as the parts of π. The partial order on Π(I) is by refinement; Π(I) is a geometric lattice, isomorphic to Πn = Π([n]) where n = |I|. (We use the convention that the empty set has a single partition, which as a set is itself empty. Therefore Π(∅) = Π0 is a one-element poset, like Π1.) Fix a finite group G, and view the wreath product G oSn as the group of permutations of G× [n] which commute with the action of G (by left multiplication on the first factor). the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R87 2 Our definition of the corresponding Dowling lattice is as follows. Definition 1.1. For n ≥ 1, let Qn(G) be the poset of pairs (J, π) where J is a G-stable subset of G × [n] and π ∈ Π((G × [n]) \ J) is such that G permutes its parts freely, i.e. for all 1 6= g ∈ G and K ∈ π, K 6= g.K ∈ π. The partial order on these pairs is defined so that (J, π) ≤ (J , π) is equivalent to the following two conditions: 1. J ⊆ J , and 2. for all parts K ∈ π, either K ⊆ J ′ or K is contained in a single part of π. We have an obvious action of G o Sn on the poset Qn(G). Of course, J must be of the form G× I for some subset I ⊆ [n], so we could just as well have used I in the definition, as in the introduction; once one has taken into account this and other such variations, it should be clear that Qn(G) is isomorphic, as a (G oSn)-poset, to Dowling’s original lattice in [5] and to the various alternative definitions given in [7], [6], and [9]. (The justification for adding yet another definition to the list will come when we adopt a functorial point of view.) The minimum element 0̂ is the pair (∅, {{(g,m)} | g ∈ G,m ∈ [n]}), and the maximum element 1̂ is the pair (G × [n], ∅). Dowling proved in [5] that Qn(G) is a geometric lattice, and hence it is Cohen-Macaulay; its rank function is rk(J, π) = n− |π| |G| , (1.1) so the length of the lattice as a whole is n. Special cases of this lattice are more familiar. Clearly Qn({1}) ∼= Π({0, 1, · · · , n}) via the map which sends (J, π) to {J ∪{0}}∪π; and Qn({±1}) is the signed partition lattice, also known as the poset of (conjugate) parabolic subsystems of a root system of type Bn. More generally, when G is cyclic of order r ≥ 2, Qn(G) can be identified with the lattice of intersections of reflecting hyperplanes in the reflection representation of G o Sn, i.e. the lattice denoted L(An(r)) in [13, §6.4]. Before we define the sub-posets we are mainly interested in, let us also consider two sub-posets given by a condition on J : Definition 1.2. For n ≥ 1, let Rn(G) be the sub-poset of Qn(G) consisting of pairs (J, π) where either J = ∅ or J = G× [n]. For n ≥ 2 and assuming that G 6= {1}, let Qn (G) be the sub-poset of Qn(G) consisting of pairs (J, π) where |J | |G| 6= 1. Clearly the minimum and maximum elements of Qn(G) are in Rn(G) (indeed, we allow J = G × [n] merely in order to include 1̂); likewise for Qn (G), given that n ≥ 2. It is easy to see that both Rn(G) and Q ∼ n (G) are pure of length n, with rank function again given by (1.1). It is also easy to see that Rn(G) \ {1̂} is a geometric semilattice in the sense of Wachs and Walker (see [16, Definition 4.2.6]), so Rn(G) is Cohen-Macaulay by [16, Theorem 4.2.7]. An alternative proof of this is provided by [9, Corollary 3.12], where Rn(G) \ {0̂, 1̂} is called Π G n . Note that Rn({1}) \ {1̂} ∼= Πn, so Rn({1}) is Πn with an extra maximum element adjoined. One can also interpret Rn({±1}) \ {1̂} as the poset the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R87 3 of (conjugate) parabolic subsystems of a root system of type Bn all of whose components are of type A. As for Qn (G), note that it is closed under the join operation of Qn(G), and two elements of Qn (G) have a meet in Q ∼ n (G) which is ≤ their meet in Qn(G). The assumption that G 6= {1} ensures that every element of Qn (G) is a join of atoms, so Qn (G) is another geometric lattice, and hence it is Cohen-Macaulay. When G is cyclic of order r ≥ 2, Qn (G) can be identified with the lattice denoted L(A 0 n(r)) in [13, Section 6.4]; for instance, Qn ({±1}) is the poset of (conjugate) parabolic subsystems of a root system of type Dn. Now we turn to the analogues of the sub-posets of the partition lattices considered by Calderbank, Hanlon, and Robinson. Definition 1.3. For n ≥ 1 and d ≥ 2, let Q mod d n (G) be the sub-poset of Qn(G) consisting of pairs (J, π) satisfying the following conditions: 1. for all K ∈ π, |K| ≡ 1 mod d; and 2. either |J | |G| ≡ 0 mod d or J = G× [n]. Note that when n ≡ 0 mod d, there is no need to explicitly allow J = G× [n]; otherwise, allowing this has the effect of ensuring that the maximum element 1̂ is included. Clearly the minimum element 0̂ of Qn(G) also belongs to Q 1 mod d n (G). To explain the congruence condition in (2), note that under the isomorphism Qn({1}) ∼= Π({0, 1, · · · , n}) ∼= Πn+1, Q mod d n ({1}) corresponds to the ‘1 mod d partition lattice’ Π (1,d) n+1 considered in [4]. Also, one can interpret Q mod d n ({±1}) \ {1̂} as the poset of proper (conjugate) parabolic subsystems of a root system of type Bn all of whose components have rank divisible by d; the following result was proved by Rains in that case. Proposition 1.4. Q mod d n (G) is a totally semimodular pure poset with rank function rk(J, π) = { d d e, if J = G× n, n d − |π| d|G| , otherwise. Its length is d d e. Proof.

This action linearly extends to LIE[A]. We are concerned here with the action of the symmetric group S, on the subspace of LIE[A] which is the linear span of bracketings of words which are permutations of the letters of the alphabet. It follows from the work of Hanlon, Stanley, and Joyal that this action and the action of S, on the top homology of the partition lattice II, indude similar representations (up to tensoring with the alternating character). It follows from the work of Garsia and Stanton that the action on the homology is similar to the action on a suitably defined top portion of the Stanley-Reisner ring. In this paper we derive a direct combinatorial proof of the similarity of these three actions by choosing natural bases in each of these three spaces and comparing the matrices corresponding to the simple reflections.

The algorithm is patterned after (1) Buchberger’s algorithm for computing a Gröbner basis of a polynomial ideal whose coefficients are from a field and (2) its extension developed by Kandri-Rody and Kapur when the coefficients appearing in the polynomials are from a Euclidean domain. The algorithm works as Buchberger’s algorithm when a polynomial ideal is over a field and as KandriRody-Kapur’s algorithm when a polynomial ideal is over a Euclidean domain. The proposed algorithm and the related technical development are quite different from a general framework of reduction rings proposed by Buchberger in 1984 and generalized later by Stifter to handle reduction rings with zero divisors. These different approaches are contrasted along with the obvious approach where for instance, in the case of Zn, ∗This research is partially supported by the NSF grants CCR-9996144 and CCR0203051. The work on this topic was initiated by the first author jointly with Prof. Klaus Madlener of University of Kaiserslautern while Kapur and Madlener were visiting each other in 1986-90. Preliminary results were presented at a workshop at Cornell University organized by the Mathematical Sciences Institute in 1988.	buchberger's algorithm;coefficient;division algorithm;gröbner basis;ibm notes;modulo operation;polynomial ring	Deepak Kapur;Yongyang Cai	2009	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-009-0072-z	canonical form;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;algebraic geometry;gröbner basis;mathematics;geometry;faugère's f4 and f5 algorithms;prime number;algebra	Theory	34.78984637504629	36.45560145332383	140708

We show how to express any column of the incidence matrix as a half-integral linear combination of any column basis, through a simplification, based on an idea of Bolker, of a combinatorial algorithm of Appa and Kotnyek.

The minimum number of vertices whose subversion results in an empty, complete, or disconnected subgraph is called the neighbor-connectivity of the graph. Gunther, Hartnell, and Nowakowski have shown that for any graph, neighbor-connectivity is bounded above by . The main result of this paper is a sharpening of the bound for abelian Cayley graphs. In particular, we show by constructing an effective subversion strategy for such graphs, that neighbor-connectivity is bounded above by /2 + 2. Using a result of Watkins the new bound can be recast in terms of to get neighbor-connectivity bounded above by 3 /4 + 2 for abelian Cayley graphs. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While designing a communication network, an important problem is to make it as reliable as possible. There are many measures of such reliability. One of them is the number of spanning trees in the network (see Cvetkovič et al. [4]). (We shall identify the network with a directed graph in the sequel.) For integers m, n, m ≤ n, define [m, n] = {m, m + 1, . . . , n}. Let A ⊆ [1, n−1], |A| = k. By a directed circulant graph Cn(A), we mean the graph whose vertex set is [0, n − 1] and the edge set is {(i, i − t) : i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1 and t ∈ A}, where subtraction is modulo n (see Fig. 1 for an example). Clearly, directed circulant graphs are regular. By an in-tree with root r, we mean a directed graph T such that the out-degree of every vertex x ≠ r in T is 1 and there is a unique path from x to r in T.	circulant matrix;directed graph;existential quantification;file spanning;modulo operation;spanning tree;telecommunications network	Zbigniew Lonc;Krzysztof Parol;Jacek Wojciechowski	2001	Networks	10.1002/net.2	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;spanning tree;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	24.7395961496051	33.034022312301786	141833

For a part of these results we also give another proof, which is based on Raney's generalized lemma. Thanks to the fact that the diagonals of a dcd-polyomino can grow at most by one, the problem of  q -enumeration of this object can be solved by an application of Gessel's  q -analog of the Lagrange inversion formula.

Combin. 21 (2000) 571) gave a bound on the size of blocking semiovals and presented a family of blocking semiovals of size 3q - 4 valid in PG(2, q) for q ≥ 5.Dover posed the question: how many equivalence classes of blocking semiovals are there in PG(2, 7) and how many of them are members of infinite families? Comprehensive computer searches by the authors found eleven blocking semiovals, up to projective equivalence. We found that at least seven of these blocking semiovals are contained in infinite families. This paper presents those families.We also prove a robust extension theorem: any blocking semioval in a subplane π of a projective plane Π may be extended to a blocking semioval in Π by adding a suitable collection of points.

As is well known, the set Stof all finite factors of all Sturmian words equals the set of factors ofPER. Moreover, the elements of PERhave many remarkable structural properties. In particular, t he relation Stand= A ∪ PER{ab, ba} holds, whereStandis the set of all finite standard Sturmian words. In this paper we introduce two proper subclasses of PERthat we denote byHarm andGold. We call an element of Harm a harmonic word and an element of Gold a gold word. A harmonic wordw beginning with the letter x is such that the ratio of two periods p/q, with p < q, is equal to itsslope, i .e.,(|w|y + 1)/(|w|x + 1), where{x, y} = {a, b}. A gold word is an element of PERsuch thatp andq are primes. Some characterizations of harmonic words are given and the number of harmonic words of each length i s computed. Moreover, we prove that S is equal to the set of factors ofHarmand to the set of factors of Gold. We introduce also the classes Harm andGold of all infinite standard Sturmian words having infinitely many prefixes in Harm andGold, respectively. We prove thatGold ∩ Harm contain continuously many elements. Finally, some conjectures are formulated. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.		Arturo Carpi;Aldo de Luca	2004	Eur. J.

As particular instances, we get flagged Schur functors and Schubert functors, the latter family being indexed by permutations. We identify Schubert functors for vexillary permutations with some flagged Schur functors, thus establishing a functorial analogue of a theorem from [6] and [15]. Over an infinite field, we study the trace of a Schubert module, which is a cyclic module over a Borel subgroup B, restricted to the maximal torus. The main result of the paper says that this trace is equal to the corresponding Schubert polynomial of Lascoux and Schützenberger [6]. We also investigate filtrations of B-modules associated with the Monk formula [10] and transition formula from [8].	maximal set;tutte polynomial;vexillary permutation	Witold Kraskiewicz;Piotr Pragacz	2004	Eur.

All paired comparisons of treatments in the designs recommended are estimable within each microplate in spite of the existence of row and column effects. The (M, S)-criterion is used to select optimal and eliminate inefficient designs. It turns out that all (M, S)-optimal designs are binary, that is, no treatments appear twice in any row or column. Optimal designs are not unique with respect to design isomorphism. A series of (M, S)-optimal designs is constructed and all paired comparisons of treatments in the constructed designs are estimable regardless of the two-way heterogeneity. An (M, S)-optimal design for 8 ×12 microplates is provided and optimal designs of other dimensions can be constructed systematically.	throughput	Xianggui Qu	2010	Technometrics	10.1198/TECH.2010.09128	mathematics;design of experiments;algorithm;statistics	Robotics	31.4575451453355	39.77741052104897	144782

Like joins (e.g., forest to forest) are most common because pixel size is typically much smaller than the average patch size. The dominance of like joins (the matrix diagonal) of the adjacency matrix has led to one interpretation of the matrix as landscape contagion (the tendency of land cover to cluster into a few, large patches). Construction of the adjacency matrix in a vector environment results in a different measurement. In a vector environment, land cover patches are not sub–divided into pixels. Therefore, the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix is zero. Construction of an adjacency matrix in a vector environment estimates the evenness of distribution of edge types, not contagion. The same edge type evenness metric is estimated in a raster environment by ignoring the matrix diagonal and re-scaling the off-diagonal elements ...		James D. Wickham;Kurt H. Riitters;Robert V.

Starting with the Königsberg seven-bridge problem in 1736, graphs with bidirectional or symmetric edges have ideally epitomized structures of various complex systems, and have developed into one of the mainstays of the modern discrete mathematics and network theory. Formally, a simple graph G consists of a vertex set V = {1, 2, · · · , n} and an edge set E ⊆ V × V . The adjacency matrix of G is a symmetric (0, 1)-matrix A(G) = (aij) ∈ Rn×n, where aij = aji = 1 if vertices i and j are adjacent, and aij = aji = 0 otherwise. It is well-known in algebraic graph theory that A(G) has exactly n real eigenvalues λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn due to its symmetry. They are usually called the spectrum (eigenvalues) of G itself [2].

It is known that the order of the Jacobian of a graph is equal to its number of spanning trees, but the exact structure is known for only a few classes of graphs. In this paper, we compute the Jacobian for graphs of the form Kn\E(H) where H is a subgraph of Kn on n − 1 vertices that is either a cycle, or a union of two disjoint paths. We also offer a combinatorial proof of a result of Christianson and Reiner that describes the Jacobian for a subclass of threshold graphs.	abelian sandpile model;file spanning;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear algebra	Serguei Norine;Peter Whalen	2011	Eur.

We investigate the first- and second-order network coherence quantifying as the sum and square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. Firstly, we deduce the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of Laplacian matrix. Then we compute the sum and square sum of reciprocal of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. Finally, we get the scalings of their first- and second-order network coherence with network size Ng are ln Ng and Ng ln Ng, respectively, which are smaller than some studied tree graphs, such as Web graphs, T fractal and Peano basin fractal.	fractal;graph - visual representation;laplacian matrix;mechlorethamine;recursion	Jiaojiao He;Meifeng Dai;Yue Zong;Jiahui Zou	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216886	tree (graph theory);control theory;small-world network;peano axioms;mathematical analysis;laplacian matrix;engineering;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;laplace operator;coherence (physics);fractal	Theory	28.93028717443208	34.78955051075526	146819

Ito and G. Lischke, Math. Log. Quart. 53 (2007) 91–106; Corrigendum in Math. Log. Quart. 53 (2007) 642–643], give rise to defining six kinds of roots of a nonempty word. For 1 ≤ k ≤ 6, a k -root word is a word which has exactly k different roots, and a k -cluster is a set of k -root words u where the roots of u fulfil a given prefix relationship. We show that out of the 89 different clusters that can be considered at all, in fact only 30 exist, and we give their quasi-lexicographically smallest elements. Also we give a sufficient condition for words to belong to the only existing 6-cluster. These words are also called Lohmann words. Further we show that, with the exception of a single cluster, each of the existing clusters contains either only periodic words, or only primitive words.	cluster analysis	Gerhard Lischke	2014	RAIRO - Theor.

In this paper we enumerate plane trees with given numbers of old leaves and young leaves. The formula is obtained combinatorially via two bijections between plane trees and 2-Motzkin paths which map young leaves to red horizontal steps, and old leaves to up steps. We derive some implications for the enumeration of restr icted permutations with respect to certain statistics such as pairs of consecutive deficiencies, double descents, and ascending runs. Finally, our main bijection is applied to obtain refinements of two identities of Coker, involving refined Narayana numbers and the Catalan numbers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Packing designs correspond to codes with constant weight; 4-sparse partial Steiner triple systems (4-sparse PSTSs) correspond to erasure-resilient codes that are useful in handling failures in large disk arrays (Chee, Colbourn, Ling, Discrete Appl. Math., to appear; Hellerstein, Gibson, Karp, Katz, Paterson, Algorithmica 12 (1994) 182–208). The study of polytopes associated with combinatorial problems has proven to be important for both algorithms and theory, but only recently the study of design polytopes has been pursued (Moura, Math. Appl. 368 (1996) 227–254; Moura, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Toronto, 1999; Moura, Proc. Seventh Annu. European Symp. Prague, 1999, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1643, Springer, Berlin, 1999, pp. 462–475; Wengrzik, Master’s Thesis, Universit> at Berlin, 1995; Zehendner, Doctoral Thesis, Universit> at Augsburg, 1986). In this article, we study polytopes associated with t-(v; k; ) packing designs and with m-sparse PSTSs. Subpacking and l-sparseness inequalities are introduced and studied. They can be regarded as rank inequalities for the independence systems associated with these designs. Conditions under which subpacking inequalities de+ne facets are derived; in particular, those which de+ne facets for PSTSs are determined. For m¿ 4, the l-sparseness inequalities with 26 l6m are proven to induce facets for the m-sparse PSTS polytope; this proof uses extremal families of PSTSs known as Erd> os con+gurations. Separation algorithms for these inequalities are proposed. We incorporate some of the sparseness inequalities in a polyhedral algorithm, and determine maximal 4-sparse PSTS(v); v6 16. An upper bound on the size of m-sparse PSTSs is presented. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. E-mail address: lucia@site.uottawa.ca (L.

The tiles must cover the region and satisfy the constraint that no four corners of the tiles meet; such tilings are called tatami tilings. We provide a structural characterization and use it to prove that the tiling is completely determined by the tiles that are on its border. We prove that the number of tatami tilings of an n × n square with n monomers is n2n−1. We also show that, for fixed-height, the generating function for the number of tatami tilings of a rectangle is a rational function, and outline an algorithm that produces the generating function.	algorithm;domino tiling;fixed point (mathematics);tiling window manager	Alejandro Erickson;Frank Ruskey;Jennifer Woodcock;Mark Schurch	2011	Electr.

Here we show that, in fact, the elements of the matrix can be partitioned into n disjoint latin transversals, provided n is a power of 2 and no element appears more than En times for some fixed 6 > 0.

Thus, an automated construction of NMR systems is possible, given the basic module and arbitrary redundancy N. In this paper we present the mathematical aspects of the method, i.e., we analyze the properties of the matrix that characterizes the method. We give the characteristic polynomials of the properly and erroneously built matrices in their explicit forms. We further give the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a properly built matrix and discuss the eigenvalues of an erroniously built matrix. We also give relations between the voter outputs and eigenpairs.	characteristic polynomial;scalability;the matrix;voter model	Elena Hadzieva;Aleksandar Simevski	2017	IEEE EUROCON 2017 -17th International Conference on Smart Technologies	10.1109/EUROCON.2017.8011124	logical matrix;redundancy (engineering);scaling;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;theoretical computer science;polynomial;computer science;matrix (mathematics);symmetric matrix	Embedded	37.71465647956771	42.00613954305714	147972

For positive integers j, the first author and B. Gordon proved that Q(n) is a multiple of 2j for every non-negative integer n outside a set with density zero. Here we show that if i 6≡ 0 (mod 2j), then #{0 ≤ n ≤ X : Q(n) ≡ i (mod 2)} j √ X / log X. In particular, Q(n) lies in every residue class modulo 2j infinitely often. In addition, we examine the behavior of Q(n) (mod 8) in detail, and we obtain a simple “closed formula” using the arithmetic of the ring Z[ √ −6].	emoticon;modulo operation	Ken Ono;David Penniston	2000	J.

We transform t his initial st ate step by step. Every vert ex checks whet her it is able to send one chip through every outgoing arc. If it can, it does; otherwise it does not send any chip. All vert ices check and send in parallel. Finally, at every vert ex all incoming chips are added to the remaining chips. This tr ansformation on the set of states is iterated. If the digraph and the total numb er of chips are finite, then we finally arrive at some periodic configurat ion. Here we investigate how t hese periodic configurations depend on the digraph and the total number of chips. There is a sharp cont rast in the behavior for Eulerian digraphs (where the in-degree of each vert ex equals its out-degree) and non-Eulerian digraphs.	directed graph;eulerian path;iteration;multigraph;oscillator (cellular automaton)	Erich Prisner	1994	Complex Systems		theoretical computer science;mathematics;discrete mathematics;chip	Theory	24.78733363040615	36.41894305039193	150483

It is shown by Cao and Yuen (1995) that if C(I (G) = 1 then G is a complete graph, and therefore Q(G) = n 1 and cc,(G) = 1 for 1 <i <n 1. We obtain similar results for graphs whose complement is bipartite. We show in particular, that if the complement of G is bipartite and there exists an integer k such that 1 <k <(n 1)/2 and Q(G) = 1 then cc,(G) = -1 for k < i < n k + 1. We also compare and discuss the relation between some properties of the Laplacian and the adjacency spectra of graphs. @ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The result is then extended to blocking sets with respect to k-dimensional subspaces and, at least when p>2, to intersections with arbitrary subspaces not just hyperplanes. This can also be used to characterize certain non-degenerate blocking sets in higher dimensions. Furthermore we determine the possible sizes of small minimal blocking sets with respect to k-dimensional subspaces. 2001 Academic Press	blocking (computing);modulo operation	Tamás Szonyi;Zsuzsa Weiner	2001	J.

Several interesting combinatorial properties have been studied such as the periodic behavior and the counting of distinct squares in partial words. In this paper, we extend the three-squares lemma on words to partial words with one hole. This result provides special information about the squares in a partial word with at most one hole, and puts restrictions on the positions at which periodic factors may occur, which is in contrast with the well known periodicity lemma of Fine and Wilf.	partial word;quasiperiodicity;social inequality;whole earth 'lectronic link;world wide web	Francine Blanchet-Sadri;Robert Mercas	2012	Theor.

e3668db3440c8e33e5a640ee6c4d10e2b044edf1	the evolution of electronic photography		"""Silver-based photography was invented in the mid-1800s, and has existed in its modem form for over 100 years. More than 60 million film cameras will be sold this year, a larger number than for any previous year. In spite of the explosion in digital technology for other applications, digital camera technology still produces images that arc vastly inferior to film images. Recent developments in silicon image sensors have made possible the direct capture of images that exceed the quality of film images. Over the next decade, cameras based on these principles will supplant film cameras in nearly all applications. In many ways, electronic photography has gone through evolutionary steps closely paralleling those experienced in the early days of film photography. The current leading-edge technology will be discussed, with referenced to its place in the evolutionary sequence. for over thirty years. His current focus and teachings arc in the area of VLSI design, ultra-concurrent systems, and physics of computation. Having pioneered in the fields of solid-state electronics and the management of complexity in the design of very large scale integrated circuits, he has been the leading force in the development of a design methodology for VLSI. This field has seen a merger of semiconductor and computer technologies. He has written and contributed to over 100 publications covering his wide rang~ of interests in solid-state physics, microelectronics, and biophysics. Holding a number of patents in these fields, he has written, with Lynn Conway, the standard text for VLSI design, """"Introduction to VLSI Systems"""" He has also had extensive experience as a consultant to industry."""	concurrency (computer science);conway's game of life;digital camera;digital electronics;digital photography;evolutionary algorithm;image sensor;integrated circuit;modem;physics of computation;semiconductor;solid-state electronics;very-large-scale integration	Carver Mead	2001			visual arts;computer vision;engineering;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	26.201768241286928	43.50693347352523	155355

[l], Domb [2]). The object of this theory is the calculus of a partition function given by an integral. Such an integral can be expanded as a sum of integrals and the coefficients of this sum are given by graph-theoretic combinatorial coefficients. Since these latter play a fundamental role for many interacting systems on a lattice (in this context ‘lattice’ means a regular geometric arrangement), the term ‘lattice constants’ has been introduced to denote them. To avoid confusion about the term ‘lattice’, in the following we shall call such coefficients (weak/strong)-constants. Two types of such constants have been introduced corresponding to the above problem: high temperature (weak) and low temperature (strong) constants. If g and G are two graphs, these coefficients are defined as follows (in the terminology used by Harary [3]): (a) Weak-constant (high temperature)=(g, G)=number of subgraphs of G isomorphic with g. (b) Strong-constant (low temperature) = [g, G] = number of induced subgraphs of G isomorphic with g. The matrix R, the entries of which are the weak constants Rii= (gi, gj) with gi and gj ranging over the set of all non-isomorphic graphs with n vertices, is called the ‘n-th order conversion matrix’. The theory of conversion matrices can be developed as follows: in the first stage a graph G can be seen as the set E of its edges; in the second stage we can consider the power set of E, P(E), the elements of which are obviously the subgraphs of G; in the third stage we can ‘reduce’ this power set by identifying the isomorphic subgraphs to obtain a new partially ordered set S(E).	coefficient;emoticon;frank harary;graph isomorphism;graph theory;induced subgraph;integral theory (ken wilber);interaction;partition function (mathematics);the matrix	L.

8fa83ae66eaae585eeb70700c08521b8801b504e	cartesian trees and lyndon trees		The article describes the structural and algorithmic relations between Cartesian trees and Lyndon Trees. This leads to a uniform presentation of the Lyndon table of a word corresponding to the Next Nearest Smaller table of a sequence of numbers. It shows how to efficiently compute runs, that is, maximal periodicities occurring in a word. 1 Cartesian and Lyndon trees The Cartesian tree, introduced by Vuillemin [15] is a binary tree associated with a sequence of numbers that label its nodes. It is both a heap, with the smallest element at the root, and the sequence is recovered during a symmetric traversal of the tree. Cartesian tree have a series of applications in addition to that introduced by Vuillemin [15] on two-dimensional images. To quote a few of them, they are used for range searching to implement range minimum queries in a sequence of numbers through the help of Lowest Common Ancestor queries in the Cartesian tree of the sequence [8]. They are also part of sorting methods that want to take advantage of partially sorted subsequences (see for example [12]). Lyndon trees are associated with Lyndon words, words that are lexicographically smaller than all their proper non-empty suffixes (see [13] and [2]). They also have several interesting algorithmic applications and attracted much interest in connection with the detection of runs (maximal periodicities) in words. The notion of Lyndon roots of runs, introduced for cubic runs in [5], has led to the property that there is linear number of square runs in a word. Originally conjectured by Kolpakov and Kucherov [11], it has eventually been proved by Bannai et al. [1]. They also show how to compute efficiently all the runs using implicitly the notion of Lyndon table (array), which is a side product of the Lyndon tree construction.

We shall make use of the terminology of van Kampen diagrams [L-S, p. 235ff]. We write AreaP (w) for the minimum number of faces (i.e 2-cells) in a van Kampen diagram with boundary label w. Equivalently, AreaP(w) is the minimum number of relators or inverses of relators occurring in all expressions of w as a product (in F ) of their conjugates. The function f : → is an isoperimetric function for P if, for all n and all words w with `(w) ≤ n and w =G 1, we have AreaP(w) ≤ f(n).

Motivated by the Fraenkel conjecture, we study in this paper whether two Christoffel words can be superimposed. Following from previous work on this conjecture using Beatty sequences, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the superimposition of two Christoffel words having same length, and more generally, of two arbitrary Christoffel words. Moreover, for any two superimposable Christoffel words, we give the number of different possible superimpositions and we prove that there exists a superimposition that works for any two superimposable Christoffel words. Finally, some new properties of Christoffel words are obtained as well as a geometric proof of a classic result concerning the money problem, using Christoffel words.

We call this problem Code Equivalence. Using techniques from the area of interactive proofs, we show on the one hand, that under the assumption that the polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse, Code Equivalence is not NP-complete. On the other hand, we present a polynomial-time reduction from the Graph Isomorphism problem to Code Equivalence.

0bff20428547edcb524dde0ec19ec4f4364e289c	attainable values of reset thresholds		An automaton is synchronizing if there exists a word that sends all states of the automaton to a single state. The reset threshold is the length of the shortest such word. We study the set RTn of attainable reset thresholds by automata with n states. Relying on constructions of digraphs with known local exponents we show that the intervals [ 1, (n2 − 3n+ 4)/2 ] and [(p− 1)(q− 1), p(q− 2) +n− q+ 1], where 2 ≤ p < q ≤ n, p+ q > n, gcd(p, q) = 1, belong to RTn, even if restrict our attention to strongly connected automata. Moreover, we prove that in this case the smallest value that does not belong to RTn is at least n2−O(n1.7625 logn/ log logn). This value is increased further assuming certain conjectures about the gaps between consecutive prime numbers. We also show that any value smaller than n(n−1) 2 is attainable by an automaton with a sink state and any value smaller than n2−O(n1.5) is attainable in general case. Furthermore, we solve the problem of existence of slowly synchronizing automata over an arbitrarily large alphabet, by presenting for every fixed size of the alphabet an infinite series of irreducibly synchronizing automata with the reset threshold n2 −O(n). 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.1.1 Models of Computation, G.2.2 Graph Theory	automaton;computation;graph theory;irreducibility;strongly connected component	Michalina Dzyga;Robert Ferens;Vladimir V.

Programs and techniques described there are updated in this paper. Improved coset definition strategies, space saving techniques and advice for obtaining improved performance are included. New coset definition strategies for Felsch-type methods give substantial reductions in total cosets defined for some pathological enumerations. Significant time savings are achieved for coset enumeration procedures in general. Statistics on performance are presented, both in terms of time and in terms of maximum and total cosets defined for selected enumerations.	coset enumeration;primary source	George Havas	1991		10.1145/120694.120723	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;group theory;algebra	DB	37.605139853672334	43.14688282384046	162562

The structures are normally represented by molecular graphs, where vertices are atoms and edges are chemical bonds. The degree of a vertex in the graph represents the valency of the corresponding atom. The problem can be extended to generating all sets of molecules that can result from a reaction. I have formulated this chemistry problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). As an initial representation of the problem, I represent each bond as a pair of variables. The atoms are represented by integers and connected by the bonds. The domain of each variable is all of the atoms in the problem. Each atom must appear a fixed number of times (its valency). For example, consider a problem that consists of two oxygens, two carbons and four hydrogens, i.e. eight atoms in three types. The number of bonds is half the sum of the atoms’ valencies. For the sample problem we need 8 bonds. It is easy to specify the valency constraint with help of the Ilog Solver constraint IloDistribute ,w hich restricts the appearance of variables that take a given value in an array. We believe this is the first constraint encoding of the problem. However, there are millions of symmetrical duplicates. Those symmetries are caused by the nature of the model and can be classified into three kinds: (i) the two atoms on each side of a bond can be swapped; (ii) as the bonds are represented by an array of undistinguished variables, permuting the assignments produces symmetrical solutions; (iii) for multiple atoms of the same element, swapping all of the assignments of one instance with assignments of the other produces symmetrical solutions. We use symmetry breaking constraints to increase solving speed and reduce the number of duplicate solutions. The first two symmetries can be broken by enforcing a lexicographical order 1,2 .T he third can be partially broken by giving the same value for all of the instances of an element with valency 1 (e.g. hydrogen) and increasing its valency. Future work will concentrate on breaking the remaining symmetry, and on extending to include more chemistry constraints.	constraint programming	Christine Wei Wu	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30201-8_87	mathematical optimization;constraint programming;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;chemical reaction;computer science;mathematics;chemical structure;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm	PL	33.369415648861484	38.93796397902744	162819

We show that this algorithm preserves the noncrossing property. This yields a simple explanation of an identity due to Simion-Ullman and Klazar in connection with enumeration problems on noncrossing partitions and RNA secondary structures. For ordinary noncrossing partitions, the reduction algorithm leads to a representation of noncrossing partitions in terms of independent arcs and loops, as well as an identity of Simion and Ullman which expresses the Narayana numbers in terms of the Catalan numbers.	sethi–ullman algorithm	William Y.

When enzyme sites are modeled by a random process, the number of solutions to DDP is known to increase exponentially as the length of DNA increases. However, the overwhelming majority of solutions are very similar and can be transformed into each other by simple transformations. Recently, Schmitt and Waterman [SW] introduced equivalence classes on the set of DDP solutions and raised an open problem to completely characterize equivalent physical maps. We study the combinatorics of multiple solutions and the cassette transformations of Schmitt and Waterman. We demonstrate that the solutions to DDP are closely associated with alternating Eulerian cycles in colored graphs and study order transformations of alternating cycles. We prove that every two alternating Eulerian cycles in a bicolored graph can be transformed into each other by means of order transformations. Using this result we obtain a complete characterization of equivalent physical maps in the Schmitt-Waterman problem. It also allows us to prove Ukkonen's conjecture on word transformations preservingq-gram composition.	compact cassette;computation;computational complexity theory;data-directed programming;differential dynamic programming;digest access authentication;eulerian path;map;schmitt trigger;smith–waterman algorithm;stochastic process;turing completeness	Pavel A.

We show that such structures induce graphs on n vertices, invariant up to complementation. Previous methods worked only for single Latin squares of even order and were harder to apply. If q is divisible by four the invariant graph is simple undirected. If q is two modulo four the graph is a tournament. When n = q + 1 is maximal, the array corresponds to an affine plane, and the vertex valencies of the graph have parity q/2 modulo two. We give the graphs at all possible points and lines for twenty-two planes of order sixteen. Four of the planes, none of them of translation or dual translation type, produce non-empty graphs at some points.	column (database);graph (discrete mathematics);maximal set;modulo operation	David G.

In the first part of the paper, we introduce the AlternatingDirection load balancing scheme, which reduces the number of load balance iterations by a factor of 2 for cartesian products of graphs. The resulting flow is theoretically analyzed and can be very high for certain cases. Therefore, we further present the Mixed-Direction scheme which needs the same number of iterations but computes in most cases a much smaller flow. In the second part of the paper, we present a simple optimal diffusion scheme for general graphs, calculating a balancing flow which is minimal in the (2 norm. It is based on the spectra of the graph representing the network and needs only m — 1 iterations to balance the load with m being the number of distinct eigenvalues. Known optimal diffusion schemes have the same performance, however the optimal scheme presented in this paper can be implemented in a very simple manner. The number of iterations of optimal diffusion schemes is independent of the load scenario and, thus, they are practical for networks which represent graphs with known spectra. Finally, our experiments exhibit that the new optimal scheme can successfully be combined with the Alternating-Direction and Mixed-Direction schemes for efficient load balancing on product graphs.	experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);iteration;load balancing (computing)	Robert Elsässer;Burkhard Monien;Robert Preis;Andreas Frommer	2004	Parallel Processing Letters	10.1142/S0129626404001714	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;parallel computing;computer science;load balancing;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;algorithm	Theory	24.75299891873375	35.47071338070436	165058

While there have been many suggested constructions for key predistribution schemes, a general understanding of the design principles on which to base such constructions is somewhat lacking. Indeed even the tools from which to develop such an understanding are currently limited, which results in many relatively ad hoc proposals in the research literature. It has been suggested that a large edge-expansion coefficient in the key graph is desirable for efficient key predistribution schemes. However, attempts to create key predistribution schemes from known expander graph constructions have only provided an extreme in the trade-off between connectivity and resilience: namely, they provide perfect resilience at the expense of substantially lower connectivity than can be achieved with the same key storage. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we prove that many existing key predistribution schemes produce key graphs with good expansion. This provides further support and justification for their use, and confirms the validity of expansion as a sound design principle. Second, we propose the use of incidence graphs and concurrence graphs as tools to represent, design and analyse key predistribution schemes. We show that these tools can lead to helpful insights and new constructions.	adjacency list;charles leonard hamblin;coefficient;graph theory;hoc (programming language);incidence matrix;optimality criterion;scientific literature;strongly regular graph	Michelle Kendall;Keith M.

d2f43bf91a88a48b3cc69a4ca6327cc9ade6441d	affine-invariant strictly cyclic steiner quadruple systems	ssqs;affine group;projective linear group;1-factor;2-chromatic sqs;recursive construction;optical orthogonal code;05b05;05c25;94b25	A Steiner quadruple system of order v, denoted by SQS(v), is a pair (V, B), where V is a finite set of v points, and B is a collection of 4-subsets of V , called blocks or quadruples, such that each 3-subset (triple) of V is contained in exactly one block in B. An automorphism group of SQS(v) is a permutation group on V leaving B invariant. An SQS(v) is said to be cyclic if it admits an automorphism consisting of a cycle of length v. And then, if the stabilizer of any block is trivial, the system is said to be strictly cyclic, denoted by sSQS(v). It is known that an sSQS(v) exists only if v ≡ 2, 10 (mod 24). But the sufficient existence condition of sSQS(v) is less known so far, all the known results are based on computer search and recursive constructions. Furthermore, let V = Z v , the residue ring modulo v, an sSQS admitting all the units of Z v as multipliers is called affine-invariant. The affine-invariant sSQS is only studied by Köhler (1979) in order to simplify the existence problem of sSQS. Köhler (1982) also considered constructions of affine-invariant 3-(p, 4, λ) designs, for prime p and putative λ > 1. Then, Brand (1993) generalized the constructions to these affine-invariant 3-designs with order of prime powers. All the previously mentioned constructions are depending on the existence of 1-factors of some graphs. In this talk, we denote V = Z 2p ∼ = Z p × Z 2 , where p ≡ 1, 5 (mod 12) is an odd prime. Thus, blocks can be classified into three types. By revisiting some properties of cross-ratio classes of projective geometries, we introduce a graph regarding the cross-ratio classes as vertices, and proves that the graph has a 1-factor, which implies the proper base blocks of the orbits can be obtained. To sum up, we present that, for any prime p ≡ 1, 5 (mod 12), an affine-invariant sSQS(2p) exists. By showing that the recursive construction for a specific class of sSQS by Feng et.al(2008) can be applied also in the case of our affine-invariant sSQS, we prove that, for any odd integer m, if each prime divisor p of m satisfies p ≡ 1, 5 (mod 12), then an sSQS(2m) exists.	matching (graph theory);modulo operation;quadruple-precision floating-point format;recursion;search algorithm;steiner tree problem	Xiao-Nan Lu;Masakazu Jimbo	2017	Des.

The computation simplifies in the case when G is a partial cube. The method developed is applied to two infinite families of fullerene patches.		Modjtaba Ghorbani;Sandi Klavzar	2016	Ars Math.

In particular, we obtain the chromatic polynomials of the line graphs of K 3, k   and K 4, k   or equivalently the total number of 3 ×  k  and 4 ×  k  Latin rectangles with entries from an  n -set.	chromatic polynomial	Krishna B.

More specifically, the paper bounds the average Hamming distance which is in turn proportional to the switching activity and the overall power dissipation of the system. By introducing the concepts of a distance matrix and a weight matrix, and by exploiting the symmetry of the distance matrix we are able to obtain bounds that are provably tighter and, as demonstrated by our experimental results, they can offer significant improvement over existing bounds. Since our bounds are independent of the state assignment and the actual implementation, they can be used at an early stage of the FSM design to indicate the largest/smallest possible power consumption.	distance matrix;finite-state machine;hamming distance	Eleftheria Athanasopoulou;Christoforos N.

We determine the spectrum of λ-times repeated blocks in a TS(υ,λ), leaving only one value in doubt for each  v ≡2( mod  12).

Until recently, the practical application of egress complexity was inhibited because of the very large repetitions of egress complexity values calculated purely on the basis of the number of each floorplan’s habitable compartments. To overcome this problem, it was decided to restrict the analysis to non-isomorphic floorplans thereby reducing many of the repetitions. In spite of this, as the number k of habitable compartments increased so did the repetitions of egress complexity values for each k, necessitating a procedure for their exhaustive generation. This paper shows how, both information theory and graph theory, have been used to develop an algorithm that produces the distributions of egress complexity values corresponding to comparable sets of non-isomorphic floorplans, each represented by a unique k-node rooted tree. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The subset of connecting nodes of G has been de ned as solid h-cover by Bermond, Fraigniaud and Peters, and center node set by Weng and Ventura. This article shows that the two concepts are equivalent. We also provide new properties for center node sets, including bounds on the minimum size of a center node set, show how to reduce the number of center nodes of a broadcast graph generated by a compound method, and propose an iterative compounding algorithm that generates the sparsest known broadcast graphs in many cases. ? 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In fact, a pair of linear models describing the behavior of the CCSGs can be derived. The algorithm that converts a given CCSG into a CA-based linear model is very simple and can be applied to CCSGs in a range of practical interest. The linearity of these cellular models can be advantageously used in two different ways: (a) for the analysis and/or cryptanalysis of the CCSGs and (b) for the reconstruction of the output sequence obtained from this kind of generators.	algorithm;automata theory;cellular automaton;cryptanalysis;emoticon;linear model;linear-feedback shift register;nonlinear system	Amparo Fúster-Sabater;Dolores de la Guía-Martínez	2010	CoRR	10.1016/j.apm.2005.08.013	cellular automaton;cryptanalysis;discrete mathematics;cellular model;cryptography;theoretical computer science;linear model;mathematics;shift register;linearity;algorithm	Crypto	37.298355891528836	45.49870400385279	175125

The set S is a dominating set of G if every vertex in V \S is adjacent to some vertex in S. The set S is a secure dominating set of G if for each u ∈ V \S, there exists a vertex v ∈ S such that uv ∈ E and (S\{v})∪{u} is a dominating set of G. The set S is a restrained dominating set if every vertex in V \S is adjacent to a vertex in S and to a vertex in V \S. A set S ⊆ V (G) is called a secure restrained dominating set (SRDS) of G if S is restrained dominating and for all u ∈ V \S there exists v ∈ S ∩ N (u) such that (S\{v}) ∪ {u} is restrained dominating. The minimum cardinality of a SRDS is called the secure restrained domination number of G and is denoted by γsr (G). In this paper we study few properties of secure restrained domination number on certain classes of graphs and we evaluate γsr (G) values for trees, unicyclic graphs, split graphs and generalized Petersen graphs.	edge dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);international symposium on reliable distributed systems;julius petersen;pseudoforest	P.

f13275d31f128a32cdcbb7f8dfd8c69a1b22ba2c	review of ordered sets: an introduction	ordered set	conjecture was finally proved shortly after the publication of this book[1]. Packing and covering properties of various clutters including two–commodity flows, r–cuts and r–arborescences, T–cuts and T–joins, and odd cycles are the subject of chapters one through five of the book. In chapters six and seven, the approach is extended to balanced and totally unimodular matrices with 0, 1, and -1 entries. In chapters eight, nine, and ten, Cornuéjols discusses decompositions of matroids, balanced matrices, and perfect graphs. The book is written in very dense definition–theorem–proof style, with relatively little motivation. Although a number of exercises are scattered throughout the book, the style of presentation makes this book unsuitable for use as an introduction to the topic. Readers looking for an applications oriented introduction to this material will find an excellent one in the combinatorial optimization textbook by Nemhauser and Wolsey[2]. Cornuéjols book can be recommended as an authoritative reference for graduate students and researchers working in this area. However, it is already beginning to be outdated by new developments. The author offered a prize of $5,000 for each of eighteen conjectures. Including the proof of the strong perfect graph conjecture, five of these eighteen conjectures have now been solved. An updated edition would be welcome.	combinatorial optimization;mathematical optimization;matroid;set packing;strong perfect graph theorem;transformation matrix;unimodular polynomial matrix	Bernd S.

The chordless cycles which comprise this irreducible core effectively characterize the connectivity structure of the network as a whole. By counting the number of cycles of length 3 ≤ k ≤ max_length, we can also create a kind of signature that can be used to identify the network. Its longest chordless cycles can be used to redraw the network and visually reveal its global connectivity patterns. Performance is analyzed, and the concepts we develop are illustrated by means of a relatively small running sample network of about 400 nodes.	algorithm;dendritic spine;depth-first search;digital signature;existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);irreducibility;logical connective;matroid	John L.

A (0, 1) matrix M is said to have F as a configuration if there is a submatrix of M which is a row and column permutation of F . We say that a matrix M is simple if it has no repeated columns. For a given v ∈ N, we shall denote by forb(v, F) the maximum number of columns in a simple (0, 1) matrix with v rows for which F does not occur as a configuration. We say that a matrix M is maximal for F if M has forb(v, F) columns. In this paper we show that for certain natural choices of F , forb(v, F) ≤ ( v t) t+1 .

This conjecture was first proved by Yan, Qin, Jin and Zhou, then subsequently by Zaleski and Zeilberger. Since the formula for the number of such core partitions is so simple one can hope for a bijective proof. We give the first direct bijective proof of this fact by establishing a bijection between the set of (s, s+2)-core partitions with distinct parts and a set of lattice paths.

The polynomial π(G, x ) = per (xI − A (G )) is called the permanental polynomial of G , and the permanental sum of G is the summation of the absolute values of the coefficients of π ( G , x ). In this paper, we investigate properties of permanental sum of a graph, prove recursive formulas to compute the permanental sum of a graph, and show that the ordering of graphs with respect to permanental sum. Furthermore, we determine the upper and lower bounds of permanental sum of unicyclic graphs, and the corresponding extremal unicyclic graphs are also determined. © 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.	adjacency matrix;coefficient;polynomial;pseudoforest;recursion	Tingzeng Wu;Hong-Jian Lai	2018	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2018.03.026	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;adjacency matrix;mathematics;recursion;upper and lower bounds;graph;absolute value;polynomial	Theory	30.218531955065906	33.84125663879778	177248

d3ec62834524352fa2a02ea250f343dba9edafe7	controllability analysis of threshold graphs and cographs		In this paper, we investigate the controllability of a linear time-invariant network following a Laplacian dynamics defined on a threshold graph. In this direction, by considering the modal matrix associated with the Laplacian matrix for this class of graphs and based on the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus criteria, a procedure for the selection of control nodes is proposed. The procedure involves partitioning the nodes of the graph into cells with the same degree; one node from each cell is then selected. We show that the remaining nodes can be chosen as the control nodes, rendering the network controllable. Finally, we consider a wider class of graphs, namely cographs, and examine their controllability properties.	anatomic node;cograph;graph - visual representation;laplacian matrix;linear time-invariant theory;modal logic;rendering (computer graphics);time complexity;time-invariant system;vitold belevitch	Shima Sadat Mousavi;Mohammad Haeri;Mehran Mesbahi	2018	2018 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.23919/ECC.2018.8550153	rendering (computer graphics);mathematics;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;controllability;laplacian matrix;network topology;threshold graph;modal matrix;laplace operator;graph	Robotics	29.19036908558975	37.721890262434194	177301

In the K -degrees of infinite binary sequences, X is below Y if the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of the first n bits of X is less than the complexity of the first n bits of Y , for each n. Identifying infinite binary sequences with subsets of N, we study the K -degrees of arithmetical sets and explore the interactions between arithmetical definability and prefixfree Kolmogorov complexity. We show that in the K -degrees, for each n > 1, there exists a Σ0 n non-zero degree which does not bound any ∆n non-zero degree. An application of this result is that in the K -degrees there exists a Σ0 2 degree which forms a minimal pair with all Σ 0 1 degrees. This extends the work of Csima and Montalbán (2006) [8] and Merkle and Stephan (2007) [17]. Our main result is that, given any ∆2 family C of sequences, there is a ∆ 0 2 sequence of non-trivial initial segment complexity which is not larger than the initial segment complexity of any non-trivial member of C. This general theorem has the following surprising consequence. There is a 0-computable sequence of non-trivial initial segment complexity, which is not larger than the initial segment complexity of any non-trivial computably enumerable set. Our analysis and results demonstrate that, examining the extend to which arithmetical definability interacts with the K reducibility (and in general any ‘weak reducibility’) is a fruitful way of studying the induced structure. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This problem can, for example, be attacked using the transfer matrix method (see [20, Section 4.7]). In particular, it is a well-known fact that the generating function of such words is always rational. For example, in [20, Example 4.7.5] it is shown that the generating function for the number of words in [3]n where neither 11 nor 23 appear as two consecutive digits is given by 3+x−x2 1−2x−x2 +x3 . In this paper, we present, in several cases, a complete solution for the problem of the enumeration of words containing asubword pattern(see below for the precise definition) of length l exactlyr times. For example, we find the number of words in [3]n containing the subword pattern 111 exactly r times, that is, the number of words which contain 111, 222, and 333 as substrings a total of r times. Régnier and Szpankowski [18] used a combinatorial approach to study the frequency of occurrences of strings (which they also called a “pattern”) from a given set in a random word, when overlapping copies of the “patterns” are counted separately (see [18, Theorem 2.1]). We note that the term “pattern” in [18] is used to denote an exact string rather than its type with respect to order isomorphism. For example, the “pattern” 112 in [18] is the actual string 112, whereas in our setting an occurrence of the subword pattern 112 is any substringaabof the ambient string witha< b. Although, in principle, it is possible to deduce our results from the result by R égnier and Szpankowski, our direct derivations are much simpler.	matrix method;substring;transfer matrix	Alexander Burstein;Toufik Mansour	2003	Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science		generating function;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	36.65103100263192	36.28575615789599	178262

26290795066ad7dfa4e252d80688a544229b6f6f	on the assignment complexity of uniform trees	assignment problem;system design	This paper discusses the assignment complexity of the uniform tree, which is made up of identical cells realizimlg a function ~. Theassignment complexity ofatreeis defined as the cardinal number of the minimum complete assignment set of the tree. When a complete assignment set is applied to the primary input lines of the tree, every internal ~ cell in the tree can be excited by all possible input combinations. The assignment problem is a basic problem in the VLSI system design, test and optimization. The relation between the property of j and the assignment complexity of the uniform tree is anidyzed. It is shown that the assignment complexity of a balanced uniform tree with n primary input lines is either O(1) or fl((lg n)a) (a G (O, l]). In the first case, the cardinal number of the minimum complete assignment set for a tree is constant and independent of the size and structure of the tree, In the second case, the assignment complexity depends cm the number of the primary input lines of the tree. If a balanced uniform tree is based on a commut ative function, then it is either ~(1.) or ~(lg n) assignable.	assignment problem;mathematical optimization;systems design;very-large-scale integration	Hongzhong Wu	1993		10.1145/164081.164100	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear bottleneck assignment problem;generalized assignment problem;mathematics;assignment problem;weapon target assignment problem;quadratic assignment problem;systems design	Theory	28.64756216356095	41.77279912706053	178620

We report on some new ideas to calculate the group of automorphisms of a lattice with a positive definite quadratic form, which lead to an improvement of an algorithm described in [PlP 85] and [Sou 91]. To illustrate the reach of the algorithm e.g. 2 matrices generating the automorphism group of the Leech lattice can be calculated in less than 3 hours on a HP 9000/730 workstation. Moreover, the automorphism group of the densest known lattice Q32 in dimension 32 (cf. [Que 84]) is for the first time determined in this paper. The algorithm has successfully been used in various situation cf. for instance [Sch 92], [PlN 93], [PlP 93], or [Sou 94].	algorithm;graph automorphism;pl/p;workstation	Wilhelm Plesken;Bernd Souvignier	1997	J.

An r -labeling f : X → {1, 2, . . . , r} of X is distinguishing (with respect to Γ ) if the only label preserving permutation of X in Γ is the identity. The distinguishing number, DΓ (X), of the action of Γ on X is the minimum r for which there is an r -labeling which is distinguishing. This paper investigates the relation between the cardinality of a set X and the distinguishing numbers of group actions on X . For a positive integer n, let D(n) be the set of distinguishing numbers of transitive group actions on a set X of cardinality n, i.e., D(n) = {DΓ (X) : |X | = n and Γ acts transitively on X}. We prove that |D(n)| = O( √ n). Then we consider the problem of an arbitrary fixed group Γ acting on a large set. We prove that if for any action of Γ on a set Y , for each proper normal subgroup H of Γ , DH (Y ) ≤ 2, then there is an integer n such that for any set X with |X | ≥ n, for any action of Γ on X with no fixed points, DΓ (X) ≤ 2. c © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

15818a54ac04e1344fbc26da76b2e03fec29f309	testing word-sized numbers for primality	random numbers	Modular based algorithms, such as those used to compute GCDs, generally require a supply of word-sized primes. Such primes can, of course, be provided statically: it is easy to precompute and store a list of a dozen or so suitable numbers. It nevertheless seems attractive to generate them randomly, for instance by considering a sequence of random numbers until one of them is found to be prime. This strategy leads to a consideration of the cost of testing if a number is composite. This cost clearly depends on the typical size of numbers being used. For use with the arithmetic package I have, it is convenient to use a modulus in the range 2**23 to 2**24, and so the remarks and timings given here are relevant to that range.	algorithm;modulus robot;primality test;random number generation;randomness	Arthur C.

An almost parallel class with deficiency x is a set of directed k-cycles which form a partition of S \ {x}. An almost resolvable directed k-cyclc system is a directed k-cyclc system in which the cycles can be partitioned into almost parallel classes. It is clear that n == 1 (mod k) is a necessary condition for the existence of such a system. It is well known that for k 3 and 4 the necessary condition is also sufficient. In this paper, we shall introduce a special kind of skew Room frames and discuss their constructions. As an application, we show that an almost resolvable directed 5-cycle system of order n exists if and only ifn 1 (mod 5 ).	angular defect;directed graph;modulo operation	Gennian Ge;Lie Zhu	1995	Australasian J.

Let d(vi) denote the vertex degree of vi and denote the maximum vertex degree of G. Let A(G) be the adjacency matrix of G. Since A(G) is a real symmetric matrix, its eigenvalues must be real, and may be ordered as λ1(G) ≥ λ2(G) ≥ · · · ≥ λn(G). The sequence of n eigenvalues is called the spectrum of G, the largest eigenvalue λ1(G) is often called the spectral radius of G. The characteristic polynomial of A(G) is called the characteristic polynomial of the graph G and is denoted by φ(G, λ). A T-shape T (l1, l2, l3) is a tree with exactly one of its vertices having maximal degree 3 such that T (l1, l2, l3) − v = Pl1 ∪ Pl2 ∪ Pl3 , where Pli is the path on li(i = 1, 2, 3)vertices, and v is the vertex of degree 3. A H-shape is a tree with exactly two of its vertices having maximal degree 3.

Then a Steiner triple system, S, is a collections of 3-subsets chosen from S in such a way that each pair of distinct elements x, yES occurs in precisely one 3-subset. The 3-subsets are called the blocks of S. The order of the Steiner triple system is v, the size of the set S. It has been shown that necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Steiner triple system is that v == 1 or 3(mod6). Simple counting arguments show that; each element must occur in v 2 1 blocks, and the Steiner triple system is made up of v(v ; 1) blocks. A Steiner triple system n is said t.o be a subsystem of S if, R ~ S and the blocks of n are also blocks of S. If we take the underlying set S of a Steiner triple system, then we ca.n define a binary operation based on the incidence of t.he elements within the blocks of the design. The binary operation can be defined in such a way that the corresponding algebra forms a commutative idempotent quasigroup called a squag. These systems a.re discussed in [2] pp.3-4. However if we adjoin a neutral element to S, every Steiner triple system can be co-ordinatised in terms of a commutative loop, called a sloop. It is know that a Steiner triple system. on 7 points is a projective plane. The corresponding sloop forms a group, (see [2J pp.19), and hence is associative. Not all sloops a.re associative and so we define the centre of a sloop to be the set of elements which associate with elements x, y, for all x, y of the sloop. We show that a sloop …	idempotence;incidence matrix;operator associativity;steiner tree problem	Diane Donovan	1990	Australasian J. Combinatorics			Theory	36.97603110859518	33.29218039348369	179731

This comment presents an extra step required to route an Omega + Omega network. Index Terms —Multistage interconnection network, MIN, Omega network, rearrangeably nonblocking, perfect shuffle, routing, interconnection. ———————— ✦ ———————— THE original paper presents a new routing algorithm for a class of rearrangeably nonblocking interconnection networks. Given a desired one-to-one interconnection pattern Π, this efficient algorithm requires O(N) routing steps to set the network switches, and can be applied to any symmetric network layout (symmetric about a virtual center line at the center stage). The Omega × Omega is an example of such a network, where Omega is a reverse Omega network and is connected to another Omega network by a butterfly pattern (denoted by the “×”). The authors further claim that the algorithm can be applied to an asymmetric network as the Omega + Omega network (the concatenation of two Omega networks). It is proven (Theorem 1) in the paper that an N × N 2 log2 N-stage asymmetric Omega + Omega network can always be converted into a symmetric N × N 2 log2 N-stage Omega -1 × Omega network, through a bit-reversed-order rearrangement of the switching elements (SE) of the first Omega network (first log2 N stages). Therefore, the authors suggest that to route an Omega + Omega network, a conversion to an Omega × Omega network be applied, on which the routing algorithm is performed, and then convert the SE settings back to the Omega + Omega network. Carrying out this procedure will not fulfill the desired interconnection pattern, unless an extra step is taken. The inability of the procedure to properly determine the SE’s settings arise from the connection between the first SE stage and the input terminals. Two factors have to be compensated for in the conversion, which are: 1) The conversion method of the Omega + Omega network to an Omega × Omega network requires rearranging the SEs in each stage of the first Omega network (log2 N stages). The input terminals to the network are not rearranged in a similar fashion. Executing the routing algorithm on the Omega × Omega network with the desired interconnection patterns completely routes the Omega × Omega network, but the results can not be converted back to the Omega + Omega network, since the input terminals are not in sequential order any more. 2) The topology of an Omega network dictates a perfect shuffle before the first SE array. Once again, the switch settings can not be converted back to the Omega + Omega network, as the input terminals were shuffled. Correcting these problems is relatively simple. Since the input terminals to the converted Omega × Omega network are both permuted by a perfect shuffle and rearranged according to the SE relocation, we shall define a new interconnection pattern that compensates for these two effects. An input index bn-1bn-2 ... b1b0 (where n = log2 N) is shuffled bn-2 ... b1b0bn-1 (bit rotation to the left) and rearranged according to the SE relocation b0b1 ... bn-2bn-1 (bit reversal of the leftmost n 1 bits), which is equivalent to a bit reversal operation on the input index, before entering the Omega × Omega network. Therefore the desired interconnection assignment in the Omega + Omega network, Π(bn-1bn-2 ... b1b0) = j (where j is the output terminal), is equivalent to the assignment Π¢(b0b1 ... bn-2bn-1) = j in the Omega -1 × Omega network. Routing of an Omega + Omega network is now achieved. For a desired interconnection pattern Π, convert the network to an Omega × Omega topology, execute the routing algorithm with the permuted interconnection pattern Π′, and convert the switch settings back to the Omega + Omega network. The connection pattern achieved is the desired pattern Π. For the desired interconnection assignment given in the original paper, the SE settings are shown in Fig. 1. A similar analysis can be carried out for a conversion of the Omega + Omega network into an Omega × Omega network (a symmetric network as well). This time the desired pattern Π would have to be modified on the output side by permuting the destination terminal by a bit reversal of the leftmost n 1 bits.

Using this result, further Hamiltonian properties of the square of blocks were proved in [4] : the square of any block is Hamiltonian connected and 1-Hamiltonian. A proof of the theorem, from which three abovementioned assertions immediately follow, is given in the present paper. The proof is simultaneously much shorter than the original one by Fleischner. We will use the common terminology and the following notions: Let G be a graph, x a vertex of G, p a path in G*, and e = (u, u > and edge of p. If e E E(G*) E(G) and there exist edges {x, u> and (x, u} in G, then it will be said that the edge e and the path p use the vertex x. It will also be said that p is an x-Hamiltonian path in G* if p includes all vertices of G except the vertex x and both its end-vertices are adjacent to x in G. Let C be a circuit of G. A vertex of C will be called C-bound if all its neighbours are among the vertices of the circuit C.	emoticon;existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);hamiltonian path;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Stanislav Riha	1991	J.

We show that the family of n nodes double loops having chord length below min[n/4, q5(n)/2) has the AdAm property, answering partially a long-standing conjecture. We also give a simpler proof of the fact that all circulant graphs with a prime number of nodes have the Ad&m property.	circulant matrix	Bruce E. Litow;Bernard Mans	1998	Inf. Process.

2e141d66350e910daf1c79c37774a29b41565aa6	subassembly stability		Planning a product assembly requires that we determine the order in which the product subparts are to be assembled. One constraint on this ordering is that the subassembly must be stable at each stage under the gravitational force and the insertion force of the next part to be assembled. In this paper, we discuss the stability problem for the case where the subassembly sits on a table. A program has been written to solve this problem for a class of subassemblies. The input to the program consists of a model of the subparts and their interconnections, and a set of external insertion forces. The program tests whether the total disturbance force is contained in the set of all stable forces between each subpart and the table. A linearized model of friction in six dimensions is used in the computation.	computation	Nico Boneschanscher;Hans van der Drift;Stephen J. Buckley;Russell H.

bfdf2aec0b5a1fe0ae6bce9d4731476cb347355b	alignment-free sequence comparison using absent words		Sequence comparison is a prerequisite to virtually all comparative genomic analyses. It is often realised by sequence alignment techniques, which are computationally expensive. This has led to increased research into alignment-free techniques, which are based on measures referring to the composition of sequences in terms of their constituent patterns. These measures, such as q-gram distance, are usually computed in time linear with respect to the length of the sequences. In this paper, we focus on the complementary idea: how two sequences can be efficiently compared based on information that does not occur in the sequences. A word is an absent word of some sequence if it does not occur in the sequence. An absent word is minimal if all its proper factors occur in the sequence. Here we present the first linear-time and linear-space algorithm to compare two sequences by considering all their minimal absent words. In the process, we present results of combinatorial interest, and also extend the proposed techniques to compare circular sequences. We also present an algorithm that, given a word x of length n, computes the largest integer for which all factors of x of that length occur in some minimal absent word of x in time and space O(n). Finally, we show that the known asymptotic upper bound on the number of minimal absent words of a word is tight.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;hilbert space;n-gram;sequence alignment;time complexity	Panagiotis Charalampopoulos;Maxime Crochemore;Gabriele Fici;Robert Mercas;Solon P.

be035d181f2883daefd5a99ef4b6ec8eca47e8a7	the quasi-wiener and the kirchhoff indices coincide		In 1993 two novel distance-based topological indices were put forward. In the case of acyclic molecular graphs both are equal to the Wiener index, but both differ from it if the graphs contain cycles. One index is defined (Mohar, B.; Babic ́, D.; Trinajstić, N. J. Chem. Inf. Comput . Sci. 1993, 33, 153-154) in terms of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, whereas the other is conceived (Klein, D. J.; Randic ́, M. J. Math. Chem. 1993, 12, 81-95) as the sum of resistances between all pairs of vertices, assuming that the molecule corresponds to an electrical network, in which the resistance between adjacent vertices is unity. Eventually, the former quantity was named quasi-Wiener index and the latter Kirchhoff index. We now demonstrate that the quasi-Wiener and Kirchhoff indices of all graphs coincide.	directed acyclic graph;kirchhoff's circuit laws;kirchhoff's theorem;laplacian matrix;molecular graph;neighbourhood (graph theory);resistance distance;topological index;wiener index;zentralblatt math	Ivan Gutman;Bojan Mohar	1996	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci960007t	resistance distance;combinatorics;electrical network;laplacian matrix;wiener index;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;vertex (geometry);graph;mathematics	Theory	29.65174130991267	35.529106184186794	187142

The results obtained thus far deal with such problems on Euclidean lattices, on which their asymptotic nature already reveals that the crucial issue is the large scale behavior of such lattices. Here we investigate how such results have to be amended on a class of graphs, referred to as Gromov hyperbolic, which behave in the large scale as negatively curved Riemannian manifolds. It is argued that Gromov hyperbolic graphs occur quite naturally in many situations. Among the results developed here, we will mention the nonvanishing probability of escape of a random walk to a Cantor set Gromov boundary and the facts that the space localization error of sensors networked in a Gromov hyperbolic fashion grows linearly with the distance to a sensor whose geographical position is known, but would become uniformly bounded in an idealized situation in which the geographical locations of the nodes at the Gromov boundary are known.	asymptote;cantor set;graph (discrete mathematics);sensor;transmission coefficient	Edmond A.

For example, when determining the amount of time used by an algorithm, one may be interested in the sequence T(1), T(2), T(3), . . . . where T(n) is the amount of time used on an input of size n. Such a sequence can also arise even if we are considering input of a fixed size; for example, if we are analyzing the average amount of time used by a sorting algorithm we might be interested in a sequence p0, pl, p', . . . . , where p~ is the probability that the algorithm makes i comparisons during the sort. Sometimes instead of knowing a closed-form expression for the nth term in a sequence, we have a recurrence relation, which is an equation that expresses the nth term of a sequence as a function of previous terms. (Recurrence relations are sometimes called difference equations.) Consider, for example, the problem of determining the number of comparisons used by Mergesort; it can be viewed as a recursive sorting algorithm that splits the input list of n numbers into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the results (using at most n 1 comparisons) to yield the final sorted output [AHo74, Chap. 2]. Assuming n is a power of two, an upper bound T(n) on the number of comparisons used by this algorithm to sort n numbers is given by	challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer science;merge sort;power of two;recurrence relation;recursion;sorting algorithm	George S.

This problem was negatively solved by Fermat in the 17th century, who used the wonderful method (ipse dixit Fermat) of infinite descent. This method, which is, historically, the first use of induction, consists in producing smaller and smaller non-negative integer solutions assuming that one exists; this naturally leads to a reductio ad absurdum reasoning because we are bounded by zero. We describe the formalization of this proof which has been carried out in the Coq proof assistant. Moreover, as a direct and no less historical application, we also provide the proof (by Fermat) of Fermat’s last theorem for n = 4, as well as the corresponding formalization made in Coq.	coq (software);existential quantification;fermat;mathematical induction;proof assistant	David Delahaye;Micaela Mayero	2005	CoRR		wieferich prime;number theory;proof by infinite descent;proofs of fermat's theorem on sums of two squares;computer science;proofs of fermat's little theorem;pure mathematics;fermat number;mathematics;fermat's little theorem;wiles' proof of fermat's last theorem;algorithm;fermat's theorem on sums of two squares	Logic	38.91060066921545	38.50571784471773	190919

The size of a guillotine partition is the number of boxes it contains. Two guillotine partitions are box-equivalent if their boxes satisfy compatible order relations with respect to the axes. (In many works, box-equivalent guillotine partitions are considered identical.) In the present work we define cut-equivalence of guillotine partitions, derived in a similar way from order relations of cuts. We prove structural properties related to these kinds of equivalence, and enumerate cut-equivalence classes of d-dimensional guillotine partitions of size n.

73cf7ff11b8ffd57a9866792fc3ef7eb28d77cd1	minimization of pseudo-boolean functions by binary development	pseudo boolean	"""An lteratlve method for zero-one minimization of integer polynomials, hnear m each variable, is outhned. It Js based on Camlon's method of binary developments with computations using multlphcatlon and sum mod 2. The method is straightforward, does not requtre any branching or solving of mequahtles, but, as with any Boolean method, may revolve storage and retneval problems. A general formula Is derived which may serve as a basis for a more direct approach. 1. Introduct ion and preliminaries In this paper a method for zero-one minimization of an integer polynomial, linear in each variable, is presented. It is an extension of Camion's ideas [ 1 ] based on binary developments and on computat ions in GF(2) (basic operations in (0, 1 } are sum mod 2, multiplication, and the constant 1). The method is iterative, does not require any branching or solution of inequalities, but, as with any Boolean method, may involve storage and retrieval problems. To avoid this as much as possible, a more direct approach is briefly outlined. It is based on a general formula which is of a certain interest in itself. In the direct approach, we would need an effective algorithm for special """"covering"""" problems which so far have not been studied. At this initial stage no computational results are available. Since at present there are only few minimization methods [3] , it seems that this somewhat unconventional path should be explored. Let B = (0, 1 }. A function f (x I , . . . , x n) with variables and values in B is called a Boo lean f u n c t i o n . A function f ( x 1 . . . . . x n ) with variables in B and real values is called a p s e u d o B o o l e a n f u n c t i o n (p.-B.f.). Sometimes we will denote f ( x I . . . . . x n ) simply by f o r f x . A surprisingly large class of problems in operational research, graph theory and combinatorics can be reduced to the following problem: 152 L G. Rosenberg, Mimmization of pseudo-Boolean functions Find the set ~2f of all points in B n where a given p.-B.f, f x takes its minimum value (here B n is the set of all (al . . . . . a n ) with a i = O, 1). This problem is called the minimization of a p.-B.f. An extensive survey of the results concerning this problem can be found in [3]. It is proved in [3, p. 22] that for every p.-B. function there are two real polynomials (1) g = ~ Cr ~D xt ' h = ~ c r ~_ErXt rEM t r r~P t (where c r are real positive numbers and both D r (r ~ M ) and E r (r ~ P) are distinct subsets of ( 1, ..., 17)) such that g h agrees with f on B n . One of the sets D r or E r in (1) can be 0: by usual convention the corresponding product is 1. Example. the disjunction x 1 v x 2 and negation Y are interpolated by x 1 + x 2 X l X 2 and 1 -x , respectively. In applications, the p.-B.f.'s usually take on only rational values. Thus for minimization purposes, we can assume that all c r are integers. I f f takes on negative values, we consider the function f k , where k is a lower bound for the values o f f ( e . g , we can choose k = F-,r~ e Cr). Obviously, the points of minimum value o f f k are precisly the points of minimum value o f f . Noting that f k takes only non-negative values, we will assume throughout that f is a non-negative p.-B.f, whose interpolation (1) has integer coefficients. 2. Binary development and approximations Let 2 p be a strict upper bound for f . It is easy to see that there exist Boolean functions f / ( x 1 . . . . . x n ) such that (2) f = v ~ l 21ft • /=0 The functions f / a r e uniquely determined and (2) will be called the b inary d e v e l o p m e n t o f f . The determination o f f /w i l l be discussed in Sections 3 6 . Assume that we have already determined all f/. The set ~ f can be obtained as follows. For any Boolean function g, set S(g ) = g 1 ( 1 ) = ( x ~ B n : g x = 1 ) . Further let O n and 1 n be the constant Boolean functions of n variables equal to 0 and 1, respectively. Let ~0 be the characteristic function of 3. Binary development by Boolean polynomials 153 ~2/(I.e., ¢0 is the Boolean function satisfying S(¢ °) = ~ f ) and let m be the minimum value o f f on B n . Starting with ~bp = In, we will construct """"approximations"""" CP, ¢P1 ..... q~l of ~0 such that (3) x ~ S((~') c, f x m < 2' ( i = 0 ..... p ) . For this we set q~P = 1 n"""" If ~b' (p >_ l > O) has been already constructed, we set ~i J~-I if t~ i ~i-1 ~ On ' q~i-I ={ ~b i if q~' ~_ 1 = On """" We have the following: Proposition 2.1. T h e B o o l e a n f u n c t i o n s 49' s a t i s f y (3) a n d B n = S(qb p ) = ... = S((p, 1 +1) D S(q~ q ) = ... = S((p i t+l ) D S(~) i t) = ... = S(dp O) = ~2f . M o r e o v e r , t (4) m = 2 p I ~ 29. /=1 Proof. By definition, S(¢ '+1 ) R S(~b'). Now S(q~ '+1 ) = S(~b') if and only i f ¢ ~+1 ~ = O n , i.e. S(q~ '+1 ) ~ S ~ ) . But this means that on the whole S(4),+ 1 ) the function f, takes on the value 1 only. In this case, we have no change. Also S(q~ i+l ) 3 S(¢') <, ¢,+1 j~ 4: O n ¢, there are x ~ S(dpi+l ), where f~x = 0; and S(¢ z) consists precisely of all such x. Hence the approximations q~' are designed so that the values o f f on S(¢') are the best possible if we manipulate only f p _ 1 . . . . . f z . T h e other assertions follow easily from this observation. 3. Binary development by Boolean polynomials We need a method for the binary development (2). For this we will now determine the binary development of g. Let N = {0,1,.... }. Introducing the binary developments of all c r in the expression for g in (1), we get (5) g = ~ 2 k ~ X k r , k E N r E M k 154 1. G. Rosenberg, Mmimization o f pseudo-Boolean functzons where Xkr = r I s ~ D k r X s , Dg r ~ (1 ... . . n}, and only a finite n u mb e r of the index sets M k are n o n e m p t y . Note tha t Xkr takes on values in B = (0,1 } only and therefore can be considered as a Boolean variable. Example 3.1. Let g = 14 + 2x 1 + 3x2 + 3x2x4 + 9 x 4 x 5 • Then g can be expressed as follows: g = (x 2 +X2X 4 +X4X 5 ) + 2(1 +X X +X2 +X2X4)+4(1 )+ 8(1 +X4X 5 ). We will base the binary development of (5) on Boolean polynomials . The Boolean func t ion """" sum mod 2"""" is )?,ix ~ = x I ~-... S x t which is equal to 1 if and only i f x 1 + """"'"""" + XI is odd. It is well k n o w n tha t ~is an associative and commuta t ive opera t ion satisfying x ~0 = x, x -i-x = 0 and x (y $ z) = x y $ y z for any x, y, z ~ B. An expression o f the form E'Ae r I I ~ A Xi (where T is a system o f subsets o f ( 1, ..., n )) will be called a Boolean polynomtal . It is well known that any Boolean func t ion can be represented as a Boolean polynomial . This representa t ion is unique up to order provided that the corresponding set T consists o f dist inct subsets (e.g., 2 = 1 -ix a n d x 1 v x 2 = x 1 -i'X 2 +XIX2). We will adopt the fol lowing nota t ion . For any set M and integer t, let M t be the family o f all subsets of M with precisely t elements, and let (6) ( i ] ' = Z; 1-I x,.. A E M t rEA Example 3.2. L e t M = (1,2,3} and let X 1 =x2, X 2 =X2X 4 and X 3 = x 4 x 5 . Then [M] 1 =XI -i-X 2 JrX 3 =x 2 +x2x 4 J rX4X 5 , [M]2 =XlX2._i_X 1x 3 J c .

It was proved in [ 1, p. 259] tha t 3. Binary development by Boolean polynomials (7) G xi = 2 l [Mlzl . tEM I~N 155 Using (7) we can construct step by step the binary development ofg .

For k = 3, we get standard Wiener polarity index. Furthermore, we generalize the terminal Wiener index TWk(G) as the sum of distances between all pairs of vertices of degree k. For k = 1, we get standard terminal Wiener index. In this paper we describe a linear time algorithm for computing these indices for trees and partial cubes, and characterize extremal trees maximizing the generalized Wiener polarity index and generalized terminal Wiener index among all trees of given order n.	algorithm;emoticon;olap cube;partial cube;protein structure prediction;time complexity;wiener connector;wiener index	Aleksandar Ilic;Milovan Ilic	2013	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-012-1215-6	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;wiener index;classical wiener space;molecule;mathematics	Theory	29.77709580461294	35.85427736492451	192950

54bcee2d09bbdff8b738f117cc7b98f83fb0e12a	new conjectures for union-closed families	frankl conjecture;union closed families;integer programming	The Frankl conjecture, also known as the union-closed sets conjecture, states that in any finite non-empty union-closed family, there exists an element in at least half of the sets. From an optimization point of view, one could instead prove that 2a is an upper bound to the number of sets in a union-closed family on a ground set of n elements where each element is in at most a sets for all a, n ∈ N+. Similarly, one could prove that the minimum number of sets containing the most frequent element in a (non-empty) union-closed family with m sets and n elements is at least m2 for any m,n ∈ N+. Formulating these problems as integer programs, we observe that the optimal values we computed do not vary with n. We formalize these observations as conjectures, and show that they are not equivalent to the Frankl conjecture while still having wide-reaching implications if proven true. Finally, we prove special cases of the new conjectures and discuss possible approaches to solve them completely.	column (database);linear programming;mathematical optimization;point of view (computer hardware company)	Jonad Pulaj;Annie Raymond;Dirk Oliver Theis	2016	Electr.

31d5f46d1ea150a472531f98c18a5d6ad9477d81	domination reliability		In this paper, we propose a new network reliability measure for some particular kind of service networks, which we refer to as domination reliability. We relate this new reliability measure to the domination polynomial of a graph and the coverage probability of a hypergraph. We derive explicit and recursive formulæ for domination reliability and its associated domination reliability polynomial, deduce an analogue of Whitney’s broken circuit theorem, and prove that computing domination reliability is NP-hard.	cograph;coherence (physics);computation;dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);recursion;tutte polynomial	Klaus Dohmen;Peter Tittmann	2012	Electr.

47bc3a68e74eaa58d2b0922d50861342fd05c648	generalizing the four gamete condition and splits equivalence theorem: perfect phylogeny on three state characters	lower bound	We study the three state perfect phylogeny problem and show that there is a three state perfect phylogeny for a set of input sequences if and only if there is a perfect phylogeny for every subset of three characters. In establishing these results, we prove fundamental structural features of the perfect phylogeny problem on three state characters and completely characterize the obstruction sets that must occur in input sequences that do not have a perfect phylogeny. We also give a proof for a stated lower bound involved in the conjectured generalization of our main result to any number of states.	phylogenetic tree;turing completeness	Fumei Lam;Dan Gusfield;Srinath Sridhar	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04241-6_18	biology;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;perfect set property;computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;unitary perfect number	Arch	35.63087289723288	36.942695146152744	195404

By a block B of S, we shall mean a finite subsequence (xi+1 , Xi+2 ,..., Xi+k) for some integers i 3 0 and k > 1; we shall call k the block length. In 1906, Thue [5] showed that (1) when X has 3 symbols there is an infinite S which has no two adjacent blocks which are identical, and (2) when X has 2 symbols there is an infinite S which has no 3 adjacent blocks which are identical. (Any sequence of length at least 4 on two symbols has two consecutive occurrences of the same block.) These results have been repeatedly rediscovered over the years and have been used in many different applications. Hedlund [3] lists some of these rediscoveries and discusses applications of these results. Brown [l] lists some later rediscoveries. In this paper, we consider only the case X = (0, l}. Despite the repeated rediscovery of result (2), little consideration seems to have been given to asking whether we can find an infinite S with restrictions on the blocks B for which there are adjacent occurrences of B in S. In this connection, we consider the following conjecture.	block code	Roger C. Entringer;Douglas E. Jackson	1974	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

A composition matrix on a finite set X is an upper triangular matrix whose entries partition X, and for which there are no rows or columns containing only empty sets. A partition matrix is a composition matrix in which an order is placed on where entries may appear relative to one-another. We show that partition matrices are in one-to-one correspondence with inversion tables. Non-decreasing inversion tables are shown to correspond to partition matrices with a row ordering relation. Partition matrices which are s-diagonal are classified in terms of inversion tables. Bidiagonal partition matrices are enumerated using the transfer-matrix method and are equinumerous with permutations which are sortable by two pop-stacks in parallel. We show that composition matrices on X are in one-to-one correspondence with (2+2)-free posets on X. Also, composition matrices whose rows satisfy a column-ordering relation are shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with parking functions. Finally, we show that pairs of ascent sequences and permutations are in one-to-one correspondence with (2+2)-free posets whose elements are the cycles of a permutation, and use this relation to give an expression for the number of (2+2)-free posets on {1,...,n}.

They have the property that the orbits of all non-uniform 0-finite configurations contain as factors all finite words over the state alphabet {0,1,…,5}. Multiplication by 3/2 is conjectured to even have an orbit of 0-finite configurations that is dense in the usual product topology. An open problem by K. Mahler about Z-numbers has a natural interpretation in terms the automaton F×3/2. We also remark that the automaton F×3 that multiplies by 3 can be slightly modified to simulate the Collatz function. We state several open problems concerning pattern generation by cellular automata.	cellular automaton	Jarkko Kari	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31653-1_5	reversible cellular automaton;block cellular automaton;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;continuous spatial automaton;quantum finite automata;continuous automaton;deterministic automaton;ω-automaton;mathematics;mobile automaton;algorithm;algebra	Theory	36.794494339001034	35.626482577905875	197227

(Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel Processing, 1987, pp. 393–400) proposed an interconnection topology, the star graph, as an alternative to the popular n-cube. Jwo et al. (Networks 23 (1993) 315–326) studied the alternating group graph An. Cheng et al. (Super connectivity of star graphs, alternating group graphs and split-stars, Ars Combin. 59 (2001) 107–116) proposed the split-star as an alternative to the star graph which can be viewed as a companion graph of An. All of these graphs have maximal connectivity. In this paper, we study these interconnection topologies using advanced measures of vulnerability, namely, strength and toughness. Moreover, we show that with respect to toughness, a star graph is no better than an n-cube, whereas the alternating group graph and split-star are tougher than both of these graphs. ? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We extend the recent result mG[0, 1) ≤ γ(G), and show that isolate-free graphs also satisfy γ(G) ≤ mG[2, n]. In pursuit of better understanding Laplacian eigenvalue distribution, we find applications for these inequalities. We relate these spectral parameters with the approximability of γ(G), showing that γ(G) mG[0,1) 6∈ O(log n). However, γ(G) ≤ mG[2, n] ≤ (c + 1)γ(G) for c-cyclic graphs, c ≥ 1.
