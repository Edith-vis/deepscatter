f2068869ae904ae562a3546fc80c61f9bec129ab	a comparative view on the potential acting on an electron in a molecule and the electrostatic potential through the typical halogen bonds	electrostatic potential;halogen bond;non-covalent interactions;potential acting on an electron in a molecule;reduced density gradient	This work considers the features of the electrostatic potential (ESP), and the potential acting on an electron in a molecule (PAEM) for the series of isolated dihalide molecules and for their molecular complexes. The joint analysis of these functions enriches the vision of atomic predispositions to the halogen bond formation and reveals details for their characterization. The account for the exchange-correlation interaction in PAEM retains the specific anisotropy of the ESP, which is commonly used for the halogen bonding explanation within σ-hole concept. Along the halogen bonds, the curvatures of PAEM and ESP functions are opposite. Being jointly mapped on the closed isosurfaces of the reduced density gradient, placed between bound atoms, they are significantly differed from the side facing the halogen atom and from the side looking at the electron donor atom. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

cf59934d0b6220ee310123c9182b5906a028db5f	evolutionary optimization of paw data-sets for accurate high pressure simulations		We examine the challenge of performing accurate electronic structure calculations at high pressures by comparing the results of all-electron full potential linearized augmented-plane-wave calculations with those of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. In particular, we focus on developing an automated and consistent way of generating transferable PAW data-sets that can closely produce the all electron equation of state defined from zero to arbitrary high pressures. The technique we propose is an evolutionary search procedure that exploits the ATOMPAW code to generate atomic data-sets and the Quantum ESPRESSO software suite for total energy calculations. We demonstrate different aspects of its workability by optimizing PAW basis functions of some elements relatively abundant in planetary interiors. In addition, we introduce a new measure of atomic data-set goodness by considering their performance uniformity over an enlarged pressure range.	evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;simulation	Kanchan Sarkar;Mehmet Topsakal;N.

8215147ecb8ed11472e3ef118d2cd3fae49f6e78	reexamination of the π-bond strengths within h2c=xhn systems: a theoretical study	divalent state stabilization energy;partly substituted dsse;electron correlation effects;π bond energies in doubly bonded species	The accurate determination of π-bond energies, D(π), in doubly-bonded species has been an important issue in theoretical chemistry. The procedure using the divalent state stabilization energy defined by Walsh has been suggested, and the procedure seems to be conceptually reasonable and applicable to all kinds of doubly-bonded species. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether the procedure could be a reliable methodology for estimating the D(π) values for a variety of H(2)C=XH(n) species. To achieve a higher accuracy, the D(π) values were estimated at QCISD(T)/6-311++G(3df,2p) level of theory combined with isogyric correction. The D(π) values estimated in this work were in excellent agreement with the extant literature values. On the other hand, in determining accurate D(π) values for doubly bonded species, especially in species with lone-pair electrons such as H(2)C=O, it has been found that consideration of highly sophisticated electron correlation effects could be important. However, sufficiently accurate D(π) values have been obtainable at QCISD(T) or CCSD(T) levels with a 6-311++G(3df,2p) basis set on geometries at relatively inferior correlated levels such as MP2 and B3LYP levels with a 6-31+G(d) basis set.	basis set (chemistry);electron;electrons;energy, physics;estimated;h2ceramic cooling;hadamard transform;hybrid functional;møller–plesset perturbation theory;uml state machine	Jun-Xian Chen;Chang Kon Kim;Hai Whang Lee;Ying Xue;Chan Kyung Kim	2011	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21718	stereochemistry;chemistry;computational chemistry	HCI	97.52982677970057	-4.502405305394347	90142
9a7a73bda7e179ab74b4598c24ca2ac318ee4e3b	interplay between peptide bond geometry and local conformation: molecular dynamics analyses	ramachandran plot;conformation;molecular dynamics;force fields;peptide bond geometry	Several statistical and quantum chemical investigations performed in the last two decades have unveiled a strong correlation between protein backbone geometry (bond angles, dihedral angles and pyramidalization) and the local conformation (Berkholz et al. 2012; Berkholz et al. 2009; Esposito et al. 2005; Esposito et al. 2000; Esposito et al. 2013; Improta et al. 2011; Karplus 1996). This finding has important implication for protein structure prediction, determination, refinement and validation. Predictive protein modeling has shown an improved convergence when these effects are considered. Therefore, force fields currently available for modeling and molecular dynamics should be able to reproduce these geometric properties. We have recently shown that quantum mechanics calculations on small peptide systems are able to reproduce the dependence of the bond distances/angles on the conformation and the interplay between the peptide bond distortions from planarity and ψ dihedral angle thus demonstrating that the peptide bond geometry of proteins is essentially ruled by local effects (Improta et al. 2015). We here evaluated the ability of several commonly used force fields to reproduce subtle structural details related to the peptide bond. Our results indicate that these force fields are unable to accurately reproduce the experimental/statistical trends.	data validation;distortion;force field (chemistry);internet backbone;molecular dynamics;planar graph;protein structure prediction;quantum mechanics;refinement (computing);word lists by frequency	Nicole Balasco;Luciana Esposito;Luigi Vitagliano	2016	PeerJ PrePrints	10.7287/peerj.preprints.1628v1	molecular dynamics;ramachandran plot	Comp.	98.6152300588398	-4.32086468599717	92168

The symmetry relations are a generalization of the frame transformation relations derived by Harter and Crogman for coupled rotor molecules. A key internal symmetry label (named “soul”) is defined so that it remains a constant label for frame transformation relations, and is conserved during vibronic transitions, ionization, and even dissociation provided the nuclear spin-rotation interaction is relatively small. Simplified procedures are given for obtaining selection rules, statistical weights, and matrix elements of multipole operators for common molecules having various point symmetries.	angularjs;approximation;coefficient;level structure;long division;r.o.t.o.r.;selection rule	Horace T.

8024d1bf81e6f24ac2bad5d1e04236a791e5f1d8	ab initio calculations of the ultraviolet resonance raman spectra of uracil	resonance raman;ultraviolet;ab initio calculation	Abstract#R##N##R##N#An equation been derived to calculate, ab initio, the frequencies and intensities of a resonant Raman spectrum from the transform theory of resonance Raman scattering. This equation has been used to calculate the intensities of the ultraviolet resonance Raman spectra from the first π-π* excited state of uracil and 1,3-dideuterouracil. The protocol for this calculation is as follows: (1) The force constant matrix elements in Cartesian coordinate space, the vibrational frequencies, and the minimum energy ground and excited state geometries of the molecule are calculated ab initio using the molecular orbital program Gaussian 92, (2) the force constants in Cartesian coordinates are transformed into force constants in the space of a set of 3N – 6 nonredundant symmetrized internal coordinates, (3) the G matrix is constructed from the energy minimized ground state Cartesian coordinates and the GFL = LΛ eigenvalue equation is solved in internal coordinate space, (4) the elements of the L and L−1 matrices are calculated, (5) the changes in all of the internal coordinates in going from the ground to the excited state are calculated, and (6) these results are used in combination with the transform theory of resonance Raman scattering to calculate the relative intensities of each of the 3N – 6 vibrations as a function of the exciting laser frequency. There are no adjustable parameters in this calculation, which reproduces the experimental frequencies and intensities with remarkable fidelity. This indicates that the Dushinsky rotation of the modes in the excited state of these molecules is not important and that the simplest form of the transform theory is adequate. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	rca spectra 70;raman scattering;resonance	Warner L.

db924ba183816b216fcc3d3e3246d199e7ded964	thermodynamic analysis of the driving force approach: non-reactive systems		Abstract A thermodynamic analysis of the driving force approach proposed by Gani and Bek-Pedersen (2000) has been performed. Through the thermodynamic analysis, the fundamental relationships between the driving force definition and the energy involved in the vapor-liquid phase equilibrium are revealed. It is clearly demonstrated that the driving force approach is not a heuristic relationship, rather, it may be considered as a powerful thermodynamics-based approach for the design of many non-reactive processes: i.e. , distillation, liquid extraction, crystallization, etc. It is shown that the driving force is explicitly related to: the vapor and liquid enthalpies, the heats of vaporization of the different species and the energy associated to the non-idealities. Also, the connection between the maximum driving force and the minimum separation energy is shown through the thermodynamic separation efficiency concept proposed by Robinson and Gilliland (1950). The analysis is highlighted with two representative separation problems involving an ideal and a non-ideal binary mixtures.		Eduardo S.

13b7065ac474a81f184cdc67e0c148f8a242e472	local electric dipole moments: a generalized approach		"""We present an approach for calculating local electric dipole moments for fragments of molecular or supramolecular systems. This is important for understanding chemical gating and solvent effects in nanoelectronics, atomic force microscopy, and intensities in infrared spectroscopy. Owing to the nonzero partial charge of most fragments, """"naively"""" defined local dipole moments are origin-dependent. Inspired by previous work based on Bader's atoms-in-molecules (AIM) partitioning, we derive a definition of fragment dipole moments which achieves origin-independence by relying on internal reference points. Instead of bond critical points (BCPs) as in existing approaches, we use as few reference points as possible, which are located between the fragment and the remainder(s) of the system and may be chosen based on chemical intuition. This allows our approach to be used with AIM implementations that circumvent the calculation of critical points for reasons of computational efficiency, for cases where no BCPs are found due to large interfragment distances, and with local partitioning schemes other than AIM which do not provide BCPs. It is applicable to both covalently and noncovalently bound systems. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."""	aim alliance;atomic-force microscopy;computation;distance;intuition;john d. wiley;microscopy, atomic force;partial charge;negative regulation of protein processing in phagocytic vesicle	Lynn Groß;Carmen Herrmann	2016	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.24440	dipole;axial multipole moments;magnetic dipole;method of moments;discrete dipole approximation codes;polarization density;electric dipole moment;transition dipole moment;electric dipole transition	ML	98.12725796341113	-5.589260248913922	100438

Such particles can be identified from experimental data using a least squares global optimization method. However, if there is significant noise in the data, the “best” solution may not correspond well to the “actual” particle. We suggest a way in which the original least squares solution may be improved by using a constrained optimization calculation which considers the position of peaks in the data. This approach is applied first to multiangle data with varying amounts of artificially introduced noise and then to examples of single-particle experimental data patterns characterized by high noise levels.	constrained optimization;global optimization;least squares;mathematical optimization;signal-to-noise ratio	Mike C.

ba956cba50187e7e6783c4e832dc8d782291de63	molecular surface generation using marching tetrahedra	marching tetrahedra	A method is presented to generate and triangulate molecular surfaces rapidly. It is based on the ‘marching tetrahedra’ approach. The method is fast, simple and easy to implement. Our approach is not analytical in nature. Hence no special treatment is required for complications with singularity, degeneracy, or with self-intersecting re-entrant surfaces. A quick test for determining the solvent accessibility of a point in space forms an important part of the method. This test has potential use outside of the surface generation algorithm such as in molecular field analysis where the solvent accessibility of a point needs to be determined. The triangulated surface generated is suitable for molecular graphics display as well as boundary element continuum dielectric calculations. © 1998, Government of Canada.

Geometrical and electronic structures, dissociation energy values, thermochemical parameters, natural bond order, electron density, and energy decomposition analyses highlight the possibility of such noble gas bound EX3+ compounds. Except He and Ne, the other heavier congeners of this family make quite strong bonds with E. In fact, the dissociations of Ar-Rn bound analogues turn out to be endergonic in nature at 298 K, except in the cases of ArGe Cl3+, Ar/KrGeBr3+, and ArSnBr3+. GeH3+ and EF3+ (E = Ge-Pb) can even bind two Ng atoms with reasonably high dissociation energy. As the pz orbital of the E center in EX3+ plays a crucial role in its binding with the noble gas atoms, the effect of the π back-bonding causing X → E electron transfer ought to be properly understood. Due to the larger back-donation, the Ng binding ability of EX3+ gradually decreases along F to Br. EH2+ and the global minimum HE(+…) H2 (E = Sn, Pb) complexes are also able to bind Ar-Rn atoms quite effectively. The NgE bonds in Ar-Rn bound CH3+, GeH3+, and EF3+ (E = Ge-Pb) and Xe/RnE bonds in NgECl3+ and NgEBr3+ (E = Ge, Sn) are mainly of covalent type.

045b2e39118227ade1d0767727b93aecb2362c04	exploring the conical intersection seam in cytosine: a dft and casscf study		Abstract   The geometry, energetics and dipole moment of the most stable conformers of cytosine in the ground state were calculated at different density functional methods, namely, B3LYP, M06-2X, ωB97-D and PEBPEB methods and the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set. The most stable conformer, the keto-amino conformer is only 1 Kcal/mol more stable than the imino-enol form. The ultrafast radiationless decay mechanism has been theoretically investigated using Complete Active Space Multiconfiguration SCF calculation. The conical intersection seam was searched in the full dimensional space for the vibrational degrees of freedom. A new conical intersection has been identified, a semi-planar conical intersection (SPCI) with main deformations inside the cytosine ring and C=O bond. The g-vector and h-vector for the semi-planar conical intersection were calculated and discussed along with their geometrical parameters. A classical trajectory dynamic simulation has been performed to characterize and identify the evolution of geometry and energy changes of the SPCI with time.		Saadullah G. Aziz;Shabaan A. K.

f4345baa6de486b6761d856bd9649bf2db7476fd	internucleotide j-couplings and chemical shifts of the n---h···n hydrogen-bonds in the radiation-damaged guanine-cytosine base pairs	spin spin coupling constants;charge transfer;density functional calculations;g c base pair radicals;chemical shifts	Internucleotide (2h)J(NN) spin-spin couplings and chemical shifts (δ((1)H) and Δδ((15)N)) of N-H···N H-bond units in the natural and radiation-damaged G-C base pairs were predicted using the appropriate density functional theory calculations with a large basis set. Four possible series of the damaged G-C pairs (viz., dehydrogenated and deprotonated G-C pairs, GC(•-) and GC(•+) radicals) were discussed carefully in this work. Computational NMR results show that radicalization and anionization of the base pairs can yield strong effect on their (2h)J(NN) spin scalar coupling constants and the corresponding chemical shifts. Thus, variations of the NMR parameters associated with the N-H···N H-bonds may be taken as an important criterion for prejudging whether the natural G-C pair is radiation-damaged or not. Analysis shows that (2h)J(NN) couplings are strongly interrelated with the energy gaps (ΔE(LP→σ*)) and the second-order interaction energies (E(2)) between the donor N lone-pair (LP(N)) and the acceptor σ*(N-H) localized NBO orbitals, and also are sensitive to the electron density distributions over the σ*(N-H) orbital, indicating that (2h)J(NN) couplings across the N-H···N H-bonds are charge-transfer-controlled. This is well supported by variation of the electrostatic potential surfaces and corresponding charge transfer amount between G and C moieties. It should be noted that although the NMR spectra for the damaged G-C pair radicals are unavailable now and the states of the radicals are usually detected by the electron spin resonance, this study provides a correlation of the properties of the damaged DNA species with some of the electronic parameters associated with the NMR spectra for the understanding of the different state character of the damaged DNA bases.

d0fc2f1c245135c3309fbdc527ba7dd485b34d18	comparative analysis of the performance of commonly available density functionals in the determination of geometrical parameters for zinc complexes		A set of 44 Zinc-ligand bond-lengths and of 60 ligand-metal-ligand bond angles from 10 diverse transition-metal complexes, representative of the coordination spheres of typical biological Zn systems, were used to evaluate the performance of a total of 18 commonly available density functionals in geometry determination. Five different basis sets were considered for each density functional, namely two all-electron basis sets (a double-zeta and triple-zeta formulation) and three basis sets including popular types of effective-core potentials: Los Alamos, Steven-Basch-Krauss, and Stuttgart-Dresden. The results show that there are presently several better alternatives to the popular B3LYP density functional for the determination of Zn-ligand bond-lengths and angles. BB1K, MPWB1K, MPW1K, B97-2 and TPSS are suggested as the strongest alternatives for this effect presently available in most computational chemistry software packages. In addition, the results show that the use of effective-core potentials (in particular Stuttgart-Dresden) has a very limited impact, in terms of accuracy, in the determination of metal-ligand bond-lengths and angles in Zinc-complexes, and is a good and safe alternative to the use of an all-electron basis set such as 6-31G(d) or 6-311G(d,p).

5bc20088b1d3708f4edb5275e78e3f0dda841a7e	topological stabilization of fullerenes		Much has been devoted to the relationship between fullerene structures and their properties after the discovery of C60.4 There exist 1812 isomers for C60~9~ that provides an interesting problem to explore. How do their stabilities vary? Because one knows all these isomers involve equal numbers of vertices (atoms) and edges (bonds) as well as 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons in dfferent arrangements. So far, only that species without fused pentagons has been ~ynthesized.~ Would not some of remaining ones be able to be stabilized? With the molecular orbital (MO) viewpoint, HOMOLUMO gaps are widely used to rationalize the stabilities of molecules with half of their magnitude known as “hardn e ~ s ” . * ~ ~ The principle of maximum hardness’O asserts that systems tend to be as hard as possible, namely, the larger the HOMO-LUMO gap, the more stable the system will be. For fullerenes, it has been noticed that a concerted trend exists between the HOMO-LUMO gaps and the signals of photoionization observed. ’ The magnitude of HOMO-LUMO gaps depends on the energy level pattem and electron counts (EC) of the molecules. In Huckel framework, those neutral n-electron species that have non-bonding MOs or unequal numbers of bonding and antibonding MOs are recognized to be unstable, because they are either open shell or closed shell structures with small HOMO-LUMO gaps. However, heteroatomic derivatives of them exist very often attributing to topological charge stabilization (TCS). Gimarcl* and Aihara13 pointed out that heteroatoms with high electronegativity prefer to locate at the sites of high electron density, while weakly electronegative atoms would prefer to occupy the low density positions, where electron densities are calculated in reference to the homo-skeleton isoelectronic with the heteromolecule. Both kinds of replacement may change the level pattem index (LPI) and the number sequence of bonding, nonbonding, and antibonding MOs symbolized by {n+, no, n-)I4 and may enlarge the HOMO-LUMO gap simultaneously in favor of forming a closed-shell, stabilized heteroatomic system. Calculations within the Huckel framework can be easily carried out using parameters for the substituents relative to reference^.'^.'^ Analogously, the possible modes for the stabilization of c 6 0 isomers via heteroatomic substitution should be capable of being deduced from similar discussions based on TCS and the evaluation of LPI, EC, and HOMO-	control theory;energy level;linear partial information;molecular orbital;open shell;photoelectrochemical process;substitution (logic);topological quantum number	Jiannong Xu;Yuansheng Jiang	1995	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci00024a008	combinatorics;fullerene;mathematics	ML	98.40263078660959	-6.473589475983124	110727

Among them, the Pearson's correlation coefficient r has no units and allows only semiquantitative statements to be made. Those that do have units of energy and whose value may be compared to a physically relevant scale, such as the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), the mean error of the energies (ER), the standard deviation of the error (SDER) or the mean absolute error (AER), overestimate the distance between potentials. Moreover, their precise statistical meaning is far from clear. In this article, a new measure of the distance between potential energy functions is defined that overcomes the aforementioned difficulties. In addition, its precise physical meaning is discussed, the important issue of its additivity is investigated, and some possible applications are proposed. Finally, two of these applications are illustrated with practical examples: the study of the van der Waals energy, as implemented in CHARMM, in the Trp-Cage protein (PDB code 1L2Y) and the comparison of different levels of the theory in the ab initio study of the Ramachandran map of the model peptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2.	4-dichlorobenzene;5 ml ethanol 0.98 ml/ml injection;alanine;approximation error;charmm;coefficient;complex systems;energy, physics;health care organization;mean squared error;mechlorethamine;plant roots;protein data bank;standard deviation	José Luis Alonso;Pablo Echenique	2006	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20337	complex systems;root-mean-square deviation;chemistry;calculus;computational chemistry;statistics	ML	97.63487865495108	-4.246569798310154	112255

To explore the latter feature, we have compared OP with B95 and a new functional introduced in the present study - the OPB method that combines OP with the same-spin (SS) component of B95. In general, we find that B95 and OPB perform comparably. Our comparisons of the various DFT procedures suggest that the incorporation of a meta-GGA (e.g., TPSS) into OP and OPB does not necessarily lead to a chemically more accurate procedure than the use of a related GGA (e.g., PBE). An important finding is the more notable (and somewhat more consistent) improvement in performance with the incorporation of SS correlation, particularly for longer-range chemical properties. Nonetheless, on average across our test sets of over 800 systems, the difference between the performances of OP versus B95 or OPB is not exceedingly large. By drawing a parallel between these DFT methods and the wavefunction scaled-MP2-type methods, we reason that one can further develop the OP functional, and perhaps a wider range of correlation functionals by combining it with the technique of range separation.	3-iodobenzylguanidine;operating system;organophosphates;performance;spin labels;chemical properties	Bun Chan;Jong-Won Song;Yukio Kawashima;Kimihiko Hirao	2016	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.24327	chemistry;thermochemistry;discrete fourier transform;computational chemistry;physical chemistry;physics	Comp.	97.91236674729926	-4.474482792681568	113645

Conceptually, bond covalency obtained from X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can be directly related to orbital compositions from electronic structure calculations, providing a standard for evaluation of density functional theoretical methods. Typically, a combination of functional and basis set that optimally reproduces experimental bond covalency is chosen, but its dependence on the population analysis method is often neglected, despite its important role in deriving theoretical bond covalency. In this study of iron tetrathiolates, and classical [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters with only thiolate ligands, we find that orbital compositions can vary significantly depending on whether they are derived from frontier orbitals, spin densities, or electron sharing indexes from """"Átoms in Molecules"""" (ÁIM) theory. The benefits and limitations of Mulliken, Minimum Basis Set Mulliken, Natural, Coefficients-Squared, Hirshfeld, and AIM population analyses are described using ab initio wave function-based (QCISD) and experimental (S K-edge XAS) bond covalency.

For this, interaction energies at representative geometries on the potential energy surfaces are evaluated using the CCSD(T) correlation method and large polarized LPol-n and augmented polarization-consistent aug-pc-2 basis sets extended with different sets of midbond functions. On the basis of the root mean square errors calculated with respect to the values for the most accurate potentials available, basis sets are selected for fitting the corresponding interaction energies and getting analytical potentials. In this work, we study the Ne-N2 van der Waals complex and after the above procedure, the aug-pc-2-3321 and the LPol-ds-33221 basis set results are fitted. The obtained potentials are characterized by T-shaped global minima at distances between the Ne atom and the N2 center of mass of 3.39 Å, with interaction energies of -49.36 cm(-1) for the aug-pc-2-3321 surface and -50.28 cm(-1) for the LPol-ds-33221 surface. Both sets of results are in excellent agreement with the reference surface. To check the potentials further microwave transition frequencies are calculated that agree well with the experimental and the aV5Z-33221 values. The success of this study suggests that it is feasible to carry out similar accurate calculations of interaction energies and ro-vibrational spectra at reduced cost for larger complexes than has been possible hitherto.	basis set (chemistry);distance;energy, physics;large;maxima and minima;mean squared error;methods of computing square roots;microwave;norepinephrine;plant roots;polarization (waves);potential energy surface;reduced cost;reference surface;seizures	Angelika Baranowska-Laczkowska;Berta Fernández	2014	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23483	atomic physics;chemistry;basis set superposition error;computational chemistry;physics	Vision	97.59912998890215	-4.557876975809093	119755

Lowering of activation energies upon heteroatom replacement are more significant for the oxacyclopropane analogues 1D, 1E, and 1F but double heterosubstitution is still needed to achieve a pseudopericyclic reaction. In fact only after reaching a pseudopericyclic process the energy balance favors the concerted pathway. Negligible NICS values and a clear disconnection in the ACID plot as well as some structural and energetical parameters reveal the pseudopericyclic nature of this concerted antara-antara [1,5](CH(2) ) sigmatropic shift. Although the product of the pseudopericyclic process is unprecedented, similar cycloisomerizations after allene activation should be considered within this hitherto undescribed reactions.

Here, we explore the molecular mechanism of this adduct formation using double-hybrid density functional theory methods. The reaction can be envisaged to occur in a two-step fashion via an aza-Michael addition leading to an intermediate ring-open adduct followed by a cyclization reaction giving the mutagenic ring-closed adduct. We find that (i) a 1,2-type addition is favored over a 1,4-type addition for the aza-Michael addition, and (ii) an initial tautomerization of the guanine moiety in the resulting ring-open adduct significantly reduces the barrier toward cyclization compared to the direct cyclization of the ring-open adduct in its keto-form. Overall, the aza-Michael addition is found to be rate-determining. We further find that participation of a catalytic water molecule significantly reduces the energy barriers of both the addition and cyclization reaction. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These corrections are indicated to be transferable to a large extent between various density-functional/basis-set combinations, so that they can be used to estimate zero-point averaged r0g distances from re values optimized at other theoretical levels. Applying this approach to a number of popular DFT levels does not, in general, improve their overall accuracy in terms of mean and standard deviations from experiment. The hybrid variant of the meta-functional TPSS is confirmed as promising choice for computing structures of transition-metal complexes.		Mark P.

a539d8f27df54b68f6dcc06bc179db1a8ab63979	image analysis using convolutional neural networks for modeling 2d fracture propagation		The primary failure mechanism in brittle materials such as ceramics, granite and some metal alloys is through the presence of defects which result in crack formation and propagation under the application of load. We are interested in studying this process of crack propagation, interaction and coalescence, which degrades the strength of the specimen. Traditionally, engineering applications that study these materials employ finite element mesh based methods that require hundreds of hours of processing time on multi-core high performance clusters. We have developed a graph-based reduced order model that captures key geometric and topological features of the dynamic fracture propagation network. We report here the early stages of our study in which deep neural networks will be applied to dynamic directed weighted graphs capturing various metrics of crack-pair interaction strength with the aim of predicting crack lengths, dynamic crack growth/coalescence properties, distributions of these properties over the entire material through time, failure paths and time to failure. Our graph-based representations allow us to consider detailed topology in conjunction with metric geometry to gain insights into the dominant mechanisms that drive the physics in these systems.	artificial neural network;biological specimen;coalescing (computer science);convolutional neural network;deep learning;failure cause;finite element method;image analysis;mesh networking;multi-core processor;software propagation;supercomputer	Robyn L.

In RVS-ADC, not only the core but also a substantial amount of energetically high-lying virtual orbitals is restricted in excitation energy calculations of low-lying excited electronic states. Using octatetraene, indole, and pyridine as representative examples and different standard basis sets of triple-zeta quality, RVS-ADC(2) turns out to be highly useful and to have negligible effects on ππ* excited states. However, for nπ* or πσ* states, the RVS approximation is generally less reliable but better at third-order than second-order ADC level. In addition, a unified, basis-set independent, thus normalized virtual orbital threshold (value) is introduced, making the RVS approximation more controllable and a priori applicable. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The validity of profiling and the large difference in the concentrations of the monomers are shown to be applicable to different tile sets. To evaluate the error rate new Markov based models are proposed to account for the different types of bonding (i.e. single, double and triple) in the monomers as modification to the commonly assumed kinetic trap model. A significant error rates reduction is accomplished compared to a scheme with constant concentration as commonly utilized under the kinetic trap model.

This degree of freedom interacts with the biomolecular system. V-AUS was applied to complex formation of two disordered amyloid-β (Aβ30-35 ) peptides in a periodic box filled by an explicit solvent. An interpeptide distance was defined as the reaction coordinate, along which sampling was enhanced. A uniform conformational distribution was obtained covering a wide interpeptide distance ranging from the bound to unbound states. The 300-K free-energy landscape was characterized by thermodynamically stable basins of antiparallel and parallel β-sheet complexes and some other complex forms. Helices were frequently observed, when the two peptides contacted loosely or fluctuated freely without interpeptide contacts. We observed that V-AUS converged to uniform distribution more effectively than conventional AUS sampling did.	antiparallel (electronics);boat dock;docking (molecular);fill;reaction coordinate;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;umbrella sampling;water model	Junichi Higo;Bhaskar Dasgupta;Tadaaki Mashimo;Kota Kasahara;Yoshifumi Fukunishi;Haruki Nakamura	2015	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23948	computational chemistry	HPC	98.8862875852809	-2.4132511103597816	138772

We examined the dimers of formic acid, formamide, 4-pyrimidinone, 2-pyridinone, 2-hydroxpyridine, and 2-hydroxycyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-one. In addition, we studied the interactions in beta-diketone enols with a simplified model, namely the hydrogen bonds of 3-hydroxypropenal with both ethenol and formaldehyde. The intermolecular interaction energies, either with or without the involvement of pi resonance, were decomposed into the Hitler-London energy (DeltaEHL), polarization energy (DeltaEpol), charge transfer energy (DeltaECT), and electron correlation energy (DeltaEcor) terms. This allows for the examination of the character of hydrogen bonds and the impact of pi conjugation on hydrogen bonding interactions. Although it has been proposed that resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds are accompanied with an increasing of covalency character, our analyses showed that the enhanced interactions mostly originate from the classical dipole-dipole (i.e., electrostatic) attraction, as resonance redistributes the electron density and increases the dipole moments in monomers. The covalency of hydrogen bonds, however, changes very little. This disputes the belief that RAHB is primarily covalent in nature. Accordingly, we recommend the term """"resonance-assisted binding (RAB)"""" instead of """"resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding (RHAB)"""" to highlight the electrostatic, which is a long-range effect, rather than the electron transfer nature of the enhanced stabilization in RAHBs."""	2-hydroxypyridine;covalent interaction;electron transport;energy, physics;formaldehyde;formamide (substance);generalized valence bond;hydrogen bonding;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);pyschological bonding;quaternions and spatial rotation;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);resonance;scanning electron microscopy;sulfur-sulfur bond isomerases;synergy;beta thalassemia;covalence;formic acid;monomer	John Frederick Beck;Yirong Mo	2007	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20523	chemistry;computational chemistry;hydrogen bond;nuclear magnetic resonance	SE	97.73352708884102	-6.085118769151764	142814

This approach uses a relatively large number of parameters (∼50) in order to generate the accurate ab initio phonon spectrum. Since the emphasis is in the accuracy rather than the transferability, it can only be used in similar bonding environments. Because of this, a reliable and automatic fitting procedure is essential. We discuss the detailed aspects of the fitting procedure, including the stages of fitting, the type of ab initio values used for the fitting, the weighting factors for different quantities, the number of ab initio data points needed, as well as the uniqueness of the parameters. We found that the parameters cannot be determined uniquely, indicating interdependence of the parameters. Nevertheless, the different parameters resulted from different fits all give accurate phonon spectrum compared to ab initio results.

5318093d75fec4058c265a5d9c72bc5cb06cba35	tungsten imido-catalysed dimerisation of α-olefins: insight into the lewis acid's function revealed from computational studies	density functional calculation;product cycle;dft calculation;kinetics	Alternative channels of the tungsten imido-catalysed olefin dimerisation proceeding through mono(imido) and bis(imido) compounds have been examined by means of the DFT method simulating authentic reaction conditions on catalyst models that closely mimic the real catalyst system. All relevant steps of a plausible metallacycle mechanism to follow alternative pathways together with the divergent path towards azatungstanacycle intermediates have been characterised by considering up to three AlClMe2 moieties explicitly. This study disclosed that the Lewis acid is actively engaged in the productive catalytic cycle, this in addition to its presumed role, among others, as alkylating and chloride ligand abstraction agent in the formation of the active catalyst species. The Lewis acid preferably forms four-membered chelates across tungsten–imido or tungsten–chlorine bonds featuring a -Al–Cl–W bridge. The formation of the five-membered tungstanacycle is found to be less affected by the cocatalyst, but it acts profoundly in modulating the energetics of its degradation into the dimer product. DFT predicts a smooth energy profile for the most accessible path via mono(imido) tungsten species, having the Lewis acid bridged across tungsten–chlorine bonds, which is in consonance with observed activity and selectivity. This type of Lewis acid association appears as being pivotal for an effective catalysis. The alternative channel to engage bis(imido) tungsten compounds features significantly more demanding kinetics for the dimer generating route, thereby rendering it as being almost impossible to be accessed. The present study constitutes evidence, based on reliable DFT calculations, that mono(imido) tungsten compounds complexed by the Lewis acid component is effectively triggering dimerisation, whilst bis(imido) tungsten species are unlikely to play a role in the productive cycle.	computation;domino tiling;elegant degradation;energy profile (chemistry);kinetics internet protocol;selectivity (electronic);simulation;while	Sven Tobisch	2011		10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.129	product lifecycle;kinetics	HCI	97.92670840514084	-7.095121579925229	152052

The method is based on perturbing an existing conformation along a molecular dynamics trajectory using initial atomic velocities with kinetic energy concentrated on the low-frequency vibrational modes, followed by energy minimization. A novel Chebyshev polynomial filter is used to heavily dampen the high-frequency components of a randomly generated Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity vector. The method is very efficient, even for large systems; it is straightforward to implement and requires only standard force-field energy and gradient evaluations. The results of several computational experiments suggest that the method is capable of efficiently sampling low-strain energy conformations of complex systems with nontrivial nonbonded interaction networks.

The models require increasingly sophisticated data needs as the hierarchy is implemented. The approach is illustrated for the production of methyl acetate because of its commercial importance, and because of the availability of adequate published data for comparison. In the limit of reaction and phase equilibrium, we show (1) the existence of both a minimum and a maximum reflux, (2) there is a narrow range of reflux ratios that will produce high conversions and high purity methyl acetate, and (3) the existence of multiple steady states throughout the entire range of feasible reflux ratios. For finite rates of reaction, we find (4) that the desired product compositions are feasible over a wide range of reaction rates, up to and including reaction equilibrium, and (5) that multiple steady states do not occur over the range of realistic reflux ratios, but they are found at high reflux ratios outside the range of normal operation.

During 15 years as the head of the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory of the Nuclear Research Center at Saclay, the author has extensively used APL in his works [1-3] and continues to promote its scientific applications. The Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS) includes two main branches, the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) and the Electron Spin Resonance ( ESR) also called Electron Paramagnetic Resonance ( EPR). The NMR is a priviledged method for the identification and conformational analysis of organic and biological molecules and is well known for its medical application, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The ESR/EPR which is the main subject of this topics, is the specific method for studying paramagnetic molecules i.e. molecules possessing at least one unpaired electron, namely the free radicals resulting from the breaking of a chemical bond, triplet fundamental (e.g. the oxygen of air) or lowest excited states and some metal coordination complexes. Most of these species are very reactive and are initiators or intermediates in a large number of chemical and biological processes : oxidation, combustion, polymerization, radiation damaging, photosynthesis etc... An important application common to the NMR and ESR is the molecular dynamics which provides thorough information on some physical properties of condensed matter.	apl;epr paradox;electron;minimal recursion semantics;molecular dynamics;one-electron universe;resonance;triplet state	Claude Chachaty	2002		10.1145/602231.602240	magnetic resonance imaging;electron paramagnetic resonance	ML	99.17996302243759	-6.417336498691316	160666

Screening function 1 is a power distance-dependent function, bi/[formula: see text] Ri-r [formula: see text] gamma, screening function 2 is an exponential distance-dependent function, bi exp(-[formula: see text] Ri-r [formula: see text]/d0), and screening function 3 is a weighted distance-dependent function, sign(bi) exp[-xi [formula: see text] Ri-r [formula: see text]/magnitude of bi)]. For every screening function, the parameters (gamma, d0, and xi) are optimized using 41 common organic molecules of 4 types of compounds: aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic amines, and aliphatic alkanes. The results of calculations show that screening function 3 cannot give chemically reasonable results, however, both the power screening function and the exponential screening function give chemically satisfactory results. There are two notable differences between screening functions 1 and 2. First, the exponential screening function has larger values in the short distance than the power screening function, therefore more influence from the nearest neighbors is involved using screening function 2 than screening function 1. Second, the power screening function has larger values in the long distance than the exponential screening function, therefore screening function 1 is effected by atoms at long distance more than screening function 2. For screening function 1, the suitable range of parameter gamma is 1.0 < gamma < 3.0, gamma = 2.3 is recommended, and gamma = 2.0 is the nearest integral value. For screening function 2, the suitable range of parameter d0 is 1.5 < d0 < 3.0, and d0 = 2.0 is recommended. HMLP developed in this research provides a potential tool for computer-aided three-dimensional drug design.		Qishi Du;Paul G.

In this work, a computational approach is exploited to rationally design improved two-photon active caging groups based on this NDBF chromophore. For this objective, first the two-photon absorption (TPA) properties of NDBF are investigated in detail and a suitable theoretical approach for the reliable simulation of TPA spectra of this class of compounds is identified. Then, virtual chemical modifications are performed by introduction of substituents at the chromophore and replacement of the central furan ring by pyrolle, thiophene, and borrole heterocycles. Subsequently, the TPA properties of the resulting compounds are computed, and the influences of the chemical modifications on TPA properties investigated in detail. The most promising candidates with largely increased two-photon uncaging efficiencies are dimethylamino-substituted derivatives of NDBF, nitrodibenzopyrrol, and nitrodibenzothiophene.

The microkinetic mechanism is adapted from literature and has been validated with reported experimental results. Rate determining steps are elicited by reaction path analysis, partial equilibrium analysis and sensitivity analysis. Results show that methane activation occurs via dissociative adsorption to pyrolysis, while oxidation of the carbon occurs by O(s). Further, the mechanism is reduced through information obtained from the reaction path analysis, which is further substantiated by principal component analysis. A 33% reduction from the full microkinetic mechanism is obtained. One-step rate equation is further derived from the reduced microkinetic mechanism. The results show that this rate equation accurately predicts conversions as well as outlet mole fraction for a wide range of inlet compositions.

d01c316df514e7a2a9fe8d37b5a68bc7b818f8be	assessing the protective activity of a recently discovered phenolic compound against oxidative stress using computational chemistry		The protection exerted by 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (DHMBA), a phenolic compound recently isolated from the Pacific oyster, against oxidative stress (OS) is investigated using the density functional theory. Our results indicate that DHMBA is an outstanding peroxyl radical scavenger, being about 15 times and 4 orders of magnitude better than Trolox for that purpose in lipid and aqueous media, respectively. It was also found to react faster with HOO(•) than other known antioxidants such as resveratrol and ascorbic acid. DHMBA is also predicted to be able to sequester Cu(II) ions, consequently inhibiting the OS induced by Cu(II)-ascorbate mixtures and downgrading the (•)OH production via the Haber-Weiss reaction. However, it is proposed that DHMBA is more efficient as a primary antioxidant (free radical scavenger), than as a secondary antioxidant (metal ion chelator). In addition, it was found that DHMBA can be efficiently regenerated in aqueous solution, at physiological pH. Such regeneration is expected to contribute to increase the antioxidant protection exerted by DHMBA. These results suggest that probably synthetic routes for this compound should be pursued, because albeit its abundance in nature is rather low, its antioxidant activity is exceptional.	3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol;antioxidants;ascorbic acid;born–haber cycle;computational chemistry;density functional theory;downgrade;free radical scavengers;free radicals;functional theories of grammar;gas scavengers;inhibition;ions;lethrinidae;natural regeneration;operating system;oxidative stress;peroxyl;phenol formaldehyde resin;synthetic intelligence;trolox c;cupric cation;mixture;orders - hl7publishingdomain;phenolics;physical hard work;resveratrol	Yenny Villuendas-Rey;Juan Raúl Alvarez-Idaboy;Annia Galano	2015	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00513	biochemistry;chemistry;organic chemistry	ML	97.89268195377834	-7.253525561889584	168964
fcbc01704eeab91c8cb3df56a3b9d657adfcdda7	a density functional theory investigation on the mechanism and kinetics of dimethyl carbonate formation on cu2o catalyst	cu2o;density functional theory;mechanism;solvent effect;dimethyl carbonate	A theoretical analysis about the mechanism and kinetics of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) formation via oxidative carbonylation of methanol on Cu(2)O catalyst is explored using periodic density functional calculations, both in gas phase and in solvent. The effect of solvent is taken into account using the conductor-like screening model. The calculated results show that CO insertion to methoxide species to produce monomethyl carbonate species is the rate-determining step, the corresponding activation barrier is 161.9 kJ mol(-1). Then, monomethyl carbonate species reacts with additional methoxide to form DMC with an activation barrier of 98.8 kJ mol(-1), above reaction pathway mainly contributes to the formation of DMC. CO insertion to dimethoxide species to form DMC is also considered and analyzed, the corresponding activation barrier is 308.5 kJ mol(-1), suggesting that CO insertion to dimethoxide species is not competitive in dynamics in comparison with CO insertion to methoxide species. The solvent effects on CO insertion to methoxide species involving the activation barriers suggest that the rate-determining step can be significantly affected by the solvent, 70.2 kJ mol(-1) in methanol and 63.9 kJ mol(-1) in water, which means that solvent effect can reduce the activation barrier of CO insertion to methoxide species and make the reaction of CO insertion to methoxide in solvents much easier than that in gas phase. Above calculated results can provide good theoretical guidance for the mechanism and kinetics of DMC formation and suggest that solvent effect can well improve the performance of DMC formation on Cu(2)O catalyst in a liquid-phase slurry.	activation function;carbonates;clinical act of insertion;copper(i) oxide;density functional theory;functional theories of grammar;gene regulatory network;insertion mutation;kinetics internet protocol;methanol;slurry;kilojoule (kj);methyl carbonate	Riguang Zhang;Luzhi Song;Baojun Wang;Zhongqiao Li	2012	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.22939	chemistry;mechanism;organic chemistry;inorganic chemistry;solvent effects;density functional theory	AI	97.61652114452714	-6.912911650584722	170841

A method for the fast computation of the NICS values is introduced, using the so-called pseudo-pi-method. A detailed examination is made of the multidimensional nature of aromaticity. The lack of a good correlation between the NICS and the multicenter delocalization indices is reported and the grounds discussed. It is shown through a thorough statistical analysis that the NICS values arise not only from local aromaticity of the benzenoid rings, but also from other circuits. It is shown that the NICS indices do not reveal the individual aromatic nature of a specific ring, contrary to the delocalization indices.	aromatics;cell nucleus;computation;digital object identifier;hydrocarbons;journal of computational chemistry;polycyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;token ring;version	Stijn Fias;Sofie Van Damme;Patrick Bultinck	2008	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20794	stereochemistry;chemistry;chemical shift;chemical bond;pi;organic chemistry;computational chemistry;physics;aromaticity	ML	98.9691227309263	-5.17012341626087	171555

Boundary shapes from the built environment and nature are studied in a morphospace composed of two axes: one corresponding to each measure, to yield a typological classification of form. It is shown that the covariance between distance and directionality is mediated by the topological structure of embedded main circulation. Three kinds of circulation—elementary, ring, and linear—thus affect three fundamentally different balancing conditions between distance and directionality in boundary shapes. The analysis of large samples of shapes thus far demonstrates a “unique shape” status, where no two different shapes have the same pair of relative distance and directional fragmentation values.	elementary;embedded system;fragmentation (computing)	Ermal Shpuza	2011	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060411000217	shape;shape analysis	Vision	100.040626045854	-6.213681892084356	171850

Electron deficiency on the metal increases with the ligand in the order NHC < CO < PF3 < NO(+). Electron-withdrawing ligands like NO(+) lead to more stable alkane complexes than NHC, a strong electron donor. Energy decomposition analysis shows that stabilization is due to orbital interaction involving charge transfer from the alkane to the metal. Reactivity and dynamics of the alkane fragment are facilitated by electron donors on the metal. These results match most of the experimental results known for CO and PF3 complexes. The study suggests activation of alkane in metal complexes to be facile with strong donor ligands like NHC.	alkanes;angular defect;bridged bicyclo compounds, heterocyclic;carbon monoxide;coordination complexes;density functional theory;electron;functional theories of grammar;ligands;molecular orbital;nitric oxide;requirement;carbene;rhenium;trifluorophosphine;tungsten	Murugesan Thenraj;Ashoka G.

Our objectives are twofold: to find a diverse set of low lying local minima, as well as the global minimum. To do so, we use massively the fast inertial relaxation engine algorithm as an efficient local minimizer. This procedure turns out to be quite efficient to reach the global minimum, and also most of the local minima. We test the method with the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, for which an abundant literature does exist, and obtain novel results, which include a new local minimum for LJ13 , 10 new local minima for LJ14 , and thousands of new local minima for 15≤N≤65. Insights on how to choose the initial configurations, analyzing the effectiveness of the method in reaching low-energy structures, including the global minimum, are developed as a function of the number of atoms of the cluster. Also, a novel characterization of the potential energy surface, analyzing properties of the local minima basins, is provided. The procedure constitutes a promising tool to generate a diverse set of cluster conformations, both two- and three-dimensional, that can be used as an input for refinement by means of ab initio methods.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;algorithm;bence jones protein;jones calculus;lennard-jones potential;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;potential energy surface;reaching;refinement (computing);telling untruths	José Rogan;Alejandro Varas;Juan Alejandro Valdivia;Miguel Kiwi	2013	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23419	classical mechanics;maxima and minima;computational chemistry;physics;quantum mechanics	Vision	98.82343206285675	-1.6236080272295583	181598

However, different measures of π-electron delocalization were employed for the CC, CX, and XY bonds, and this index seems to be inappropriate for compounds containing heteroatoms. In order to describe properly various resonance effects (σ-π hyperconjugation, n-π conjugation, π-π conjugation, and aromaticity) possible for heteroatomic π-electron systems, some modifications, based on the original HOMA idea, were proposed and tested for simple DFT structures containing C, N, and O atoms.

In our common neighbor analysis, we introduce the common neighbor label (CNL) which is a group of atoms of a smaller size (than the cluster) designated by four numeric digits. The CNL thus describes topologically smaller size atomic configurations and is associated an abundance value which is the number of """"degenerate"""" four digits all of which characterize the same CNL. When the cluster is in its lowest energy state, it has a fixed number of CNLs and hence abundances. At nonzero temperatures, the cluster undergoes different kinds of atomic activities such as vibrations, migrational relocation, permutational and topological isomer transitions, etc. depending on its lowest energy structure. As a result, the abundances of CNLs at zero temperature will change and new CNLs with their respective new abundances are created. To understand the temperature dependence of the CNL dynamics, and hence shed light on the cluster dynamics itself, we employ a novel method of statistical time series analysis. In this method, we perform statistical clustering at two time scales. First, we examine, at given temperature, the signs of abundance changes at a short-time scale, and assign CNLs to two short-time clusters. Quasi- periodic features can be seen in the time evolution of these short-time clusters, based on which we choose a long-time scale to compute the long-time correlations between CNL pairs. We then exploit the separation of correlation levels seen in these long-time correlations to extract strongly-correlated collections of CNLs, which we will identify as effective variables for the long-time cluster dynamics. It is found that certain effective variables show subtleties in their temperature dependences and these thermal traits bear a delicate relation to prepeaks and main peaks seen in clusters Ag14 ,C u 14 and Cu13Au1 .W e therefore infer from the temperature changes of effective variables and locate the temperatures at which these prepeaks and principal peaks appear, and they are evaluated by comparing with those deduced"""		S.

The position isomers were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level, and the charge distribution in the cluster is estimated by NBO analysis. The criterion of ring-cap orbital overlap compatibility along with the number of BC, CC, and BB bonds help in explaining the stability order in each category. The most stable isomer is the one with maximum ring-cap orbital overlap and largest number of BC bonds. The order of relative stability among the trigonal bipyramid is 1c>1b>1a′, where the stability is proportional to the number of CH caps over the small three-membered ring. The C3B3H6+ isomer with the one allyl C3 group (2b) is more favorable than the one with a cyclopropenyl group (2a). Among the C3B4H7+ isomers the stability order is 3e>3d>3c>3b>3a, which mostly depends on the ring-cap orbital overlap. In the bicapped square antiprism (4) where there is large number of isomers, the order follows the rule of ring cap compatibility and the number of BC bonds. The order of 5e>5d>5c>5b>5a obtained from the calculations is in perfect agreement with the above sited rules. Equations (1)–(5) devised for estimating the stability of isomers of C3Bn−3Hn+ indicate an increase in stability with cage size. The mono-positive charge of the isomers is distributed throughout the cage, making them suitable candidates as weakly electrophillic cations. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The results demonstrate that cRE and related replica exchange with guided annealing (RE-GA) schemes lead to unbalanced exchange attempt probabilities and break detailed balance whenever the system undergoes slow conformational transitions (relative to the temperature diffusion timescale). Nonetheless, numerical simulations suggest that approximate canonical ensembles can be generated for systems with small conformational transition barriers. This suggests that RE-GA maybe suitable for simulating intrinsically disordered proteins, an important class of newly recognized functional proteins. The efficacy of RE-GA is demonstrated by calculating the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered kinase inducible domain protein. The results show that RE-GA helps the protein to escape nonspecific compact states more efficiently and provides several fold speedups in generating converged and largely correct ensembles compared to the standard temperature RE.	approximation algorithm;detailed balance;deuterium exchange measurement;gallium;intrinsically disordered proteins;numerical analysis;parallel tempering;probability;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulated annealing;simulation;software release life cycle;unbalanced circuit;viral capsid secondary envelopment	Weihong Zhang;Jianhan Chen	2014	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23675	crystallography;protein folding;molecular dynamics;chemistry;computational chemistry	ML	98.95489250671486	-2.6963633307527233	185989
f2c83e9b705578f6d86bfbef515f82c24a2f5422	neighbor-list reduction: optimization for computation of molecular van der waals and solvent-accessible surface areas		A general, fast, and exact optimization, called neighbor-list reduction (NLR), is presented, which can be used to accelerate the computation of hard-sphere molecular surface areas. NLR allows selected neighbors of a central atom to be removed from the computation in a preprocessing step, thus allowing the calculation of the atomu0027s surface area to proceed with a shorter list of neighbors. The atoms removed are those having intersections with the central atom falling entirely within unions of other atomsu0027 intersections with the central atom. We describe explicit methods for two levels of neighbor-list reduction: 3NLR considers three hard spheres at a time—the central atom, the candidate for removal, and one other neighbor; whereas 4NLR considers two other neighbors. We demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of this optimization by means of a modified version of the NACCESS program, which computes atomic and molecular surface areas numerically. As test cases we used compounds of different size and class, with and without explicit hydrogens. When van der Waals surface (vdWSA) is computed, the NLR methods reduce the length of the neighbor list by as much as 41%; when solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is computed, the reduction is as great as 74%. The overall speed improvement due to these reductions is a factor of only about 1.2 for vdWSA, but is about 2.0 for the computation of SASA, in the context of this particular program. All 39,554 calculated atomic surface areas (vdWSA and SASA) were found to be identical to within 0.001 A2 to those obtained without NLR. © 1998 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 19: 797–808, 1998		Jörg Weiser;Armin A.

Results on 33 different molecules covering a wide range of symmetries and structural types demonstrate that both coordinate systems are of comparable efficiency. There is a marked tendency for natural internals to converge to global minima whereas Cartesian optimizations converge to the local minimum closest to the starting geometry. Because they can now be generated automatically from input Cartesians, natural internals are to be preferred over Z-matrix coordinates. General optimization strategies using internal coordinates and/or Cartesians are discussed for both unconstrained and constrained optimization. © John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	energy minimization;mathematical optimization;z-matrix (chemistry)	Jon Baker	1993	Journal of Computational Chemistry	10.1002/jcc.540140910	curvilinear coordinates;homogeneous coordinates;energy;calculus;computational chemistry;bipolar coordinates;mathematics;geometry;barycentric coordinate system;log-polar coordinates;analytic geometry;physics;quantum mechanics;generalized coordinates;orthogonal coordinates	Vision	98.45829979145832	-4.166535175021315	196052
070dcfda64e334b3f64f0e632c3f33b458bec691	a lagrangian formulation for optical backpropagation training in kerr-type optical networks	optical network;backpropagation	Steven R. Skinner Electrical Engineering Wichita State University Wichita, KS 67260-0044 Elizabeth C. Behrman Physics Department Wichita State University Wichita, KS 67260-0032 A training method based on a form of continuous spatially distributed optical error back-propagation is presented for an all optical network composed of nondiscrete neurons and weighted interconnections. The all optical network is feed-forward and is composed of thin layers of a Kerrtype self focusing/defocusing nonlinear optical material. The training method is derived from a Lagrangian formulation of the constrained minimization of the network error at the output. This leads to a formulation that describes training as a calculation of the distributed error of the optical signal at the output which is then reflected back through the device to assign a spatially distributed error to the internal layers. This error is then used to modify the internal weighting values. Results from several computer simulations of the training are presented, and a simple optical table demonstration of the network is discussed. 772 Elizabeth C. Behrman 1 KERR TYPE MATERIALS Kerr-type optical networks utilize thin layers of Kerr-type nonlinear materials, in which the index of refraction can vary within the material and depends on the amount of light striking the material at a given location. The material index of refraction can be described by: n(x)=no+nzI(x), where 110 is the linear index of refraction, ~ is the nonlinear coefficient, and I(x) is the irradiance of a applied optical field as a function of position x across the material layer (Armstrong, 1962). This means that a beam of light (a signal beam carrying information perhaps) passing through a layer of Kerr-type material can be steered or controlled by another beam of light which applies a spatially varying pattern of intensity onto the Kerr-type material. Steering of light with a glass lens (having constance index of refraction) is done by varying the thickness of the lens (the amount of material present) as a function of position. Thus the Kerr effect can be loosely thought of as a glass lens whose geometry and therefore focusing ability could be dynamically controlled as a function of position across the lens. Steering in the Kerr material is accomplished by a gradient or change in the material index of refraction which is created by a gradient in applied light intensity. This is illustrated by the simple experiment in Figure 1 where a small weak probe beam is steered away from a straight path by the intensity gradient of a more powerful pump beam.	armstrong's axioms;backpropagation;coefficient;computer simulation;electrical engineering;error message;gradient;holography;kerr effect;logic gate;nonlinear system;photorefractive effect;signal beam;software propagation;teaching method;thickness (graph theory);volume hologram;windows legacy audio components	James Edward Steck;Steven R.

Direct evaluation of Debye summation has quadratic complexity, which results in computational bottleneck when determining crystal properties, or running structure refinement protocols that involve SAXS or SANS, even for moderately sized molecules. We present a fast approximation algorithm that efficiently computes the summation to any prescribed accuracy ε in linear time. The algorithm is similar to the fast multipole method (FMM), and is based on a hierarchical spatial decomposition of the molecule coupled with local harmonic expansions and translation of these expansions. An even more efficient implementation is possible when the scattering profile is all that is required, as in small angle scattering reconstruction (SAS) of macromolecules. We examine the relationship of the proposed algorithm to existing approximate methods for profile computations, and show that these methods may result in inaccurate profile computations, unless an error-bound derived in this article is used. Our theoretical and computational results show orders of magnitude improvement in computation complexity over existing methods, while maintaining prescribed accuracy.	approximation algorithm;computation (action);computational complexity theory;crystallography;distance;ewald summation;fast multipole method;graphics processing unit;image scaling;language translations;mandibular right second molar tooth;mathematical optimization;moderate response;neutrons;non-small cell lung carcinoma;parallel computing;physical restraint equipment (device);protocols documentation;prototype;provable security;refinement (computing);sas;sampling (signal processing);scattering, small angle;sinc function;speedup;summation (document);test scaling;time complexity;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Nail A.
