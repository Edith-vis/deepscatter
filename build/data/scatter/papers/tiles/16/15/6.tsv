dc4b1a6ac94d3af019d4a0db089cafa6b5c701cb	in-operando tracking and prediction of transition in material system using lstm		The structures of many material systems evolve as they are treated with physical processing. For instance, organic and inorganic crystalline materials frequently coarsen over time as they are thermally treated; with domains (grains) rotating and growing in size. When a material system undergoing the structural transformation is probed using x-ray scattering beams, the peaks in the scattering images will sharpen and intensify, and the scattering rings will become increasingly 'textured'. Accurate identification of the transition frame in advance brings multiple benefits to the NSLS-II in-operando experiments of studying material systems such as minimal beamline damage to samples, reduced energy costs, and the optimal sampling of material properties. In this paper, we formulate the prediction and identification of the structural transition event as a classification problem and apply a novel LSTM model to identify sequences having transition event. The preliminary results of the experiments are encouraging and confirm the viability of the detection and prediction of transition in advance. Our ultimate goal is to deploy such a prediction system in the real-world environment at the selected beamline of NSLS-II for improving the efficiency of the experimental facility.	artificial neural network;binary classification;deep learning;experiment;long short-term memory;sampling (signal processing);state space;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Pranjal Sahu;Dantong Yu;Kevin G.

The cavity, made by ultra low expansion glass (Corning ULEreg), must be kept close to the zero-expansion temperature (close to 25degC) of the glass. The target can only be met by active control, while leaving the cavity free of sensor and actuators. This is obtained by two concepts: thermal bath and reference thermal sink, the latter allowing zero-expansion temperature to be reached by heaters in a wide environment range. Preliminary experiments of the two concepts leading to cavity design are detailed.	emergence;experiment;glass;thermal grease	Enrico S.

In order to support and expand the physical program, the existing Inner Detector will be replaced by a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) within the next few years. This allows for the detection of charged reaction channels, which can't be measured with the CBELSA/TAPS experiment up to now, as well as for particle identi cation from the speci c energy loss. A rst prototype with GEM foils for charge ampli cation in front of the readout plane and suitable size for the CBELSA/TAPS experiment was built in collaboration with the TU Munich, the detector laboratory of the GSI in Darmstadt and the Stefan-MeyerInstitute of the University Vienna. The TPC has been commissioned successfully within the FOPI experiment at the GSI during several test beam campaigns. Additionally, systematic studies have been carried out with a smaller Test-TPC using a TestBench providing an accurate external track de nition. As the electron drift velocity in the TPC volume is a crucial parameter for the exact track reconstruction, detailed simulations of the drift velocity and its dependency on external parameters, such as drift voltage, pressure, gas ow or temperature, have been carried out. The results of these simulations recommend a constant monitoring of all examined parameters to allow a reasonable use of the simulated drift velocities. For this purpose, and to ensure a safe and stable operation of the TPCs and the other detectors on the TestBench, the required hardware, the control software based on a data base and a graphical user interface were designed and constructed as the main part of this work. With this so-called SlowControl, it was possible to measure, control and store several parameters e.g. voltages, currents, temperatures or gas ows with high precision during the beam times and test measurements carried out. The SlowControlGUI features a good handling and a display of the measured values in real-time. From the data recorded with the GEM-TPC, the actual drift velocities of the electrons within the detector volume have been extracted and compared with the theoretical predictions of the simulation. Hence, the error in the reconstruction of the z component was minimized thus, improving further analysis of the data."""	blue (queue management algorithm);database;electron;graphical user interface;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;prototype;real-time clock;resonance;sensor;simulation;test bench;velocity (software development)	David Kaiser	2014				ML	99.62514414721753	-11.123359183161732	122061

The program is composed on the basis of the algorithm which realizes MSS criterion. The necessary and sucient criterion conditions are the existence of two dierent steady states in reaction simplex P i xi  const: They are composed for each SS. The program in Maple-V for IBM computers works well. It permits to construct a system of stoichiometric inequalities (which realizes these necessary and sucient conditions) and to establish its solvability for a concrete catalytic reaction. The program shows whether it is impossible or possible to describe MSS with the help of any investigated scheme. It determines SS coordinates and ®nds the values of stage rate constants.

In environmental parameters monitoring, the climatic differences in Brazil should be considered, which make necessary the development of sensors for each region of the country. Thus, researchers of the Environmental Technologies Group (TECAMB) integrated to the Associate Laboratory of Sensors and Materials (LAS) of the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) have well established themselves, for the last 20 years, in the elaboration of diagnosis techniques, characterization and development of porous ceramic. In this work, porous ceramic was manufactured from mechanical mixture of ZrO2 and TiO2 powders, compacted and sintered at different temperatures, for application as air humidity sensing elements in the Project """"Development and Application of Network of Geosensors for Environmental Monitoring"""", into a co-operation programme under the Microsoft Research-FAPESP Virtual Institute for IT Research, for tropical forests monitoring. Ceramic materials applied as sensing elements of humidity, specifically metallic oxides, have shown advantages in terms of their mechanical strength, their resistance to chemical attack and their thermal and physical stability in, mainly, hostile environments. It is noteworthy that the ceramics exhibit a unique structure, consisting of grains, grain boundaries, surfaces and pores, what make them appropriate to be used as humidity sensors, since they have microstructures able to be controlled and suitable chemical compositions. The characterization of the sintered ceramics were carried out through X-ray diffraction (crystalline phases), scanning electron microscope, SEM (microstructure) and measurements of B.E.T. (specific area of porous). The porous ceramics characterization as air relative humidity sensor element was accomplished through capacitance variation measurements, using a RLC bridge coupled to a climatic chamber, in function of the air relative humidity range."""	electron;environmental chamber;microsoft research;rlc circuit;sensor	Rodrigo de Matos Oliveira;Maria do Carmo de Andrade Nono;Celso von Randow	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2012.65	thermal stability;compaction;powder;ceramic;grain boundary;capacitance;environmental monitoring;scanning electron microscope;porous medium	Mobile	99.52897206389035	-19.70711403964767	145463

The electronic detector and control circuits were designed to regulate digital counters or to trigger a radio telemetry signal when a target insect was lured to a detector by the chemical attractant. The telemetry signals were received at a base radio receiver station and collated by a computer on a continual real-time basis. These detection and reporting systems can increase the efficiency of monitoring insect population densities in field conditions, and could substantially reduce costs of labor and transportation during season-long insect surveys. >		Don E.

The use of standard ICC profiles in prepress leaves it to the printer to match the fixed substrate characteristics contained in these profiles. This triggers the interest in methods to predict, if a given ink, press and paper combination complies with a given characterization. We present an approach to compare physical and optical characteristics of papers in order to achieve such a prediction of compliance by classification methods.

It is important to know what fraction of the selected nuclei, leaving the target, reach the detection system. This information is crucial for determining absolute cross section of the studied reaction.#R##N##R##N#Solution method: Interaction of projectiles with target nuclei is treated event by event, semimicro-scopically. Position and angle (with respect to beam direction), energy and charge state of the reaction products are calculated by Monte Carlo method. Trajectory of each nuclei inside the separator is then calculated by ion optical transfer matrix method. Ratio of the number of trajectories completing their journey up to the detection system to the total number of trajectories is a direct measure of absolute transmission efficiency of the separator.#R##N##R##N#Reasons for new version:   The method for calculating mean squared scattering angle (〈ϑ〉2〈ϑ〉2), used earlier [2], was found to be inadequate particularly for low energy heavy residues. Energy loss of beam in the target-backing foil and energy loss of residues in the charge-reset foil (wherever used) needed to be taken into account for better matching of simulated residue parameters with measurements.#R##N##R##N#Summary of revisions:#R##N#1.#TAB##R##N#A new method [3] for calculating multiple small angle Coulomb scattering of residues in the target has been adopted. The change is incorporated in function Weibull() in the program ters_pti2.c.#R##N##R##N#2.#TAB##R##N#Isotopically enriched targets are made on a thin backing foil (usually made of carbon) quite often. Energy loss of beam in the backing foil (assuming beam is made to pass through the backing foil first, which is the usual practice) need to be taken into account.

CBM will explore the high-density region of the QCD phase diagram by investigating nuclear collisions from 2 to 45 GeV beam energy per nucleon. Its main focus is the measurement of very rare probes (e.g. charmed hadrons), which requires interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, unprecedented in heavy-ion experiments so far. Together with the high multiplicity of charged tracks produced in heavy-ion collisions, this leads to huge data rates (up to 1 TB/s), which must be reduced on-line to a recordable rate of about 1 GB/s. Moreover, most trigger signatures are complex (e.g. displaced vertices of open charm decays) and require information from several detector subsystems. The data acquisition is thus being designed in a free-running fashion, without a hardware trigger. Event reconstruction and selection will be performed on-line in a dedicated processor farm. This necessitates the development of fast and precise reconstruction algorithms suitable for on-line data processing. In order to exploit the benefits of modern computer architectures (many-core CPU/GPU), such algorithms have to be intrinsically local and parallel and thus require a fundamental redesign of traditional approaches to event data processing. Massive hardware parallelisation has to be reflected in mathematical and computational optimisation of the algorithms. This is a challenge not only for CBM, but also for current and future experiments, in particular for heavy-ion eperiments like e.g. ALICE at the LHC. For the development of the proper algorithms, a careful simulation of the input data is required. Such a simulation must reflect the free-running DAQ concept, where data are delivered asynchronously by the detector front-ends on activation, and no association to a physical interaction is given a priori by a hardware trigger. It hence goes beyond traditional event-based software frameworks. In this article, we present the challenges of and the current approaches to simulation, data processing and reconstruction in the CBM experiment. 1 The CBM Experiment The Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR) is an accelerator complex under preparation near the GSI research centre in Darmstadt, Germany [6–8]. 2 Computational Challenges for the CBM Experiment Its backbones are two superconducting synchrotrons (SIS-100 and SIS-300) with 100 and 300 Tm bending power, respectively, delivering highly intense beams of protons (up to 90 GeV), light ions (up to 45 GeV per nucleon) and heavy ions (up to 35 GeV per nucleon). The FAIR facility will serve various fields of physics research such as hadron physics using secondary beams of anti-protons, nuclear structure physics with rare isotope beams, plasma physics with highly pulsed heavy-ion beams, and atomic physics with highly charged ions and low-energy antiprotons. The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment (CBM) is being prepared to be operated at this facility from 2018 on [3, 4]. It will investigate nuclear matter under extreme conditions (temperature, density) as produced in relativistic nuclear collisions. The collision energies available with the SIS-100 and SIS-300 accelerators provide access to the high-density regime of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter as depicted in Fig. 1. CBM will search for the landmarks of this phase diagram as predicted by theory, namely the onset of the transition from confined to deconfined matter, the critical point, the onset of chiral symmetry restoration, and hypothetical new phases of matter like quarkyonic matter or color superconductivity. The CBM physics programme is complementary to the heavy-ion research conducted at RHIC and LHC, which explore QCD matter at high temperatures but vanishing net-baryon density. For a detailed review of the CBM physics, see [11]. Fig. 1. The phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, indicating the regimes of confined and deconfined matter. The critical point separates the region of a cross-over (explored by RHIC and LHC) from that of a first-order phase transition to be studied by the CBM experiment. The task of a heavy-ion experiment is to characterise the collision, and to try to infer the underlying physics, from the multitude of final-state hadrons emitted Computational Challenges for the CBM Experiment 3 from the reaction zone. The abundances of these hadrons vary over many orders of magnitude, from the frequent pions to the rare charmonium states (Fig. 2). The emphasis of CBM will be the measurement of rare probes giving access to the early stage of the collisions, like charmed hadrons, multi-strange hyperons and leptonic decays of short-lived vector mesons. As the expected multiplicities of these observables are extremely low, their measurement requires high interaction rates, which drive the experimental requirements. Consequently, CBM is being designed to cope with collision rates of up to 10 MHz, unprecedented in heavyion experiments so far. Such rates call for fast and radiation hard detectors and read-out electronics, but also constitute challenges for the data acquisition, online data reduction and data processing. Fig. 2. Predicted hadron multiplicities (including the relevant branching ratio) for central Au+Au collisions at 25A GeV The experimental setup of CBM is shown in Fig. 3. The experiment will operate in fixed-target mode and measure charged hadrons, electrons and muons as well as photons. The core of the setup is a silicon tracking system (STS) located inside the yokes of a superconducting dipole magnet. Displaced vertices of open charm decays will be detected by a precision vertex tracker (MVD) consisting of monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) close to the interaction target. Charged hadrons will be identified by a time-of-flight detector (TOF) about 10 m downstream the target. A RICH detector and several layers of transition radiation detectors (TRD) serve electron identification (Fig. 3, left). The TRD is also used for tracking purposes. Photons will be detected in an electro-magnetic calorimeter (ECAL) behind the TOF wall. For the measurement of muons, the RICH will be replaced by an active absorber system consisting of several detector layers inside the iron absorber (Fig. 3, right). 4 Computational Challenges for the CBM Experiment Fig. 3.

From left to right: Superconducting magnet hosting the target, the micro-vertex detector (MVD) and the silicon tracking system (STS), ring-imaging cherenkov detector (RICH), three stations of transition radiation detectors (TRD), time-of-flight wall (TOF) and electro-magnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The forward calorimeter (PSD) at the end of the setup serves for event characterisation (centrality, event plane). Right: CBM setup for muon measurements. The RICH detector is replaced by an active absorber system (MUCH). Only one TRD station is used for tracking between MUCH and TOF. 2 Event Reconstruction in CBM Event reconstruction in the CBM experiment starts, after cluster and hit finding in the various detector systems, with track finding in the silicon tracking system. The challenge of this task is depicted in Fig. 4, showing a simulated central Au+Au collision at 25A GeV in the STS. About 700 charged tracks are emitted into the detector acceptance with the strong kinematical focussing typical for fixed-target experiments. These tracks have to be reconstructed with high precision and efficiency in order to sort out the interesting, rare observables from the bulk of the produced hadrons. An additional challenge is posed by the large number of fake hits in the STS (about eight times the number of real hits) caused by the projective strip geometry of the sensors. To cope with these conditions, a reconstruction algorithm based on the Cellular Automaton has been developed [13], which has proven to be both fast and efficient. The algorithm starts from short segments built of three space points (hits). Short segments are connected to larger ones if their junction satisfies the specific track model. Finally, track candidates appear, the best of which are selected, the others rejected. The advantage of this method is that it is conceptually simple, local w.r.t. data and thus intrinsically parallel, which makes it well suited for modern, many-core computer architectures. Currently, about 150 central events can be reconstructed per second on a Intel X5550 with 2× 4 cores (2.67 GHz). The reconstruction efficiency is above 95% for momenta larger than 1 GeV (Fig. 5). Similar efficiencies were obtained by an alternative approach Computational Challenges for the CBM Experiment 5 Fig. 4. Simulation of a central Au+Au collision at 25A GeV beam momentum in the main tracking system of CBM. About 700 charged tracks are in the detector acceptance. using the Hough transformation method, which was developed and tested on a CELL-BE as a prototype for an FPGA array. Fig. 5. Track finding efficiency in the STS, obtained with the CA track finder in central Au+Au collisions at 25A GeV, as a function of momentum After track finding, the track parameters are reconstructed using the Kalman filter algorithm, taking into account the propagation in a non-homogeneous magnetic field and multiple scattering and energy loss in the detector materials. The Kalman filter is also used for track propagation throughout the detector system and is thus inherently used be the track finding algorithms. 6 Computational Challenges for the CBM Experiment Track finding in the downstream detectors (TRD and/or MUCH) is performed with a track following method, using the tracks already found in the STS as seeds. A particular challenge is constituted by the muon detection system since the tracks have to be traced through the consider	active galactic nucleus;alice;antivirus software;cellular automaton;central processing unit;centrality;charmed baryons;circuit restoration;computation;computer architecture;critical point (network science);data acquisition;downstream (software development);electron;experiment;field-programmable gate array;first-order predicate;gigabyte;graphics processing unit;hough transform;human–computer interaction;kalman filter;large hadron collider;line level;manycore processor;mathematical optimization;nuclear structure;observable;online and offline;onset (audio);parallel computing;peterson's algorithm;phase diagram;pixel;plasma active;prototype;radiation hardening;requirement;sensor;server farm;simulation;software framework;software propagation;sound quality;terabyte;tracking system;xfig	Volker Friese	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-28212-6_2	software framework;event reconstruction;theoretical computer science;detector;large hadron collider;exploit;data acquisition;physics;data processing	ML	99.99173623932069	-16.570630571501376	177039
