We show how the mathematical framework of catastrophe theory can be used to describe the behaviour of critical point trajectories when various different types of generic events, viz. annihilations and creations of pairs of spatial critical points, (almost) coincide. Although such events are nongeneric in mathematical sense, they are not unlikely to be encountered in practice. Furthermore the behaviour leads to the observation that fine-to-coarse tracking of critical points doesn't suffice. We apply the theory to an artificial image and a simulated MR image and show the occurrence of the described behaviour.	relevance;scale space	Arjan Kuijper;Luc Florack	2002		10.1007/3-540-47969-4_13	computer vision;combinatorics;scale space;computer science;catastrophe theory;mathematics;geometry;critical point	HCI	100.54925716019038	5.666776498919995	115661

This algorithm is important for joining various process simulation steps, where data have to be smoothed or transferred from one grid to another. Furthermore, it is important for integrating the ion implantation simulator into a process flow. One reason for using different grids is that for certain Monte Carlo simulation methods, using orthogrids is mandatory because of performance reasons. The algorithm presented sweeps a small rectangular grid over the points of the new tetrahedral grid and uses approximation by generalized Bernstein polynomials. This approach was put on a mathematically sound basis by proving several properties of these polynomials. It does not suffer from the adverse effects of least squares fits of polynomials of fixed degree as known from the response surface method. The most important properties of Bernstein polynomials generalized to cuboid domains are presented, including uniform convergence, an asymptotic formula, and the variation diminishing property. The smoothing algorithm which works very fast is described and, in order to show its applicability, the resulting values of a 3-D real world implantation example are given and compared with those of a least squares fit of a multivariate polynomial of degree two, which yielded unusable results.	algorithm;approximation;bernstein polynomial;cuboid;fits;ion implantation;least squares;monte carlo method;monte carlo methods for option pricing;phil bernstein;regular grid;response surface methodology;simulation;smoothing;usability;variation diminishing property	Clemens Heitzinger;Andreas Hössinger;Siegfried Selberherr	2003	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2003.814259	econometrics;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;process simulation;hybrid monte carlo;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Graphics	100.09276676128437	11.518851210651082	154792
