4685f8b44d1aa5cd1854bb48b9e751431be896da	misual: music visualization based on acoustic data	visualization;moving average;similarity measure;music	This paper describes a music visualization method called Misual. The goal of this research to provide objective and static information regarding musical impressions that will enable people to efficiently categorize a huge number of music pieces and select favorites from them. Features are directly extracted from music and then visualized in an image that suits human intuition. As a first step in this research, volume transitions and repetitions are focued on as the visualized objects. For the volume transition, power information is extracted and then smoothed by a moving average. This information is continuously visualized with 3D-like images, in which radii of circles reflect the volume information. Repetitions are visualized with color. These are detected on the basis of the frame-to-frame similarity measured by the Mel-frequency cepstrum. These two kinds of information were visualized for three pieces of real music. The visualizations will be useful for roughly grasping the musical features in a very short time and imagining the music intuitively.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bookmark (world wide web);categorization;color;mel-frequency cepstrum;music visualization;smoothing	Naoko Kosugi	2010		10.1145/1967486.1967581	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-34.05294953219527	-45.8442815102228	43108

Wide-angle head-mounted camera video was recorded from two housekeepers and two machinists during their regular work activities, and the grasp types, objects, and tasks were analyzed and coded by study staff. The full dataset contains 27.7 hours of tagged video and represents a wide range of manipulative behaviors spanning much of the typical human hand usage. We provide the original videos, a spreadsheet including the tagged grasp type, object, and task parameters, time information for each successive grasp, and video screenshots for each instance. Example code is provided for MATLAB and R, demonstrating how to load in the dataset and produce simple plots.	camera phone;file spanning;matlab;r language;screenshot;spreadsheet	Ian M.

The capture of Soldier performance demands is particularly challenging in this regard, as many factors converge to impact performance in actual usage. In this paper, we describe new capabilities for tactile communications that include an authoring system, use of android-driven displays for control and map-based information, and engineering tactors with differing salient characteristics. This allows development of a dual-tactor display that affords a larger variety of tactile patterns for communications, or TActions. These innovations are integrated in a prototype system. We used the system to present navigational signals to combat-experienced soldiers to guide development of tactile principles and the system itself. Feedback was positive for the concept, operational relevance, and for ease of interpretation.		Linda R. Elliott;Bruce J. P. Mortimer;Roger W. Cholewiak;Greg R. Mort;Gary A.

Characters written in a single stroke have both on-strokes and off-strokes. Thus, the shapes of the hand-gesture characters are different from the shapes of characters written on paper. It is difficult to trace the shapes of characters in air because the writer cannot see the trajectories. In this study, a light emission diode (LED) pen and a TV camera are used to capture the LED light trajectory, and the movements of the light are converted into direction codes correcting the slant of the handwriting character. The codes are normalized to 100 data items to eliminate the effect of writing speed. The 100 direction codes are compared with model data in which the direction codes of 46 Japanese characters are defined. Next, the system has expanded to a multi-camera system. Two of four cameras are selected and the 3-D positions of the gesture trajectories are calculated by the stereo method, and the position data are converted into front view data. In the experiments, we attained a recognition rate of 92.9% for the single-camera system. The multi-camera system has the advantage that it can recognize gestures regardless of the origin directions of the gestures. The system also has the ability to recognize the directions of the gesture commands with an accuracy of 9Â°.	code;diode;direction finding;experiment;the 100	Toshio Asano;Sachio Honda	2010	19th International Symposium in Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598705	data modeling;computer vision;speech recognition;image processing;air;computer science;trajectory;professional video camera;mathematical model;gesture recognition;handwriting recognition;human interface device;computer graphics (images);light-emitting diode	Graphics	-38.40569768512285	-43.53914277033367	43290
3d6b11f97e38ab13803c3081894b7642da12de4b	understanding finger input above desktop devices	near surface;thickness;finger input;height;midair	Using the space above desktop input devices adds a rich new input channel to desktop interaction. Input in this elevated layer has been previously used to modify the granularity of a 2D slider, navigate layers of a 3D body scan above a multitouch table and access vertically stacked menus. However, designing these interactions is challenging because the lack of haptic and direct visual feedback easily leads to input errors. For bare finger input, the user's fingers needs to reliably enter and stay inside the interactive layer, and engagement techniques such as midair clicking have to be disambiguated from leaving the layer. These issues have been addressed for interactions in which users operate other devices in midair, but there is little guidance for the design of bare finger input in this space.  In this paper, we present the results of two user studies that inform the design of finger input above desktop devices. Our studies show that 2 cm is the minimum thickness of the above-surface volume that users can reliably remain within. We found that when accessing midair layers, users do not automatically move to the same height. To address this, we introduce a technique that dynamically determines the height at which the layer is placed, depending on the velocity profile of the user's initial finger movement into midair. Finally, we propose a technique that reliably distinguishes clicking from homing movements, based on the user's hand shape. We structure the presentation of our findings using Buxton's three-state input model, adding additional states and transitions for above-surface interactions.	desktop computer;haptic technology;input device;interaction;missile guidance;multi-touch;thickness (graph theory);three-state logic;usability testing;velocity (software development)	Chat Wacharamanotham;Kashyap Todi;Marty Pye;Jan O.

While these interfaces can easily project graphical elements on the bare hand, they cannot give tactile feedback. Here we present a technology that could help to expand the output capability of on-body interfaces to provide tactile feedback without restricting the skin as an interaction surface. SkinHaptics works by focusing ultrasound in the hand using a phased array of ultrasound transmitters and the acoustic time-reversal signal processing technique. We present experimental results that show that this device can steer and focus ultrasound on the skin through the hand, which provides the basis for the envisioned technology. We then present results of a study that show that the focused energy can create sensations that are perceived under the skin and in the hand. We demonstrate the potential of SkinHaptics and discuss how our proof-of-concept device can be scaled beyond the prototype.	acoustic cryptanalysis;graphical user interface;phased array;prototype;skin (computing);time reversal signal processing;transmitter;under the skin	Daniel Spelmezan;Rafael Morales Gonzalez;Sriram Subramanian	2016	2016 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)	10.1109/HAPTICS.2016.7463162	computer vision;acoustics;engineering;communication;tactile sensor	HCI	-43.069335506640556	-41.5489331427867	43597

0d37934e423485e3b8523f6eb024adc96133d636	serious games for rehabilitation of stroke patients with vibrotactile feedback		In this paper, we present a set of serious games with vibrotactile feedback developed for upper extremity motor function rehabilitation. These games are part of a framework called SIERRA that stands for Post-Stroke Interactive and Entertaining Rehabilitation with ReActive objects. The framework uses Augmented Reality technology to provide natural exercise environment and motivating virtual objects at the same time. It adopts serious games concept to provide patients with a more entertaining environment for treatments. We seamlessly superimpose virtual objects onto a real environment and patients can interact with them in a motivating game scenario. Since vibrotactile actuators are attached to the real objects, patient can experience haptic feedback as well as audiovisual feedback. Usability results show that the serious games with vibortactile feedback offers significant advantages both in terms of improving interests of the subjects for the game and in dealing with the realism of the games.

This study extends the steering law to paths with corners. Two experiments compare the movement times of negotiating paths with corners to straight paths with the same width and movement amplitude. The experimental results show a significant effect on the movement times due to the corners, extending far into the legs of the path's corner. Modeling the results using resource theory, a cognitive theory for divided attention, suggests that steering through corners is two simultaneous tasks: steering along the legs of the corner and aiming at the corner.	cognitive science;cursor (databases);experiment;steering law;user interface	Robert Pastel	2006		10.1145/1124772.1124934	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;fitts's law;user interface;steering law	HCI	-45.55279814857852	-48.94763595778983	44994

However, these apps with touch screens are not user-friendly for visually impaired people who are eager to be able to leave their homes independently. Moreover, the most widely used apps are not specially made for the visually impaired, so they create much confusion and result in a problematic user experience. The main purpose of this research is to provide a new mobility-aid solution in the form of a navigation app that remembers meaningful information over the journey and makes the trip safer and smoother. Unlike those applications that provide visual guides, we want to refer to the way blind people recognize and remember their route, and provide multi-sensory messages combining familiar reference points that they have learned from O&M training.

cd29fe500a2cf83af1e3a1439275ca07dc2aef93	a practical evaluation of the influence of input devices on playability		Innovations being achieved with interactive devices (screens, sensors etc.) allow the development of new forms of interaction for many applications. Videogames played with these devices are completely changing how we use them and taking advantage of intuitive interfaces. Based on that, we ask âWhat aspects of playability are affected using different input devices for a certain gaming task and how is gaming performance affected?â. Our contribution is to present a practical evaluation of four different input devices (Mouse, Gamepad, Kinect and Touchscreen) used to interact with the same game, Fruit Ninja, with our data analysis indicating that changing input device brings significant differences in certain aspects of player experience for this game, such as sensation, challenge and control, while for others there was very little difference since this particular game rarely provides intense experiences for those aspects.

However, sometimes it is not easy to select a device which fits the specific character of varied kinds of robots while at the same time increasing the user's convenience. Under these circumstances, in this study, we have tried to measure user convenience. We tried to understand the characteristics of several devices used to achieve human robot interaction by using each of these devices that could be used with a personal computer: We used a button type device, a joystick, a driving device which consisted of a handle and pedals, and a motion-based human interface device including an acceleration sensor.	fits;haptic technology;human interface device;humanârobot interaction;joystick;mobile computing;personal computer;robot control;usability	Tae Houn Song;Ji-Hwan Park;S.

It introduces a novel approach to the concept of the cursor inside the 3D virtual space, rethinking it as a drawing and control plane. 3D cursors are intuitively manipulated by multi-touch handheld tablets that are tracked in 6DOF. The system also features a lightweight immersive 3D rendering technique that runs on a single laptop allowing texture and lighting effects on 3D geometry. Users can simultaneously access their individual complementary orthogonal views on the tablets, as personal windows into the shared display of the virtual environment; they can concurrently 3D sketch, select, edit, manipulate 3D objects using the tablets as tangible props, as well as collectively navigate the scene using the tablet as a 3D trackpad. With the notion of multiple 3D cursors the personal computer becomes a collaborative working environment. The first version was implemented in 2014 [Dorta et al. 2014]. A product level system is presented with the immersive and non immersive implementations. A variation of the interface which works without the need of an external tracker is also demostrated that opens the possibility of using the system with any handheld device such as smart phones and watches.	3d rendering;collaborative working environment;control plane;cursor (databases);handheld game console;laptop;microsoft windows;mobile device;multi-touch;personal computer;smartphone;smartwatch;tablet computer;touchpad;unfolding (dsp implementation);virtual reality	TomÃ¡s Dorta;Gokce Kinayoglu;Michael Hoffmann	2015		10.1145/2785585.2785586	fixation;computer vision;real-time computing;simulation;attention;eye tracking;branching;computer science;operating system;alternative splicing;multimedia;interactivity;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.64295358677561	-39.29667807255966	45565

These advancements aim to assist safe driving and improve user travel experience. Before the realization of a full automation, in-vehicle dialog systems may reduce the driver distraction from many services available through connectivity. Even when a full automation is realized, in-vehicle dialog systems still play a special role in assisting vehicle occupants to perform various tasks. On the other hand, in-vehicle use cases need to address very different user conditions, environments, and industry requirements than other uses. This makes the development of effective and efficient in-vehicle dialog systems challenging; it requires multidisciplinary expertise in automatic speech recognition, spoken language understanding, dialog management (DM), natural language generation, and application management, as well as field system and safety testing. In this article, we review research and development (R&amp;D) activities for in-vehicle dialog systems from both academic and industrial perspectives, examine findings, discuss key challenges, and share our visions for voice-enabled interaction and intelligent assistance for smart vehicles over the next decade.	application lifecycle management;dialog manager;dialog system;natural language generation;natural language understanding;requirement;speech recognition	Fuliang Weng;Pongtep Angkititrakul;Elizabeth Shriberg;Larry P.

The system allows for non-intrusive measurement of positions of all players in indoor sports through whole match, using only inexpensive video equipment cameras mounted on the ceiling of the sports hall. Tracking process (obtaining trajectories from videos) is automatic and only supervised by operator, to initialize player positions at the beginning and correct the mistakes during the tracking. The software provides means for user friendly calibration of video data using court markings of each supported sport as reference coordinates. The system has been tested for European handball, basketball, squash and tennis. Manual annotations can be added, to complement the quantitative data. Software keeps synchronization between annotations and trajectory data and provides means to use custom annotation dictionaries. Due to calibration, the results are provided in court coordinates (meters, centimeters) and can be exported (synchronized with annotations in same file) for further analysis with any application (e.g. Microsoft Excel, SPSS).

The associations between attention devoted to metadata elements and selecting an interesting book were analyzed. Eye movements of 30 users selecting fiction for four search tasks were recorded. The results indicate that although participants paid most attention in book pages to content description and keywords, these had no bearing on selecting an interesting book. Author and title information received less attention, but were significant predictors of selection.	eye tracking	Janna PÃ¶ntinen;Pertti Vakkari	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40501-3_8	computer vision;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-35.64783652206219	-50.014046617041174	46156

Human users need to task the network to help them achieve mission objectives, while humans (sometimes the same individuals) are also sources of mission-critical information. We propose a natural language-based conversational approach to supporting human-machine working in mission-oriented sensor networks. We present a model for human-machine and machine-machine interactions in a realistic mission context, and evaluate the model using an existing surveillance mission scenario. The model supports the flow of conversations from full natural language to a form of Controlled Natural Language (CNL) amenable to machine processing and automated reasoning, including high-level information fusion tasks. We introduce a mechanism for presenting the gist of verbose CNL expressions in a more convenient form for human users. We show how the conversational interactions supported by the model include requests for expansions and explanations of machine-processed information.	automated reasoning;computation;compute node linux;controlled natural language;gist;high- and low-level;interaction;mission critical	Alun D.

In addition, improvements in autonomous modes of such vehicles are making it easier for minimally-trained individuals to operate the vehicles. As the autonomous capabilities advance, the user's role shifts from a direct teleoperator to a supervisory control role. Since the human operator is often better suited to make decisions in uncertain situations, it is important for the human operator to have awareness of the environment in which the vehicle is operating in order to prevent collisions and damage to the vehicle as well as the structures and people in the vicinity. In this paper, we present the Collision and Obstacle Detection and Alerting (CODA) display, a novel interface to enable safe piloting of a Micro Aerial Vehicle with a mobile device in real-world settings.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;humanâcomputer interaction;mobile device;telerobotics;unmanned aerial vehicle	Erin Treacy Solovey;Kim Jackson;Mary L.

This study proposes a strategy for identifying users based on touch dynamics. Users' touch behavior is monitored and several unique features are extracted including left versus right hand dominance, one-handed versus bimanual operation, stroke size, stroke timing, symmetry, stroke speed and timing regularity. An experiment involving 20 users reveals that the strategy is successful in identifying users and their traits according to the touch dynamics. The results can be used for automatic user interface customization. However, more research is needed before touch characteristics can be applied to increasing the security of handheld touch-based devices.	fax;handheld game console;interaction;mobile device;user interface	Frode Eika Sandnes;Xiaoli Zhang	2012	2012 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 9th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.45	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;behavioural sciences;computer science;mobile device;multimedia;authorization;biometrics	Robotics	-45.492681235418885	-45.256498624235235	47053

There has been a significant amount of research focusing on 3D content production, compression and delivery. However very little research has been dedicated to the emerging challenges in assessing user experience when interacting with the 3D video content. Interaction tasks such as pointing and selection are critical to the consumer's experience of the 3D video technology. This paper studies the impact of pointing modalities on the quality of interaction experience with stereoscopic 3D television. The conducted user study compares and evaluates three pointing modalities: standard mouse-based interaction, virtual laser pointer and hand gesture modality, using the ISO 9241-9 standard for multi-directional tapping task. The results suggest that the virtual laser pointer modality can provide better quality of interaction experience than other modalities in terms of user performance and user satisfaction.	3d television;data compression;digital video;hdmi;interaction;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);pointer (computer programming);stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy;usability testing;user experience	Haiyue Yuan;Janko Calic;Ahmet M.

Multidimensional input is often assumed to allow users to work quickly, but at the cost of precision, due to the instability of the hand moving in the open air. We show that, at least for the orientation matching task used in this experiment, users can take advantage of the integrated degrees of freedom provided by multidimensional input without necessarily sacrificing precision: using multidimensional input, users completed the experimental task up to 36% faster without any statistically detectable loss of accuracy. We also report detailed observations of common usability problems when first encountering the techniques. Our observations suggest some design issues for 3D input devices. For example, the physical form-factors of the 3D input device significantly influenced user acceptance of otherwise identical input sensors. The device should afford some tactile cues, so the user can feel its orientation without looking at it. In the absence of such cues, some test users were unsure of how to use the device.	input device;instability;sensor;usability testing	Ken Hinckley;Joe Tullio;Randy F. Pausch;Dennis Proffitt;Neal F.

8fc00cc73db678df783d145f5a61839abc9ded51	public space behavior modeling with video and sensor analytics		We present a review of technologies relevant to public space surveillance and describe a pilot study to explore the challenges. The general purpose of this study is to capture and analyze behavior patterns and anomalies of people behavior in a public space. On the capture side, we explore a small array of networked cameras as well as an ultrasonic sensor array for measuring the height of walking persons. After capture, video and ultrasound signals are analyzed and statistics calculated for such measurements, including the duration and speed of the trajectory of each tracked person, and a person's height which is a useful biometric feature for tracking the person across multiple, non-overlapping camera views. These statistics are first analyzed offline to determine the expected patterns of measured values over many captured events. Based on the expected patterns, anomalies can be detected as outliers in real time. Since this is a broad-based pilot study, conclusions relate to the effectiveness of the capture modalities and approaches investigated. We discuss how we use these findings to guide our future work.

This work tries to design the virtual home objects with the ability of playing the music and implement a particular HCI interface accomplishing the music interaction with virtual home objects for deploying virtual home music services in smart homes. Each virtual home object is connected to a list of songs. When a home inhabitant holds a virtual home object and moves it as operating gestures upon the implemented HCI interface, the virtual home music service will be activated and the smart home will automatically play the favorite songs for its inhabitant. In this way, a highly interactive home music service for home inhabitants can be realized through the convenient operating interactions between the virtual home objects and the implemented HCI interface in smart homes.

Our research is motivated by the fact that much of the content on public displays includes text. Hence, researchers and practitioners could greatly benefit from users being able to spontaneously interact as well as to implicitly calibrate an eye tracker while simply reading this text. In particular, we adapt Pursuits, a technique that correlates users' eye movements with moving on-screen targets. While prior work used abstract objects or dots as targets, we explore the use of Pursuits with text (read-and-pursue). Thereby we address the challenge that eye movements performed while reading interfere with the pursuit movements. Results from two user studies (N=37) show that Pursuits with text is feasible and can achieve similar accuracy as non text-based pursuit approaches. While calibration is less accurate, it integrates smoothly with reading and allows areas of the display the user is looking at to be identified.	eye tracking;smoothing;text-based (computing);usability testing	Mohamed Khamis;Ozan Saltuk;Alina Hang;Katharina Stolz;Andreas Bulling;Florian Alt	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971679	computer vision;smooth pursuit;multimedia	HCI	-45.66286260960532	-44.08371156779148	48169

As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to find the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users' novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender,~\emph{adaNov-R}, that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.	interaction;user experience	Komal Kapoor;Vikas Kumar;Loren G.

These systems use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for position information. Indoor navigation however cannot rely on GPS data, as the signals do not penetrate building structure. Thus other techniques are required to provide position information indoors. In this article the approach to an indoor navigation system based on the position information provided by the Device Whispering technique is presented. The position information acquired by Device Whispering is less precise than information acquired by the Fingerprinting technique but more robust. To compensate the deficit of precision the position information is combined with a movement model. This movement model is automatically generated from the maps which are already required for navigation.	approximation algorithm;data structure;global positioning system;map;modulation;native-language identification;natural language generation;prototype;radio fingerprinting;wireless access point	Ory Chowaw-Liebman;Uta Christoph;Karl-Heinz Krempels;Christoph Terwelp	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Information Networks and Systems (WINSYS)		dead reckoning;turn-by-turn navigation;computer vision;gps/ins;simulation;global positioning system;computer science;operating system;prototype;mobile computing;skeleton;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	-38.833253614729124	-44.44720760083924	48367

The main problem for the developer is to know the optimal text style for the specific display and for applications where color coding must be strictly followed because it is regulated by laws or internal practices. In this work, we experimented the effects on readability of two head-worn devices (optical and video see-through), two backgrounds (light and dark), five colors (white, black, red, green, and blue), and two text styles (plain text and billboarded text). Font type and size were kept constant. We measured the performance of 15 subjects by collecting about 5,000 measurements using a specific test application and followed by qualitative interviews. Readability turned out to be quicker on the optical see-through device. For the video see-through device, background affects readability only in case of text without billboard. Finally, our tests suggest that a good combination for indoor augmented reality applications, regardless of device and background, could be white text and blue billboard, while a mandatory color should be displayed as billboard with a white text message.	augmented reality;color;color balance;default;display device;head-mounted display;imagery;mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;mega man x8;shadow volume;sprite (computer graphics);web site	Saverio Debernardis;Michele Fiorentino;Michele Gattullo;Giuseppe Monno;Antonio E.

Unfortunately, on-screen reading loses many of the natural features of conventional physical media, such as the ability to annotate, slip in bookmarks, turn page corners, and so on. How best should these features be represented electronically? Can computerized representations give benefits that excel the conventional benefits of paper? We describe the design and implementation of a novel reading system that mimics key properties of paper and surpasses them by incorporating digital techniques. A comparative user study evaluating the system confirmed the effectiveness of the features and the value of the system as a whole.	fundamental interaction;interactivity;mobile device;personal computer;screen reading;usability testing	Jennifer Pearson;George Buchanan;Harold W.

By using the system, a user can interact simply by accessing a web site from his/her web browser. A notable characteristic of the system is that the anthropomorphic agent is synthesized from a photograph of a real human face. This makes it possible to construct a web site whose owner's facial agent speaks with visitors to the site.

We evaluate and compare three types of wink-based interactions: single wink, double wink, and long wink, in three mobile usage scenarios: sitting, walking, and lying down. Results show that single wink has similar error rate as touch input, and is preferred over touch input for targets in corner regions on a smartphone.	interaction;mobile device;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);smartphone;touchscreen;wink (animated file)	Pin-Sung Ku;Te-Yen Wu;Ericka Andrea Valladares Bastias;Mike Y.

The system exploits the human capability for rapidly scanning imagery augmenting it with an active learning loop, which attempts to always present the most relevant material based on the current information. Two versions of the human interface were evaluated, one with variable page sizes and manual paging, the other with a fixed page size and automatic paging. Both require absolute attention and focus of the user for optimal performance. In either case, as users search and find relevant results, the system can invisibly re-rank its previous best guesses using a number of knowledge sources, such as image similarity, text similarity, and temporal proximity. Experimental evidence shows a significant improvement using the combined extremes of human and machine power over either approach alone.	bandwidth (signal processing);computer performance;expectationâmaximization algorithm;page (computer memory);paging;real-time clock;user interface;video clip	Alexander G.

We explore how both lowand high-literate online consumers make decisions at the point of purchase in an online shopping task. We measured percentage fixation duration of AOIs during decision-making on four search engine results page (SERP) tasks. Qualitative and quantitative results combined suggest that tabular SERP may contribute to the success of low literate consumers making sophisticated trade-off decisions. Furthermore, we propose that tabular SERP choice design may improve low literate user experience for more general SERP choice design.	online search;online shopping;point of sale;search engine results page;table (information);user experience;web search engine	Lisa C.

2a624422e1faba3c7fd87887bf5f79d0874b4344	wind tactor: an airflow-based wearable tactile display		Traditional wearable tactile displays transfer information through a firm contact between the tactile stimulator (tactor) and the skin. The firm contact, however, might limit the location of wearable tactile displays and might be the source of discomfort when the skin is being exposed to prolonged contact. This motivated us to find a non-contact wearable tactile display, which is able to transfer information without a contact. Based on the literature review, we concluded that we should focus on airflow-based tactile displays among various non-contact stimulation methods. In my previous work, I proposed the concept of a non-contact wearable tactile display using airflows and explored its feasibility. Focusing on an airflow-based wearable tactile display, I am investigating the expressivity and the feasibility of wearable airflow displays in real-world environments. I expect my dissertation will provide empirical grounds and guidelines for the design of an airflow-based wearable tactile display.	talking tactile tablet;wearable computer	Jaeyeon Lee	2017		10.1145/3131785.3131838	humanâcomputer interaction;wearable computer;computer science;airflow;expressivity;computer vision;stimulation;artificial intelligence;tactile sensor	HCI	-46.8772897894575	-41.22033442170975	49943

In this work, we investigate how people refer to objects in the world during relatively unstructured communication with robots. We collect a corpus of deictic interactions from users describing objects, which we use to train language and gesture models that allow our robot to determine what objects are being indicated. We introduce a temporal extension to stateof-the-art hierarchical matching pursuit features to support gesture understanding, and demonstrate that combining multiple communication modalities more effectively capture user intent than relying on a single type of input. Finally, we present initial interactions with a robot that uses the learned models to follow commands.	interaction;matching pursuit;robot	Cynthia Matuszek;Liefeng Bo;Luke S.

The increasing availability of flexible interactive technologies offers us the opportunity to design devices that adapt to their context of use and opens up new avenues for the design of interaction on a flexible device for 'multi-context interaction'. In this paper, we present initial work in this direction through an explorative pilot study. Interestingly, the participants were rather influenced by standard tactile input gestures and envisioned using these for interaction while taking advantage of the flexible properties of the device for adaptation instead, either to the context or the object to which the device is attached (e.g. pressure input, positioning of the device and deformation).	interaction	Sabrina A.

We propose a new technique for automatically finding and exercising such interactions by analyzing and exercising event handlers registered in the DOM. A basic form of gesture emulation is employed to find states accessible via swiping and tapping. Testing the tool against 6 well-known gesture libraries and 5 actual RIAs, we find that the technique discovers many states and transitions resulting from such interactions, and could be useful for cases such as automatic test generation and error discovery, especially for mobile web applications.	emulator;interaction	Frederik Nakstad;Hironori Washizaki;Yoshiaki Fukazawa	2015	International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering	10.1142/S0218194015710163	rich internet application;simulation;computer science;engineering;crawling;world wide web	SE	-47.91154967818852	-42.933074329325486	50715

The subjects were given the task of deciding which of two virtual springs is the stiffer, these springs being simulated with a PHANToM/sup TM/ force feedback device and displayed on a monoscopic computer screen. The first spring had a realistic behavior, since its visual and haptic displacements were identical. The second spring-the pseudo-haptic one-was stiffer on a haptic basis, but sometimes less stiff on a visual basis. The data collected allowed us to calculate the visual point of subjective equality (PSE) between the two springs, which represents the boundary of the sensory illusion. On average, a high value of PSE turned out to be -24%. This value increased monotonically when the haptic difference between the springs increased. This implies that more visual deformation is necessary to compensate for large haptic differences and qualifies the notion of visual dominance. However, this boundary varies greatly depending on the subjects and their sensory integration strategy. The subjects were sensitive to this illusion to varying degrees.

It is fast and complementary to existing protocols in other ways. For equal overhead, it allows testing over a wider range of users. It is subject to potential biases, but they can be quantified and adjusted. It assumes an existing standard layout which is used as a comparator. It eliminates bias from differing familiarity and finger memory by appropriately mapping both layouts. We illustrate it with two mobile phone keypad layouts: Samsung's variant of the common ABC layout, and a new user-specific layout (PM). We repeat a comparison previously undertaken by a training-based method, which used ten participants, and estimated a $54\%$ speedup for PM (SD = $35\%$). The new method used 116 participants and estimated a $19.5\%$ speedup (SD = $7.5\%$). Differences in speedup estimates can be explained by the wide confidence interval of the training-based methods, differences in test corpuses, and the inherent conservatism of the new method. Effects of user characteristics could be meaningfully tested due to the larger test group. Gender had no detectable effect on any of the measures, but age and keypad experience were significantly related to ABC and PM performance. However, the relative speedup was unaffected by age or keypad experience: the method can remove comparison biases arising from differing experience levels.	communications protocol;comparator;mobile phone;norm (social);overhead (computing);quantifier (logic);speedup;words per minute	Joonseok Lee;Hanggjun Cho;R.

Inspired by natural variations in stroke speed when drawing quickly or with precision, we exploit stroke dynamics to distinguish intentional fine detail from stroke noise. Combining inertia and stroke dynamics, elasticurves can be imagined as the trace of a pen attached to the user by an oscillation-free elastic band. Sketched quickly, the elasticurve spatially lags behind the stroke, smoothing over stroke detail, but catches up and matches the input stroke at slower speeds. Connectors, such as lines or circular-arcs link the evolving elasticurve to the next input point, growing the curve by a responsiveness fraction along the connector. Responsiveness is calibrated, to reflect drawing skill or device noise. Elasticurves are theoretically sound and robust to variations in stroke sampling. Practically, they neaten digital strokes in real-time while retaining the modeless and visceral feel of pen on paper.	fax;mode (computer interface);real-time clock;responsiveness;sampling (signal processing);smoothing	Yannick Thiel;Karan Singh;Ravin Balakrishnan	2011		10.1145/2047196.2047246	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;oscillation;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-38.70896033265901	-38.224355948358095	51093

An effective method of deliberate training is to replicate the required procedures using neurosurgical simulation tools and visualizing a three-dimensional (3D) workspace. However, Augmented Reality (AR) neurosurgical simulators become obsolete for a variety of reasons, including usersu0027 distance underestimation. Few investigations have been conducted for improving usersu0027 depth perception in AR systems with perceptual motion cues through neurosurgical simulation tools for planning aid purposes. In this poster, we are reporting a user study about whether head motion and perceptual motion cues have any an influence on usersu0027 depth perception.	augmented reality;depth perception;effective method;requirement;self-replicating machine;simulation;usability testing;workspace	Hamza Ghandorh;Roy Eagleson;Sandrine de Ribaupierre	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	10.1109/VR.2018.8446580	computer vision;workspace;simulation;task analysis;artificial intelligence;computer science;visualization;perception;effective method;augmented reality;depth perception	Visualization	-44.34615280617006	-47.96405283723761	51399

To more effectively compare the usefulness of the various functionalities and interface features of such systems, we have developed a simulation environment for decision tasks of any scale and structure. Furthermore, we have identified three criteria in an evaluation framework for assessing the quality of such CDSSs: usersâ cognitive effort, preference expression effort, and decision accuracy. A set of experiments carried out in such simulation environments showed that most CDSSs employed in current e-commerce Web sites are suboptimal. On the other hand, a hybrid decision strategy based on four existing ones was found to be more effective. The interface improvements based on the new strategy correspond to some of the advanced tools already developed in the research field. This result is therefore consistent with our earlier work on evaluating CDSSs with real users. That is, some advanced tools do produce more accurate decisions while requiring a comparable amount of user effort. However, the simulation environment will enable us to efficiently compare more advanced tools among themselves, and indicate further opportunities for functionality and interface improvements.	decision support system;decision theory;e-commerce;experiment;parsing expression grammar;performance evaluation;purchasing;simulation	Jiyong Zhang;Pearl Pu	2006	IJEBR	10.4018/jebr.2006070103	e-commerce;decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;decision problem;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-37.805339915374525	-51.532654577662356	51581

One reason for this are time constraints that hinder a replay of a walking sound synchronous to the haptic step feedback when walking. In order to add a matching step feedback to virtual environments, this paper introduces a calibration-free system which can predict the occurrence time of a stepdown event based on an analysis of the userâs gait. For detecting reliable characteristics of the gait, accelerometers and gyroscopes are used that are mounted on the userâs foot. Since the proposed system is capable of detecting the characteristic events in the footâs swing phase, it allows a prediction that gives enough time to replay sound synchronous to the haptic sensation of walking. In order to find the best prediction regarding prediction time and accuracy, data gathered in an experiment is analyzed regarding reliably occurring characteristics in the human gait. Based on this, a suitable prediction algorithm is proposed.	algorithm;auditory processing disorder;feedback;haptic technology;sensor;virtual reality	Markus Zank;Thomas Nescher;Andreas M.

Mobile augmented reality requires highly accurate and fast six degrees of freedom tracking in order to provide registered graphical overlays to a mobile user. With advances in mobile computer hardware, vision-based tracking approaches have the potential to provide efficient solutions that are non-invasive in contrast to the currently dominating marker-based approaches. We propose to use a tracking approach which can use in an unknown environment, i.e. the target has not be known beforehand. The core of the tracker is an on-line learning algorithm, which updates the tracker as new data becomes available. This is suitable in many mobile augmented reality applications. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on tasks where the target objects are not known beforehand, i.e. interactive planing.	3d modeling;algorithm;augmented reality;bing maps platform;boosting (machine learning);computer hardware;computer vision;confluence;fundamental fysiks group;global positioning system;graphical user interface;graphics;microsoft windows;mobile computing;mobile operating system;model checking;motion estimation;online and offline;online machine learning;planar (computer graphics);planning;prototype;sensor;six degrees of separation;software deployment;virtual globe	Gerhard Schall;Helmut Grabner;Michael Grabner;Paul Wohlhart;Dieter Schmalstieg;Horst Bischof	2008	2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops	10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563134	planning;computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;computer science;multimedia;mobile computing	Vision	-39.82825198058511	-40.911580004212205	51913

To know the length of one body segment â such as a thumb â potentially provides a predictive route to other physical characteristics, such as overall standing height. In this study, we examined whether it is feasible that the length of a person's thumb could be revealed from the way in which they From a corpus of approx. 19,000 swipe gestures captured from 178 volunteers, we found that people with longer thumbs complete swipe gestures with shorter completion times, higher speeds and with higher accelerations than people with shorter thumbs. These differences were also observed to exist between our male and female volunteers, along with additional differences in the amount of touch pressure applied to the screen.

Researchers intend to resolve these shortcomings by augmenting traditional systems with human-like interaction capabilities. Knowledge about human emotion, behavior, and intention is necessary to construct convenient interaction mechanisms. Today, dedicated hardware often infers the emotional state from human body measures. Similar to humans interpreting facial expressions, our approach acquires video information using standard hardware that does not interfere with people to accomplish this task. It exploits model-based techniques that accurately localize facial features, seamlessly track them through image sequences, and finally interpret the visible information. We make use of state-of-the-art techniques and specifically adapt most of the components involved to this scenario, which provides high accuracy and real-time capability. We base our experimental evaluation on publicly available databases and compare its results to related approaches. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of our approach and shows promising for integration into various applications.	curve fitting;database;facial recognition system;humanâcomputer interaction;information;loss function;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;modal logic;optimization problem;real-time clock;user interface;world file	Matthias Wimmer;Christoph Mayer;Sylvia Pietzsch;Bernd Radig	2008	First International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interaction	10.1109/ACHI.2008.7	computer vision;human body;speech recognition;computer science;gesture recognition;user interface;proof of concept;facial expression	Robotics	-36.316235909419454	-43.05135060413282	52355

Previous audio-video conferencing systems are abortive in presenting nonverbal behaviors which we, as human, usually use in face to face interaction. Recently, research in teleconferencing systems has expanded to include nonverbal cues of remote person in their distance communication. The accurate representation of non-verbal gestures for such systems is still challenging because they are dependent on hand-operated devices (like mouse or keyboard). Furthermore, they still lack in presenting accurate human gestures. We believe that incorporating embodied interaction in video teleconferencing, (i.e., using the physical world as a medium for interacting with digital technology) can result in nonverbal behavior representation. The experimental platform named Tele-Embodied Agent (TEA) is introduced which incorperates remote person's head gestures to study new paradigm of embodied interaction in video teleconferencing. Our preliminary test shows accuracy (with respect to pose angles) and efficiency (with respect to time) of our proposed design. TEA can be used in medical field, factories, offices, gaming industry, music industry and for training.	digital electronics;embodied agent;interaction;programming paradigm;tea;television	Muhammad Sikandar Lal Khan;Shafiq ur RÃ©hman;Zhihan Lv;Haibo Li	2013		10.1145/2541831.2541876	user-centered design;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;factory;evaluation;operating system;multimedia;communications system	HCI	-47.38501036642418	-38.11734326072318	52587

The method involves overlaying random dot patterns onto a real object surface prior to rendering a virtual object. Results from preliminary experiments have shown that the use of random dot patterns can be effective in contributing to the percept of transparency for the case of flat real surfaces with subtle textures. This suggests that the addition of such patterns may also help in perceiving the correct depth order of virtual objects in such images. Moreover, experimental results indicate that, by controlling the relative dot size and dot density of the patterns, it should be possible also to retain sufficient information about the real surface. Future research should be aimed towards the feasibility and effectiveness of applying this method to more realistic AR conditions.	ar (unix);augmented reality;dots per inch;experiment;stereoscopy	Sanaz Ghasemi;Mai Otsuki;Paul Milgram	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)	10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2016.0086	surface finish;computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-43.14500126573826	-48.606074511327826	52656

In this paper we analyze; firstly, the negative effect of walking on text-input performance, particularly the users' main difficulties and error patterns. We focused our research on thumb typing, since this is a commonly used technique to interact with touch interfaces. Secondly, we analyze how these effects can be compensated by two-hand interaction and increasing target size. We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy. We finish with implications for future designs.	poor posture;touch typing;virtual keyboard;while	Hugo Nicolau;Joaquim A.

Typically, a linear function is employed such that the progress of the bar is directly proportional to how much work has been completed. However, numerous factors cause progress bars to proceed at non-linear rates. Additionally, humans perceive time in a non-linear way. This paper explores the impact of various progress bar behaviors on user perception of process duration. The results are used to suggest several design considerations that can make progress bars appear faster and ultimately improve users' computing experience.	linear function;nonlinear system;user interface	Chris Harrison;Brian Amento;Stacey Kuznetsov;Robert Bell	2007		10.1145/1294211.1294231	simulation;computer experiment;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;user interface;time perception	HCI	-48.15690305555789	-50.25732972914394	52703

This novel interface introduces filters by communities, and network structure, as well as ranking of tweets. It aims to improving content discovery, while maintaining content relevance and sense of user control. Participants in the US and the UK interacted with the interface in semi-structured interviews. In two iterations of the same study (n=4, n=8), we found that the interface gave users a sense of control. Users asked for an active selection of communities, and a more fine-grained functionality for saving individual âfavoriteâ users. Users also highlighted unanticipated uses of the interface such as iteratively discovering new communities to follow, and organizing events. Informed by these studies, we propose improvements and a mock-up for an interface to be used for future larger scale experiments for exploring microblog content.	content discovery platform;experiment;iteration;mock object;organizing (structure);relevance;scientific visualization;semiconductor industry;tree traversal;user interface	Nava Tintarev;Byungkyu Kang;Tobias HÃ¶llerer;John O'Donovan	2015			microblogging;formative assessment;data mining;computer science;ranking;social media	HCI	-33.94362486472501	-49.96340483820225	53348

In our recent work, we have demonstrated AUDIBLE, an auditory system capable of sound source localization, tracking and separation in real-time, using an array of eight microphones and running on a laptop computer. The system is able to localize and track up to four sources, while separating up to three sources in real-time in noisy environments. Signal processing techniques can be quite computer intensive, and the question of making it possible for this system to run on platforms that cannot carry a laptop computer onboard can be raised. This paper reports our investigation of the appropriate compromises to be made to AUDIBLE's implementation in order to port the system on an embedded DSP (Digital Signal Processor) platform. The DSP implementation is fully functional and performs well with minor limitations compared to the original system i.e., limitations on sound source duration and on the number of sources that can be processed simultaneously. Results demonstrate that it is feasible to port AUDIBLE on embedded platforms, opening up its use in field applications such as human-robot interaction in real life settings.	algorithm;computer data storage;covox speech thing;digital signal processor;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;fixed-point arithmetic;humanârobot interaction;internationalization and localization;laptop;microphone;mobile robot;performance;real life;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;sampling (signal processing);signal processing	Simon BriÃ¨re;Jean-Marc Valin;FranÃ§ois Michaud;Dominic LÃ©tourneau	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543740	mobile robot;embedded system;electronic engineering;acoustics;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;signal processing	Robotics	-36.614576611917286	-43.05765808452664	53584
f1c0664af9eed603c41af2b8f5536d186572e134	preliminary environment mapping for redirected walking		Redirected walking applications allow a user to explore large virtual environments in a smaller physical space by employing so-called redirection techniques. To further improve the immersion of a virtual experience, path planner algorithms were developed which choose redirection techniques based on the current position and orientation of the user. In order to ensure a reliable performance, planning algorithms depend on accurate position tracking using an external tracking system. However, the disadvantage of such a tracking method is the time-consuming preparation of the physical environment which renders the system immobile. A possible solution to eliminate this dependency is to replace the external tracking system with a state-of-the-art inside-out tracker based on the concept of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In this paper, we present an approach in which we attach a commercially available SLAM device to a head-mounted display to track the head motion of a user. From sensor recordings of the device, we construct a map of the surrounding environment for future processing in an existing path planner for redirected walking.

Socially assistive robotics (SAR) is a subcategory of HRI that focuses on providing assistance through hands-off interactions. We have developed a SAR architecture that facilitates multiple task-oriented interactions between a user and a robot agent. The architecture accommodates a variety of inputs, tasks, and interaction modalities that are used to provide relevant, real-time feedback to the participant. We have implemented the architecture and validated its technological feasibility in a small pilot study in which a SAR agent led three post-stroke individuals through an exercise scenario.

ee87596d8e36199f4bbbdabf9318eeabf146b163	getting fast, free, and anonymous answers to questions asked by people with visual impairments		Much of the information we encounter in daily life is visual. For people with visual impairments, this information is not inherently accessible. Technology can be used to provide access to this visual information, through automated tools like currency identifiers, object recognizers, and optical character recognition, which allow for immediate access to visual information in a users' environment. However, these tools are often are limited to a specific domain, and can fail in non-ideal conditions (e.g., an optical character recognition tool trying to identify handwritten text).  By incorporating people into the information access pipeline, human-powered tools can allow for more complex information to be extracted from the user's surroundings. Human-powered access tools connect people who have disabilities to other people who can access information on their behalf. While people may not be as quick as automated tools, the person answering can make inferences based on prior knowledge and experiences, ask for clarification, and reason over the information provided.  In this article, we explore the long-term public deployment and lessons learned from VizWiz Social, a human-powered access tool that connects people with visual impairments to sighted workers or friends and family members who can answer their visual questions. By analyzing the use of this service, and running controlled experiments to determine how users value different answer sources, we have been able to build upon the original VizWiz design to create social microvolunteering, a method for getting fast, free, and anonymous answers to visual questions.	experience;experiment;finite-state machine;identifier;information access;optical character recognition;software deployment	Erin Brady	2015	ACM SIGACCESS	10.1145/2809915.2809918	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-36.87006577721317	-49.088443371324004	54000

However, vibration is often perceived as a rather artificial, even unpleasant cue. We explore a novel method based on pneumatic cues to provide a more natural tactile output. We use two airbags positioned at the back of the user, at shoulder height to give navigational cues. We utilize the shoulder tap metaphor to give directions to the left, right or ahead. We compare the pneumatic cue to vibro-tactile cue at the same position. Our Results show, that the pneumatic cue was rated as significantly less urgent than vibro-tactile cue. As there were no significant differences in error rate, annoyance and usability, we rate ShoulderTap as eligible alternative to vibro-tactile cues.	automation;cue tone;depth perception;encode;prototype;usability	Tim Claudius Stratmann;Shadan Sadeghian Borojeni;Wilko Heuten;Susanne C.

85aecede8a244357456e5316aa93f6294934989e	a process for anticipating and executing icon selection in graphical user interfaces	pointing device;user preferences;graphic user interface	This article presents a system for predicting the icon a user will select from an icon toolbar, based on command use frequency and mouse trajectory. The system differs from previous systems in two important ways: First, the prediction system does not initiate any action. Instead, it predicts where the mouse is moving and subtly âsuggestsâ a command for the user to verify. Second, the system takes into account the relative likelihood of commands being used when making its predictions. Initial testing suggested that a system that only predicted the most frequently used icon choices was better than one that predicted all choices. A study with 12 test users using a mouse and 10 using a trackpad found substantial benefits of this âlimited prediction system.â The system resulted in a mean reduction in time to issue a command of 41% for trackpad users and 25% for mouse users. Trackpad users, but not mouse users, preferred the prediction system to the traditional way of pointing. These results suggest that a prediction system such as the one described here has the potential to reduce the time and effort required to issue commands. The utility of the system appears to be especially great in laptops and other devices that use trackpads as their primary pointing devices.	computer mouse;graphical user interface;laptop;touchpad	David M.

In general, the input language is a function of the command language, while the command language can be any language defined by the system designer. The relationship between these languages is modeled using fuzzy set theory, and a fuzzy command grammar that forms a coherent framework for intelligent human-computer interface designs is defined. To test the validity of these hypotheses, an interface was designed, using fuzzy command grammars, that is consistent, context-dependent, user-sensitive, adaptive, and responsive in interactions; and provides user and system initiated help; and that reduces unnecessary interruptions in dialogues by error correction. Experimental results indicate that a fuzzy command grammar is a viable alternative for designing such interfaces. >		Hikmet Senay	1992	IEEE Trans.

To browse information on such workspaces, two prominent spatially-aware navigation techniques, peephole, and direct off-screen pointing, have been proposed as alternatives to the standard on-screen flick and pinch gestures. Previous studies have shown that both techniques can outperform on-screen gestures in various user tasks, but no prior study has compared the three techniques in a map-based analytic task. In this paper, we examine these two spatially-aware techniques and compare their efficiency to on-screen gestures in a map navigation and exploration scenario. Our study demonstrates that peephole and direct off-screen pointing allows for 30% faster navigation times between workspace locations and that on-screen flick and pinch is superior for accurate retrieval of workspace content.	browsing;mobile device;peephole optimization;viewport;workspace	Khalad Hasan;David AhlstrÃ¶m;Pourang Irani	2015		10.1145/2788940.2788957	computer vision;simulation;engineering;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.330543679357916	-45.867624001849435	55293

First, we present a model of the activity of visiting a museum which has emerged both from the state of the art and also from a number of observations made by the author. This model is comprised of two types of activity experienced by the observer of an artwork: sensitive activity and analytical activity. We then explain the methodology of the experiments and the results. We identify three schemes of interaction between the visitor and the mobile guide, and we describe these schemes and their impact on the activity of visiting a museum. Finally this model allows us to determine future directions for the design of mobile augmented reality tools for visiting museums.	augmented reality;experiment	Anne Bationo Tillon;Isabelle Marchal;Pascal Houlier	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality - Arts, Media, and Humanities	10.1109/ISMAR-AMH.2011.6093655	augmented reality;simulation;visualization;painting;computer science;operating system;multimedia;mobile computing;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-44.10184416914261	-41.43690864859347	55306

The resulting video maps are stored on separate refresh bands of the rotating memory. The two output signals are connected to separate color guns of a color television monitor, thus creating a superimposed image on the screen. Optical separation is achieved by viewing the image through color filters.

Each type has its proponents and each has been reported as successful in experimental trials, however, no direct experimental comparisons of the two approaches have been reported. We have therefore conducted a series of experiments directly comparing them on a range of measures. In this paper, we present results from a study in which we used a directional line drawing task to compare user performance with these two popular forms of wearable tactile display. We also investigated whether user performance was affected by a match between the plane of the tactile interface and the plane in which the users drew the perceived directions. Finally, we investigated the effect of adding a complementary visual display. The touch screen display on which participants drew the perceived directions presented either a blank display or a visual display of a map indicating eight directions from a central roundabout, corresponding to the eight directions indicated by the tactile stimuli. We found that participants performed significantly faster and more accurately with the belt than with the array whether they had a vertical screen or a horizontal screen. We found no difference in performance with the map display compared to the blank display.	experiment;line drawing algorithm;roundabout;tactile imaging;touchscreen;wearable computer	Mayuree Srikulwong;Eamonn O'Neill	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15841-4_15	computer vision;simulation;engineering;communication	HCI	-45.84525615028186	-46.52463098938721	55486

Simulation results with exhibition of interactive painting games show that we can achieve a low cost and effective HMI by using a video camera only.	computer monitor;displacement mapping;humanâcomputer interaction;image processing;liquid-crystal display;polystation;simulation;user interface	Jun-Ren Ding;Jiun-Yu Chen;Fu-Chun Yang;Jar-Ferr Yang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518075	computer vision;computer science;liquid-crystal display;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-41.393076349759056	-39.70674860499043	55514

Our prototype enables mobile devices to be components of a tangible interface where each device can serve as both, a touch sensing display and as a tangible item for interaction. The only necessary modification is the attachment of a conductive 2D touch pattern on each device. Compared to existing approaches, our Active Commodity Tangible User Interfaces (ACTUI) can display graphical output directly on their built-in display paving the way to a plethora of innovative applications where the diverse combination of local and global active display area can significantly enhance the exibility and effectiveness of the interaction. We explore two exemplary application scenarios where we demonstrate the potential of ACTUI.	attachments;graphical user interface;mobile device;prototype;software deployment;tangible user interface	Ming Li;Leif Kobbelt	2015		10.1145/2786567.2792895	public records;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia	HCI	-45.308737098059694	-39.44901865561565	55770
c7c146d5120f9d8315e148993da056df1fbd2697	a two-stage model for user's examination behavior in mobile search		With the rapid growth of mobile search, it is important to understand how users browse the mobile SERPs and allocate their limited attention to each result. To address this problem, we introduce a two-stage examination model that can separately capture the position bias with a skimming model and the attractiveness bias with an attractiveness model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by using a dataset that contains explicit examination feedbacks from users. We further investigate userÂ»s examination behaviors by analyzing the model parameters learned via EM algorithm. The results reveal some interesting findings such as how the skimming behavior is dependent on the previous examination sequence and what factors are associated with the attractiveness of search results on mobile SERPs.	biasâvariance tradeoff;browsing;expectationâmaximization algorithm;eye tracking;feedback;usability testing;viewport	Jiaxin Mao;Yiqun Liu;Noriko Kando;Zexue He;Min Zhang;Shaoping Ma	2018		10.1145/3176349.3176891	mobile search;data mining;computer science;attractiveness;expectationâmaximization algorithm	Web+IR	-34.82680764759151	-50.912561421105906	55807

The experimental DW involves hierarchical levels and contains information about customers profiles and related purchase items. A user study has been carried out to compare two navigation and selection techniques. Sixteen volunteers were instructed to explore the DW and look for information using the interaction techniques, involving either a single WiimoteTM (monomanual) or both WiimoteTM and NunchuckTM (bimanual). Results indicated that the bimanual interaction technique is more efficient in terms of speed and error rate. Moreover, most of the participants preferred the bimanual interaction technique and found it more appropriate for the exploration task. We also observed that males were faster and made less errors than females for both interaction techniques.	dreamwidth;graphics;haptic technology;interaction technique;multimodal interaction;usability testing;virtual reality	Hamza Hamdi;Eulalie Verhulst;Paul Richard	2017		10.5220/0006130400750083	computer-mediated reality;artificial reality;metaverse;mixed reality	HCI	-45.930388007701566	-47.186839747519905	56008

We first identify and study the parameters of a mobile true-3D projection, in terms of the projection's distance to the phone, angle to the phone, display volume and position within the display. We identify suitable parameters and constraints, which we propose as requirements for developing mobile true-3D systems. We build on the first outcomes to explore methods for coordinating the display configurations of the mobile true-3D setup. We explore the resulting design space through two applications: 3D map navigation and 3D interior design. We discuss the implications of our results for the future design of mobile true-3D displays.	requirement	Marcos Serrano;Dale Hildebrandt;Sriram Subramanian;Pourang Irani	2014		10.1145/2628363.2628375	computer vision;simulation;computer science;operating system;display device;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.08759166442222	-41.22910834144374	56050

Their ability to physically mutate provides users with an additional information channel that facilitates a range of new applications including collaboration and tangible entertainment while enhancing familiar applications such as terrain modelling by allowing 3D scenes to be rendered in a physical-3D manner. Through a mobile 3x3 custom built prototype, we examine the design space around Tilt Displays, categorise output modalities and conduct two user studies. The first, an exploratory study examines users' initial impressions of Tilt Displays and probes potential interactions and uses. The second takes a quantitative approach to understand interaction possibilities with such displays, resulting in the production of two user-defined gesture sets: one for manipulating the surface of the Tilt Display, the second for conducting everyday interactions.	apache axis;categorization;interaction;prototype;terrain rendering;usability testing	Jason Alexander;AndrÃ©s Lucero;Sriram Subramanian	2012		10.1145/2371574.2371600	computer vision;interaction;simulation;computer science;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.059044949614986	-41.21883105174964	56065
c96791fe470f0e92cc98bc4493ef1010d16af7c8	âwow! i have six fingers!â: would you accept structural changes of your hand in vr?	embodiment;virtual characters;virtual reality;ownership;avatars;perception;avatar	With the increasing demand in virtual reality applications and games, the need to understand how users perceive their virtual representation (avatar) is becoming more and more important. In particular, with the potential of virtual reality to alter and control avatars in different ways, the user representation in the virtual world does not always necessarily match the user body structure. In this context, this paper explores how users would accept as their own a six-digit realistic virtual hand. By measuring participantsâ senses of ownership (i.e., the impression that the virtual hand is actually our own hand) and agency (i.e., the impression to be able to control the actions of the virtual hand), we somehow evaluate the possibility of creating a Six-Finger Illusion in VR. We measured these two dimensions of virtual embodiment in a virtual reality experiment where participants performed two tasks successively: (1) a self-manipulation task inducing visuomotor feedback, where participants mimicked finger movements presented in the virtual scene and (2) a visuotactile task inspired by Rubber Hand Illusion protocols, where an experimenter stroked the hand of the user with a brush. The real and virtual brushes were synchronously stroking the participantsâ real and virtual hand, and in the case when the virtual brush was stroking the additional virtual digit, the real ring finger was also synchronously stroked to provide consistent tactile stimulation and elicit a sense of embodiment. Results of the experiment show that participants did experience high levels of ownership and agency of the six-digit virtual hand as a whole. We found higher levels of ownership and agency for the additional finger when the hand was fully animated, compared to a control group where the additional digit was not animated. Through the presented experiment, we found that participants responded positively to the possibility of controlling the six-digit hand despite the structural difference, and accepted the sixdigit virtual hand and individual digits as their own to some extent. These results bring preliminary insights about how avatar with structural differences can affect the senses of ownership and agency experienced by users in VR.	avatar (computing);virtual reality;virtual world	Ludovic Hoyet;Ferran Argelaguet;Corentin Nicole;Anatole LÃ©cuyer	2016	Front.

We examined the relative importance of distance and angular information about landmarks in place learning. Participants repeatedly learned a target location in relation to three distinct landmarks in an immersive computer-generated (virtual) environment. Later, during testing, they attempted to return to that location. The configurations of landmarks used during testing were altered from those participants learned in order to separate the effects of metric distance information and information about inter-landmark angles. In general, participants showed greater reliance on distance information than angular information. This reliance was affected by nonmetric relationships present during learning, as well as by the degree to which the learned environment contained right or straight angles.	angularjs;computer-generated holography	David Waller;Jack M.

The addition of touch is important extra information that can add another dimension to the realism of the experience. Progress in networking these systems together over long distances has been held back, principally because the latency of the network can induce severe instability in any dynamic objects in the scene. This paper describes techniques allowing long-distance sharing of haptic-enabled, dynamic scenes. At the CSIRO Virtual Environments Laboratory, we have successfully used this system to connect a prototype of a surgical-simulation application between participants on opposite sides of the world in Sweden and Australia, over a standard Internet connection spanning 3 continents and 2 oceans. The users were able to simultaneously manipulate pliable objects in a shared workspace, as well as guide each other's hands (and shake hands!) over 22,000 km (13620 miles) of Internet connection. The main obstacle to overcome was the latency-induced instability in the system, caused by the delays and jitter inherent in the network. Our system involved a combination of an event-collection mechanism, a network event-forwarding mechanism and a pseudophysics mechanism. We found that the resulting behavior of the interconnected body organs, under simultaneous-user manipulation, was sufficiently convincing to be considered for training surgical procedures.	algorithm;collaborative virtual environment;communications satellite;file spanning;haptic technology;instability;internet;interrupt latency;prototype;server (computing);shake;simulation;virtual reality;workspace	Chris Gunn	2005	Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments	10.1162/105474605323384663	simulation;computer science;virtual machine;artificial intelligence;operating system;multimedia;haptic technology	Visualization	-41.75898854724464	-50.09604869667099	56483

In this paper, a technique is proposed for synthesizing tactile vibrational signals based on the ability to measure surface structure by the use of multiple photographic images taken at different illumination angles. The vibrational signal of the tactile device is synthesized using natural noise. The virtual reality system consists of a 3D visual display, a force feedback device and a vibration tactile sensation device.	algorithm;haptic technology;virtual reality	Xin Yin;Kazuyoshi Nomura;Hiromi T.

In this paper we study the properties of mobile-based interaction with O+D interfaces on 3D public displays. We evaluate three types of existing interaction techniques for the 3D translation of the Detail view: touchscreen input, mid-air movement of the mobile device (Mid-Air Phone) and mid-air movement of the hand around the device (Mid-Air Hand). In a first experiment, we compare the performance and user preference of these three types of techniques with previous training. In a second experiment, we study how well the two mid-air techniques perform with no training or human help to imitate usual conditions in public context. Results reveal that Mid-Air Phone and Hand perform best with training. However, without training or human help Mid-Air Phone is more intuitive and performs better on the first trial. Interestingly, on both experiments users preferred Mid-Air Hand. We conclude with a discussion on the use of mobile devices to interact with public O+D interfaces.	air-ground radiotelephone service;experiment;interaction technique;mobile device;smartphone;touchscreen	L.

4e61ddc6abd6fba1f5a009122dcf0ca71f6f1b3f	impact of virtual environments on motivation and engagement during exergames		Video games and sport are an essential part in the life of millions of people. With recent advances of immersive virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR, the use of virtual environments (VE) for exergames is becoming more and more popular. An exergame combines a physical activity with video game elements by tracking body movements or reactions of user, attempting to engage users in a more enjoyable system. In this paper, we present the results of a subjective experiment carried out with the aim to compare different kinds of virtual environments with each other. A rowing ergometer, connected either to a virtual reality system using a head-mounted display (HMD) or to a CAVE environment, was used as an exergame device. While for rowing experts, fitness and performance improvements are of major interest, we wanted to focus on the motivation and engagement of non-professionals. By means of a series of questionnaires and a follow-up interview, the Quality of Experience of participants using the system was assessed. Measurements include concepts such as flow, presence, video quality and well-being. Results show significant advantages of the HMD as well as of the CAVE compared to a system without a VE for the overall quality, system feedback, and flow. While the CAVE and HMD system mainly differed in their autotelic experience, the HMD was favored by the majority of participants due to a superior feeling of presence.	htc vive;head-mounted display;immersion (virtual reality);oculus rift;playstation vr;presence information;video;virtual reality	Steven Schmidt;Patrick Ehrenbrink;Benjamin Weiss;Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons;Tanja Kojic;Andrew Johnston;Sebastian MÃ¶ller	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)	10.1109/QoMEX.2018.8463389	multimedia;rowing;feeling;immersion (virtual reality);flow (psychology);quality of experience;video quality;virtual reality;computer science;autotelic	Visualization	-48.15585567619803	-50.67414332618934	57284

Key frames extracted directly from video inform users about content without requiring them to view the entire video. As part of ongoing work to develop video browsing interfaces, several interface displays based on key frames were investigated. Variations on dynamic key frame """"slide shows"""" were examined and compared to a static key frame """"filmstrip"""" display. The slide show mechanism displays key frames in rapid succession and is designed to facilitate visual browsing by exploiting human perceptual capabilities. User studies were conducted in a series of three experiments. Key frame display rate, number of simultaneous displays, and user perception were investigated as a function of user performance in object recognition and gist determination tasks. No significant performance degradation was detected at display rates up to 8 key frames per second, but performance degraded significantly at higher rates. Performance on gist determination tasks degraded less severely than performance on object recognition tasks as display rates increased. Furthermore, gist determination performance dropped significantly between three and four simultaneous slide shows in a single display. Users generally preferred key frame filmstrips to dynamic displays, although objective measures of performance were mixed.

Several techniques have been suggested to facilitate this task, for instance, by reducing the required movement distance. Here we measure the natural coordination of eye and mouse pointer control across several search and selection tasks. We find that users automatically minimize the distance to likely targets in an intelligent, task dependent way. When target location is highly predictable, top-down knowledge can enable users to initiate pointer movements prior to target fixation. These findings question the utility of existing assistive pointing techniques and suggest that alternative approaches might be more effective.	computer mouse;graphical user interface;pointer (computer programming);pointer (user interface);top-down and bottom-up design	Hans-Joachim Bieg;Lewis L.

Especially in multi-person HRI, this function becomes more important because of its adaptation to changes of a speaker's and/or object's locations. We implement our method for multi-person HRI system on the android Actroid-SIT, and conduct two experiments for estimating the precision of gestures and the human impressions about the Actroid.

Our aim is to shed light on the subjective preferences and practical perceptual limits of stereo vision with respect to cardboarding. We present three experiments that explore the consequences of displaying simple scenes with reduced depths using both subjective ratings and adjustments and objective sensitivity metrics. Our results suggest that compressing depth to 80% or above is likely to be acceptable, whereas sensitivity to the cardboarding artifact below 30% is very high.

744d07a91b8b8dc6f82bed866537d98f1d09742a	step aside: an initial exploration of gestural input for lateral movement during walking-in-place locomotion		Walking-in-place (WIP) techniques provide users with a relatively natural way of walking in virtual reality. However, previous research has primarily focused on WIP during forward movement and tasks involving turning. Thus, little is known about what gestures to use in combination with WIP in order to enable sidestepping. This paper presents two user studies comparing three different types of gestures based on movement of the hip, leaning of the torso, and actual sidesteps. The first study focuses on purely lateral movement while the second involves both forward and lateral movement. The results of both studies suggest that leaning yielded significantly more natural walking experiences and this gesture also produced significantly less positional drift.	drift plus penalty;experience;futures studies;in-place algorithm;lateral thinking;lean integration;obstacle avoidance;usability testing;virtual body;virtual reality	C Wang;Oana A.

In a previous study, we reported three automated methods for generating audio-video summaries and a user evaluation of those methods. An open question remained about how well various text/image only techniques will compare to the audio-video summarizations. This study attempts to fill that gap. This paper reports a user study that compares four possible ways of allowing a user to skim a presentation: 1) PowerPoint slides used by the speaker during the presentation, 2) the text transcript created by professional transcribers from the presentation, 3) the transcript with important points highlighted by the speaker, and 4) a audio-video summary created by the speaker. Results show that although some text-only conditions can match the audio-video summary, users have a marginal preference for audio-video (ANOVA f=3.067, p=0.087). Furthermore, different styles of slide-authoring (e.g., detailed vs. big-points only) can have a big impact on their effectiveness as summaries, raising a dilemma for some speakers in authoring for on-demand previewing versus that for live audiences.	browsing;imperative programming;marginal model;smart common input method;text-based user interface;usability testing	Li-wei He;Elizabeth Sanocki;Anoop Gupta;Jonathan Grudin	2000		10.1145/332040.332427	speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;pevq	HCI	-37.198132302768535	-49.48857287454988	59006

We discuss several design variations and user testing of two-handed navigation techniques, including puck and stylus input on a Wacom tablet, as well as a novel design incorporating a touchpad (for the nonpreferred hand) and a mouse (for the preferred hand). To support the latter technique, we introduce a new input device, the TouchMouse, which is a standard mouse augmented with a pair of one-bit touch sensors, one for the palm and one for the index finger. Finally, we propose several enhancements to Buxtonâs three-state model of graphical input and extend this model to encompass two-handed input transactions as well.	desktop computer;graphical user interface;input device;interaction technique;sensor;stylus (computing);tablet computer;three-state logic;touchpad;user research	Ken Hinckley;Mary Czerwinski;Mike Sinclair	1998		10.1145/288392.288572	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia;input device	HCI	-46.287855868230764	-42.45609921547855	59097

This paper studies continuous authentication for touch interface based mobile devices. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based behavioral template training approach is presented, which does not require training data from other subjects other than the owner of the mobile device and can get updated with new data over time. The gesture patterns of the user are modeled from multiple sensors - touch, accelerometer and gyroscope data using a continuous left-right HMM. The approach models the tap and stroke patterns of a user since these are the basic and most frequently used interactions on a mobile device. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method a new data set has been created from 42 users who interacted with off-the-shelf applications on their smart phones. Results show that the performance of the proposed approach is promising and potentially better than other state-of-the-art approaches.	authentication;gyroscope;hidden markov model;interaction;markov chain;mobile device;sensor;smartphone;touch user interface	Aditi Roy;Tzipora Halevi;Nasir D.

Unlike 3D modelling techniques, the required human work and computation are independent of the amounts of detail and complexity that exist in the scene, and in addition they provide great visual realism. In this study we created virtual environments using three different photo-realistic techniques: panoramic video, regular video, and a slide show of panoramic still images. While panoramic video offered continuous movement and the ability to interactively change the view, it was the most expensive and time consuming to produce among the three techniques. To assess whether the extra effort needed to create panoramic video is warranted, we analysed how effectively each of these techniques supported a sense of presence in participants. We analysed participants' subjective sense of presence in the context of a navigation task where they travelled along a route in a VE and tried to learn the relative locations of the landmarks on the route. Participants' sense of presence was highest in the panoramic video condition. This suggests that the effort in creating panoramic video might be warranted whenever high presence is desired.

We conducted a study to investigate whether users can find these targets while walking, comparing their performance when using only haptic feedback to that when using an equivalent visual system. The results are encouraging, and here we present our findings, discussing their significance and issues relevant to the design of future systems that combine haptics with location awareness.	haptic technology;information discovery;location awareness;prototype;spontaneous order	Simon Robinson;Parisa Eslambolchilar;Matt Jones	2009		10.1145/1671011.1671022	computer vision;simulation;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-46.676643049495894	-44.287049104021655	59384

This method is an essential part of our augmented desk interface in which a user can, with natural hand gestures, simultaneously manipulate both physical objects and electronically projected objects on a desk, e.g., a textbook and related WWW pages. Previous tracking methods which are typically based on color segmentation or background subtraction simply do not perform well in this type of application because an observed color of human skin and image backgrounds may change signi cantly due to projection of various objects onto a desk. In contrast, our proposed method was shown to be e ective even in such a challenging situation through demonstration in our augmented desk interface. This paper describes the details of our tracking method as well as typical applications in our augmented desk interface.	background subtraction;general-purpose modeling;image processing;image segmentation;image subtraction;lcd projector;template matching;video projector;www	Yoichi Sato;Yoshinori Kobayashi;Hideki Koike	2000		10.1109/AFGR.2000.840675	computer vision;augmented reality;finger tracking;the internet;template matching;computer science;pattern matching;image sensor;gesture recognition;tracking;multimedia;image segmentation;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-38.738076600751235	-42.11858384667582	59710

In this paper, we outline a method for computing target points to the FRONT, LEFT, RIGHT, and BEHIND segmented objects in evidence grid maps built using range data on a mobile robot. This method uses the segmented objects and their contour points to calculate eigenvectors which can be used to calculate the LEFT, RIGHT, FRONT, and BEHIND points.

Their unique position on the useru0027s face opens interesting opportunities for interactive sensing. In this paper, we describe EyeSpyVR, a software-only eye sensing approach for smartphone-based VR, which uses a phoneu0027s front facing camera as a sensor and its display as a passive illuminator. Our proof-of-concept system, using a commodity Apple iPhone, enables four sensing modalities: detecting when the VR head set is worn, detecting blinks, recognizing the weareru0027s identity, and coarse gaze tracking - features typically found in high-end or specialty VR headsets. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of EyeSpyVR in a series of studies with 70 participants, finding a worn detection of 100%, blink detection rate of 95.3%, family user identification accuracy of 81.4%, and mean gaze tracking error of 10.8Â° when calibrated to the wearer (12.9Â° without calibration). These sensing abilities can be used by developers to enable new interactive features and more immersive VR experiences on existing, off-the-shelf hardware.	eye tracking;illuminator (backlight);interactivity;prototype;sensor;smartphone;usability testing;virtual reality	Karan Ahuja;Rahul Islam;Varun Parashar;Kuntal Dey;Chris Harrison;Mayank Goel	2018	IMWUT	10.1145/3214260	immersion (virtual reality);virtual reality;computer vision;artificial intelligence;eye tracking;computer science	HCI	-45.105357149727055	-43.425745014512785	60155

The simulator lets us measure under what conditions a robot makes someone feel intrigued, or alarmed, or unconcerned, extending to nonhumanoids the studies of emotion that have been done for robots with facial expressions. This better model of how the virtual robot is perceived lets us agilely improve its appearance and behavior, containing the combinatorial explosion of parameters to study in costlier real-world experiments. The residence and the robot are rendered with Unity, and viewed with an Oculus Rift. Audio corresponding to flight maneuvers is resynthesized from recordings of an actual quadrotor. Flight dynamics using L1 adaptive control run in MATLAB and Simulink. Through menus operated by a Leap Motion hand tracker, the human subject commands the quadrotor to fly to various rooms (Unity waypoints), along precomputed paths that avoid collisions. The flight path is varied through a mathematical mapping to Laban Motion Factors (e.g., directness, sustainedness, lightness, and boundness) to provoke a range of responses. The subjectâs emotion is estimated from heart rate, skin conductance, and head tilt from the Riftâs IMU (which is a quick metric for discomfort level). âe-mail: marinho@illinois.edu ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research is supported in part by the NSFâs National Robotics Initiative, and by the Graduate College at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Since this interface relies on the biosignals originating from the contraction of muscles on the face during particular movements, even individuals with a paralyzed limb can use it with ease. For real-world application, a dedicated hardware module employing a general-purpose DSP was implemented and its validity tested on an electrically powered wheelchair. Furthermore, an additional attempt to reduce error rates to a minimum for stable operation was also made based on the entropy information inherent in the signals during the classification phase. In the experiments in which 11 subjects participated, it was found most of them could control the target system at their own will, and thus the proposed interface could be considered a potential alternative for the interaction of the severely handicapped with electronic systems.

Compensatory decision-making strategies are used when the consumer fully rationalizes their decision outcome whereas non-compensatory decision-making strategies are used when the consumer considers only that information which has most meaning to them at the time of decision. When designing online shopping support tools, incorporating these decision-making strategies with the goal of personalizing the design of the user interface may enhance the overall quality and satisfaction of the consumerâs shopping experiences. This paper presents work towards this goal. The authors describe research that refines a previously developed procedure, using techniques in cluster analysis and rough sets, to obtain consumer information needed in support of designing customizable and personalized user interface enhancements. The authors further refine their procedure by examining and evaluating techniques in traditional association mining, specifically conducting experimentation using the Eclat algorithm for use with the authorsâ previous work. A summary discussing previous work in relation to the new evaluation is provided. Results are analyzed and opportunities for future work are described.	algorithm;association rule learning;cluster analysis;decision support system;online shopping;personalization;purchasing;rough set;user interface	Timothy Maciag;Daryl H.

In specific contextual situations, capacitive touch interfaces used on current mobile devices are not accessible when, for example, wearing gloves during a cold winter. Although the market has responded by providing capacitive styluses or touchscreen-compatible gloves, these solutions are not widely accepted and appropriate in such particular situations. Using the nose instead of fingers is an easy way to overcome this problem. In this paper, we present in-depth results of a user study on nose-based interaction. The study was complemented by an online survey to elaborate the potential and acceptance of the nose-based interaction style. Based on the insights gained in the study, we identify the main challenges of nose-based interaction and contribute to the state of the art of design principles for this interaction style by adding two new design principles and refining one already existing principle. In addition, we investigated in the emotional effect of nose-based interaction based on the user experiences evolved during the user study.	mobile device;smart device;touchscreen;usability testing;wired glove	Ondrej PolÃ¡cek;Thomas Grill;Manfred Tscheligi	2013		10.1145/2541831.2541867	simulation	HCI	-48.0328381855577	-41.54548737241113	60702

The prototype system is equipped with a set of simple sensors, such as three-axis acceleration sensor and distance sensor. Our system estimates three walking states to control the application of the brake. Emergency strong brake can be predicted to prevent and/or forestall a fall. Individual characteristics related to brake control can be acquired within a short time and taken effect. In this paper, the implementation of brake control assist and its evaluations from performance and usability points of view are presented.

We investigated experimentally how humans perceive geometric figures in geometric proportional analogies and discovered that subjects perceive structures within the figures which are suitable for solving the analogy. Humans do not perceive the elements within a figure individually or separately, but cognize the figure as a structured whole. Furthermore, the perception of each figure in the series of analogous figures is influenced by the context of the whole analogy. A computational model which shall reflect human cognition of geometric figures must be flexible enough to adapt the representation of a geometric figure and produce a similarly structured representation as humans do while solving the analogy. Furthermore, it must be able to take into account the context, i.e. structures and transformations in other geometric figures in the analogy.	cognition;computation;computational model;do while loop;experiment;geometric modeling;humans	Angela Schwering;Kai-Uwe KÃ¼hnberger;Ulf Krumnack;Helmar Gust	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03832-7_2	computer simulation;cognition;developmental psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication;adaptation	Vision	-41.721281065082366	-51.99907623305053	60911

Head-mounted displays (HMDs), however, use displays and optical elements in front of a user's eyes, which often do not natively support a wide field of view to stimulate the entire human visual field. Such limited visual angles are often identified as causes of reduced navigation performance and sense of presence.  In this paper we present an approach to extend the visual field of HMDs towards the periphery by incorporating additional optical LED elements structured in an array, which provide additional low-resolution information in the periphery of a user's eyes. We detail our approach, technical realization, and present an experiment, in which we show that such far peripheral stimulation can increase subjective estimates of presence, and has the potential to change user behavior during navigation in a virtual environment.	anomalous experiences;head-mounted display;peripheral vision;spatialâtemporal reasoning;virtual reality;visual basic[.net]	Paul Lubos;Gerd Bruder;Oscar Ariza;Frank Steinicke	2016		10.1145/2927929.2927939	computer vision;engineering;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.27106495179764	-46.69403763619055	60977

When the user's situation, place or activity changes, the functionality of the device should adapt to these changes. In this work we propose a layered real-time architecture for this kind of context-aware adaptation based on redundant collections of low-level sensors. Two kinds of sensors are distinguished: physical and logical sensors, which give cues from environment parameters and host information. A prototype board that consists of eight sensors was built for experimentation. The contexts are derived from cues using real-time recognition software, which was constructed after experiments with Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps and its variants. A personal digital assistant (PDA) and a mobile phone were used with the prototype to demonstrate situational awareness. On the PDA font size and backlight were changed depending on the demonstrated contexts while in mobile phone the active user profile was changed. The experiments have shown that it is feasible to recognize contexts using sensors and that context information can be used to create new interaction metaphors.	backlight;british informatics olympiad;experiment;high- and low-level;information appliance;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;prototype;real-time clock;real-time locating system;requirement;scripting language;sensor;tea;teuvo kohonen;usability testing;user profile	Albrecht Schmidt;Kofi Asante Aidoo;Antti Takaluoma;Urpo Tuomela;Kristof Van Laerhoven;Walter Van de Velde	1999		10.1007/3-540-48157-5_10	situation awareness;computer vision;information and communications technology;simulation;concept learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;multimedia;information appliance;computer security	HCI	-34.824561234288964	-44.01999502210254	61276

One of the most basic training tasks is to train dogs to perform postures on cue. While it might be easy for a human trainer to see when an animal has performed the desired posture, it is much more difficult for a computer to determine this. Most work in this area uses accelerometer and/or gyroscopic data to produce data from an animal's current state, but this has limitations. Take for example a normal standing posture. From an accelerometer's perspective, it closely resembles the """"laying down"""" posture, but the posture can look very different if the animal is standing still, versus walking, versus running, and might look completely different from a """"standing on incline"""" posture. A human trainer can instantly tell the difference between these postures and behaviors, but the process is much more difficult for a computer.  This paper demonstrates several algorithms for recognizing canine postures, as well as a system for building a computational model of a canine's potential postures, based solely on skeletal measurements. Existing techniques use labeled data, which can be difficult to acquire. We contribute a new technique for unsupervised posture detection, and compare the supervised technique to our new, unsupervised technique. Results indicate that the supervised technique performs with a mean 82.06% accuracy, while our unsupervised approach achieves a mean 74.25% accuracy, indicating that in some cases, our new unsupervised technique is capable of achieving comparable performance."""	algorithm;computation;computational model;cue tone;fibre optic gyroscope;knowledge engineering;poor posture;unsupervised learning	Michael Winters;Rita Brugarolas;John Majikes;Sean Mealin;Sherrie Yuschak;Barbara L.

We created interactive embedded interfaces called 'Navitiles' that can be suspended in a floor to support navigation of a building. Our design uses capacitance and RFID sensors to determine users' location and LEDs to indicate possible directions. We determine whether Navitile cues could help users understand spatial relationships between points of interest. We based our study on a previous experiment that used a simulated VR maze to test whether users were able to exhibit 'shortcut' behaviour that would indicate the formation of spatial maps. Our hypothesis was that the physicality of embodied spatial navigation directed by the Navitiles in a real maze would enable users to achieve similar spatial shortcut behaviours to those found in the virtual task. We found significant evidence that sufficient spatial knowledge was acquired to enable successful shortcut performance between unexplored routes. However, further work is required to measure the effect of physical body movement on spatial skills development.	embedded system;fundamental interaction;keyboard shortcut;map;minutiae;point of interest;sensor;spatial navigation	Douglas Boari;Mike Fraser	2009		10.1145/1517664.1517706	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-45.5896928614506	-45.133301985143476	61909

In these spaces, collaboration between humans and robots becomes vital, but also raises new challenges for robotics algorithms. A collaborative robot must be able to assist humans in a large diversity of tasks, understand its collaboratorâs intentions as well as communicate its own, predict human actions to adapt its behavior accordingly, and decide when it can lead the task or instead follow the user. All these aspects require the robot to adapt. It needs to execute different tasks, and rapidly adapt to the userâs actions and requirements.

However, Hegarty (2010) described alternative strategies: Mental rotation is not always used; analytical strategies can be used instead. In this study, we compared three groups of participants in three external formats of presentation of the referent figure in the Vandenberg & Kruse test: static, animated, interactive. During the test, participants were eye tracked. After the test, they were interrogated on their strategies for each item during the viewing of the replay of their own eye movement in a cued retrospective verbal protocol session. Results showed participants used varied strategies, part of them similar to those shown by Hegarty. Presentation format influenced significantly the strategy. Participants with high performance at the test used more mental rotation. Participants with lower performance tended to use more analytical strategies than mental rotation.	diagram;interactivity;turing test	Jean-Michel Boucheix;Madeline Chevret	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44043-8_17	simulation;computer science;communication;social psychology	HCI	-46.960023225368694	-48.59182019737562	62488

In these architectures multiple behaviors are usually running concurrently so a mechanism for integrating the resulting actuation commands from these behaviors into actual actuation commands sent to the robotâs motor system must be faced. Different architectures proposed different action integration mechanisms that range from distributed to central integration. In this paper an analysis of the special requirements that HRI imposes on the action integration system is given. Based on this analysis a novelle hybrid action integration mechanism that combines distributed attention focusing with a fast central integration algorithm is presented in the framework of the EICA architecture. The proposed system was tested in a simulation of a listener robot that aimed to achieve human-like nonverbal listening behavior in real world interactions. The analysis of the system showed that the proposed mechanism can generate coherent human-like behavior while being robust against signal correlated noise.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;autonomy;coherence (physics);data haven;embodied agent;humanârobot interaction;pacific rim;requirement;robot;simulation;situated	Yasser F.

The approach aims at simulating the real-life experience of observing an outside world through one or multiple windows. Here, the display screen serves as a virtual window such that viewers moving in front of the display can observe different part of the scene which is also moving in the opposite direction. In order to generate this see-through experience, a virtual 3D scene is first created and placed behind the display. Then, the viewers' 3D positions and motion are tracked by a 3D viewer tracking method based on multiple infra-red cameras. The virtual scene is rendered by 3D graphics engines in real-time speed, based on the tracked viewer positions. A prototype system has been implemented on a large-size tiled display and was able to bring viewers a realistic and natural 3D see-through experience.	3d computer graphics;graphics library;microsoft windows;prototype;real life;real-time transcription;simulation;stereoscopy;virtual reality	Chang Yuan	2009	2009 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference	10.1109/VR.2009.4811033	layout;computer vision;visualization;infrared;rendering;computer science;graphics;graphical user interface;virtual reality;prototype;tracking;multimedia;virtual retinal display;user interface;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-42.61804375154964	-38.48672591267216	62661

The workspace is often bounded by the tracking area or the display devices. This paper describes a novel interaction metaphor called the Magic Barrier Tape, which allows a user to navigate in a potentially infinite virtual scene while confined to a restricted walking workspace. The technique relies on the barrier tape metaphor and its """"do not cross"""" implicit message by surrounding the walking workspace with a virtual barrier tape in the scene. Therefore, the technique informs the user about the boundaries of his walking workspace, providing an environment safe from collisions and tracking problems. It uses a hybrid position/rate control mechanism to enable real walking inside the workspace and rate control navigation to move beyond the boundaries by """"pushing"""" on the virtual barrier tape. It provides an easy, intuitive and safe way of navigating in a virtual scene, without break of immersion. Two experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the Magic Barrier Tape by comparing it to two state-of-the-art navigation techniques. Results showed that the Magic Barrier Tape was faster and more appreciated than the compared techniques, while being more natural and less tiring. Considering it can be used in many different virtual reality systems, it is an interaction metaphor suitable for many different applications, from the entertainment field to training simulations scenarios."""	display device;experiment;haptic technology;immersion (virtual reality);institute for operations research and the management sciences;simulation;virtual reality;virtual world;workspace	Gabriel Cirio;Maud Marchal;Tony Regia-Corte;Anatole LÃ©cuyer	2009		10.1145/1643928.1643965	navigation;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-45.55654501202445	-43.257188558570675	62690
6071ecd9ce51863d128830e9764cbe7d2eef0115	pervasive computing		Emerging electric-drive vehicles, such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), hold the potential for substantial reduction of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. User driving behavior, which varies from person to person, can significantly affect (P)HEV operation and the corresponding energy and environmental impacts. Although some studies exist that investigate vehicle performance under different driving behaviors, either directed by vehicle manufacturers or via on-board diagnostic (OBD) devices, they are typically vehicle-specific and require extra device/effort. Moreover, there is no or very limited feedback to an individual driver regarding how his/her personalized driving behavior affects (P)HEV performance. This paper presents a personalized driving behavior monitoring and analysis system for emerging hybrid vehicles. Our design is fully automated and non-intrusive. We propose phone-based multi-modality sensing that captures precise driverâvehicle information through de-noise, calibration, synchronization, and disorientation compensation. We also provide quantitative driver-specific (P)HEV analysis through operation mode classification, energy use and fuel use modeling. The proposed system has been deployed and evaluated with real-world user studies. System evaluation demonstrates highly-accurate (0.88-0.996 correlation and low error) driving behavior sensing, mode classification, energy use and fuel use modeling.	modality (humanâcomputer interaction);on-board data handling;personalization;plug-in (computing);ubiquitous computing;usability testing	Judy Kay Paul Lukowicz Hideyuki Tokuda;P.

The pervasiveness of the smartphones makes it possible to implement new interactive signage systems for advertising purpose. A new drag gable cyber-physical broadcast/multicast media system, Smart Signage, is proposed in our previous work. It allows multiples users simultaneously obtaining the displayed content with an intuitive ``dragging"""" hand gesture. With the increasing number of deployed digital signs, it is possible that there are multiple signs in one location. In this paper, a new approach is proposed using the existing Smart Signage infrastructure to allow smartphones to interact with multiple digital signs in one location. This approach differentiates signs by the orientations of the signage displays, which are measured by smartphone-embedded orientation sensors. A user can interact with the intended sign by simply pointing his/her smartphone at the target signage display. With this new approach, Smart Signage successfully extends from one-to-many interaction to many-to-many interaction."""	bit error rate;cyber-physical system;degraded mode;drag and drop;embedded system;experiment;many-to-many;multicast;one-to-many (data model);response time (technology);sensor;signage systems;smart tv;smartphone	James She;Jon A Crowcroft;Hao Fu;Pin-Han Ho	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.133	embedded system;multimedia;internet privacy;computer security	Visualization	-42.72281528368699	-42.323596186913676	62974

This approach enables long duration recordings (e.g. over 30 minutes), and supports post-hoc mapping of the Kinect2 depth video to the color space if needed. By using common file formats, the data can be played back and analyzed on any other computer, without requiring sensor specific SDKs to be installed.

We performed two studies evaluating the feasibility of walking user interfaces (WUIs) that adapt their layout when the user is moving. In a pilot study with 6 users, we evaluated the effects of different button sizes on performance when walking while using a portable music player. Results showed significant interactions between size and movement. In the second study, 29 users evaluated the performance of a WUI that dynamically changed button sizes as the user moved. Results show that our dynamic user interface performs at the level of its component static interfaces without any additional penalty due to adaptation. This work adds to our design knowledge about walking user interfaces and provides lessons learned in evaluating mobile devices while walking in public spaces.	interaction;mobile device;user interface	Shaun K.

The task to be completed is often defined in terms of some desired trajectory and humans generate certain forces to achieve the desired trajectory. In this paper we describe our efforts to experimentally and theoretically classify forces associated with these skilled tasks. The idea is then to develop a system that can capture and playback exhibition of skill through haptics from person to person. Our preliminary results from experiments show that the forces generated by an individual are unique for a given task. Furthermore, for a given person, these forces show little variance over repeated exhibition of the same task. A virtual writing simulator was used to collect data from human subjects. The significance of this research is that not only was the forces generated by a person for a given skill unique, but is also verifiably different from another human subject performing the same task.	experiment;haptic technology;simulation	Govindarajan Srimathveeravalli;Venkatraghavan Gourishankar;Thenkurussi Kesavadas	2006	2006 14th Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems	10.1109/HAPTICS.2006.163	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	Robotics	-47.58946680333497	-50.36420046302096	63122
00f787b0b34e8a0bcdd4e29af3e9d814ba77b84b	visual search	experimental lab study;reaction time;reading;visual perception	Broadly defined, visual search is the act of looking for something or a number of things. It is reasonable, at the start of a survey of the topic, to ask why we have to search at all. Part of the answer is obvious, part is more involved, and all of the answer has to do with the fact that we are creatures with limitations. To begin with the obvious, our eyes are seeing only part of the world around us at the present moment. The world extends 360 degrees around our heads, but our eyes have a visual field of a bit over 180 degrees in the horizontal dimension and, depending on the configuration of our faces, about 90 degrees in the vertical dimension. If the target of search is outside the current visual field, we will need to move to point our eyes in the right direction. Within that large visual field, processing is hugely uneven. In the fovea, each individual photoreceptor commands what amounts to its own optic nerve fiber. If there were one optic nerve fiber for every photoreceptor in the retina, the optic nerve would be too fat to be practical. This constraint and others result in extensive pooling of information in the peripheral visual field. As a result, visual resolution falls off dramatically as we move away from the fovea (Green, 1970). If detection requires more than very coarse processingâfor example, if one wants to read any letter on this pageâthe target must be brought to the fovea by moving the eyes. It is important to note that while fixation of the targets of search is common and often necessary, it is not required in all cases. Targets can be detected in peripheral vision as long as their defining features can be resolved in peripheral vision. Indeed, many studies of search involve requiring observers to hold fixation at one point while targets and distractors are presented at peripheral locations (e.g., Braun & Julesz, 1998; Carrasco, Evert, Chang, & Katz, 1995; Wolfe, OâNeill, & Bennett, 1998). On the right side of Figure 13.1, if you fixate on the central âx,â you should be able to search successfully for the letter âcâ without moving your eyes. When a basketball player is praised for his peripheral vision, this does not mean that he can read the newspaper 15 degrees from fixation. It is more likely to mean that he has trained himself to fixate at one location while successfully searching for the receiver of his next pass by deploying his attention to his peripheral visual field. The decline in resolution is only part of the problem in peripheral vision. Targets that are large enough to be resolved may still be difficult or impossible to identify in peripheral vision because of the crowding effects of other, nearby contours (Levi, Klein, & Aitsebaomo, 1985).

This paper firstly compares the perceived depth with the shot scene depth from the viewing and shooting geometries for a couple of shooting and rendering devices. This yields a depth distortion model whose parameters are expressed from the geometrical characteristics of shooting and rendering devices. Secondly, these expressions are inverted in order to design convenient shooting layouts yielding chosen distortions on specific rendering devices. Thirdly, this design scheme provides three shooting technologies (3D computer graphics software, photo rail, and camera box system) producing qualitative 3D content for various kinds of scenes (real or virtual, still or animated), complying with any prechosen distortion when rendered on any specific multiscopic technology or device formerly specified.

In this paper, we present a method for detecting heightened cognitive load using a technique known as mouse dynamics (MD). We provide an overview of cognitive science literature linking changes in cognitive states to interruptions of fine motor control to provide a theoretical base for our work. We then describe a laboratory experiment in which low, medium, and high cognitive load were elicited while MD features were captured. We found that participants exhibited longer task duration, longer mouse movements, more direction changes, and slower speed when under high cognitive load.		Mark Grimes;Joseph S.

d964efb74aeb69ac7151919922ddfa343e02f798	particle display system - virtually perceivable pixels with randomly distributed physical pixels		In this study, the authors propose and implement a particle display system (PDS) that consists of hundreds of randomly distributed pixels. The wireless capability of this system enables each node to move freely without distant limitation of the use of wire cables. The authors also propose effective visual presentation techniques for a display system with randomly distributed pixels. One of the optimization techniques involves the extension of a well-known phenomenon where humans can perceive two-dimensional static or moving images from a set of high-frequency flashing one-dimensional pixel arrays, such as LED arrays, as a characteristic of a human's vision system. While this technique can only extend the virtual resolution of a display in a direction perpendicular to the aligned pixels, our technique enables the display of multi-directional scrolling of two-dimensional images with randomly distributed pixels. In addition, the advantages of presenting information on a display with nonuniform pixel distribution and virtual pixels with fast flash of pixels are discussed. The proposed techniques help in reducing the cost of installing a large-scale display and the time taken for the initial preparation of the setup, which involves carrying large pixel arrays and determining the precise size and shape of the display.	pixel;randomness	Munehiko Sato;Atsushi Hiyama;Tomohiro Tanikawa;Michitaka Hirose	2009	JIP	10.2197/ipsjjip.17.280	computer vision;computer hardware;computer science;960h technology;native resolution;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-40.666641730996	-39.188401110473755	63676

Numerous games have been designed for the Sphero for smartphones and tablets. However, most of these games provide an interface for controlling the Sphero that is far from natural. These games also do not put a strong focus on the physical environment around the Sphero. This work discusses a control scheme used to control a Sphero with another Sphero, and a pervasive game leveraging this scheme that emphasizes physical properties of the environment to create an immersive experience.	pervasive informatics;remote control;robot;smartphone;tablet computer	Brennan Jones;Kody R.

e89f24c36ed99970c9bee94909ebe4c618f1cc0d	a multimodal human-machine interface enabling situation-adaptive control inputs for highly automated vehicles		Intelligent vehicles operating in different levels of automation require the driver to fully or partially conduct the dynamic driving task (DDT) and to conduct fallback performance of the DDT, during a trip. Such vehicles create the need for novel human-machine interfaces (HMIs) designed to conduct high-level vehicle control tasks. Multimodal interfaces (MMIs) have advantages such as improved recognition, faster interaction, and situation-adaptability, over unimodal interfaces. In this study, we developed and evaluated a MMI system with three input modalities; touchscreen, hand-gesture, and haptic to input tactical-level control commands (e.g. lane-changing, overtaking, and parking). We conducted driving experiments in a driving simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the MMI system. The results show that multimodal HMI significantly reduced the driver workload, improved the efficiency of interaction, and minimized input errors compared with unimodal interfaces. Moreover, we discovered relationships between input types and modalities: location-based inputs-touchscreen interface, time-critical inputs-haptic interface. The results proved the functional advantages and effectiveness of multimodal interface system over its unimodal components for conducting tactical-level driving tasks.	device driver;driving simulator;experiment;haptic technology;high- and low-level;humanâcomputer interaction;lateral thinking;multimodal interaction;simulation;touchscreen;user interface;window of opportunity	Udara E.

This means that exploration influences perception, but also perception influences exploration. We can optimize/change the exploratory movements according to the perception and/or the task, consciously or unconsciously. In this paper, a tactile sensing system including bidirectionality is proposed and its potential and application to laparoscopic surgery are discussed. The proposed system is composed of a tactile sensor and a tactile display. The tactile sensor is mounted on a forceps, and the tactile feedback based on the sensor output is provided by using the tactile display. The user can feel sensor outputs and adjust the forceps manipulation according to the environment and the target. This leads to collect adequate sensor outputs. Implementing the bidirectionality gets the most out of the capability of the tactile sensor. Furthermore, the developed system might have an additional effect due to using the tactile display to the other hand, not to the hand with the forceps. It is an enhancement of haptic perception by tactile feedback to distant part. The developed system is introduced and establishment of the bidirectionality and its effect are discussed. Psychophysical experiments on the enhancing effect are conducted. Experimental results show a potential of the proposed tactile sensing system.	bi-directional text;consciousness;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;javaserver pages;lumped element model;numerical analysis;prototype;signal processing;tactile sensor	Yoshihiro Tanaka;Takanori Nagai;Masamichi Sakaguchi;Michitaka Fujiwara;Akihito Sano	2013	2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC)	10.1109/WHC.2013.6548399	computer vision;computer science;tactile sensor;statistics	Robotics	-42.58906383636645	-44.39134075050093	63983

This OCU follows a large set of design guidlines and also features novel techniques for a human operator to remotely interact with a man-portable ground robot. The system was evaluated in a high fidelity tunnel accident simulation at a fire fighting training center. The OCU allowed training and collisions to remain low, while SA was improved. Qualitative observations are also discussed, such that end-users do not often choose the optimal views in the OCU for the tasks at hand.	camera phone;collision detection;control unit;experiment;modal logic;multi-touch;robot;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;user modeling	Benoit Larochelle;Geert-Jan M.

In pursuit of these goals, we integrated the non-standard UI technologies of multi-sensor tablets, toolglass, transparent UI components, and marking menus. We describe a working prototype of our new paradigm, the rationale behind it and our experiences introducing it into an existing application. Finally, we presents some ot the lessons learned: prototypes are useful to break the barriers imposed by conventional GUI design and some of their ideas can still be retrofitted seamlessly into products. Furthermore, the added functionality is not measured only in terms of user performance, but also by the quality of interaction, which allows artists to create new graphic vocabularies and graphic styles.	design rationale;graphical user interface;item unique identification;programming paradigm;prototype;tablet computer;vocabulary	Gordon Kurtenbach;George W.

These systems rely on the extraction of phonemes from the speech signal and converting them to 'visemes' or visual lip shapes for a synthetic human face. The generation of human emotional expressions has also been developed in the recent past.

Recent research indicates that the type of feedback impacts typing speed, error rate, and the user's need to switch her gaze between the on-screen keyboard and the typed text field. The current study focuses on the issues of feedback when a short dwell time (450 ms vs. 900 ms in a previous study) is used. Results show that the findings obtained using longer dwell times only partly apply for shorter dwell times. For example, with a short dwell time, spoken feedback results in slower text entry speed and double entry errors. A short dwell time requires sharp and clear feedback that supports the typing rhythm.	bit error rate;feedback;keystroke dynamics;type system;virtual keyboard;words per minute	PÃ¤ivi Majaranta;Anne Aula;Kari-Jouko RÃ¤ihÃ¤	2004		10.1145/968363.968390	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;communication	HCI	-47.15314139173271	-45.45438132121562	64289

First, we review the current state-of-the-art of exiting solutions and discuss their applicability and limitations. We categorize the exiting solutions into three kinds: (1) virtual real-time 2D image/video techniques, where the consumer gets to superimpose the clothes on their real-time video to visualize themselves wearing the clothes. (2) 2D and 3D mannequins, where a web-application uses the body measurements provided by the customer, to superimpose the standard sizes to fit a customized 2D or 3D mannequin before buying. (3) 3D camera and laser technologies which acquire 3D information of the costumer, enabling estimation of the body shape and measurements. Additionally, we conduct user studies to investigate the user behavior when buying clothes and their demands to a virtual dressing room.	virtual dressing room	Michael B.

Compared to traditional markers with square patterns, the proposed markers composed of alphabets have several advantages for interaction. The proposed markers are based on English alphabet letters, allowing users to interact intuitively by combining the alphabetized markers to from words. The marker recognition system operates at a robust 58.8 fps, recognizing the markers in a fast and effective method. In this paper, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed markers by implementing an AR application.	augmented reality;effective method;optical character recognition	Seiheui Han;Eun Joo Rhee;Junyeong Choi;Jong-Il Park	2011		10.1145/2087756.2087839	computer vision;augmented reality;speech recognition;computer science;operating system;user interface	HCI	-37.757792395971	-43.75919387794146	64529

We seek for the approaches that do not require modifications to the panels: spatial tag and frequency tag. Spatial tag is similar to fiducial tag used by tangible tabletop surface interaction, and uses multi-point, geometric patterns to encode object IDs. Frequency tag simulates high-frequency touches in the time domain to encode object IDs, using modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects to simulate high-speed touches in varying frequency. We will show several demo applications. The first combines simultaneous tangible + touch input system. This explores how tangible inputs (e.g., pen, easer, etc.) and some simple gestures work together on capacitive touch panels.	encode;embedded system;fiducial marker;modulation;multi-touch;simulation;tangible user interface;touchscreen;ipad;ipod	Neng-Hao Yu;Li-Wei Chan;Lung-Pan Cheng;Mike Y.

Current advances in hardware technology for tabletop displays introduce the possibility of mimicking these physical interactions through direct-touch or tangible user interfaces. While both promise intuitive physical interaction, they are rarely discussed in combination in the literature. In this paper, we present a study that explores the advantages and disadvantages of tangible and touch interfaces, specifically in relation to one another. We discuss our results in terms of how effective each technique was for accomplishing both a 3D object manipulation task and a 2D information visualization exploration task. Results suggest that people can more quickly move and rotate objects in 2D with our touch interaction, but more effectively navigate the visualization using tangible interaction. We discuss how our results can be used to inform future designs of tangible and touch interaction.	3d computer graphics;book;fundamental interaction;humanâcomputer interaction;information visualization;tangible user interface	Mark S.

It is hypothesized, however, that easing navigation tasks would result in weaker cognitive maps, leaving users more vulnerable to becoming lost should their navigation device fail. We describe an outdoor navigation study that highlighted the gap between theoretical expectations and real world testing with navigation tools. We addressed the issues by creating a simulation system for testing navigation tools and report on the results of a study comparing AR with maps. We then extended the system to support simultaneous secondary tasks to assess relative workload. We present this as a way of objectively measuring relative cognitive effort expended on navigation tool use. Our findings are helpful in the design of mobile pedestrian navigation tools seeking to balance navigational efficiency with mental map formation.		James Wen;Agnes Deneka;William S.

By creating this infastructure, we have been able to make several scenarios including musical instruments, sending messages between tables, and menus that change with apparent use in a food scenario.

Virtual reality can be an effective neuropsychological tool for a more ecological and functional assessment and rehabilitation of neglect. We developed a 3D Virtual Reality platform - NeuroVirtual 3D - for the assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive deficits, in particular for USN. Within the virtual environments it is possible to interact with virtual objects and execute specific exercises using a Microsoft Kinect. Through the analysis of different grasping tasks it is possible to evaluate in an ecological way the patients' ability to find and handle objects in both sides of the virtual space.	cognition disorders;hemimegalencephaly;kinect;patients;physical object;physical therapy exercises;virtual reality;functional assessment	Pietro Cipresso;Silvia Serino;Elisa Pedroli;Andrea Gaggioli;Giuseppe Riva	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-375-9-66	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;natural user interface	HCI	-47.44006913581599	-49.57374641072713	65045

Prior work and comments from individuals lacking proprioception indicate that conveying prosthesis motion through a nonvisual sensory channel would reduce and possibly remove the need to watch the prosthesis. To motivate the design of suitable sensory substitution devices, this study investigates the difference between seeing a virtual prosthetic limb move and feeling one's real limb move. Fifteen intact subjects controlled a virtual prosthetic finger in a one-degree-of-freedom rotational spring discrimination task. A custom haptic device was used to measure both real finger position and applied finger force, and the resulting prosthetic finger movement was displayed visually (on a computer screen) and/or proprioceptively (by allowing the subject's real finger to move). Spring discrimination performance was tested for three experimental sensory conditions-visual motion, proprioceptive motion, and visual and proprioceptive motion-using the method of constant stimuli, with a reference stiffness of 290 N/m. During each trial, subjects sequentially pressed the right index finger on a pair of hard-surfaced virtual springs and decided which was stiffer. No significant performance differences were found between the three experimental sensory conditions, but subjects perceived proprioceptive motion to be significantly more useful than visual motion. These results imply that relaying proprioceptive information through a nonvisual channel could reduce visual attention during prosthesis control while maintaining task performance, thus improving the upper limb prosthesis experience.	computer monitor;haptic technology;sensory substitution	Netta Gurari;Katherine J.

Limited research exists testing the effectiveness of various gaze direction techniques. However, there is a lack of empirical research evaluating real-time color effects designed to direct the viewer's gaze. We developed a novel VR gaze-directing stimulus using a dynamic real-time color effect and tested its effectiveness in a user study. The stimulus was influenced by color psychology research and chosen by an informal pilot study. Results suggest that the stimulus encouraged participants to direct their gaze back towards POIs. In the majority of subjects who encountered the stimulus, their gaze was successfully directed back to POIs within a few seconds. While the task of holding viewer gaze in VR remains a challenge, this experiment has uncovered new information about the potential of color effect-based VR gaze direction.	color;point of interest;real-time clock;real-time locating system;usability testing;virtual reality	Mason Smith;Ann McNamara	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	10.1109/VR.2018.8446420	computer vision;gaze;empirical research;artificial intelligence;point of interest;color psychology;immersion (virtual reality);computer science;virtual machine	Visualization	-45.294995054014855	-47.37270322117014	65647
448374e096b66a2ea862afbc5cb051ab4b2c100d	a multi-modal platform for semantic music analysis: visualizing audio-and score-based tension	music representation;music analysis;multimodal system;tension;article;online interface	Musicologists, music cognition scientists and others have long studied music in all of its facets. During the last few decades, research in both score and audio technology has opened the doors for automated, or (in many cases) semi-automated analysis. There remains a big gap, however, between the field of audio (performance) and score-based systems. In this research, we propose a web-based Interactive system for Multi-modal Music Analysis (IMMA), that provides musicologists with an intuitive interface for a joint analysis of performance and score. As an initial use-case, we implemented a tension analysis module in the system. Tension is a semantic characteristic of music that directly shapes the music experience and thus forms a crucial topic for researchers in musicology and music cognition. The module includes methods for calculating tonal tension (from the score) and timbral tension (from the performance). An audio-to-score alignment algorithm based on dynamic time warping was implemented to automate the synchronization between the audio and score analysis. The resulting system was tested on three performances (violin, flute, and guitar) of Paganini's Caprice No. 24 and four piano performances of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. We statistically analyzed the results of tonal and timbral tension and found correlations between them. A clustering algorithm was implemented to find segments of music (both within and between performances) with similar shape in their tension curve. These similar segments are visualized in IMMA. By displaying selected audio and score characteristics together with musical score following in sync with the performance playback, IMMA offers a user-friendly intuitive interface to bridge the gap between audio and score analysis.	algorithm;cluster analysis;cognition;dynamic time warping;modal logic;performance;semiconductor industry;usability;web application	Dorien Herremans;Ching-Hua Chuan	2017	2017 IEEE 11th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)	10.1109/ICSC.2017.49	simulation;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;tension;music theory;multimedia;world wide web	Visualization	-34.67618725885062	-46.01114125901734	65768
ac7ce8f2953d8dcd1cdecbd553660832c674c6e2	yes, right there!: a self-portrait application with sensor-assisted guiding for smartphones	smartphone;face detection;inertial sensor;camera	1. ABSTRACT Taking self-portrait on a smartphone is a lot of fun and can be easy when we know how (Fig. 1a). In addition, thank to selftimer, giving a delay between pressing the shutter release and the shutterâs firing, we are able to take photos of ourselves when nobody on hand to take it (Fig. 1b). However, there are rare cases that we can get satisfied snapshots at our first try. The reason is that we usually had no idea whether we were in the right position of the camera frame (Figs. 1c, 2a and 2c). Although the front camera can help us to check position in the frame, its generated snapshot quality is much lower than that taken by the back camera. In this demo we will introduce a self-portrait App â âYes, right there!â The App enables a camera to prevent faces from being cut out of the camera frame by giving suggestions to users until they are in a suitable position in the frame, as shown in Fig. 1d, Fig. 2b, and Fig. 2d. The suggestions are voice commands including âRaise your hand!â, âCome closer!â, âPlease move to the leftâ, and so on. They depend on the faceâs position in the camera frame [1] and the inertial sensing data on the phone. In the end, a good picture is then taken after the beep sounds. More concretely, âYes, right there!â supports two modes: selfportrait mode and self-timer mode. In self-portrait mode, our App initially asks users to take favorite photos as pre-training references. In the meantime, the application measures the yaw, pitch, and roll values from accelerometer, electronic compass, and gyro. Note that the users usually like to take photos with a special angle. Once a user wants to take self-portrait, she points the lens at herself so that her face is reflected in the camera frame. The App detects the faceâs position in the camera frame and measures the yaw, pitch, and roll values. Then the faceâs position and the inertial sensing data are being compared against the pre-training references while the App suggests the user to change her posture by voice commands. If the face moves to the right position and the yaw, pitch, and roll values are suitable, a good picture is then taken automatically; otherwise, the App repeats the suggestions. Note that the self-portrait mode can be easily extended for multiple users. In self-timer mode, the user firstly specifies an area where she wants her face to appear in the frame. When the App works, it compares the position of her face against the area specified, and suggests the user to change her location by voice commands. As shown in Fig. 2a, the userâs face is detected appearing in the grid 1 (outside the specified area in the frame). The voice interactive function is triggered to lead the user by saying âPlease move to the left and then come closer, etc.â until she moves to the suitable position (Fig. 2b). When the App works for multiple users, as shown in Fig. 2c, it detects that a user in the left side is not in the area specified (gird 5), and then the voice interactive function will give suggestions (e.g., The user in the right side please moves to the left, etc.) until all the users are appearing in the specified area in the frame (Fig. 2d). Fig. 3 shows our system model. We will distribute Android phones to demo visitors, allowing real-time interaction with user interface on these phones. We will also show how âYes, right there!â recommends users taking selfportrait without assistance from others. Moreover, users can set timer for different waiting intervals, and specify the number and range of the grid which is considered as suitable position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how to help users take self-portrait by detecting the faceâs position in the camera frame and measuring the inertial sensing data on the phone.	android;beep;gyro;humanâcomputer interaction;inertial navigation system;movie projector;multi-user;poor posture;raise;real-time transcription;sensor;smartphone;snapshot (computer storage);timer;user interface;xfig;yaws	Chi-Chung Lo;Sz-Pin Huang;Yi Cheng Ren;Yu-Chee Tseng	2013		10.1145/2462456.2465705	embedded system;computer vision;face detection;computer science	HCI	-44.40661132745862	-42.09424619640435	65977

Gestures are recognized using proximity-based movement detection using flexible capacitive sensor arrays that can be built into the environment or placed on to the body or be integrated into clothing. Inviz provides an innovative interface to home automation systems to simplify environmental control for individuals with limited-mobility resulting from paralysis, paresis, and degenerative diseases. Proximity-based sensing obviates the need for physical contact which can result in skin abrasion which is particularly deleterious to people with limited-to-no sensitivity in their extremities. A custom-designed wireless module maintains a small form factor facilitating placement based on an individual's needs. Our system leverages a hierarchical sensing technique which facilitates learning gestures based on the individual and placement of the sensors. Classification uses just-in-time embedded computational resources to provide accurate responses while maintaining a low average power consumption, in turn reducing the impact of batteries on the form factor. To illustrate the use of Inviz in a smart home environment, we demonstrate an end-to-end home automation system that controls small appliances. We will interface our system with a home automation gateway to demonstrate a subset of potential applications. This interactive demonstration highlights the intuitiveness and extensibility of the Inviz prototype.	capacitive sensing;computational resource;embedded system;end-to-end principle;extensibility;gesture recognition;home automation;just-in-time compilation;personalization;prototype;sensor;small form factor;wearable computer	Gurashish Singh;Alexander Nelson;Ryan Robucci;Chintan Patel;Nilanjan Banerjee	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134029	embedded system;simulation;computer science;gesture recognition;prototype;capacitive sensing	Mobile	-42.255687089985585	-42.17502067760001	66203

Occasionally, players are thrown into situations with a high amount of visual complexity, which may cause players, especially novice players, to misinterpret important game goals or mechanics, which may, in turn, lead to a diminished experience. Previous research investigated visual design, but only in terms of brightness and color contrast, no research investigated attributes of motion, their complexity in regards to visual design, and their effect on the game experience. Informed by cinema and visual perception domains, we embark on a study of 4 motion attributes: flicker, shape, speed, and repetition, and investigate their design within 6 games. We rate these games based on their complexity. We use video coding with a kappa reliability measure to identify these attributes. We then investigate the relationship between the use of these motion attributes and the rated complexity of the visual scene. We present this analysis as a contribution, and design lessons extrapolated based on the analysis.	3d film;bios;cinema 4d;data compression;experiment;extrapolation;focal (programming language);fear, uncertainty and doubt;flicker (screen);futures studies;stationary process;visual language	David Milam;Magy Seif El-Nasr;Dinara Moura;Lyn Bartram	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_12	visual rhetoric;computer vision;simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-42.95297045974721	-50.24545560087398	66783

Our findings indicate that although performance is not different between the two interfaces, the amount of attention as measured by the number of eye-tracking points was very different in the graphical and numerical conditions. Attention increased over time in the numerical condition, but was stable in the graphical condition. These results showed that the strategies used to make decisions in dynamic environments vary according to the form of information presentation.	computer simulation;eye tracking;graphical user interface;numerical analysis	Cleotilde Gonzalez;Janice Golenbock	2003			computer vision;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science	HCI	-47.123767300274	-48.187616489032614	66899
a9171ae2ed73bccafc63f7556586a93f47cb9150	on-time measurement of subjective anxiety of a passenger in an autonomous vehicle: gradually changing sounds decreases anxiety of passenger		The current study examined the possibility of measuring the subjective anxiety in real-time by means of a novel handle-shaped device, caused by riding an autonomous car. In our experiment, a participant was shown computer graphics (CG) animation, which gave the person a virtual experience of riding a new autonomous car. The CG animation stimuli were made with three variables: maximum speed (19 km/h, 160 km/h, or 320 km/h), acceleration/deceleration pattern (linear or exponential), and with and without ascending/descending sounds (sound, or no sound). The participants grasped the handle and moved it in the longitudinal direction, i.e., pulling when they experienced anxiety and pushing when they felt relaxed. Results of experiments by 16 participants showed that they moved the handle depending on the stimulus of speed at that instant, which indicated that our handle-shaped device was useful in assessing the participantsâ anxiety on time. In addition, results indicated that sounds, especially those which gradually ascending with acceleration, could diminish the subjective anxiety under some conditions.		Akitoshi Tomita;Etsuko T.

Once the user acquires the visual code of interest, the user can then manipulate the related virtual object/system without having to keep the camera centered on the visual code. Our new interface does this analyzing the optical flow as captured by the camera. For example, consider a visual code that represents a 3D object, such as a dial. After selecting the code, the user can freely rotate and/or move the virtual object without having to keep the camera pointed at the code. This interface is much more user friendly and is more intuitive since the user's hand gestures can be more relaxed, more natural, and more extensive.

Up until this point, the method of defining a single screen keyboard and redirecting touch inputs to key inputs was used. However, this method diminishes the efficiency of touch-screens because a fixed-layout is applied to every application even though different keys are used for different UI states of an application. This study proposes a method that investigates the type of keys used in an application during run-time using the probe key and dynamically configures the layout of screen keyboards. Test results of the proposed method showed that an optimized touch-screen UI was generated every time the UI state of an application changed.	mobile app;mobile phone;touchscreen;user interface	Seokhoon Ko;Seman Oh	2010	2010 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)	10.1109/ICDIM.2010.5664625	layout;games;embedded system;mobile telephony;humanâcomputer interaction;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;user interface	HCI	-45.99320512723465	-43.07072931886788	67546

The method uses a combination of gaze and eye movement to infer head gestures. Compared to other gesture-based methods a major advantage of the method is that the user keeps the gaze on the interaction object while interacting. This method has been implemented on a head-mounted eye tracker for detecting a set of predefined head gestures. The accuracy of the gesture classifier is evaluated and verified for gaze-based interaction in applications intended for both large public displays and small mobile phone screens. The user study shows that the method detects a set of defined gestures reliably.	eye tracking;gesture recognition;interaction;mobile phone;sensor;usability testing	Diako Mardanbegi;Dan Witzner Hansen;Thomas Pederson	2012		10.1145/2168556.2168578	computer vision;eye tracking;gesture recognition;communication;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.28053561742167	-43.27892094491376	67681

For the experiments, observers viewed graphically rendered displays consisting of pairs of rotating objects and judged whether their shapes were identical. For some pairs they were, while for other pairs they differed by varying amounts. We determined the accuracy of shape perception from these discrimination judgments. We provide background information for the operational definition of shape used throughout the experiments, as well as for the rendering factors under experimental investigation: occluding contour, smooth shading, and specular highlights. Following that, we describe a series of experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated the effectiveness of our new technique for the exploration of perceptual issues related to graphic interfaces. An additional four experiments produced results concerning the effects of rendering parameters on the communication of 3D shape. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated the contributions of basic rendering conditions such as the presence of occluding contours and smooth surface shading. In Experiments 4 and 5, the manipulation of specular highlighting revealed that accurate shape discrimination judgments were possible either with or without the specular component. These results lay a foundation for reasoned manipulation of interface properties when accurate communication of 3D shape is a primary goal of the display.		James C. Rodger;Roger A.

The casters and wheels of the walker provide mobility to elderly users. However, when the walker moves in unexpected directions, falling accidents often occur. These accidents pose a very serious problem and are one of the leading causes of secondary injuries and disorders. Caregivers support patients with impaired motor or sensory functions by standing next to them when they walk. The main interests of this study are the development of an intelligent walker and the realization of a safe walker for the elderly and disabled. In our previous study, we developed the intelligently controllable walker (i-Walker) that utilized compact MR fluid brakes in its wheels and a web camera. In addition, we had proposed a line-tracing controller for i-Walker, whose performance was evaluated by healthy subjects.

0381be4d23c53399cdb08daef6dd59c616218208	tv scout: lowering the entry barrier to personalized tv program recommendation	entry barrier	In this paper, we present TV Scout, a recommendation system providing users with personalized TV schedules. The TV Scout architecture addresses the âcold-startâ problem of information filtering systems, i.e. that filtering systems have to gather information about the userâs interests before they can compute personalized recommendations. Traditionally, gathering this information involves upfront user effort, resulting in a substantial entry barrier. TV Scout is designed to avoid this problem by presenting itself to new users not as a filtering system, but as a retrieval system where all user effort leads to an immediate result. While users are dealing with this retrieval functionality, the system continuously and unobtrusively gathers information about the userâs interests from implicit feedback and gradually evolves into a filtering system. An analysis of log file data gathered with over 10,000 registered online users shows that over 85% of all first-time users logged in again, suggesting that the described architecture is successful in lowering the entry barrier.1	cold start;experiment;gerrit;information filtering system;information seeking;kelly criterion;login;personalization;recommender system;scout;television;tom proulx;web application	Patrick Baudisch;Lars Brueckner	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31842-2_30	simulation;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-34.781336004851845	-51.56009045607327	68008

In general, it is expected that the environmental electromagnetic noise would disturb the novel EMG signals. We measured the EMG signals and obtained high signal-to-noise ratio in CABIN immersive multiscreen display constructed at the University of Tokyo. The observed signal-tonoise ratio would make EMG signals a reliable input channel with simple signal processing, and real time control of virtual objects was successfully performed. The advantages of the EMG signals will be proposed as a promising human interface in immersive multiscreen environments. The user would control virtual objects reflecting the activations of the userâs muscles to realize fine operations. Furthermore, by using this additional biosignal channel, the user might interact with virtual objects without definite motion.	electromyography;humanâcomputer interaction;multi-screen video;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;user interface	Hideaki Touyama;Koichi Hirota;Michitaka Hirose	2006	IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR 2006)	10.1109/VR.2006.83	electromagnetic interference;embedded system;simulation;real-time control system;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;signal processing;virtual reality;cave;signal-to-noise ratio;human interface device	Visualization	-39.609288768819866	-50.47813111714896	68519

Issues of bri ghtness, oblique projection distortion, focus, obstruction, and display resolut ion are examined. Solutions to some of these problems are described, together with a plan to use a video camera to allow device-free interaction with the pr ojected images. The ED-projector is a practical way to create ubiquitous g raphical interfaces to access computational power and networked data. In particul ar, it is envisioned as an alternative to the carrying of laptops and to the i nstallation of displays in furniture, objects, and walls. In addition, the use of ED-projectors to augment reality without the use of goggles is examined and illustrated with examples. 11Introduction Ubiquitous computing envisions a world where it is possible to have access to computer resources anywhere and anytime to the data and services available through the Internet [1]. Since most of current software and Internet data is designed to b e accessed through a high-resolution graphical interf ace, to truly ubiquitously compute todayusers need devices with reasonable graphical capabi lities. This means carrying laptops everywhere, wearing computer graphics goggl es, or installing monitors and displays on the surfaces of spaces and objects, suc h as desks, fridges, and entrance doors. Or, simply, toresign to the low-resolution displays of mobile pho nes or PDAs. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to create ubiquitous graphical interfaces. Our idea is to couple an LCD/DLP projec tor to a motorized rotating mirror and to a computer graphics system that can correct the distortion caused by oblique projection. As the mirror moves, different surfaces become available to be used as displays. Also, we plan to employ a video camera to detect hand interaction with the projected image using computer vision techniques. Our target is to develop a projection-based system that creates interactive displays everywhere in an environment by transforming a surf ace into a projected """" touch screen.

For example, tangibles allow users to interact with mobile devices using physical objects both on screen and around the device. Similarly, there is a growing class of auxiliary devices that require a smartphone to be docked, transforming an otherwise simple object into something with rich interactivity. However, these auxiliary devices still require numerous components, including mechanical mechanisms, PCBs, and sometimes batteries. This increases manufacturing costs, and reduces physical robustness.	mobile device	Gierad Laput;Eric Brockmeyer;Moshe Mahler;Scott E.

The key objective is to exploit user-friendly biometric, with least privacy concern, to enhance security of the data in smartphone. The final product from this research is a finger knuckle authentication smartphone application, which is developed under Android operating system with environment version 2.3.3. This paper has developed some specialized algorithms for the finger knuckle detection, image pre-processing and region segmentation. Automatically detected and segmented finger knuckle images are used to encode finger knuckle pattern phase information using a pair of log-Gabor filters. Efficient implementation of various modules is achieved in C/C++ programming language, with OpenCV library, for online application. We also developed a user-friendly graphical user interface for the users to enroll and authenticate themselves. The developed system can therefore acquire finger knuckle image from the smartphone camera and automatically authenticate the genuine users. This paper has also developed a new smartphone based finger knuckle image database of 561 finger knuckle images of 187 different fingers from 109 users, in real imaging environment. In the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a mobile phone based finger knuckle identification which has shown highly promising results in automatically identifying the users from their finger knuckle images.	algorithm;android;authentication;biometrics;c++;contactless payment;encode;finger tree;gabor filter;graphical user interface;mobile app;mobile phone;opencv;operating system;preprocessor;programming language;smartphone;usability;web application;on-line system	KamYuen Cheng;Ajay Kumar	2012	2012 BIOSIG - Proceedings of the International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)		computer vision;speech recognition;information privacy;computer science;graphical user interface;authorization;image segmentation;computer security	Mobile	-34.557961399565386	-44.95648292866229	69058

Unfortunately, teleportation is known to cause disorientation in many users. This paper reports on an experiment designed to explore the relationship between teleportation and recollection of the structure of a virtual world when users are provided with a map navigation aid. Thirty-six subjects were divided into two groups (teleportation and free roam) and asked to collect objects in a virtual world. The results of the study showed that subjects who navigated with teleportation completed the task significantly faster than those who free roamed, with no difference between groups in the number of errors. However, when the map was removed, subjects who previ-ously teleported committed significantly more errors and took longer than those in the free roam group. There were no differences between groups on either of the post trial map drawing or map labeling exercises.	virtual world	Daniel C.

A robot with remote-brained design does not bring its own brain within the body but leaves the brain in the mother environment. The robot talks with it by radio links. The brain is raised in the mother environment inherited over generations. The key idea of the remote-brained approach is that of interfacing intelligent software systems with real robot bodies through wireless technology. In this framework the robot system can have a powerful vision system in the brain environment. We have applied this approach toward the creation of vision-based dynamic and intelligent behaviors in various robot configurations. In this paper we introduce our robot vision system and the remote-brained approach and describe visual processes for vision-based behaviors with remote-brained robots.	real-time transcription;robotics	Masayuki Inaba;Satoshi Kagami;Hirochika Inoue	1995		10.1007/BFb0035201	computer vision;simulation;active vision;machine vision;computer science;software system;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-36.784795128141994	-40.07034545726288	69282

One way of using the 3D space above a horizontal surface is to divide it into discrete parallel layers stacked upon each other. Horizontal and vertical lens movements are essential tasks for the style of multi-layer interaction associated with it. We conducted a comprehensive user study with 18 participants investigating fundamental issues such as optimal number of layers and their thickness, movement and holding accuracies, and physical boundaries of the interaction volume. Findings include a rather limited overall interaction height (44 cm), a different minimal layer thickness for vertical and horizontal search tasks (1 cm/4 cm), a reasonable maximum number of layers depending on the primary task, and a convenience zone in the middle for horizontal search. Derived from that, design guidelines are also presented.	interaction technique;layer (electronics);multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nonlinear system;thickness (graph theory);usability testing	Martin Spindler;Marcel Martsch;Raimund Dachselt	2012		10.1145/2207676.2208583	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;multimedia	HCI	-45.141527382819106	-45.247325665812376	69399

In many cases, they track physical objects using computer vision techniques to attach corresponding virtual objects on them. However, when a user tries to have a closer look at the virtual content, the tracking can fail as the viewpoint gets too close to the physical object. To prevent this, we propose an automatic zooming method that helps users to achieve a closer view to the scene without losing tracking. By updating the zoom factor based on the distance between the viewpoint and the target object, a natural and intuitive zooming interaction is achieved. In a user study evaluating the technique, we found that the proposed method is not only effective but also easy and natural to use.	augmented reality;computer vision;interaction;usability testing;zooming user interface	Gun A.

In this paper, we present a novel technology and several applications that allow users to interact with paper documents, books, and magazines. This interaction is in the form of reading and writing electronic information, such as images, web urls, video, and audio, to the paper medium by pointing a camera phone at a patch of text on a document. Our application does not require any special markings, barcodes, or watermarks on the paper document. Instead, we propose a document recognition algorithm that automatically determines the location of a patch of text in a large collection of document images given a small document image. This is very challenging because the majority of phone cameras lack autofocus and macro capabilities and they produce low quality images and video. We developed a novel algorithm, Brick Wall Coding (BWC), that performs image-based document recognition using the mobile phone video frames. Given a document patch image, BWC utilizes the layout, i.e. relative locations, of word boxes in order to determine the original file, page, and the location on the page. BWC runs real-time (4 frames per second) on a Treo 700w smartphone with a 312 MHz processor and 64MB RAM. Using our method we can recognize blurry document patch frames that contain as little as 4-5 lines of text and a video resolution as low as 176x144. We performed experiments by indexing 4397 document pages and querying this database with 533 document patches. Besides describing the basic algorithm, this paper also describes several applications that are enabled by mobile phone-paper interaction, such as inserting electronic annotations to paper, using paper as a tangible interface to collect and communicate multimedia data, and collaborative homework.	algorithm;barcode;book;camera phone;display resolution;experiment;frame (video);html;humanâcomputer interaction;image resolution;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile phone;patch (computing);random-access memory;real-time data;real-time transcription;real-time web;smartphone;tangible user interface;usability testing;web page	Berna Erol;Emilio R.

In addition, given the prevalence of handheld wireless devices, visualization on mobile handheld devices is beneficial for a large proportion of users. In this work we summarize our research on crowd visualization on wireless and handheld devices combining compression, 3D modeling and interactive visualization. We also synthesize crowds to validate our preliminary implementations. In order to achieve very high compression rates we use a novel perceptually adaptive approach for motion capture data compression. Our visualization interface can be used for simulation of crowds, and evaluating the design and capacity tolerances to crowds for public transit systems.	3d modeling;data compression;handheld game console;information visualization;interactive visualization;mobile device;motion capture;real-time clock;simulation;virtual tour	L.

A user study with 16 participants was conducted to evaluate its usability with two assembly tasks that varied in their complexity. As part of the assessment, we compared the interaction behavior of our platform with a commercial instant messaging application, which lacked the ability to augment or view video imagery. The results identified differences in the completion times between the two conditions, as we examined the use of visual augmentation, including recommendations to improve the platform.	adobe freehand;canonical quantization;embedded system;instant messaging;rapid refresh;recommender system;reference architecture;remote application platform;usability testing	Mark D.

The primary virtual tennis system, shown in Figure 1, consists of a four wall display with front, left, right and floor, high-resolution stereoscopic projection displays, to produce an immersive experience. The secondary system, shown in Figure 2, consisted of a single stereoscopic projector display, designed to be portable and easily assembled by two persons. Both systems use an in-house developed low-latency, low-jitter, all optical tracking system. The primary system has been demonstrated to several hundred visitors, while the secondary portable system has been demonstrated at the Emerging Technologies at both SIGGRAPH 2012 [Fong et al. 2012] in Los Angeles and SIGGRAPH Asia 2011 [Fong et al. 2011] in Hong Kong. The current prototype is the V-shaped actuator based haptic racket, shown in Figure 3.	haptic technology;image resolution;immersive technology;prototype;racket;siggraph;simulation;stereoscopy;tracking system;video projector	Wee Teck Fong	2012		10.1145/2425296.2425321	humanârobot interaction;computer vision;facial motion capture;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;videoconferencing;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-40.73697363899397	-39.201191028553914	70040

Leveraging the capabilities of reasonably accurate object tracking using commodity cameras and/or depth sensors to determine the 3D position and pose of objects in real time, it is possible to project dynamic graphical content on arbitrary surfaces, such as a person's face. Coupling these capabilities with a simple drawing application, participants can have the experience of âpaintingâ on someone's face, or even on their own, by observing the projection in a mirror. Similarly, integrating 2D rigid-body, fluid and gravity simulation, one may interact with virtual objects projected on their own face or body.	3d rendering;algorithm;augmented reality;display device;dynamical simulation;fluid animation;graphical user interface;map;parallax;physics engine;prototype;sensor;shader	Naoto Hieda;Jeremy R.

4129f49813f8e80ce4de73ae0a3aad229341ee82	user interface providing support for creating artistic patterns	intelligent user interface;user interface;fuzzy associative memory;idea support;kansei information	As design work using computer spreads, usage environments are appearing which have operations involving aesthetic sensibilities via the GUIs in a variety of graphics software and have the representational capacity to represent three-dimensional images and images with the feel of oil paintings. However, their operation still relies on the userÂs sensibilities and knowledge. In this paper, we propose a user interface for a user support system for creating artistic patterns. Its features are summarized by the following three points. First, the system has knowledge about designs. The result of design analysis provided the following knowledge. (1) The elements producing a design are the colors, shapes, and composition. (2) To turn an image into a pattern, the image is conceived of as a specific scene, then the pattern can be drawn by extracting the colors, shapes, and composition based on the scene by combining these elements. This knowledge is held in the system. Second, there is a user interface to easily transmit the image to the system. The media to convey kansei (affective information) are considered to be both linguistic and nonlinguistic. And an interface was designed to enable direct manipulation by pen or mouse to select from a list box of a three-level kansei language and to select from a pattern candidate group. Another user interface was designed which accounts for the inability of a person to grasp the kansei from the start to completion and allows repeating the kansei specification by the user and the presentation of patterns by the system. Third, there is a mechanism that automatically creates the pattern in response to the userÂs kansei. We designed an algorithm to create a design by (1) using fuzzy logic to deduce the userÂs image and (2) creating the pattern by using the parameters needed to draw the pattern which were extracted from the deduced image. Furthermore, we developed a support system for creating artistic patterns that has the above functions, and had multiple testers test its operation to verify the systemÂs effectiveness in application tests on real problems.

48684be32c9c4a50ba791ec6200262918edfd840	development of a rating system for all tennis players		A mathematically based method for evaluating the ability of tennis players is recommended to replace the ad hoc methods now followed. This method involves deriving a numerical rating (TCAP) for each player by utilizing match scores. Such ratings can be put to many uses, such as tournament placement, handicapping, match and tournament result prediction, and player progress evaluation. Extensive results have been obtained for both professional and amateur players, and indications are that eventually all serious tennis players may be rated by the same system. Finally, these results lead to insights into the game, including the conclusion that the professionals have nearly the same variability within their group as do the amateurs within theirs.		Samuel S.

59b9fa73d56223f789d246298ff95217e6b714ed	cloud media dj platform: functional perspective		Content services have been provided to people in a variety of ways. Jukebox provides an automated music-playing service. User inserts a coin and presses a music button desired, the jukebox automatically selects and plays the record. DJs in Korean cafes receive the contents they want and play it through the speakers in the store. In this paper, we propose a service platform that reinvents the Korean cafe DJ in an integrated environment of IoT and cloud computing. In addition, we analyze the functional aspects of the services provided by the proposed platform. The user in a store requests contents (music, video, message) through the service platform. The contents are provided through the public screen and speaker in the store where the user is located. This allows people in the same location store to enjoy the contents together. The user information and the usage history are collected and managed in the public cloud. Therefore, users can receive customized services regardless of stores. Based on the implementation results of the platform, it is shown that the proposed platform provides more functions and advantages than other streaming services. Also proposed platform can provide contents efficiently to concurrent users.

In particular, bulky gloves inhibit the ability to interact with standard computing interfaces such as a mouse or keyboard. This paper presents the results of a preliminary investigation into a system that permits the space suit gloves themselves to be used as data entry devices. Hand motion tracking is combined with simple finger gesture recognition to enable use of a virtual keyboard, while tactile feedback provides touch-based context to the graphical user interface (GUI) and positive confirmation of keystroke events. In human subject trials, conducted with twenty participants using a prototype system, participants entered text significantly faster with tactile feedback than without (p = 0.02). The results support incorporation of vibrotactile information in a future system that will enable full touch typing and general mouse interactions using instrumented EVA gloves.	activity recognition;computer keyboard;computer mouse;display device;event (computing);gesture recognition;graphical user interface;helmet-mounted display;information system;interaction;line-of-sight (missile);point and click;prototype;smartphone;touch typing;virtual keyboard;wired glove	Richard J.

f282cad5b1c30ca1b31ceda0fdcc7ffda6396132	tablet fish tank virtual reality: a usability study		In this paper, we describe the development a tablet FTVR prototype that incorporates both motion parallax and stereo cues with the use of easy-to-find hardware. We also present findings of a usability study based on the prototype. Experiment: We conducted an experiment on the usability of our tablet FTVR prototype using the visual search task from the comparative study between CAVE and FTVR [DJK*06]. To perform the task, participants had to identify the location of a rectangular bump on the surface of a noisy potato-shaped object then move it under a pole by rotating the potato using the arrow keys at the bottom of the display. Tablet Fish Tank Virtual Reality: To achieve tablet FTVR without any enhancement to the hardware itself, we combine Anaglyph 3D for stereopsis with head position tracking from the tabletâs front camera. For stereo, we use Anaglyph 3D images. For motion parallax, following previous studies [FN11, Rek95]. See Algorithm 1 for more detail. We used the Unity game engine to develop the application, and ran it on an iPad Air (model number A1474). The application operates in four view modes: Normal 2D (2D), Head-coupled display (HCD), Anaglyph 3D (Anaglyph), and Combined view mode (Combined). Results: Here we present the results of the experiment. We dropped the data for one participant from all analyses because the time the individual took to complete the task was many standard deviations beyond the mean. The objective data are summarised in Table 1. The results of the comparison between the Normal 2D view mode and the combined view mode are summarized in Figure 2. Discussion & Conclusion: The first question is How effective is tablet FTVR? Although there were no statistically significant differences between the view modes for PQ scores, we suspect that this was more because of the visual discomfort from Anaglyph 3D and the front-facing camera-based tracking techniqueâs limitations than anything else. The comparison results suggest that participants perceived depth and felt that a virtual object existed in front of them more in the Combined view mode, when compared to the Normal 2D view mode. Our findings coincide with those of Li et al. [LPWL12]. We suspect that participants were unable to perform the task better in the Combined view mode because of the front-facing camera-based tracking techniqueâs limitations. This coincides with a study by Kongsilp and Dailey [KD17], who found that in desktop FTVR settings, the combination of motion parallax and stereopsis cues produces lower visual discomfort and higher subjective level of presence when compared to the stereopsis cue only. The last question is If it is useful, should we develop a new system or enhance existing devices? We believe that it would be best to develop a new system from scratch if we absolutely require stereoscopic displays. Both polarized 3D and active shutter 3D technologies would require a fair amount of hardware changes to todayâs commodity tablets. Reference: â [DJK*06] DEMIRALP C., JACKSON C. D., KARELITZ D.

Visually impaired students are frequently integrated in mainstream courses, collaborating with sighted peers and instructors. This paper describes a tangible block localization and tracking method, using small inexpensive sensor packages that detect color placed on an interaction surfaceâi.e., a standard flat-screen display. The system recursively subdivides the display surface into regions of distinct colors that the sensor package can distinguish. Once located, the sensor package can be tracked by moving the color pattern underneath to follow it, re-expanding the pattern as needed to capture the sensor package if it moves too fast. The novel tracking infrastructure supports novel approaches to teach a number of science and math concepts to visually impaired students.	tangible user interface	Rhonda Stanton;Enrico Pontelli;Z.

One challenge here is to develop a teleoperational robot system that can be manipulated by children themselves. There are two requirements for realizing such a system. First, the system has to be sufficiently intuitive so that child users can control it without the need for detailed instructions. Second, the control of the system should have some amount of enjoyment so that child users do not get bored. To satisfy these requirements, we introduce a tricycle-style teleoperational interface that remotely controls a robot. We also report field tests that are currently being conducted at English learning schools for children in Japan.	requirement;robot	Fumihide Tanaka;Toshimitsu Takahashi	2012	2012 7th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)	10.1145/2157689.2157782	telerobotics;simulation;early childhood education;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	Robotics	-42.022006766872	-45.20032746861981	71316
9a2483aaaf4378b8f9c18b4a035784e186aaffe7	throw and tilt - seamless interaction across devices using mobile phone gestures		To overcome limitations of small screens and to provide intuitive ways of interacting with personal data, this work addresses the seamless combination of sensor-enabled phones with large displays. An intuitive basic set of tilt gestures is introduced for a stepwise or continuous interaction with both mobile applications and distant user interfaces by utilizing the handheld as a remote control. In addition, we introduce throwing gestures to transfer media documents to a large display. By means of these gestures, we also propose transferring a running interface from a mobile phone to a large screen (to improve usability) and back (to achieve mobility). We demonstrate the feasibility of the interaction methods with several application prototypes facilitating a very natural flow of interaction.	handheld game console;interaction;mobile app;mobile device;mobile phone;personally identifiable information;privacy;remote control;scrolling;seamless3d;software engineering;software prototyping;stepwise regression;usability;user interface	Raimund Dachselt;Robert Buchholz	2008			embedded system;humanâcomputer interaction;mobile search;mobile technology;mobile computing;mobile phone tracking;mobile station;mobile web;gsm services;user interface;computer science	HCI	-46.290622720931296	-42.290492027647105	71537

A simulated flight deck environment was established according to the dimensions of a real commercial aircraft cockpit with back projection, and then a balanced sequence of pseudo random variates was generated with replicated Latin square design. After the experiment of 18 interior color levels and 2 luminance levels, a complex statistical analysis was conducted to examine the significance as well as correlations within different factors. The fluctuation of luminance can affects the results slightly, while the change of the interior color, both hue and saturation-intensity levels, can influence subjects' visual ergonomics significantly and interactively. This coherent assessment indicates that light blue was the best choice, whereas, vivid yellow was the last among the 18 colors.	coherent;human factors and ergonomics	Ye Zhou;Wei Zhang;Baofeng Li;Jinhai Yu;Zhi Ma	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39354-9_25	computer vision;simulation;engineering;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-43.16273408449775	-51.76946552102227	71688

These services use automatic speechrecognition and music-understanding technologies to provide content analysis results, such as full-text speech transcriptions and music scene descriptions, that let users enjoy content-based multimedia retrieval and active browsing of speech and music signals without relying on metadata. When automatic content analysis is used, however, errors are inevitable. PodCastle and Songle therefore provide an efficient error correction interface that let users easily correct errors by selecting from a list of candidate alternatives.	browsing;crowdsourcing;error detection and correction;module file;web service	Masataka Goto;Jun Ogata;Kazuyoshi Yoshii;Hiromasa Fujihara;Matthias Mauch;Tomoyasu Nakano	2012			computer science;multimedia;communication;world wide web	Web+IR	-34.789619614708734	-47.636845568517295	72012

In this work, we explore error-aware gaze-based interfaces that estimate and adapt to gaze estimation error on-the-fly. We implement a sample erroraware user interface for gaze-based selection and different error compensation methods: a naÃ¯ve approach that increases component size directly proportional to the absolute error, a recent model by Feit et al. that is based on the two-dimensional error distribution, and a novel predictive model that shifts gaze by a directional error estimate. We evaluate these models in a 12-participant user study and show that our predictive model significantly outperforms the others in terms of selection rate, particularly for small gaze targets. These results underline both the feasibility and potential of next generation error-aware gaze-based user interfaces.	approximation error;image scaling;naivety;predictive modelling;real-time clock;seamless3d;usability testing;user interface	Michael Barz;Florian Daiber;Daniel Sonntag;Andreas Bulling	2018		10.1145/3204493.3204536	gaze;eye tracking;machine learning;approximation error;usability;mobile interaction;user interface;artificial intelligence;computer science	HCI	-45.49121568102772	-45.44154672466069	72258

It agentizes an artifact by attaching humanoid parts to it. There have been many studies that can provide valuable information on using spoken directions and gestures via anthropomorphic agents such as CG(Computer graphics) agents and communication robots. Our method directly anthropomorphizes the artifact through robotic bodily parts shaped like those of humans. An anthropomorphized artifact with these parts can provide information to people by giving them spoken directions and expressing themselves through body language. This makes people pay more attentions to the artifact, than when using anthropomorphic CG or robot agents. We conducted an experiment to verify the difference between receiving an explanation of the functions of the artifact using the direct anthropomorphization method and that from using the independent humanoid agent """"Robovie"""".

9194c8eccf02e02fb3a048736593365e6487972d	on the usage of smart devices to augment the user interaction with multimedia applications		Wearable devices have recently gained a foothold in the market with the uptake of smartwatches. The strong tie between a smartwatch and its owner, the highly predictable position of a smartwatch on the body, and its internal sensors are enabling a wide array of applications that leverage the user context. In this paper we focus on a gesture recognition system to augment the user interaction with multimedia applications. We define a set of seven gestures that are relevant across several applications and we collect an extensive dataset with two smartwatches (the Motorola Moto360 and Apple's Watch). We use Long Short Term Memory neural networks for gesture recognition based on sensor data from both smartwatches. We provide an extensive evaluation of the classification accuracy of the system and provide a sensitivity analysis to find the Long Short Term Memory configuration that maximizes the classification accuracy. We also show the extent to which Long Short Term Memory neural networks outperform traditional machine learning approaches. We also illustrate an application we built for the Android and iOS platforms that allows developers to easily integrate the gesture recognition in their own systems. We conclude the paper with a description of use cases to underscore the potential impact of our contribution.

The rapid development in bringing this technology on roads attracts growing attention of research in the human interaction with autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on the interaction of other road users with autonomous vehicles. These road users may be pedestrians who negotiate their right of way, other human drivers sharing the same road, or human traffic control officers. In order to learn about these road users in general, this paper aims to identify first the formalized hand signals applied by officers. The paper answers the question whether there is a general and universal language to interact with traffic. If so, then future work can identify elements of this universal language in the gestures of other road users, and facilitate an understanding between them and autonomous vehicles.	autonomous robot	Surabhi Gupta;Maria Vasardani;Stephan Winter	2016		10.1145/3003965.3003967	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;communication	Robotics	-37.21482602766614	-38.479558169653835	72908

To make humanoid live with people, spoken language communication is fundamental because we use this kind of communication every day. However, due to difficulties of speech recognition itself and implementation on the robot, a robot with such an ability has not been developed. In this study, we propose a robot with the technique implemented to overcome these problems. This proposed system includes three key features, image processing, sound source separation, and turn-taking timing control. Processing image captured with camera mounted on the robotpsilas eyes enables to find and identify whom the robot should talked to. Sound source separation enables distant speech recognition, so that people need no special device, such as head-set microphones. Turn-taking timing control is often lacked in many conventional spoken dialogue system, but this is fundamental because the conversation proceeds in real-time. The effectiveness of these elements as well as the example of conversation are shown in experiments.	covox speech thing;dialog system;experiment;image processing;microphone;modal logic;personalization;real-time transcription;robot;source separation;speech recognition;spoken dialog systems	Shinya Fujie;Daichi Watanabe;Yuhi Ichikawa;Hikaru Taniyama;Kosuke Hosoya;Yoichi Matsuyama;Tetsunori Kobayashi	2008	Humanoids 2008 - 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2008.4756014	humanârobot interaction;computer vision;speech recognition;image processing;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-36.95569385785077	-42.97809758605428	73066

We introduce a whole framework and resources of a real-life scenario for elderly subjects supported by an assistive bathing robot, addressing health and hygiene care issues.

We consider privacy issues by evaluating the depth visual stream along with the RGB, using Kinect sensors. The audio-gestural recognition task on this new dataset yields up to 84.5%, while the online validation of the I-Support system on elderly users accomplishes up to 84% when the two modalities are fused together. The results are promising enough to support further research in the area of multimodal recognition for assistive social HRI, considering the difficulties of the specific task.	data acquisition;humanârobot interaction;kinect;multimodal interaction;multimodal learning;privacy;real life;robot;sensor;signal processing	Athanasia Zlatintsi;Isidoros Rodomagoulakis;Petros Koutras;A.

The user remotely controls, from a desktop computer, a toy car that is situated in a remote environment and equipped with wireless stereo-cameras and other sensors. The experience of the user is enriched by the information displayed to the user, namely the live stereo image and artificial multimodal special effects generated from the information from the sensors. The proposed telepresence game is expected to offer a different kind of fun and excitement compared to the 3D graphics based counterparts because the user does not have to suspend one's disbelief, and has to be aware and conscious of the actual physical implications of one's action. In the actual demo, two telepresence toy cars will run on a small mock up race track (thus requiring two control PC's)."""	3d computer graphics;as-interface;desktop computer;experience;mock object;multimodal interaction;sensor;situated;stereo cameras	Yongjin Kim;Jaehoon Jung;Seokhee Jeon;Sangyoon Lee;Gerard Jounghyun Kim	2005		10.1145/1178477.1178567	simulation;engineering;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-46.083766315165235	-39.670976905971514	73099

We define interactive legends as a class of controls combining the visual representation of static legends and interaction mechanisms of widgets. As interactive legends start to appear in popular websites, we categorize their designs for common data types and evaluate their effectiveness compare to standard widgets. Results suggest that 1) interactive legends can lead to faster perception of the mapping between data values and visual encodings and 2) interaction time is affected differently depending on the data type. Additionally, our study indicates superiority both in terms of perception and interaction of ordinal controls over numerical ones. Numerical techniques are mostly used in todayâs systems. By providing solutions to allowing users to modify ranges interactively, we believe that interactive legends make it possible to increase the use of ordinal techniques for visual exploration.	categorization;global variable;information visualization;interaction technique;interactive storytelling;interactivity;numerical analysis;ordinal data	Nathalie Henry Riche;Bongshin Lee;Catherine Plaisant	2010	Comput.

An off-the-shelf laser pointer has a toggle switch to generate a laser spot, the presence (ON) or absence (OFF) of this spot and its combination are the candidates of the interaction technique. We conducted empirical study that compared remote pointing technique performed using combination of ON and OFF of the laser spot, ON-OFF and ON-OFF-ON, and using a desktop mouse as a baseline comparison. We present quantitative performance test based on Fitts' test using a one-direction tapping test in ISO/TS 9241-411 procedure; and assessment of comfort using a questionnaire. We hope this result give contribution to the interaction technique using laser pointer as a pointing device especially in selecting the appropriate clicking technique for real application.

In the haptic guidance paradigm, the subject is physically guided through the ideal motion by the haptic interface, thus giving the subject a kinesthetic understanding of what is required. Subjects learned a complex 3D motion under three training conditions (haptic, visual, haptic and visual) and were required to manually reproduce the movement under two recall conditions (with vision, without vision). Performance was measured in terms of position, shape, timing, and drift. Findings from this study indicate that haptic guidance is effective in training. While visual training was better for teaching the trajectory shape, temporal aspects of the task were more effectively learned from haptic guidance. This supports a possible role for haptics in the training of perceptual motor skills in virtual environments.	alternating occlusion training;cognition;experiment;haptic technology;programming paradigm;simulation;virtual reality	David Feygin;Madeleine Keehner;Frank Tendick	2002		10.1109/HAPTIC.2002.998939	stereotaxy;computer vision;simulation;computer science;multimedia	Robotics	-46.86894501568949	-49.940922327597946	73266

The substitute interface is established by the combination of wearable devices such as a head-mounted display with camera and a ring-type microphone. The camera recognizes which object the user intends to employ. When the user picks up and taps the object, such as a notebook, a virtual display is overlaid on the object, and the user can operate the ad hoc mobile device as if the object were part of the device. Display size can be changed easily by selecting a larger object. The userâs pointing/selection action is recognized by the combination of the camera and the ring-type microphone. We first investigate the usage scene of tablet devices and create a prototype that can operate as a tablet device.

A telepointer that has a pointer delegation function is called a delegate pointer. The appearance of delegate pointers in an interactive environment can show the weight of voting. Moreover, delegate pointers can be used to limit the manipulators of objects to only one or a small group in order to reduce any conflicting manipulation. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the appropriateness of the appearance of pointers to show the voting weight, and to test the feasibility of the delegate pointer.	experiment;norm (social);pointer (computer programming);telepointer	Noritaka Osawa	2007		10.1145/1240866.1241049	proxy;real-time computing;voting;computer science;delegate;distributed computing;computer security	HCI	-40.72646746011191	-50.53231918045631	73327

Existing systems typically provide two dimensional video streams to remote participants, and these are restricted to viewpoint locations based on the placement of physical cameras. Recent systems have incorporated the ability of a remote expert to annotate their 2D view and for these annotations to be displayed in the physical workspace to the local worker. We present a prototype remote guidance system, called RemoteFusion, which is based on the volumetric fusion of commodity depth cameras. The system incorporates real-time 3D fusion with color, the ability to distinguish and render dynamic elements of a scene whether human or non-human, a multi-touch driven free 3D viewpoint, and a Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) light annotation mechanism. We provide a physical overview of the system, including hardware and software configuration, and detail the implementation of each of the key features.	augmented reality;computer hardware;guidance system;multi-touch;prototype;real-time clock;streaming media;workspace	Matt Adcock;Stuart Anderson;Bruce H.

2b94ba0b9cb1ac3e6b142f745eaad908ea227eb7	human factors evaluation of a vision-based facial gesture interface		We adapted a vision-based face tracking system for cursor control by head movement. An additional vision-based algorithm allowed the user to enter a click by opening the mouth. The Fitts law information throughput rate of cursor movements was measured to be 2.0 bits/sec with the ISO 9241-9 international standard method for testing input devices. A usability assessment was also conducted and we report and discuss the results. A practical application of this facial gesture interface was studied: text input using the Dasher system, which allows a user to type by moving the cursor. The measured typing speed was 7-12 words/minute, depending on level of user expertise. Performance of the system is compared to a conventional mouse interface.	algorithm;computer mouse;cursor (databases);dasher;facial motion capture;fitts's law;gesture recognition;human factors and ergonomics;ieee 1394;input device;joystick;pointing device;throughput;tracking system;usb;usability;words per minute	Gamhewage Chaminda de Silva;Michael J.

ead58b00ac70d46c50d6cccaa98b4a9662964b37	gestyboard 2.0: a gesture-based text entry concept for high performance ten-finger touch-typing and blind typing on touchscreens		This paper presents the second version of the Gestyboard, which is an innovative approach of text entry on multi-touch devices like tabletops or tablets. To overcome the lack of tactile feedback, we use unique gesture-to-key mappings for each finger according to the ten-finger touch-typing method. As a key feature, the Gestyboard only accepts keystrokes when they are performed with the finger corresponding to the ten-finger touch-typing method. This way, missing a keystroke is not possible, and therefore blind typing is naturally supported by the concept. The first version of the Gestyboard was optimized according to the qualitative and quantitative results of our first formal evaluation. This paper presents two new evaluations which give new insights on the comparative performance and conceptual improvements of the Gestyboard. In the second evaluation, our participants reached a speed of 108 cpm (characters per minute [21.6wpm]) and an error rate of 4% which is close to the performance of standard users on classic touchscreen keyboards. The third evaluation additionally revealed that our participants increased their typing speed with the Gestyboard by 44% and decreased their error rate by 48% in just 3 trial sessions. This steep learning curve is mostly due to the familiarity to the QWERTY layout.	event (computing);multi-touch;touch typing;touchscreen;words per minute	Tayfur Coskun;Christian A.

4eb29d6f7ba2e3fc2176d14507a6657ba7c8682e	the flashing right turn signal with pedestrian indication: a human factors study to assess driver comprehension		Given the increased fatality risk of older pedestrians, and the large and growing older adult population in the United States and around the world, many countermeasures to ensure aging pedestrian safety have been explored (e.g., different types of crosswalk markings). The present study sought to investigate the potential of an experimental countermeasure, the flashing pedestrian indicator (FPI). This signal, intended for right-turning drivers, alternates between a yellow arrow and a pedestrian symbol when a pedestrian calls for a walk phase at a signalized intersection. The purpose of this signal is to cue right-turning drivers to the potential presence of a pedestrian, encourage scanning to the right for crossing pedestrians, and promote driver yielding behaviors. We conducted a study to gauge the comprehension of drivers who were naive to the signal to explore if the FPIâs intended message was understood. Participants were presented with scenarios depicting the FPI and other signal states and were asked the meaning of the observed signal (open-ended and multiple choice questions). Comprehension was tested across a range of age groups: younger (21â35 years), middle-aged (50â64), and older adult (65+) drivers. While in general the signal was understood, some participants were confused regarding the meaning of the FPI in certain situations. Potential positive effects of the FPI need to be weighed against potential confusion before any further recommendations can be made regarding the FPI as a potential countermeasure to assist with pedestrian crashes.	bios;human factors and ergonomics;list comprehension	Nelson A.

89477503ddaebb341565966f64e635021b5fcf65	evaluating gesture-based augmented reality annotation	spatial referencing;user study;annotations;hololens;augmented reality	Drawing annotations with 3D hand gestures in augmented reality are useful for creating visual and spatial references in the real world, especially when these gestures can be issued from a distance. Different techniques exist for highlighting physical objects with hand-drawn circle and arrow annotations from a distance, assuming an approximate 3D scene model (e.g., as provided by the Microsoft HoloLens). However, little is known about user preference and performance of such methods for annotating real-world 3D environments. In this paper, we compare different annotation methods using the HoloLens augmented reality development platform: Surface-Drawing and Air-Drawing, with either raw but smoothed or interpreted and beautified gesture input. For the Surface-Drawing method, users control a cursor that is projected onto the world model, allowing gesture input to occur directly on the surfaces of real-world objects. For the Air-Drawing method, gesture drawing occurs at the user's fingertip and is projected onto the world model on release. The methods have different characteristics regarding necessitated vergence switches and afforded cursor control. We performed an experiment in which users draw on two different real-world objects at different distances using the different methods. Results indicate that Surface-Drawing is more accurate than Air-Drawing and Beautified annotations are drawn faster than Non-Beautified; participants also preferred Surface-Drawing and Beautified.	approximation algorithm;ar (unix);augmented reality;cursor (databases);ibm notes;microsoft hololens;network switch;smoothing;user interface;vergence	YunSuk Chang;Benjamin Nuernberger;Bo Luan;Tobias HÃ¶llerer	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI)	10.1109/3DUI.2017.7893337	computer vision;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.41481188176405	-40.58352633179681	73855

This set of techniques is called SDM (Selective Dynamic Manipulation). Selective, indicating our goal for providing a high degree of user control in selecting an object set, in selecting teractive techniques and the properties they affect, and in the degree to which a user action affects the visualization. Dynamic, indicating that the interactions all occur in real-time and that interactive animation is used to provide better contextual information to users in response to an action or operation. Manipulation, indicating the types of interactions we provide, where users can directly move objects and transform their appearance to perform different tasks. While many other approaches only provide interactive techniques in isolation, SDM supports a suite of techniques which users can combine to solve a wide variety of problems.	interaction;real-time transcription;user interface	Mei C.

5aaa4fd891d30e8a33047be5f0040d4565baf9a2	tof tactile stamps: drawing object silhouettes through depth segmentation by blind people		We present a workstation utilizing a simple depth segmentation approach to let visually impaired users transform real-world objects into their two-dimensional silhouette shape. Therefore, we use a Kinect TOF system for detection and a novel two-dimensional dynamic tactile pin-matrix display for presenting the captured result. The calibration, segmentation as well as some experimental findings about the used TOF system are explained. Based on the limitations of the TOF system, the segmentation is limited to objects being at least 29mm high. Furthermore, the segmented shapes are less detailed, ragged and sometimes optical deformed. A brief evaluation with three blind users showed that they would accept little such deformations. However, they would like to use such a system for drawing complex objects or share an object's impression with other users in a very fast and enjoyable way.	kinect;workstation	Jens Bornschein;Lukas FÃ¶rster;Denise Bornschein	2017		10.1145/3056540.3064946	silhouette;computer science;impression;computer vision;computer graphics (images);workstation;segmentation;artificial intelligence	HCI	-42.368414664405584	-39.63158904244057	74096
66c747e8891d989f019770d37e2f5d2736d01ebd	assessing the readability of stacked graphs		Stacked graphs are a visualization technique popular in casual scenarios for representing multiple time-series. Variations of stacked graphs have been focused on reducing the distortion of individual streams because foundational perceptual studies suggest that variably curved slopes may make it difficult to accurately read and compare values. We contribute to this discussion by formally comparing the relative readability of basic stacked area charts, ThemeRivers, streamgraphs and our own interactive technique for straightening baselines of individual streams in a ThemeRiver. We used both real-world and randomly generated datasets and covered tasks at the elementary, intermediate and overall information levels. Results indicate that the decreased distortion of the newer techniques does appear to improve their readability, with streamgraphs performing best for value comparison tasks. We also found that when a variety of tasks is expected to be performed, using the interactive version of the themeriver leads to more correctness at the cost of being slower for value comparison tasks.	baseline (configuration management);call stack;chart;correctness (computer science);design of experiments;distortion;futures studies;graphical user interface;information theory;interaction;procedural generation;randomness;smart;time series	Alice Thudt;Jagoda Walny;Charles Perin;Fateme Rajabiyazdi;Lindsay MacDonald;Riane Vardeleon;Saul Greenberg;M.

675eb53a4793a53fb8e67e522a9d7cbc1af337b6	violin timbre navigator: real-time visual feedback of violin bowing based on audio analysis and machine learning		Bowing is the main control mechanism in sound production during a violin performance. The balance among bowing parameters such as acceleration, force, velocity or bow-bridge distance are continuously determining the characteristics of the sound. However, in traditional music pedagogy, approaches to teaching the mechanics of bowing are based on subjective and vague perception, rather than on accurate understanding of the principles of movement bowing. In the last years, advances in technology has allowed to measure bowing parameters in violin performances. However, sensing systems are generally very expensive, intrusive and require for very complex and time consuming setups, which makes it impossible to bring them into a classroom environment. Here, we propose an algorithm that is able to estimate bowing parameters from audio analysis in real-time, requiring just a microphone and a simple calibration process. Additionally, we present the Violin Palette, a prototype that uses the reported algorithm and presents bowing information in an intuitive way.

People with artistic and animation skills are required to create expressive gestures and movements on the robots. We observe that dancers can translate music into motions that are perceived as expressive by the audience. In this study, we developed a program to exploit melodic and dynamics information from music to create expressive robot motion. The program was used on two applications: producing motions strictly from the music information and controlling the execution a pre-programmed sequence of actions. Both applications are intended for a robot theater. The former was applied on an arm robot, while the latter on a humanoid KHR-1 robot. Two surveys were done to analyze the impact of our method. The results suggest that the robot motions produced by our program can be perceived as being more expressive and more dynamic than the motions created by a person or without music information.

Here, we report two new experiments designed to investigate whether this phenomenon also emerges when a triangle appears as a local feature within a wine label. The experimental task was to identify whether all of the wine bottles in a store display were the same or not, while each wine bottle had either a downward- or upward-pointing triangle displayed on its label. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the participants responded more rapidly when searching for a wine bottle with a downward-pointing triangle on its label than when the target had a triangle pointing upward, indicating the presence of a DPTS effect. In Experiment 2, the DPTS effect was replicated while varying the set size. The magnitude of the DPTS effect increased with increasing set size. Taken together, these results revealed similar visual search results for pictorial stimuli with triangles as local features as for geometric triangular shapes. The implications of these findings for the design of product labels are discussed.	doppler effect;emergence;experiment;image	Hui Zhao;Charles Spence;Xiaoang Wan	2016		10.1145/3007577.3007582	mathematics;advertising;communication;engineering drawing	HCI	-43.68306728313407	-51.4491270550174	74823

Extracting this knowledge allows an organization to optimize internal processes and facilitate training of new hires. Therefore, there has been a significant research effort in developing techniques for automated knowledge mining at workplaces. However, research in the past have been focused mainly on extracting knowledge of stationary professions such as office workers, who perform most of their day-to-day tasks at their desk. In this work, we propose an approach for mining work knowledge of physically active professions such as nurses, firefighters, waiters, housekeepers or janitors. We leverage the advances of mobile sensing to extract knowledge from workers with high level of mobility and physical activity patterns. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach on a real-world scenario of a janitor as a study subject. We show that using data collected from mobile devices carried by a janitor throughout their work, we are able to extract knowledge rules that describe generalized patterns of janitor's behavior. We expect the proposed method to be applied to other fields to mine knowledge from workplaces.	data mining;experiment;framing (world wide web);high-level programming language;mobile device;smartphone;smartwatch;stationary process;unsupervised learning;vii	Le T.

To reduce the time to make these selections, researchers have proposed in-place toolbars such as Toolglasses or popup palettes. Even though in-place toolbars have been known for a long time, there are factors influencing their performance that have not been investigated. To explore the subtleties of different designs for in-place toolbars, we implemented and compared three approaches: warping the cursor to the toolbar, having the toolbar pop up over the cursor, and showing the toolbar on the trackpad itself to allow direct touch. Our study showed that all three new techniques were faster than traditional static toolbars, but also uncovered important differences between the three in-place versions. Participants spent significantly less time in the direct-touch trackpad, and warping the cursorâs location caused a time-consuming attentional shift. These results provide a better understanding of how small changes to in-place toolbar techniques can affect performance.	cursor (databases);fastest;image warping;in-place algorithm;touchpad	Andre Doucette;Carl Gutwin;Regan Lee Mandryk	2010			real-time computing;simulation;computer hardware	HCI	-45.925741804040655	-46.52253587638013	75107

Therefore, it is crucial for a video browsing system to be fast and accurate with minimum user effort. In sharp contrast to traditional Relevance Feedback (RF), we propose a novel paradigm for fast video browsing dubbed Mental Visual Indexing (MVI). At each interactive round, the user only needs to select one of the displayed shots that is most visually similar to her mental target and then the user's choice will further tailor the search to the target. The search model update given a user feedback only requires vector inner products, which makes MVI highly responsive. MVI is underpinned by a sequence model in terms of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is trained by automatically generated shot sequences from a rigorous Bayesian framework, which simulates user feedback process. Experimental results on three 3-hour movies conducted by real users demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	browsing;programming paradigm;radio frequency;random neural network;recurrent neural network;relevance feedback	Richang Hong;Jun He;Hanwang Zhang;Tat-Seng Chua	2016		10.1145/2964284.2967296	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web	Vision	-33.763748267520285	-49.79582884727584	75146

The rotation style of 12 different stimuli was varied by burst length (i.e., 20, 50, 100 ms), continuity (i.e., continuous and discontinuous), and direction (e.g., forward and backward). Using these stimuli 528 stimulus pairs were presented to 12 subjects who were to distinguish if stimuli in each pair were the same or different. Then they rated the stimuli using four scales measuring the pleasantness, arousal, approachability, and dominance qualities of the 12 stimuli. The results showed that continuous forward-backward rotating stimuli were rated as significantly more unpleasant, arousing, avoidable, and dominating than other types of stimulations (e.g., discontinuous forward rotation). The reaction times to these stimuli were significantly faster than reaction times to discontinuous forward and backward rotating stimuli. The results clearly suggest that even simple haptic stimulation can carry emotional information. The results can be utilized when making use of haptics in human-technology interaction.	haptic technology;prototype;scott continuity	Katri Salminen;Veikko Surakka;Jani Lylykangas;Jukka Raisamo;Rami Saarinen;Roope Raisamo;Jussi Rantala;Grigori E.

In particular, mutual relationships of body movements between a robot and a human are considered to be important for smooth and natural communication, as they are in human-human communication. We have developed a semi-autonomous humanoid robot system that is capable of cooperative body movements with humans using environment-based sensors and switching communicative units. And we conducted an experiment using this robot system and verified the importance of cooperative behaviors in a route-guidance situation where a human gives directions to the robot. This result indicates that the cooperative body movements greatly enhance the emotional impressions of human in a route-guidance situation. We believe these results allow us to develop interactive humanoid robots that sociably communicate with humans.	autonomous robot;humanoid robot;humans;semiconductor industry;sensor;smoothing	Daisuke Sakamoto;Takayuki Kanda;Tetsuo Ono;Masayuki Kamashima;Michita Imai;Hiroshi Ishiguro	2004	RO-MAN 2004. 13th IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE Catalog No.04TH8759)	10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.11.001	humanârobot interaction;three-dimensional space;entrainment;computer vision;motion capture;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;social robot;user interface	Robotics	-39.96979219956213	-48.66622700466928	75387

The user quickly skims through the list and picks a few apps for a closer look. The vast majority of the apps regardless of how well-made they are go unnoticed. App icons uniquely represent each app in Google Play and help apps to get noticed, as we demonstrate in the paper. We reviewed the visual qualities of icons that could make them noticeable and likable. We then computationally measured two of the qualities visual saliency and complexity for 930 icons and linked the computed scores to app popularity (the number of app ratings and installs). The measures explained 38% of variance in the number of ratings, if app genre was accounted for.

a32e246e8ac36b5e3447cd9bf0af44b98be33000	tactifloor: design and evaluation of vibration signals for doorway reminder systems		The forgetting of objects is an everyday problem. Current research projects develop doorway reminder systems which are supposed to remind the user of certain objects or events before leaving home. At present the focus of research is mainly on the technical design of the recognition of persons and objects. For this reason we are concentrating on the design and evaluation of possible system feedback. In particular, the target group of the digital natives is familiar with the concept of tactile feedback for reminder functions. Therefore known vibration patterns were used, which are to be transferred to the user via the floor. This solution was implemented in a first prototype. A user study with 19 volunteers showed a general acceptance of tactile feedback via floor panel and the cognitive link of the vibration patterns with reminder notifications.	digital native;floor and ceiling functions;prototype;usability testing	Daniela Reschke;Matthias BÃ¶hmer;Manuel Sorg	2017		10.1145/3152832.3156623	humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;cognition;forgetting;vibration;digital native	HCI	-46.97241044166743	-42.7609545006917	75621

The main novelty is the use of the user's situation as the basis for designing color codes to explain the environmental information and for developing the wayfinding system to detect and recognize such color codes. Actually, people would require different information according to their situations. Therefore, situation-based color codes are designed, including location-specific codes and guide codes. These color codes are affixed in certain locations to provide information to the visually impaired, and their location and meaning are then recognized using the proposed wayfinding system. Consisting of three steps, the proposed wayfinding system first recognizes the current situation using a vocabulary tree that is built on the shape properties of images taken of various situations. Next, it detects and recognizes the necessary codes according to the current situation, based on color and edge information. Finally, it provides the user with environmental information and their path through an auditory interface. To assess the validity of the proposed wayfinding system, we have conducted field test with four visually impaired, then the results showed that they can find the optimal path in real-time with an accuracy of 95%.	color;qr code;real-time clock;vocabulary	Eunjeong Ko;Jinsun Ju;Eun Yi Kim	2011		10.1145/2049536.2049545	situation awareness;computer vision;simulation;computer science	HCI	-44.10399877812398	-45.52824855996242	75626

There is little scientific evidence on the conditions under which additional taps for navigation are better than scrolling or vice versa. Therefore, we conducted a user study in which we experimentally evaluated GUIs tailored for a smartphone and a tablet PC, respectively. Each participant performed the same task with two different layouts of the same GUI, either on a given smartphone or tablet PC. We collected quantitative data through measuring task completion time and error rates, as well as qualitative data through subjective questionnaires. The main result is that tailoring a GUI specifically for a smartphone or tablet PC, respectively, is important, since screen size matters. Users performed significantly better when they could use the tailored version on the given device. This preference was also reflected in their subjective opinions.	display size;experiment;graphical user interface;scrolling;smartphone;tablet computer;usability testing	David Raneburger;Roman Popp;David Alonso-RÃ­os;Hermann Kaindl;JÃ¼rgen Falb	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.635	the internet;usability;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;graphical user interface;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-47.62623142672634	-45.56707015798617	75962

In this paper we report the results of using a collaborative Mixed Reality application that allows the trainer to manipulate the virtual objects in a virtual environment. At the same time, the trainee observes the virtual object manipulation as means to move the real objects accordingly. The trainer uses a Virtual Reality interface and the trainee uses an Augmented Reality one. The results show that, even though the time to complete the task using the application is longer, users perceive that collaboration using a similar application in the real world could make collaboration easier.	ar (unix);augmented reality;computer vision;experiment;head-mounted display;mixed reality;reality lab;software house;virtual reality	Luis Montoya;Elizabeth Restrepo;Daniels Sjogreen;Helmuth Gomez	2007			immersion (virtual reality);computer-mediated reality;humanâcomputer interaction;mixed reality;multimedia;instructional simulation;virtual reality;augmented reality;computer science;cave automatic virtual environment;trainer	HCI	-43.20969758237676	-38.63108045565753	76132

This kind of technology augments the range of human perception and actuation. In this paper we quantitatively determine if wearable laser pointers are viable alternatives to Head-Mounted Displays for indicating where in the physical environment the local agent should direct her/his attention. The potential benefit of the laser pointer would be reduced eye fatigue, due to the fact that the documented refocusing challenges associated with HMD use would be completely eliminated. 10 participants where asked to perform a short tele-guided pick-and drop task using both approaches. The quantitative analysis indicates that user performance in the laser pointer condition is higher than the HMD approach (P = .064, Î± = 0.1). While all 10 participants found the task easy in both conditions, 8 of 10 participants found the laser pointer system more convenient.	head-mounted display;pointer (computer programming);television;wearable computer	Shahram Jalaliniya;Thomas Pederson;Steven Houben	2014		10.1145/2641248.2641354	simulation;computer hardware;engineering;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.65872888209396	-47.574449596540035	76248

This study involved 25 subjects performing selection tasks with a TouchPad mouse while wearing a wearable computer on their back and using a head-mounted display. Each subject performed the tasks in 27 different combinations of four postures (sitting, kneeling, standing and prone) and seven different placements of the TouchPad mouse on the subjectâs body (forearm, thigh by 2, torso by 2, and upper arm by 2). We measured the time and error rate to complete the selection of a circular target. The results for the effects due to posture showed that there were similar time effects for sitting, standing and kneeling. When examining the effects resulting from mouse position, the front of the thigh was shown to be the best position of the mouse. When the posturing and mouse position conditions were combined, the results indicated that the thigh front mouse position would be most appropriate for sitting, kneeling and standing postures, and the forearm mouse position would be best for the prone position.	attachments;bit error rate;cpu cache;comment (computer programming);cursor (databases);desktop computer;head-mounted display;input device;interaction;poor posture;touchpad;wearable computer	Bruce H.

By employing a secondary device, to work in unison with a touchscreen, some of this demand may be alleviated. In a medium-fidelity driving simulator, twenty-four drivers completed four typical in-vehicle tasks, utilising each of four devices -- touchscreen, rotary controller, steering wheel controls and touchpad (counterbalanced). Participants were then able to combine devices during a final 'free-choice' drive. Visual behaviour, driving/task performance and subjective ratings (workload, emotional response, preferences), indicated that in isolation the touchscreen was the most preferred/least demanding to use. In contrast, the touchpad was least preferred/most demanding, whereas the rotary controller and steering wheel controls were largely comparable across most measures. When provided with 'free-choice', the rotary controller and steering wheel controls presented as the most popular candidates, although this was task-dependent. Further work is required to explore these devices in greater depth and during extended periods of testing.	driving simulator;humanâcomputer interaction;rotary system;simulation;steering wheel;touchpad;touchscreen;unison	David R.

c5625313a941ec81cec9c79172f4f2e9becd6194	sensing keyboard input for computer activity recognition with a smartphone		Computer activities such as writing documents and playing games are becoming more and more popular in our daily life. These activities (especially if identified in a non-intrusive manner) can be used to facilitate context-aware services. In this paper, we propose to recognize computer activities through keyboard input sensing with a smart-phone. Specifically, we first utilize the microphone embedded in a smartphone to sense the acoustic signal of keystrokes on a computer keyboard. We then identify keystrokes using fingerprint identification techniques. The determined keystrokes are then corrected by using the proposed adjacent similarity matrix algorithm. Finally, by fusing both semantic and acoustic features, a classification model is constructed to recognize four typical computer activities: chatting, coding, writing documents, and playing games. We evaluated the proposed approach from multiple aspects in realistic environments. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of our approach.	acoustic cryptanalysis;activity recognition;algorithm;computer keyboard;context-aware network;embedded system;event (computing);fingerprint;microphone;plover;sensor;similarity measure;smartphone	He Du;Zhiwen Yu;Dong Xiao;Zhu Wang;Qi Han;Bin Guo	2017		10.1145/3123024.3123150	embedded system;computer vision;coding (social sciences);activity recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science;microphone;similarity matrix	HCI	-35.66551446221573	-45.26230114527374	76521

We propose a new methodology that we call multimodal interactive continuous scoring of quality (MICSQ). MICSQ is composed of a device interaction process between the 3D display and a separate device (PC, tablet, etc.) used as an assessment tool, and a human interaction process between the subject(s) and the separate device. The scoring process is multimodal, using aural and tactile cues to help engage and focus the subject(s) on their tasks by enhancing neuroplasticity. Recorded human responses to 3D visualizations obtained via MICSQ correlate highly with measurements of spatial and temporal activity in the 3D video content. We have also found that 3D quality of experience (QoE) assessment results obtained using MICSQ are more reliable over a wide dynamic range of content than obtained by the conventional single stimulus continuous quality evaluation (SSCQE) protocol. Moreover, the wireless device interaction process makes it possible for multiple subjects to assess 3D QoE simultaneously in a large space such as a movie theater, at different viewing angles and distances. We conducted a series of interesting 3D experiments showing the accuracy and versatility of the new system, while yielding new findings on visual comfort in terms of disparity, motion and an interesting relation between the naturalness and depth of field (DOF) of a stereo camera.	3d television;binocular disparity;cinema 4d;control table;digital video;display size;dynamic range;experiment;flicker (screen);multi-user;multimodal interaction;rejection sampling;signal processing;stereo camera;stereo display;stereoscopic acuity;stereoscopy;tablet computer;tree accumulation;video projector;visualization (graphics)	Taewan Kim;Jiwoo Kang;Alan C.

To assess a novel approach to access this information, we conducted a field trial of a mobile mixed reality application called MAA, which operates on a mobile phone. MAA displays a view through the Earth and geospatial content in the direction to which the user is pointing the device. In this paper, we report the results of the two-week long field trial of MAA. We found that the embodied usage of MAA is experienced as engaging and surprising, but may also be cumbersome in some usage situations. Virtual viewing of locations around the planet was considered pleasant. MAA was often shown to friends, and was used for watching visual materials and searching for information about cities. MAA was found to be a promising platform for many kinds of location-based content, especially for real-time events and local information.	geotagging;location-based service;mixed reality;mobile phone;real-time locating system	Erika Reponen;Tiina Koponen;Jaakko KerÃ¤nen;Kaisa VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen	2012		10.1145/2148131.2148192	simulation;geography;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-47.8637726205987	-40.380242352002426	76663

A novel depth-to-sound mapping is proposed that can be adjusted by the user through the touch interface of the mobile device. This mapping allows the user to define the field of view and the location of inference. A smart phone âappâ and demo will be produced.

A simple virtual environment was created in the style of a desert to minimize the amount of visual distractions; a head mounted display was used to display the environment. Users would in the real world drive a Combi Bike and the velocity generated was translated to a vehicle in the virtual environment, moving it forward on a predetermined path. Each user traversed a total of eight hills, two in each of the four conditions. The perceived exertion was measured several times during each condition using the Borg Scale. The results show that there is no significant difference between the four conditions, which had different combinations of auditory and haptic feedback.	multimodal interaction	Jon Ram Bruun-Pedersen;Morten G.

Further, as the number of consumer electronics in modern homes increases, people are often forced to switch between many controllers to interact with these devices. To simplify interaction with these devices and to enable more collaborative forms of device control, we propose an integrated remote control system, called CRISTAL (Control of Remotely Interfaced Systems using Touch-based Actions in Living spaces). CRISTAL enables people to control a wide variety of digital devices from a centralized, interactive tabletop system that provides an intuitive, gesture-based interface that enables multiple users to control home media devices through a virtually augmented video image of the surrounding environment. A preliminary user study of the CRISTAL system is presented, along with a discussion of future research directions.	augmented reality;centralized computing;control system;gesture recognition;iteration;multi-touch;multi-user;remote control;situated;usability testing	Thomas Seifried;Michael J Haller;Stacey D.

Casual interactions are particularly appropriate in scenarios where full engagement with devices is frowned upon socially, is unsafe, physically challenging or too mentally taxing. Novel sensing approaches which go beyond direct touch enable wider use of casual interactions, which will often be 'around device' interactions. We consider the degree to which previous commercial products and research prototypes can be considered as fitting the focused-casual framework, and describe the properties using control theoretic concepts. In an experimental study we observe that users naturally apply more precise and more highly engaged interaction techniques when faced with a more challenging task and use more relaxed gestures in easier tasks.	apache continuum;experiment;interaction technique;theory	Henning Pohl;Roderick Murray-Smith	2013		10.1145/2470654.2481307	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;foreground-background	HCI	-47.631619281283065	-49.03426999038888	77299

This paper describes work on expressing emotion through eye behaviors in virtual agents based on the parameters selected from the AU-Coded facial expression database and real-time eye movement data (pupil size, blink rate and saccade). A rule-based approach to generate primary (joyful, sad, angry, afraid, disgusted and surprise) and intermediate emotions (emotions that can be represented as the mixture of two primary emotions) utilized the MPEG4 FAPs (facial animation parameters) is introduced.

This deviation is made in terms of intrinsic note attributes like pitch, timbre, timing and dynamics. The advances in computational power capabilities and digital sound synthesis have allowed real-time control of synthesized sounds. Expressive control becomes then an area of great interest in the sound and music computing field. Musical expressivity can be approached from different perspectives. One approach is the musicological analysis of music and the study of the different stylistic schools. This approach provides a valuable understanding about musical expressivity. Another perspective is the computational modelling of music performance by means of automatic analysis of recordings. It is known that music performance is a complex activity that involves complementary aspects from other disciplines such as psychology and acoustics. It requires creativity and eventually, some manual abilities, being a hard task even for humans. Therefore, using machines appears as a very interesting and fascinating issue. In this paper, we present an overall view of the works many researchers have done so far in the field of expressive music performance, with special attention to the computational approach.	computation	Miguel Delgado;Waldo Fajardo Contreras;Miguel Molina-Solana	2011	Expert Syst.

14a3f6427fbd5178fe3b40e8db3994df744a33a4	estimating tactile perception by observing explorative hand motion of others		When we acquire tactile information about an object's surface, we actively move our hands. Past studies have shown a correlation between participantsâ (i.e., touchersâ) hand motion in tactile exploration and the evaluated tactile attributes of the object, which suggests that tactile perception can be estimated from statistical analysis of touchersâ hand motion. Though it has been reported that the statistical analysis of hand motion can indeed estimate tactile perception, whether humans can estimate tactile perception by observing the hand motion of others remains unclear. To investigate this, we conducted experiments wherein observers watched point-light moving hands of touchers in tactile exploration and evaluated the material being touched. Our results show that, although observersâ estimation of touchersâ perception was not accurate, observers extracted information from touchersâ hand motion for estimation, and the correlations within observersâ estimation were high. These results suggest that human observers can estimate tactile perception through visual observation of the hand motion of others by adopting common strategies about the relationships between touchersâ hand motion and tactile perception.	estimated;experiment;extraction;touch perception;touch sensation;observers	Takumi Yokosaka;Scinob Kuroki;Junji Watanabe;Shin'ya Nishida	2018	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2017.2775631	visualization;computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;feature extraction;perception	Robotics	-43.581646464249516	-51.11877448779108	78399

Previous experiments performed in full-cue, real-world environments have demonstrated that blind walking to targets serves as an accurate indication of distance perception, up to about 25 m. In contrast, the same task performed in virtual environments (VEs) using head-mounted displays shows significant underestimation in walking. To date, blind walking is the only visually directed action task that has been used to evaluate distance perception in VEs beyond reaching distances. The possible influence of the response measure itself on absolute distance perception in virtual environments is currently an open question. Blind walking involves locomotion and the egocentric updating of the environment with one's own movement. We compared this measure to blind throwing, a task that involves the initiation of a movement directed by vision, but no further interaction within the environment. Both throwing and walking were compressed in the VE but accurate in the real world. We suggest that distance compression found in VEs may be a result of a general perceptual origin rather than specific to the response measure.	experiment;head-mounted display;image compression;the walking dead: season two;virtual reality	Cynthia S.

The interface registers specific myokinetic activity of the residual limbs, and encodes the intended voluntary movements that are then actualized as virtual hand motions. The composite myokinetic interface-virtual reality (MKI-VR) system consists of an array of pressure sensors mounted in an arm sleeve, sensors of elbow- and shoulder-joint angles, a trained filter derived from the pseudoinverse of a response matrix, and a virtual hand model, programmed in Java 3D. Users can manipulate virtual objects such as balls and pegs in a 3D training environment, while their performance at various difficulty levels is scored. In preliminary tests, upper-limb amputees readily gained the ability to grasp and release virtual objects. We propose the utility of the MKI-VR system both as an assessment tool for rehabilitation engineers, and as a motivator for amputees to exercise and thereby maintain their residual motor ability.	control system;graphics software;java 3d;playstation vr;sensor;usability;virtual reality	Manjuladevi Kuttuva;Grigore C.

However, the influence of stereoscopic vision on human visual function remains insufficiently understood. The public has come to understand that lens accommodation and convergence are mismatched while viewing 3D video clips, and this is the main reason for the visual fatigue caused by 3D. The aim in this study is to compare the fixation distance of accommodation and convergence in viewing real objects and 3D video clips. Real objects and 3D video clips perform the same movements. We measured accommodation and convergence in viewing real objects and 3D video clips. From the result of this experiment, we found that no discrepancy exists in viewing 3D video clips like real object. Therefore, we argue that the symptoms in viewing stereoscopic vision may not be due to the discrepancy between lens accommodation and convergence.	3d television;discrepancy function;stereopsis;stereoscopy;video clip	Tomoki Shiomi;Keita Uemoto;Takehito Kojima;Satoshi Hasegawa;Masako Omori;Hiromu Ishio;Hiroki Takada;Masaru Miyao	2013			computer vision;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-42.6865879116406	-50.159577381612955	79623

We derived the strain tensor field induced by a sinusoidal surface sliding on a finger as well as the field created by a tactile transducer array deforming the fingerpad skin by lateral traction. We found that the first field could be well approximated by the second. Our results have several implications. First, tactile displays using lateral skin deformation can generate tactile sensations similar to those using normal skin deformation. Second, a synthesis approach can achieve this result if some constraints on the design of tactile stimulators are met. Third, the mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin must respond to the deviatoric part of the strain tensor field and not to its volumetric part. Finally, many tactile stimuli might represent, for the brain, an inverse problem to be solved, such specific examples of âtactile metameresâ are given.	approximation algorithm;embedded system;lateral computing;lateral thinking;tactile transducer;traction teampage	Qi Wang;Vincent Hayward	2008	TAP	10.1145/1279920.1279921	tactile imaging;computer vision;computer science;inverse problem;artificial intelligence;haptic technology;communication;contact mechanics	Robotics	-44.70137126206062	-50.266906041386754	79767

Each speaker produces a variety of phenomena parallel to speech. Some of them, e.g. intonation, are coded vocally, others are coded by motor responses (facial expression, gestures, etc.). If human-computer-interaction (HCI) tries to mimic this situation, at least some non-verbal phenomena have to be integrated into natural language input and output. A multitude of new devices (mouse, joystick, touch-screens, etc.) have enabled this transition to multimodal HCI. Gestures which illustrate the content of the verbal message are especially suitable for integration into HCI. A relevant subset of them is pointing gestures, which specify elements of the visual context. They are performed frequently because their use shortens and simplifies the verbal output. As an illustration of these considerations, the NL dialog system XTRA (University of Saarbrucken) is presented. It allows reference to elements of a tax form by the combination of textual input and simulated pointing gestures. In order to explore the regularities of this âform deixis,â an experiment has been carried out within the framework of the XTRA-project. Furthermore, its results were taken for an evaluation of the currently used simulation technique.

42c124a55423917e6d6ee1f36c27a3201f56d985	interest-point-based landmark computation for agents' spatial description coordination		In applications involving multiple conversational agents, each of these agents has its own view of a visual scene, and thus all the agents must establish common visual landmarks in order to coordinate their space understanding and to coherently share generated spatial descriptions of this scene. Whereas natural language processing approaches contribute to define the common ground through dialogues between these agents, we propose in this paper a computer-vision system to determine the object of reference for both agents efficiently and automatically. Our approach consists in processing each agentâs view by computing the related, visual interest points, and then by matching them in order to extract the salient and meaningful landmark. Our approach has been successfully tested on real-world data, and its performance and design allow its use for embedded robotic system communication.	computation;computer vision;dialog system;embedded system;natural language processing;robot;type system	Joanna Isabelle Olszewska	2016		10.5220/0005847705660569	computer vision;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-34.03518281499002	-41.24846169719478	79852

Specifically, the viewpoint is varied in terms of height and tilt and the influence on a basic task, such as following some pre-defined paths, is analyzed. The operators are able to control one motor degree of freedom and up to two perceptive degrees of freedom. It is shown that performance vary depending both on the viewpoint and on the amount of perceptive freedom; in particular, the chosen metrics give better results when more perspective and, surprisingly, a more constrained perception is deployed. Furthermore, the contrast between the actual performance and the performance perceived by the operators is shown, which allows to discuss about the need of quantitative approaches in measuring the efficiency of a teleoperation task.	mobile robot	Luca Giulio Brayda;JesÃºs Ortiz;Nicolas Mollet;Ryad Chellali;Jean-Guy Fontaine	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10817-4_78	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;degrees of freedom	Robotics	-45.19844586519414	-48.51392091365359	79853

In a first experiment, participants were asked to render, according to imagined walking scenarios, five emotions (aggressive, happy, neutral, sad, and tender) by manipulating the parameters of synthetic footstep vibrations simulating various combinations of surface materials and shoes. Results allowed to identify, for the involved emotions and vibration conditions, the mean values and ranges of variation of two parameters, vibration amplitude and temporal distance between consecutive steps. Results were in accordance with those reported in previous studies on real walking, suggesting that the plantar vibro-tactile expression of emotions in walking is independent of the real or imagined motor activity. In a second experiment, participants were asked to identify the emotions portrayed by walking vibrations synthesized by setting the synthesis engine parameters to the mean values found in the first experiment. Results showed that the involved algorithms were successful in conveying the emotional information at a level comparable with previous studies. Results of both experiments revealed strong similarities with those of an analogous study on footstep sounds suggesting that emotionally expressive walking styles are consistently produced and recognized at auditory and plantar vibro-tactile level.	algorithm;amiga walker;applicative programming language;avatar (computing);computer simulation;desktop computer;ecology;experiment;image;multimodal interaction;neural oscillation;performance;sadness;shoes;synthetic intelligence;virtual reality	Luca Turchet;Damiano Zanotto;Simone Minto;Antonio Rod&#x00E0;;Sunil K.

The operator controls a virtual excavator by means of a joystick while experiencing visual and force feedback generated by environment and machine models. The simulator comprises an impedance model of the excavator arm, a model for the bucket-ground interaction forces, a graphically rendered visual environment, and a haptic interface.

TapLock captures the size and the axis length of the finger touch area on the phone screen for creating a password, which cannot be easily observed by a shoulder surfer. Our user study shows that TapLock has several advantages over existing smartphone password systems, including its strong attack resilience, small authentication delay, and haptic input feedback that improves the usability.	apache axis;authentication;haptic technology;password;smartphone;touchscreen;usability testing	Hongji Yang;Lin Chen;Kaigui Bian;Yang Tian;Fan Ye;Wei Yan;Tong Zhao;Xiaoming Li	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249465	embedded system;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-44.80765403354447	-44.70847785007135	80856

We report on the development of the EcoSonic system as a platform for evaluating such displays and present five design approaches to guide their realization. In a study with 30 participants, we evaluated two prototype auditory displays against the baseline of visual-only eco-driving feedback in a within-subject study. Our selected designs are described in full detail. Key findings include a significantly reduced fuel consumption as well as lower engine speeds compared to the visual display. Furthermore, questionnaire analysis results confirm that the auditory conditions are less obtrusive and also seem to allow a more subconscious processing and comprehension of the provided information. Finally, we have found that the affectiveness of the display design seems to have a positive impact on its perceived helpfulness and the ability to absorb its information subconsciously.	baseline (configuration management);list comprehension;peripheral;prototype	Jan Hammerschmidt;Thomas Hermann	2017	Displays	10.1016/j.displa.2016.11.002	simulation;engineering;behavior change;multimedia	HCI	-47.50115499594973	-46.61239199803591	81169

Understanding the attention patterns of users within these environments is important for the design and evaluation of such interactive elements. We present a modelling approach based on dynamic adaptation of the users' field-of-view, bottom-up visual saliency calculation and task-dependent semantic interest modeling that allows approximating the attention of users with regard to a photorealistic 3D-model. This improved availability of attention information can help to design more usable navigation systems, identify problems for user groups with special needs and support the design of seamless attention switches between information elements.	approximation;bottom-up proteomics;display device;interactivity;map;network switch;seamless3d	Johann Schrammel;Georg Regal;Manfred Tscheligi	2014		10.1145/2559206.2581295	computer vision;navigation;simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-46.746614390005725	-40.57224981392437	81641

Although the process is facilitated by the availability of 3D models displayed on digital tablets on construction sites, it is not always clear what is the exact 3D location of specific elements in 2D drawings. In this preliminary study, we propose a method based on a computer tablet and a head mounted augmentation system that enables the user to display a 3D element by clicking on its 2D representation on a construction drawing. Early results show that the method has potential, but highlights perception issues.

NGOMSL model is a description of the knowledge that a user must possess to operate the system represented as elementary actions for effective usability evaluations. In the last few years, mobile robots have been exhibiting a stronger presence in the commercial markets and very little work has been done with NGOMSL modelling for usability evaluations in human-robot interaction discipline. This paper focuses on applying NGOMSL modelling for usability evaluation of human-humanoid robot interaction in soccer domain. Usability evaluations were performed and adequate results were obtained.

This feeling of âbeingâ in a mediated environment is described as presence. Two important factors that influence presence are the level of immersion and the navigation method. We developed two navigation methods to simulate natural walking using a Wii Balance Board and a Kinect Sensor. In this preliminary study we examined the effects of these navigation methods and the level of immersion on the participants' perceived presence in a 2Ã2 factorial between-subjects study with 32 participants in two different VEs (Powerwall and Mixed-Reality-See-Through-Glasses).

Recently, a novel cost-efficient method for estimating physical ergonomics and performance has been introduced to HCI. It is based on optical motion capture and biomechanical simulation. It provides a rich source for analyzing human movements summarized in a multidimensional data set. Existing visualization tools do not sufficiently support the HCI experts in analyzing this data. We identified two shortcomings. First, appropriate visual encodings are missing particularly for the biomechanical aspects of the data. Second, the physical setup of the user interface cannot be incorporated explicitly into existing tools. We present MovExp, a versatile visualization tool that supports the evaluation of user interfaces. In particular, it can be easily adapted by the HCI experts to include the physical setup that is being evaluated, and visualize the data on top of it. Furthermore, it provides a variety of visual encodings to communicate muscular loads, movement directions, and other specifics of HCI studies that employ motion capture and biomechanical simulation. In this design study, we follow a problem-driven research approach. Based on a formalization of the visualization needs and the data structure, we formulate technical requirements for the visualization tool and present novel solutions to the analysis needs of the HCI experts. We show the utility of our tool with four case studies from the daily work of our HCI experts.	area striata structure;cost efficiency;data structure;estimated;graphics visualization;human factors and ergonomics;humanâcomputer interaction;imagery;motion capture;movement;muscle;optic nerve glioma, childhood;preparation;requirement;simulation;solutions;user interface device component;science of ergonomics	Gregorio Palmas;Myroslav Bachynskyi;Antti Oulasvirta;Hans-Peter Seidel;Tino Weinkauf	2014	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346311	computer vision;simulation;information visualization;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;biomechanics;data mining;multimedia;data visualization	Visualization	-42.650564916469584	-47.6303250334425	82359

Reported scores for measures of overall simulator sickness, disorientation, nausea, and occulomotor discomfort were all higher in the natural walking condition than either the simulated walking or real world conditions. This indicates that simulated walking is a better choice for reducing simulator sickness during tasks requiring a navigationally complex environment and a long amount of time.	simulation;virtual reality	Evan A.

041bd32da37543a01a910156147b1e0878908305	binocular disparity as an explanation for the moon illusion		ï¾We present another explanation for the moon illusion, in which the moon looks larger near the horizon than near the zenith. In our model, the sky is considered a spatially contiguous and geometrically smooth surface. When an object (like the moon) breaks the contiguity of the surface, humans perceive an occlusion of the surface rather than an object appearing through a hole. Binocular vision dictates that the moon is distant, but this perception model dictates that the moon is closer than the sky. To solve the dilemma, the brain distorts the projections of the moon to increase the binocular disparity, which results in increase of the angular size of the moon. The degree of the distortion depends upon the apparent distance to the sky, which is influenced by the surrounding objects and the condition of the sky. The closer the sky appears, the stronger the illusion. At the zenith, few distance cues are present, causing difficulty with distance estimation and weakening the illusion.	angularjs;binocular disparity;binocular vision;distortion;moon;user illusion	Joseph Antonides;Toshiro Kubota	2013	CoRR		computer vision	Vision	-41.95367179753548	-50.46892616523057	82595

Therefore, a tsunami evacuation drill (TED) is important for disaster education. However, conventional TEDs do not necessarily produce the maximum effect because some participants move quickly to evacuation sites while simply imagining the tsunami and do not feel a sense of tension. We have developed a TED system that uses a motion hazard map (MHM) and smart devices (e.g. tablet computers and smart glasses). This system has three phases, i.e. simulation, evacuation and reflection phases. For the simulation, the system allows users to generate a MHM by configuring tsunami simulation using Google Maps. For the evacuation, the system presents the generated MHM by panoramically visualising the approaching tsunami (simulated animation) and plotting the participants' current locations on Google Maps. The participants can move quickly while feeling a sense of tension and viewing the simulated animation to determine the speed of and distance to the tsunami. For the reflection, the system superimposes recorded participants' evacuation routes onto the simulated animation.	cartography;computer animation;simulation;smart device;smartglasses;tablet computer;tsunami games	Junya Kawai;Hiroyuki Mitsuhara;Masami Shishibori	2016	2016 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Disaster Management (ICT-DM)	10.1109/ICT-DM.2016.7857221	seismology;simulation;geography;cartography	HCI	-42.56722540062506	-38.70044604948564	82626
d6f36a120db9e2d69fc9985485a80439ee20595a	using sound feedback to help blind people navigate		People can generate mental representations of one physical magnitude (e.g., distance) in terms of another (e.g., pitch). Capitalizing on this ability, we developed a system that could help visually impaired people navigate by presenting them with sounds of lower or higher pitch according to their distance from objects that they gaze at. Eight blind-folded participants completed a Hebb-Williams Maze with the system and twelve blind-folded participants completed the maze without it. Both groups completed the maze five times. We found that participants completed the maze faster in the last three trials compared to the first trial. There were no differences between the groups in the pace of improvement and in the time to complete the maze. However, participants who used the system made less errors in the maze than participants who did not use it. Our findings indicate that the system can potentially assist visually impaired people navigate. The contribution of the system to navigation will be further investigated with larger number of participants and with more extensive training.	hebbian theory;pitch (music)	Assaf Botzer;Nir Shvalb;Boaz Ben-Moshe	2018		10.1145/3232078.3232083	spatial memory;simulation;control engineering;engineering	HCI	-46.68582644434719	-49.1012817285855	82712

We designed this training based on previous successful trainings of spatial-numerical associations (such as number line estimation) and introduced a full-body response movement. Children responded to a number line estimation task presented on an interactive whiteboard by moving their whole body to the left or right. In a pilot study with a small group of children (total sample size N = 27), this experimental training was compared to two control trainings, one training the same task without the full-body movement and one training a different task with full-body movement. The experimental training led to significant improvement in all dependent measures and was most effective in enhancing performance in a spatial-numerical task. Furthermore, full-body movement helped children maintain their performance level in multi-digit addition. We conclude that full-body movement can enhance the efficiency of numerical trainings, which could also be successfully utilized in serious games and incorporated into the classroom.	interactive whiteboard	Ursula Fischer;Korbinian Moeller;Stefan Huber;Ulrike Cress;Hans-Christoph Nuerk	2015	Int.

7916d5d6965781d4d01e04c01207bf9485bba85e	inside looking out or outside looking in?: an evaluation of visualisation modalities to support the creation of a substitutional virtual environment		Current Virtual Reality systems only allow users to draw a rectangular perimeter to mark the room-scale area they intend to use. Domestic environments can include furniture and other obstacles that hinder the ease with which users can naturally walk. By leveraging the benefits of passive haptics, users can match physical objects with virtual counterparts, to create substitutional environments. In this paper we explore two visualisation modalities to aid in the creation of a coarse virtual representation of the physical environment, by marking out the volumes of space where physical obstacles are located, to support the substitution process. Our study investigates whether this process is better supported by an inside-looking-out 3D User Interface (that is, viewing the outside world while immersed in Virtual Reality) or from an outside-looking-in one (while viewing the Virtual Environment through an external device, such as a tablet). Results show that the immersive option resulted in better accuracy and was the one with the highest overall preference ratings.	3d user interaction;haptic technology;integrated circuit layout;interaction technique;item unique identification;perimeter;peripheral;scientific visualization;tablet computer;user interface;virtual reality;virtual world	Jose F.

In the experiment, 15 subjects performed an assembly planning task in three different conditions: a traditional engineering (TE) environment, a nonimmersive desktop VR (DVR) environment, and an immersive CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) VR (CVR) environment. The effects of the three conditions on the subjects' performance were analyzed. The subjects' performance time in the TE condition was significantly longer than that in the DVR condition and that in the CVR condition, whereas the difference in performance time between the DVR condition and the CVR condition was not significant. The total number of problematic assembly steps in the TE condition was significantly greater than that in the CVR condition. Specifically, the subjects' assembly sequences in the TE condition involved more reorientations than in the DVR condition. The number of difficult assembly steps in the TE condition was significantly greater than that in the DVR condition, which was significantly greater than that in the CVR condition. The number of dissimilar assembly steps in the TE condition was significantly greater than that in the CVR condition, which was significantly greater than that in the DVR condition. Hence, the results revealed advantages of the two VR environments over the TE environment in improving the subjects' overall assembly planning performance and in minimizing the handling difficulty, excessive reorientation and dissimilarity of assembly operations.	automated planning and scheduling;virtual reality	Nong Ye;Pat P.

The Command and Control Cube (C3) developed by Grosjean et al. is a quick access menu forthe VE configuration called workbench (a large screen displaying stereoscopic images). The C3 presents two modes, one with the graphical display of the cubic structure associated to the C3 and a blind mode for expert users, with no feedback. In this paper we conduct formal tests of the C3 under four different conditions: the visual mode with the graphical display, the blind mode with no feedback and two additional conditions enhancing the expert blind mode: a tactile mode with the tactile feedback of a CybergloveÂ¿ and a sound mode with a standard audio device. Results show that the addition of sound and tactil feedback is more disturbing to the users than the blind mode. The visual mode performs the best although the blind mode achieves some promising results.	cube;cubic function;infographic;stereoscopy;virtual reality;wired glove;workbench	JÃ©rÃ´me Grosjean;Jean-Marie Burkhardt;Sabine Coquillart;Paul Richard	2002		10.1109/ICMI.2002.1167041	layout;command and control;computer vision;navigation;simulation;wearable computer;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;feedback;graphical user interface;virtual reality;multimedia	HCI	-43.049673752426806	-40.942762263401846	83450
84681ce05988d50b760a675e80ed6fc95fca252b	an advanced teleoperation testbed	low resolution	Due to the technology available, most previous work in teleoperated robotics used relatively low-resolution video links and provided limited perceptual feedback to the teleoperator. In most cases, these projects reported only limited teleoperator success compared to vehicles with human drivers on-board. We set out to build a high-fidelity teleoperation system which takes advantage of recent technological advances. This system permits highly capable teleoperation and has allowed us to begin to investigate the minimum system requirements for effective teleoperation.	on-board data handling;requirement;robotics;system requirements;telerobotics;testbed	Bill Ross;John Bares;David Stager;Larry D.

These methods are used for an intuitive interaction with an assistance-system in which the skin-tones are used to segment the hands. The segmentation builds the basis of feature extraction for the static and dynamic gestures. In the static gestures, the activation of particular region leads us to associated actions whereas HMM classifier is used to extract the dynamic gestures dependent upon the flow. The assistance-system supports the workers in manual working tasks in the context of assembling complex products. This paper is focused on the interaction of the user with this system and describes the work in progress with the initial results from an application scenario.	feature extraction;gesture recognition;hidden markov model;real-time locating system	Frerk Saxen;Omer Rashid Ahmed;Ayoub Al-Hamadi;Simon Adler;Alexa Kernchen;RÃ¼diger Mecke	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416668	computer vision;contextual image classification;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;gesture recognition;image segmentation;mobile computing;sketch recognition	Robotics	-37.990196313209104	-43.37590505286474	83675

Browsing video surrogates saves user time, storage capacity and avoids unnecessary downloading of large files. The study presented in this paper compared dynamic and static presentation techniques for key frames extracted from video documents. For this study key frames were automatically extracted and then a subset was manually selected to best represent the document. The three interface designs used were: 4 key frame static storyboard display, 12 key frame static storyboard display and 12 key frame dynamic slideshow display. The key frames in all displays were shown in temporal order. User performances on object, action identification, and gist comprehension and selection tasks were compared across treatments. Examination time and user satisfaction were also measured. Static storyboard displays proved to support object identification better, while other user performance measures showed no statistically significant differences. Using fewer key frames in static displays saved considerable amount of user time and screen real estate and user performance on gist comprehension and selection did not decrease when key frames were carefully selected to support queries. Implications for interface design and further research are discussed.	browsing;computer user satisfaction;digital library;digital video;download;gist;key frame;library (computing);performance;storyboard;surrogates	Anita Komlodi;Gary Marchionini	1998		10.1145/276675.276688	simulation;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;video processing;world wide web	HCI	-37.63153481133712	-50.137516309242386	83821

Though several researchers have indicated the particular high potential of gaze-based interaction for pointing tasks, often gaze-only approaches are investigated. However, time-consuming dwell-time activations limit this potential. To overcome this, we present a gaze-supported fisheye lens in combination with (1) a keyboard and (2) and a tilt-sensitive mobile multi-touch device. In a user-centered design approach, we elicited how users would use the aforementioned input combinations. Based on the received feedback we designed a prototype system for the interaction with a remote display using gaze and a touch-and-tilt device. This eliminates gaze dwell-time activations and the well-known Midas Touch problem (unintentionally issuing an action via gaze). A formative user study testing our prototype provided further insights into how well the elaborated gaze-supported interaction techniques were experienced by users.	eye tracking;fisheye;interaction technique;multi-touch;multimodal interaction;prototype;usability testing;user-centered design;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sophie Stellmach;Sebastian Stober;Andreas NÃ¼rnberger;Raimund Dachselt	2011		10.1145/1983302.1983303	computer vision;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-46.66370854178853	-44.15404154048716	83860

After presenting related work, we detail our implementation. Its design is based on our modeling of two classes of algorithms that are key to the tracker: Image Differencing Segmentation (IDS) and Fast Rejection Filters (FRF). We introduce a new chromatic distance for IDS and a FRF that is independent to finger rotation. The system runs at full frame rate (25 Hz) with an average total system latency of 80 ms, independently of the number of tracked fingers. When used in a controlled environment such as a meeting room, its robustness is satisfying for everyday use.	algorithm;commodity computing;direct manipulation interface;fast fourier transform;frequency response;gabor filter;image differencing;interaction;rejection sampling;video tracking	Julien Letessier;FranÃ§ois BÃ©rard	2004		10.1145/1029632.1029652	computer vision;finger tracking;simulation;eye tracking;computer science;operating system;satisfiability;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.22818087848573	-39.879875424701034	83953

Face direction and movement is then used to control the cursor.

In this paper we present a framework to allow for complex textual queries over the body of OpenStreetMap ([6]) data. Our framework supports searching for substrings, points-of-interest, and geo locations while also allowing all the usual set operations in a query. It is optimized for efficiency, providing near-instant query results even on low-capability hardware. The respective data structure can be stored locally (even on a smartphone) or accessed on a server via the internet. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated by respective implementations for the Android platform as well as a simple web-based geo location search engine.	android;data structure;openstreetmap;server (computing);smartphone;substring;usability;web application;web search engine	Daniel Bahrdt	2013		10.1145/2534190.2534200	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	Mobile	-46.30273991112613	-40.87081845307372	84201

11aaec273c1ba348d113ff799048fdb3ccccbf1e	user perception of next-track music recommendations		Many of today's music streaming websites and apps provide personalized next-track listening recommendations based on the user's current and past listening behavior. In the research literature, various algorithmic approaches to determine suitable next tracks can be found. However, almost all of them were evaluated in offline experiments using, for example, manually created playlists as a gold standard. In this work, we aim to check the external validity of insights that are obtained through such offline experiments on historical datasets. We conducted an online user study involving 277 subjects in which the participants evaluated the suitability of four different alternatives of continuing a given set of playlists. Our results indicate that manually created playlists can in fact represent a reasonable gold standard, an insight for which no evidence existed in the literature before. Furthermore, our work was able to confirm that considering playlist homogeneity aspects does not only lead to performance improvements in offline experiments -- as indicated by past research -- but also to a better quality perception by users. However, the observations also revealed that user studies of this type can be easily distorted by item familiarity biases, because the participants tend to evaluate continuation alternatives better when they know the track or the artist.	advanced stream redirector;algorithm;continuation;experiment;external validity;online and offline;personalization;recommender system;scientific literature;streaming media;usability testing	Iman Kamehkhosh;Dietmar Jannach	2017		10.1145/3079628.3079668	recommender system;homogeneity (statistics);information retrieval;active listening;multimedia;perception;continuation;external validity;computer science	HCI	-34.55235671043991	-50.936950151722826	84287

Dynamic manipulation engages a viewer's kinesthetic sense in addition to his visual sense, adding an immediacy to the exploration experience. Finding the right way to represent data has been an active topic of much thought and discussion since the beginnings of visualization. To explore dynamic visualization's power, the author constructed a tool (Calico), for creating and manipulating bivariate color mappings using several different color models. Using Calico, she conducted two experimental studies of the effects of control over the color mapping on accuracy, confidence, and preference.	bivariate data;color mapping;graphics;precomputation;scientific visualization	Penny Rheingans	2002	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/38.974511	computer vision;color model;information visualization;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;operating system;geometry;multimedia;user interface;data visualization;statistics;computer graphics (images);mechanical engineering	Visualization	-44.37237469040857	-38.98595625410895	84296

A user wants to launch a new graphical component or an application in the part of the screen next to him. Traditional methods such as popup menus allow him to first open the application and afterwards let him move, resize and orient the component appropriately. Meanwhile, the component may cover some objects the others users are looking at or interacting with. How to avoid this disruption of other persons' activity?  This paper describes menu techniques for adding a new user's interface object on a shared device while preserving mutual awareness of the participants without disturbing them in their interaction. We present Sketched Menu, Abbreviated Sketched Menu and Iconic Gestures. These techniques let a user specify the shape, the size, the location and the orientation of the desired object before its creation.  Sketched menus and iconic gestures preserve the mutual awareness. These techniques allow both adaptation of a user to the current context -the actions of the other users and the spatial arrangement of the objects on the tabletop-and the others to be aware of the foreseen action and the related space claim.	denial-of-service attack;graphical user interface;interaction;norm (social);pop-up ad	Mohammed Belatar;FranÃ§ois Coldefy	2010		10.1145/1936652.1936681	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-45.96840417571735	-38.667034481542935	84377

The worldwide penetration of mobile phones at present makes mobile phones excellent devices for delivering new services to users without requiring learning effort. An NFC-enabled mobile phone will allow a user to demand and obtain services by touching its different elements in a given smart environment. In this paper, we present a proposal in which we analyze the scope of touch interaction and develop a perceived touch interaction through tagging context (PICTAC) model.	ambient intelligence;mobile phone;near field communication;smart environment	Gabriel Chavira;JosÃ© Bravo;Salvador W.

In our experiment we used a 3D version of a Fitts' task to compare visual feedback, EMS, vibration, with no feedback. The results demonstrate that both EMS and vibration provide reasonable addition to visual feedback.

We investigated the combination of a horizontal and a directly connected vertical display, which together form a digital workspace. In particular, we were interested in the effect of the physical transition (bezel, edge or curve) on dragging. In a study participants performed dragging tasks across both display planes with direct touch as well as a pointing device. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant effect on task completion time. Only regarding accuracy the curved transition performed better than edge and bezel. Interestingly, the subjective judgment did generally not match the objective results. These findings suggest that we need to rethink our understanding of display continuities in terms of usability as well as user satisfaction.	drag and drop;pointer (computer programming);pointing device;usability;workspace	Fabian Hennecke;Wolfgang Matzke;Andreas Butz	2012		10.1145/2207676.2207705	computer vision;simulation;computer science;transition;multimedia;pointing device	HCI	-45.33772813066207	-46.440921154098994	85526

e81993db9b27fd0c0b05df4b0cbf14fe8fbfd431	unsupervised embrace pose recognition using k-means clustering		Embrace is an essential part of human-social interactions. It also gives positive health benefits as much as other touch gestures. However, in the recent years, studies of embrace recognition has been largely ignored when compared to recognition of touch gestures such as pat or rub. There are different kinds of embrace, with humans and pets, which can express different meanings. As embraces can be as important as touches, we are interested in what kind of embraces we can model, specially for human-robot interaction. In this paper, we investigate an unsupervised embrace pose recognition system based on a soft-stuffed robot platform. Our proposed method includes a hardware implementation of soft fabric-based capacitive touch sensors and a software algorithm comprising of k-means clustering based on locational features extracted from a sliding window. The result shows that our proposed method can model embrace patterns as different clusters. The method is capable of recognizing and clustering unseen data to a similar cluster's patterns, though there is a limitation when modeling two poses whose touches are similar but different in the alignment of the robot. In the next step, we plan to improve and test the proposed method in real-time environment, and make adjustments to our sensing system to cope with found limitations. If successful, the proposed method will be integrated with a touch gesture recognizer into a gesture recognition system for creating interactive and affective responses with stuffed-toy robot, which can become a medium for robot therapy or our own pets at home.	algorithm;cluster analysis;coat of arms;finite-state machine;gesture recognition;humans;humanârobot interaction;k-means clustering;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot;sensor;unsupervised learning	Nutnaree Kleawsirikul;Hironori Mitake;Shoichi Hasegawa	2017	2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)	10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172407	artificial intelligence;gesture recognition;computer vision;feature extraction;cluster analysis;computer science;software;k-means clustering;affect (psychology);tactile sensor;gesture	Robotics	-36.9412636321609	-43.89010892314679	85689

We describe this new hardware in detail, and demonstrate how it can be embedded behind a regular LCD, allowing sensing without degradation of display capability. With our approach, fingertips and hands are clearly identifiable through the display. The approach of optical sensing also opens up the exciting possibility for detecting other physical objects and visual markers through the display, and some initial experiments are described. We also discuss other novel capabilities of our system: interaction at a distance using IR pointing devices, and IR-based communication with other electronic devices through the display. A major advantage of ThinSight over existing camera and projector based optical systems is its compact, thin form-factor making such systems even more deployable. We therefore envisage using ThinSight to capture rich sensor data through the display which can be processed using computer vision techniques to enable both multi-touch and tangible interaction.	computer vision;elegant degradation;embedded system;experiment;form factor (design);image sensor;liquid-crystal display;multi-touch;tangible user interface;video projector	Steve Hodges;Shahram Izadi;Alex Butler;Alban Rrustemi;William Buxton	2007		10.1145/1294211.1294258	zero forcing equalizer;computer vision;simulation;infrared;form factor;mobile device;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-43.16588559587866	-41.09569881269454	85729

In the best case, existing practices from manual work could be used, to smoothly let current employees start using robot technology as a natural part of their work. Our aim is to simplify the robot programming task by allowing the user to simply make technical drawings on a sheet of paper. Craftsman use paper and raw sketches for several situations; to share ideas, to get a better imagination or to remember the customer situation. Currently these sketches have either to be interpreted by the worker when producing the final product by hand, or transferred into CAD file using an according tool. The former means that no automation is included, the latter means extra work and much experience in using the CAD tool. Our approach is to use the digital pen and paper from Anoto as input devices for SME robotic tasks, thereby creating simpler and more user friendly alternatives for programming, parameterization and commanding actions. To this end, the basic technology has been investigated and fully working prototypes have been developed to explore the possibilities and limitation in the context of typical SME applications. Based on the encouraging experimental results, we believe that drawings on digital paper will, among other means of human-robot interaction, play an important role in manufacturing SMEs in the future.

However, perfect registration is not always necessary for users to understand the intent of an augmentation. This paper describes the results of an experiment to evaluate the effects of graphical context in a Lego block placement task when the graphics are located outside of the task area. Four conditions were compared: fully registered AR; non-registered AR; a heads-up display (HUD) with the graphics always visible in the field of view; and a HUD with the graphics not always visible in the field of view. The results of this experiment indicated that registered AR outperforms both non-registered AR and graphics displayed on a HUD. The results also indicated that non-registered AR does not offer any significant performance advantages over a HUD, but is rated as less intrusive and can keep non-registered graphics from cluttering the task space.	augmented reality;display device;gvu center at georgia tech;graphical user interface;graphics;head-mounted display;head-up display;ibm notes;modeling language;virtual world;wap identity module;workspace	Cindy M.

Since there is likely a strong correlation between gaze and interaction cues, such as cursor and caret locations, a supervised learning algorithm can learn the complex mapping between gaze features and the gaze point by training on incremental data collected implicitly from normal computer interactions. We develop a set of robust geometric gaze features and a corresponding data validation mechanism that identifies good training data from noisy interaction-informed data collected in real-use scenarios. Based on a study of gaze movement patterns, we apply behavior-informed validation to extract gaze features that correspond with the interaction cue, and data-driven validation provides another level of crosschecking using previous good data. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves an average error of 4.06Âº, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed gaze estimation method and corresponding validation mechanism.	algorithm;caret;cursor (databases);data validation;interaction;supervised learning	Michael Xuelin Huang;Tiffany C.

However, field tests have failed to validate the belief that AR-based tools would outperform map-based tools for such pedestrian navigation tasks. Assuming this is due to inaccuracies in consumer GPS tracking used in handheld AR, we created a simulated environment that provided perfect tracking for AR and conducted experiments based on real world navigation studies. We measured time-on-task performance for guided traversals on both desktop and head-mounted display systems and found that accurate tracking did validate the superior performance of AR-based navigation tools. We also measured performance for unguided recall traversals of previously traversed paths in order to investigate into how navigation tools impact upon route memory.	augmented reality;desktop computer;experiment;gps tracking unit;global positioning system;handheld game console;head-mounted display;point of interest;smartphone;virtual reality	James Wen;William S.

Key exhibits adduced as evidence in support of this bold theory are a pair of portraits by Jan van Eyck of Cardinal Niccolo Albergati(&?) - a silverpoint study of 1431 and a larger oil of 1432. The contours in these two works bear striking resemblance in form (after being appropriately scaled) and at least one distinctive """"relative shift"""" - evidence that has led proponents of the projection theory to claim that the oil was copied by means of an epidiascope or primitive opaque projector, the shift due to an accidental """"bump"""" during the copying process. We find several difficulties with this optical explanation: there are at least two relative shifts (one horizontal and one vertical), the latter being somewhat unlikely given the putative projection equipment and setup; these shifts are in the ratio of distances of nearly 1:2, a ratio that has no natural role in the projection explanation; any accidental """"bump"""" would surely have been noticed by van Eyck, and if so desired, corrected by him; recent analysis shows physical evidence (tiny pinpricks presumably from mechanical compass) consistent with mechanical transfer that has no role in the optical explanation; and several other points. The fidelity of the copy as well as the direction and relative magnitudes of these shifts are, however, consistent with the use of a familiar grid construction and with mechanical transfer using drawing compass and ruler or Reductionszirkel . Further, there are prominent vertical Bruchkanten (fold or fraction) lines on the grounded paper in the silverpoint study whose orientation and separation have no natural role in an optical theory, but have a plausible role in other explanations. Our rebuttal to the projection theory for these works is supposed by considertaion of hte lack of documentary evidence from both artists and scientists, of surviving optical devices, and of the artistic goals and established painting praxis in the early Renaissance.Â© (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The force pattern fed back to the user while using the tactile device is similar, in terms of intensity and area of application, to that perceived while interacting with a haptic device providing both tactile and kinesthetic feedback and it can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic and kinesthetic feedback. For this reason we refer to this approach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle insertion scenario is considered. The haptic device is connected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task. Experiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the tactile feedback only is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by the user using both tactile and kinesthetic feedback. As most of the sensory substitution approaches, also this does not suffer from typical stability issues of teleoperation systems due for instance to delays. Moreover experiments show that the proposed sensory substitution technique outperforms sensory substitution with more conventional visual feedback.	experiment;haptic technology;interaction;sensory substitution;simulation;virtual reality;wearable technology	Domenico Prattichizzo;Claudio Pacchierotti;Giulio Rosati	2011	CoRR		computer vision;computer science;multimedia;communication	Robotics	-45.06356315906021	-49.16077223589238	86364

We target sound volume control for digital multi-touch instruments an area where pre-touch is demonstrated with our approach to approximating velocity of finger taps.

HTML is the basic language for website design but its ALT attribute on the IMG element does not adequately capture comprehensive image semantics and description in a way that can be accurately interpreted by screen readers, hence blind people do not usually get the complete description of the image. Most of the problems however arise from web designers and developers not including a description of an image or not comprehensively describing these images to people with visual impairments. In this paper, we propose the use of the Image Description Assessment Tool (IDAT), a Java-based tool containing some proposed heuristics for assessing how well an image description matches the real content of the image on the web. The tool also contains a speech interface which can enable a visually impaired individual to listen to the description of an image that has been uploaded unto the system.	accessibility;alt attribute;assistive technology;computer science;html element;heuristic (computer science);img;java;web accessibility;web design	Julius Tanyu Nganji;Mike Brayshaw;Brian Tompsett	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-31603-6_3	information retrieval;rdf;web accessibility;java;semantics;heuristics;upload;alt attribute;computer science;img	HCI	-35.53601037175291	-49.65093277695744	87146

To be perceived as an augmentation of reality, the virtual environment has to be properly aligned to the real world. This registration process has to be done at least once for every hardware set-up, but may have to be repeated in part or completely for each user, prop or device to be included both in the real and the virtual world. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive process for registration and calibration tasks necessary to implement correct augmentation. This includes procedures for calibrating projective and head-mounted displays, tracking systems, tracked input devices and props. Our method unifies the necessary tasks of world-toaugmentation alignment, display calibration and registration of tracked and static props in one, interactive set-up process, which can easily be conducted by the untrained user.	augmented reality;computer-generated holography;head-mounted display;input device;tracking system;virtual reality;virtual world	Anton L.

In a classical communications sense this seems a step backwards because a much larger bandwidth is required, but the return is a richer communications mode. Acoustic technology for the audio layer is presented here, although it is not entirely inseparable from the visual aspects. The talkers' audio signals are sensed by an array of microphones assisted by a video-based talker-location system. The data is transmitted to the remote listener's location, where the 3D audio is reproduced around the listeners' ears by an array of speakers in the room. The idea is that the listener experiences being in the same room as the talkers, but achieving this convincingly has raised challenges which require new research. As a step in this direction, we use simulation in a reverberant environment to investigate the improvement from using prescribed-directivity loudspeakers for the sound field reproduction. The strong performance improvement compared to using an array of conventional omni-directional loudspeakers contributes motivation for the development of such directional loudspeakers.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;bandwidth (signal processing);computer monitor;decibel;experience;immersion (virtual reality);loudspeaker;microphone;peripheral;separable polynomial;simulation;software deployment	Hanieh Khalilian;Ivan V.

We compared three different techniques for mapping the head turn to scrolling a list of numbers with and without haptic feedback. We found that the haptic feedback had no noticeable effect in objective metrics, but it sometimes improved user experience. Direct mapping of head orientation to list position is fast and easy to understand, but the signal-to-noise ratio of eye and head position measurement limits the possible range. The technique with constant rate of change after crossing the head angle threshold was simple and functional, but slow when the rate of change is adjusted to suit beginners. Finally the rate of change dependent on the head angle tends to lead to fairly long task completion times, although in theory it offers a good combination of speed and accuracy.	experiment;eye tracking;haptic technology;interaction technique;multimodal interaction;scrolling;signal-to-noise ratio;smartglasses;user experience;user interface	Oleg Spakov;Poika Isokoski;Jari Kangas;Jussi Rantala;Deepak Akkil;Roope Raisamo	2016		10.1145/2993148.2993153	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;haptic technology	HCI	-45.61306720860231	-46.25274807948361	88067

TilTouch gestures extend the vocabulary of navigation interfaces by combining motion tilt with directional touch. We consider sixteen directional TilTouch gestures that rely on tilt and touch movements along the four main compass directions. An experiment explores their effectiveness for both one-handed and two-handed use. Results identify the best combinations of TilTouch gestures in terms of performance, motor coordination, and user preferences.	user (computing);vocabulary	Theophanis Tsandilas;Caroline Appert;Anastasia Bezerianos;David Bonnet	2014		10.1145/2556288.2557088	computer vision;simulation;computer science;mobile device;natural user interface;gesture	HCI	-46.14370025153687	-44.02391958314988	88262
60541652fb364293ec51754f8bfca152559bde28	movietweeters: an interactive interface to improve recommendation novelty		This paper introduces and evaluates a novel interface, MovieTweeters. It is a movie recommendation system which incorporates social information with a traditional recommendation algorithm to generate recommendations for users. Few previous studies have investigated the influence of using social information in interactive interfaces to improve the novelty of recommendations. To address this gap, we investigate whether social information can be incorporated effectively into an interactive interface to improve recommendation novelty and user satisfaction. Our initial results suggest that such an interactive interface does indeed help users discover more novel items. Also, we observed users who perceived that they discovered more novel and diverse items reported increased levels of user satisfaction. Surprisingly, we observed that even though we successfully were able to increase the system diversity of the recommendations, it had a negative correlation with users perception of novelty and diversity of the items highlighting the importance of improved user-centered approaches.	algorithm;computer user satisfaction;multi-master replication;online and offline;recommender system;user interface;user-centered design	Ishan Ghanmode;Nava Tintarev	2018				HCI	-35.87188320018794	-51.25735934606782	88290

Users tested our new technique against existing techniques Raycast, Bendcast, and Hook across a variety of different 3D scenarios which featured three different levels of object density and three different levels of object velocity. Our two dependent variables were completion time and total attempts per scenario. Users also completed a post-questionnaire which yielded qualitative insights on their experience. Our study shows that Bendcast, Scope, and Hook all performed similarly across all scenarios, yet were all significantly faster and less error-prone than Raycast. Despite this similar performance, users strongly favored Scope over the other three techniques, and over the second most preferred technique nearly two to one.	cognitive dimensions of notations;cursor (databases);usability testing;velocity (software development)	Jeffrey Cashion;Joseph J.

These environments build a shared display space from variety of devices: tablets, projected surfaces, tabletops, and traditional monitors. Since the different display surfaces are usually not organized in a single plane, traditional schemes for stitching the displays together can cause problems for interaction. However, there is a more natural way to compose display space -- using perspective. In this paper, we develop interaction techniques for multi-display environments that are based on the user's perspective on the room. We designed the Perspective Cursor, a mapping of cursor to display space that appears natural and logical from wherever the user is located. We conducted an experiment to compare two perspective-based techniques, the Perspective Cursor and a beam-based technique, with traditional stitched displays. We found that both perspective techniques were significantly faster for targeting tasks than the traditional technique, and that Perspective Cursor was the most preferred method. Our results show that integrating perspective into the design of multi-display environments can substantially improve performance.	cursor (databases);image stitching;interaction technique	Miguel A.

A user conceptually encloses his/her experiences gathered through sense organs into physical objects by simply touching an object. The user can also disclose and re-experience for himself/herself the experiences accumulated in an object by the same operation. We implemented a prototype system composed basically of a radio frequency identification (RFID) device. Physical objects are also attached to RFID tags. We conducted two experiments. The first experiment confirms a succession of the âencoding specificity principle,â which is well known in the research field of psychology, to the Ubiquitous Memories system. The second experiment aims at a clarification of the systemâs characteristics by comparing the system with other memory externalization strategies. The results show the Ubiquitous Memories system is effective for supporting memorization and recollection of contextual events.	experience;experiment;prototype;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;sensitivity and specificity;succession	Tatsuyuki Kawamura;Tomohiro Fukuhara;Hideaki Takeda;Yasuyuki Kono;Masatsugu Kidode	2006	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-006-0085-4	radio-frequency identification;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-43.6789790045892	-44.459364538419685	88868

In the paper we present the innovative touchless computer control method based on head movement analysis. The aim of our work was to replace the standard mouse with the movements of the userâs head. In contrast to the known solutions, our proposition does not require image recording of the userâs head and complex image analysis. The analysis of position in our solution is made using the camera worn by the user on the head. A project of such a solution has been developed and the research of it has been carried out. It has been shown that in this way it is possible to effectively move the screen cursor to the position which is identified by the userâs face orientation. Additionally, in this solution, the eye image analysis has been performed. Interpretation of blinking allowed executing system commands. Using the built prototype the experiments have been carried out in a group of 30 people...		Dariusz Sawicki;Piotr Kowalczyk	2018	Int. J. Hum. Comput.

Vision-based hand gesture recognition techniques have many proven advantages compared with traditional devices, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with electronic devices. This work proposes a generic system architecture based in computer vision and machine learning, able to be used with any interface for human-computer interaction. The proposed solution is mainly composed of three modules: a pre-processing and hand segmentation module, a static gesture interface module and a dynamic gesture interface module. The experiments showed that the core of vision-based interaction systems can be the same for all applications and thus facilitate the implementation. In order to test the proposed solutions, three prototypes were implemented. For hand posture recognition, a SVM model was trained and used, able to achieve a final accuracy of 99.4%. For dynamic gestures, an HMM model was trained for each gesture that the system could recognize with a final average accuracy of 93.7%. The proposed solution as the advantage of being generic enough with the trained models able to work in real-time, allowing its application in a wide range of human-machine applications.

Spatial AR systems instead use stationary displays that provide augmentation to an on-looking user. They could avoid issues with damage, breakage and wear, while enabling ubiquitous installations in unmanned environments, through protected display and sensing technology.  Our contribution is an exploration of compatible interfaces for public AR environments. We investigate interactive technologies, such as touch, gesture and head tracking, which are specifically appropriate for spatial optical see-through displays. A prototype system for a digital museum display was implemented and evaluated. We present the feedback from domain experts, and the results from a qualitative user study of seven interfaces for public spatial optical see-through displays.	3d interaction;augmented reality;gesture recognition;motion capture;prototype;software deployment;stationary process;unmanned aerial vehicle;usability testing	Alex Olwal	2008		10.1145/1463160.1463236	computer vision;augmented reality;interaction;pose;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;interface;mixed reality;multimedia;gesture	HCI	-44.31289716280808	-42.80613768974203	89107

The term âimplicit gestureâ in our work refers to a natural physical hand manipulation performed by the user who takes hold of the control device and simply picks it up from its neutral motionless position - a âpick-upâ gesture. For reference with other related systems, explicit and well defined personal name identification gestures were used as well. User evaluation study results show that 100% recognition accuracy was achieved when using explicit identification signature gestures and over 91% recognition accuracy was achieved when using the implicit âpick-upâ gesture. Performance of the proposed system is comparable to results of other respectable related works when using explicit identification gestures, while also showing that implicit gesture based user identification is possible and viable.	login;personal identification number	Joze Guna;Iztok Humar;Matevz Pogacnik	2012	2012 35th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2012.6256373	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;operating system;gesture recognition;accelerometer;statistics	Robotics	-38.10895541530164	-46.462568086807096	89215

Plants growing from deliberately placed seeds are directed by robotic units that the user can position, configure and activate. For example, the robotic units may serve as physical shields or frames but they may also guide the plants' growth through emission of light. The biohybrid system evolves over time to redefine architectural spaces. This gives rise to the particular challenge of designing a biohybrid system before its actual implementation and potentially long before its developmental processes unfold. Here, an augmented reality interface featuring according simulation models of plants and robotic units allows one to explore the design space a priori. In this work, we present our first functional augmented reality prototype to design biohybrid systems. We provide details about its workings and elaborate on first empirical studies on its usability.	augmented reality;prototype;robot;simulation;usability	Sebastian von Mammen;Heiko Hamann;Michael Heider	2016		10.1145/2993369.2993400	augmented reality;simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-45.49361418346323	-38.87771792465605	89250

Most QAC algorithms take a learning-based approach to incorporate various signals for query relevance prediction. However, such models are trained on simulat- ed user inputs from query log data. The lack of real user interaction data in the QAC process prevents them from further improving the QAC performance. In this work, for the first time we collect a high-resolution QAC query log that records every keystroke in a QAC session. Based on this data, we discover two user behaviors, namely the horizontal skipping bias and vertical position bias which are crucial for rele- vance prediction in QAC. In order to better explain them, we pro- pose a novel two-dimensional click model for modeling the QAC process with emphasis on these behaviors. Extensive experiments on our QAC data set from both PC and mobile devices demonstrate that our proposed model can accurate- ly explain the users' behaviors in interacting with a QAC system, and the resulting relevance model significant improves the QAC performance over existing click models. Furthermore, the learned knowledge about the skipping behavior can be effectively incorpo- rated into existing learning-based models to further improve their performance.	algorithm;column (database);event (computing);experiment;image resolution;interaction;interaction information;interdependence;mobile device;personal computer;relevance	Yanen Li;Anlei Dong;Hongning Wang;Hongbo Deng;Yi Chang;ChengXiang Zhai	2014		10.1145/2600428.2609571	computer science;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-34.18367013641556	-50.46647821608367	89719

The living labs evaluation paradigm, i.e., observing users in their natural task environments, offers great promise in this regard. Yet, progress in an academic setting has been limited. This paper presents the first living labs for the IR community benchmarking campaign initiative, taking as test two use-cases: local domain search on a university website and product search on an e-commerce site. There are many challenges associated with this setting, including incorporating results from experimental search systems into live production systems, and obtaining sufficiently many impressions from relatively low traffic sites. We propose that head queries can be used to generate result lists offline, which are then interleaved with results of the production system for live evaluation. An API is developed to orchestrate the communication between commercial parties and benchmark participants. This campaign acts to progress the living labs for IR evaluation methodology, and offers important insight into the role of living labs in this space.	application programming interface;benchmark (computing);e-commerce;hoc (programming language);information retrieval;list of google products;living lab;online and offline;production system (computer science);programming paradigm	Krisztian Balog;Liadh Kelly;Anne Schuth	2014		10.1145/2661829.2661962	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;evaluation;data mining;database;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-34.27204052191914	-51.63948117537251	89748

We created a 'virtual 3D acoustic environment' in which listeners feel a car passing in front of them to help them cross the street safely. An idea of this acoustic system originated from a previous research that showed that the blind make good use of reflected sounds or reverberations in identifying sources and in specifying distances from objects. The system is useful not only for analyzing critical cues of perception of 'crossability' but also for training the blind how to cross a street. Such auditory information can provide the blind with a safe training system for acquiring such auditory information.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Takayuki Shiose;Kiyohide Ito;Kazuhiko Mamada	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27817-7_70	computer vision;simulation;speech recognition;computer science;virtual reality;user interface;perception	Visualization	-39.66668106400173	-49.05597936088239	89807

In this paper, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of car-appropriate applications according to their needs. Additionally, three potential car-appropriate applications related to computer vision are investigated and implemented in our platform for increased driving safety. The first and second carappropriate applications aim to enhance the driving visual field by restoring the low-visibility scenes captured during inclement-weather or nighttime driving conditions to be high-visibility ones, respectively, and display them on a transparent windshield display. We also survey pedestrian tracking techniques that combine multiple driving recorders' information as a mobile surveillance network, including one proposed framework we have developed as the third car-appropriate application. By embedding these carappropriate applications, the Smart Car has the potential to increase safety of driving conditions both in daytime and nighttime, even in bad weather.	augmented reality;bidirectional texture function;computational intelligence;computer vision;datasheet;download;embedded system;global positioning system;humanâcomputer interaction;sensor;smart tv;smartphone;ubiquitous computing;video tracking;virtual world	Shih-Chia Huang;Bo-Hao Chen;Sheng-Kai Chou;Jenq-Neng Hwang;Kuan-Hui Lee	2016	IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine	10.1109/MCI.2016.2601758	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;image sensor;internet of things;intelligent sensor	HCI	-40.02031976159903	-42.03593421834022	89897

Often, hierarchies are the sole means to do it. However, users can remember a broader range of autobiographic contextual data about their personal items. Unfortunately, it can seldom be used to manage and retrieve them. Even when this is possible, it is often done by asking users to fill in values for arbitrary properties in dialog boxes or wizards.  We propose that narrative-based interfaces can be a natural and effective way to help users recall relevant autobiographic data about their personal items and convey it to the computer. Using Quill, a narrative-based personal document retrieval interface, as a case-study, we show how such an interface can be designed. We demonstrate the approach's validity based on a set of user studies, discussing how the problems raised by the evaluation of such an interface were overcome.	document retrieval;organizing (structure);personally identifiable information;usability testing;user (computing);wizard (software);dialog	Daniel GonÃ§alves;Joaquim A.

Contactless gestures have hardly been successful in cars so far, but have received attention in other contexts recently. We propose a way to achieve a better acceptance by both drivers and car manufacturers. Using a four-step process, we developed a small set of culturally independent and therefore easy-to-learn gestures, which can be used universally across different devices. We built a first prototype using distance sensors to detect the stop gesture in front of several devices. We conducted a user study during actual driving situations, testing the pragmatic and hedonic quality of the approach as well as its attractiveness. The results show a high acceptance of our approach and confirm the potential of freehand gestures as an alternative input modality in the car.	adobe freehand;contactless payment;interaction;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);prototype;sensor;usability testing	Sebastian LÃ¶hmann;Martin Knobel;Melanie Lamara;Andreas Butz	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40477-1_34	simulation;multimedia	HCI	-46.47021310571723	-44.631971322901514	90297

Existing applications allow users to answer phone calls without touching the screenâby shaking the phone, for exampleâbut do not allow users to make phone calls. The proposed interaction allows users to select and call an intended contact by utilizing the iPhoneâs accelerometer. The interaction also involves video camera scanning for commands to switch between group-selection and individual-selection modes to facilitate the selection of the call candidate. Furthermore, the proposed interaction secures transparency by displaying the cameraâs video stream on the smartphone screen. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the interaction, an application using the interaction was developed, and two simple experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to make phone calls using the application. The success rate was 98Â %, and user satisfaction with the proposed interaction was approximately 90Â %. Therefore, the results showed that the proposed interaction could be an effective solution to allow users to make phone calls in situations where they cannot physically touch the iPhone screen. Furthermore, this solution could be used in many fields that need interactions with users in mobile applications.	experiment;interaction;mobile app;real life;smartphone;streaming media	Myoungbeom Chung;Hyunseung Choo	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1576-8	embedded system;mobile interaction;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;accelerometer	HCI	-45.77560636521863	-43.63599194478073	90330

The method of transmitting messages, skin-reading, is effective at conveying rich information but its active training method requires full user attention, is demanding, time-consuming, and tedious. Passive haptic learning offers the possibility to learn in the background while performing another primary task. We present a study investigating the use of passive haptic learning to train for skin-reading.	haptic technology;teaching method;transmitter	Granit Luzhnica;Eduardo E. Veas;Caitlyn E.

Our âhaptic materialâ format encodes ten elementary haptic features in dedicated maps, similarly to âmaterialsâ used in computer graphics. These ten different features enable the expression of compliance, surface geometry and friction attributes through vibratory, cutaneous and kinesthetic cues, as well as thermal rendering. The diversity of haptic data allows various hardware to share this single format, each of them selecting which features to render depending on its capabilities.	complementarity theory;computer graphics;database;haptic technology;iteration;list of 3d rendering software;map;open research;point of view (computer hardware company);texture mapping;volume	Antoine Costes;Fabien Danieau;Ferran Argelaguet;Anatole LÃ©cuyer;Philippe Guillotel	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93399-3_4	rendering (computer graphics);haptic technology;computer vision;computer graphics;texture mapping;computer science;artificial intelligence;kinesthetic learning	Visualization	-41.48436162816859	-39.729811206894766	90659

In particular, we introduce the notion of a horizontal tool space with task-dependent graphical input areas. These input areas are designed as single purpose control elements for specific functions and allow users to manipulate objects displayed on a vertical screen using simple one- and two-finger touch gestures and both hands. For demonstrating this concept, we use 3D modeling tasks as a specific application area. Initial feedback of six expert users indicates that our techniques are easy to use and stimulate exploration rather than precise modeling. Further, we gathered qualitative feedback during a multi-session observational study with five novices who learned to use our tool and were interviewed several times. Preliminary results indicate that working with our setup is easy to learn and remember. Participants liked the partitioning character of the dual-surface setup and agreed on the benefiting quality of touch input, giving them a 'hands-on feeling'.	3d modeling;feedback;hands-on computing;interaction technique;multi-monitor;touchscreen;workspace	Henri Palleis;Julie Wagner;Heinrich HuÃmann	2016		10.1145/2909132.2909257	qualitative property;simulation;computer science;polygonal modeling;multimedia	HCI	-44.49522050852844	-39.39454302246628	90707

With the advent of LCD displays and their migration to pure digital data transfer, many of the cost elements associated with the graphic cards have fallen dramatically. The ability to incorporate any commercial graphic card into a medical application and retain the required calibration (DICOM 3.14) standards has shifted the calibration burden to the LCD display in a positive way. The LCD becomes the logical location for expanded Look-Up-Tables (LUTS) to reside. In this way, presentation values (P-values) from the graphics card in an unambiguous digital format can be mapped within the panel to absolute luminance responses consistent with DICOM.	dicom;flat panel display;plug and play	K.

In this paper, we describe the design of animated transitions and present a user study on how they are perceived. The results show that in the transition between two images, bringing up the next image earlier dominates the perception of a fast transition over other variables examined in the study.	graphics;mobile device;mobile phone;usability testing;user experience;user interface	Jussi Huhtala;Ari-Heikki Sarjanoja;Jani MÃ¤ntyjÃ¤rvi;Minna Isomursu;Jonna HÃ¤kkilÃ¤	2010		10.1145/1753326.1753527	user interface design;user experience design;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia	HCI	-47.49754867431135	-44.70781733334029	90984

Although rock climbing is a trending sport, there are little to no consumer electronics available to support rock climbing training during exercise. In this paper, we investigated the acceptance and appropriateness of wearables in climbing on different body parts. Based on an online survey with 54 climbers, we designed a wearable device and conducted a perception study with 12 participants in a climbing gym. Using vibro-tactile, audible, and visual cues while climbing an easy route and a hard route, requiring high physical and cognitive load, we found that the most suited notification channel is sound, directly followed by vibro-tactile output. Light has been found to be inappropriate for the use in the sport of climbing.	global positioning system;norm (social);pet rock;real-time web;rock's law;wearable computer;wearable technology	Felix Kosmalla;Frederik Wiehr;Florian Daiber;Antonio KrÃ¼ger;Markus LÃ¶chtefeld	2016		10.1145/2858036.2858562	climbing;simulation;wearable computer;computer science;multimedia;perception	HCI	-45.78012425973525	-44.6053434698164	91017

The haptic user interface is incorporated into an ATM test apparatus on the keypad. The system adopts a well known 'clock face' metaphor and is designed to provide haptic prompts to the user in the form of directions to the current active device, e.g. card reader or cash dispenser. Results of an evaluation of the device are reported that indicate that users with varying levels of visual impairment are able to appropriately detect, distinguish and act on the prompts given to them by the haptic keypad. As well as reporting on how participants performed in the evaluation we also report the results of a semi structured interview designed to find out how acceptable participants found the technology for use on a cash machine. As a further contribution the paper also presents observations on how participants place their hands on the haptic device and compare this with their performance.	atm turbo;card reader;haptic technology;norm (social);semiconductor industry;user interface	Brendan Cassidy;Gilbert Cockton;Lynne M.

Among them, the tactile sense is important and useful for close range interaction and manipulation tasks. In this paper, we explore this possibility using a vibro-tactile device on the whole body for simulating collision between the user and virtual environment. We first experimentally verify the effect of enhanced user felt presence by employing localized vibration feedback alone on collision, and further investigate how to effectively provide the sense of collision using the vibro-tactile display in different ways. In particular, we test the effects of using a vibration feedback model (for simulating collision with different object materials), saltation, and simultaneous use of 3D sound toward spatial presence and perceptual realism. The results have shown that employing the proposed vibro-tactile interface did enhance the sense of presence, especially when combined with 3D sound. Furthermore, the use of saltation also helped the user detect and localize the point of contact more correctly. The use of the vibration feedback model was not found to be significantly effective, and sometimes even hindered the correct sense of collision primarily due to the limitation of the vibrotactile display device.	anomalous experiences;display device;experiment;http 404;multimodal interaction;simulation;surround sound;virtual reality	Jonghyun Ryu;Gerard Jounghyun Kim	2004		10.1145/1077534.1077551	computer vision;simulation;computer science;virtual machine;artificial intelligence;operating system;virtual reality	HCI	-44.83970595557317	-47.90258869413632	91448

Live-Art installations must be often made very favorably due to low budget. In this article the function of a module for orientation is being described as it works in an artistic project, a Ph.D. - thesis is based on. The project is based on different people's memories and stories. âMuseum of the momentâ deals with the aesthetic effects of performative collections such as the various visual animations of people's memories. Different people are being videotaped while describing important moments in their lives. These portraits are being presented on large screens in the gallery. The viewers equipped with radio-controlled headphones look at the images and also listen to the different stories, not necessarily knowing who of the portrayed people has told which story. The orientation module based on the Arduino is supposed to identify the screen automatically and communicate with the acoustic server, in order to create the effect, that only the screen, that is being looked at by the viewer will trigger an acoustic signal which is the story that the viewer can listen to. Arduino is being used in this setting to enable orientation in the gallery space in the first place. Secondly, it makes sure to identify positions. Arduino-Nanos with a MPU 9150 are being used. These include an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetic field sensor. To set and identify positions Wi-Fi is being used. Therefore signal strength and fingerprinting algorithms were examined. The final configuration of the screens does not necessarily need an estimation of position.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;arduino;fingerprint (computing);geomatics;gyroscope;headphones;mpu-401;radio control;sensor;server (computing)	Thomas Willemsen;Friedrich Keller;Stefanie Lorey;Harald Sternberg	2014	2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275505	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	HCI	-41.5831272802677	-42.5832911184024	91895

However, little work has investigated how to present reviews on screening interface for facilitating users to screen out interesting alternatives from a set of options. In this paper, we have developed a novel review-based screening interface in terms of usersâ behaviors. Concretely, there are two innovations in the interface design: (1) it enables users to eliminate items by sentiment attributes (i.e., the attributes extracted from reviews), and (2) it emphasizes on visualizing the value distribution of each attribute and tradeoffs among attributes. The results of a user study show that our review-based screening interface achieves significantly more positive assessments than traditional screening interface, in terms of usersâ perceived decision accuracy, cognitive effort, pleasantness and intention to use.	e-commerce payment system;usability testing	Dongning Yan;Li Chen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58484-3_11	interface design;e-commerce;data mining;cognition;computer science	HCI	-37.430226005053065	-51.63060100100946	91897
1255be2482d22e659ac21d05240409f4276f8471	gesture-based object localization for robot applications in intelligent environments		Drawing attention to objects and their localization in the environment are essential building blocks for domestic robot applications, e.g. fetch-and-delivery or navigation tasks. For this purpose, human pointing gestures turned out to be a natural and intuitive interaction method to transfer the spatial data of an object from human to robot. Current approaches only use the robot's on-board sensors to perceive gesture-based instructions, which restricts them to the field of view of the robot's camera. The integration of mobile robots into intelligent environments, such as smart homes, opens new possibilities to overcome this limitation by utilizing components of the surrounding environment as additional sensors. We take advantage of these new possibilities and propose a multi-stage object localization system based on human pointing gestures that considers the whole intelligent environment as interaction partner.

Current HRI findings from the micro UAS literature suggest that a Mission Specialist role requires a small, mobile, and visual interface that is dedicated and software-based. A literature survey of humanrobot team modeling, human-machine interaction technologies, and interaction principles applicable to micro UAS, resulted in an identified HRI investigation framework, five synthesized design guidelines, and a system architecture for a dedicated Mission Specialist interface. The interface was implemented and evaluated through an exploratory field study involving 16 specialized emergency responders. Observations from the study suggested that with refinements, a dedicated Mission Specialist interface could be a useful tool for future HRI studies to explore role performance in micro UAS.	aerial photography;algorithm;field research;humanâcomputer interaction;humanârobot interaction;micro isv;systems architecture;unmanned aerial vehicle;user interface	Joshua M.

ed949cf7518baf3a40b15fc2137f0704273ec450	character input by gesture performed with grasping both ends of tablet pc		We developed a method to enter Hiragana (cursive in Japanese) characters and alphanumeric characters by thumb gestures for Japanese people. This method is optimized to be used while holding the left and right ends of a tablet PC with hands. Each gesture is designed by concatenating a few horizontal and/or vertical strokes, but path of the gesture remains inside the one-stroke square centering its starting position. A Hiragana character is input by selecting a row of the table of Japanese syllabary and then a column of the table. The alphabet characters are segmented into 6 groups in order of letters. Just like Hiragana, an alphabet character is entered by selecting a group and then selecting a member. However, in the alphanumeric mode, to reduce the cost of modifying the mistakenly selected group, an operation to move to the previous or next group have been added.	tablet computer	Toshimitsu Tanaka;Tetsuaki Mano;Yuuya Tanaka;Kohei Akita;Yuji Sagawa	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91250-9_7	computer hardware;alphanumeric;multimedia;computer science;hiragana;cursive;concatenation;syllabary;alphabet;left and right;gesture	Robotics	-45.302351743219376	-44.74198180223026	92166

We first propose a perception submodule that takes in visual data solely and predicts human collaborator's hand movement. Then a robot trajectory adaptive planning submodule is developed that takes the noisy movement prediction signal into consideration for optimization. We first collect a new human manipulation dataset that can supplement the previous publicly available dataset with motion capture data to serve as the ground truth of hand location. We then integrate the algorithm with a robot manipulator that can collaborate with human workers on a set of trained manipulation actions, and it is shown that such a robot system outperforms the one without movement prediction in terms of collision avoidance.	algorithm;ground truth;humanârobot interaction;mathematical optimization;motion capture;robot	Yiwei Wang;Xin Ye;Yezhou Yang;Wenlong Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)	10.1109/CVPRW.2017.72	artificial intelligence;computer vision;collision;visualization;robot;ground truth;computer science;trajectory;manipulator;humanârobot interaction;motion capture	Vision	-34.76741791495076	-43.25602113065423	92331

We have developed an omnidirectional walker (ODW) for walking support to those who have walking disabilities. It is necessary for the ODW to know which direction the user is intending to go during walking support. A novel interface is proposed for the ODW to recognize directional intention according to the user's forearm pressures which are measured by force sensors embedded in the armrest. The relationship between forearm pressures and directional intention was extracted as fuzzy rules and an algorithm is proposed for directional intention identification based on distance type fuzzy reasoning method. In this paper, we conduct walking support experiments with the proposed method. The results show that the algorithm is applicable to directional control in walking support.	algorithm;amiga walker;armrest;embedded system;experiment;open desktop workstation;sensor	Yinlai Jiang;Kenji Ishida;Shuoyu Wang;Takeshi Ando;Masakatsu G.

Touch is a key but understudied element; here, we explore its emotional content in the context of a furry robot pet. We asked participants to imagine feeling nine emotions located in a 2-D arousal-valence affect space, then to express them by touching a lap-sized robot prototype equipped with pressure sensors and accelerometer. We found overall correct classification (Random Forests) within the 2-D grid of 36% (all participants combined) and 48% (average of participants classified individually); chance 11%. Rates rose to 56% in the high arousal zone. To better understand classifier performance, we defined and analyzed new metrics that better indicate closeness of the gestural expressions. We also present a method to combine direct affect recognition with affect inferred from gesture recognition. This analysis provides a unique first insight into the nature and quality of affective touch, with implications as a design tool and for incorporating unintrusive affect sensing into deployed interactions.	robot	Kerem Altun;Karon E.

However, there are a limited number of research studies that have evaluated the effect of these parameters on human tactile perception. This paper investigated the influence and interaction of these two parameters on a discrimination task. The task consisted of discriminating the spatial-period of sinusoidal gratings through the use of passive-guided touch. In two complementary experiments 40 participants performed the discrimination task under two different tactile conditions: (I) using direct bare fingertip sensing (baseline condition), and (II) using tactile displays with different tactor spacings and diameters. In both experiments differences between and within subjects were considered for Condition II, and for all test conditions the spatial-period Weber fraction for each participant was measured. Results from both experiments were consistent in indicating that tactile performance improves as tactor spacing is decreased and tactor diameter is increased. However, tactor spacings below 1.1 mm might not result in any significant further improvement. The findings of this study might help designers to choose design parameters for tactile displays based upon the cost-benefit of tactor density versus perceptual performance.	baseline (configuration management);diameter (qualifier value);experiment;fingertip dosing unit;haptic device component;haptic technology;large;less than;small;spacing;touch perception;weber	Nadia Vanessa Garcia-Hernandez;Federica Bertolotto;Ferdinando Cannella;Nikolaos G.

In this architecture, each client maintains a local copy of the virtual environment (VE). A centralized physics simulation running on a server calculates the object states based on haptic device position information received from the clients. The object states are sent back to the clients to update the local copies of the VE, which are used to render interaction forces displayed to the user through a haptic device. Communication delay leads to delayed object state updates and increased force feedback rendered at the clients. In this article, we analyze the effect of communication delay on the magnitude of the rendered forces at the clients for cooperative multi-user interactions with rigid objects. The analysis reveals guidelines on the tolerable communication delay. If this delay is exceeded, the increased force magnitude becomes haptically perceivable. We propose an adaptive force rendering scheme to compensate for this effect, which dynamically changes the stiffness used in the force rendering at the clients. Our experimental results, including a subjective user study, verify the applicability of the analysis and the proposed scheme to compensate the effect of time-varying communication delay in a multi-user SHVE.	centralized computing;clientâserver model;dynamical simulation;haptic technology;interaction;multi-user;server (computing);usability testing;virtual reality	Clemens Schuwerk;Xiao Xu;Rahul Gopal Chaudhari;Eckehard G.

Stereo loudspeakers to the left and right of the screen are typically used for virtual human audio. Unfortunately, stereo pairs can produce an effect known as precedence, which causes users standing close to a particular loudspeaker to perceive a collapse of the stereo sound to that singular loudspeaker. We studied if this effect might degrade the presentation of a virtual character, or if this would be prevented by the ventriloquism effect. Our results demonstrate that from viewing distances common to virtual human scenarios, a movement equivalent to a single stride can induce a stereo collapse, creating conflicting perceived locations of the virtual human's voice. Users also expressed a preference for a sound source collocated with the virtual human's mouth rather than a stereo pair. These results provide several design implications for virtual human display systems.	covox speech thing;loudspeaker;mixed reality;precedence effect;virtual actor	David M. Krum;Evan A. Suma;Mark T.

Instead of memorizing pictures on cards, players explore tactile graphics on a computer-generated virtual surface. Tactile sensations are created by controlling dynamic, distributed lateral strain patterns on a fingerpad in contact with a tactile display called STRESS2. The tactile graphics are explored by moving the device within the workspace of a 2D planar carrier. Three tactile rendering methods were developed and used to create distinct tactile memory cards. The haptic memory game showcases the capabilities of this novel tactile display technology.	computer-generated holography;display device;graphics;lateral thinking;memory card;workspace	Qi Wang;Vincent LÃ©vesque;JÃ©rÃ´me Pasquero;Vincent Hayward	2006		10.1145/1125451.1125510	computer vision;computer science;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-43.45118012438111	-40.12232880348473	93682

3dda66ce9f3b402f524d34a85ee9fb49c83c99d2	perceptual evaluation of space in virtual environments		Floor plan designs and their spatial analysis are typically constrained to blueprints and 2D projections of 3D models. Computing appropriate spatial measures from such representations provides a standard way of quantifying important aspects of the design. We wish to investigate whether a personu0027s perceptual exploration of a space would agree with such spatial measures, that is, whether a person can roughly infer such measures by exploring a space. We perform two studies, one involving novices and the other experts. First, we conduct a perceptual study to discover whether a novice useru0027s perception of spatial measures depends on the mode used to explore the space. Our analysis considers three spatial measures, grounded in Space-Syntax, that characterize key aspects of a design such as visibility, accessibility, and organization. We compare three modes of exploration: 2D blueprints, first-person view in a 3D simulation, and a 3D virtual reality simulation with teleportation. A correlation analysis between the usersu0027 perceptual ratings and the spatial measures, indicates that virtual reality is the most effective of the three methods, while 2D blueprints and 3D first-person exploration often fail entirely to convey the spatial measures. In the second study, experts are asked to evaluate and rank the design blueprints for each measure. The expert observations are in strong agreement with the spatial measures for accessibility and organization, but not for visibility in some cases. This indicates that even experts have difficulty understanding spatial aspects of an architecture design from 2D blueprints alone.	3d floor plan;3d modeling;accessibility;blueprint;color vision;hoc (programming language);marginal model;max;parsing;perceptual robotics;simulated reality;simulation;singular value decomposition;spatial analysis;virtual reality;visibility graph;visual basic[.net]	Muhammad Usman;M.

Currently, most people access digital media contents by exploiting GUI. However, it only provides limited manipulation of the contents. The proposed system, instead of a mouse and a keyboard, adopts two types of tangible objects, i.e. a RFID-enabled object and a tracker-embedded object. The TMCS enables users to easily access and control digital media contents through tangible objects. In addition, it supports an interactive media controller which can be used to synthesize media contents according to users' taste. It also offers personalized contents, which suits users' preferences, by exploiting context such as the users' profile and situational information. Accordingly, the TMCS demonstrates that tangible interfaces with context can provide more effective interfaces to satisfy users' demands. Therefore, the proposed system can be applied to various interactive applications such as multimedia education, entertainment, multimedia editor, etc.		Sejin Oh;Woontack Woo	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietisy/e89-d.1.53	humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;control system;operating system;virtual reality;multimedia;user interface;world wide web	DB	-46.16398804093755	-38.94320746414115	94579

In recent years -to allow for deafblind individuals to communicate more independently- a number of haptic gloves have been developed that can recognize and/or convey manual sign languages. These gloves are expensive to construct and currently not commercially available. To address this issue we present a bimanual communication aid, called AUTOSEM that instead of using the hand as a display surface for manual signs, uses combinations of different orientations of both hands to define a set of semaphores that can represent an alphabet. A significant benefit of our technique is that it uses both hands and it can be implemented using low-cost motion sensing devices. User studies with fourteen able-bodied users evaluate both the output and input capabilities of our technique. A deafblind individual provided qualitative feedback on AUTOSEM using a case study.	haptic technology;ibm notes;input/output;orientation (graph theory);semaphore (programming);usability testing	Vinitha Khambadkar;Eelke Folmer	2014	2014 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)	10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775461	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	Visualization	-42.835307438333125	-43.973962613370965	94655

We designed and built a crank-slider mechanism that creates a periodic prismatic motion with asymmetric acceleration (strong in one direction and weak in the other) leading to a âvirtualâ force sensation. The prototype of the handheld device generates a sensation of unidirectional force; humans perceive a uni-directional force although the device physically generates a bi-directional force. By using a motor to pan the crank-slider mechanism, the device unit can create a virtual force in any arbitrary direction on a two dimensional plane. The direction of force can be controlled with angular sensors.

Monitoring live teleoperation video feeds, for example to search for survivors in search and rescue, can be cognitively taxing, particularly for operators driving multiple robots or monitoring multiple cameras. To reduce workload, emerging computer vision techniques can automatically identify and indicate (cue) salient points of potential interest for the operator. However, it is not clear how to cue such points to a preoccupied operator -- whether cues would be distracting and a hindrance to operators -- and how the design of the cue may impact operator cognitive load, attention drawn, and primary task performance. In this paper, we detail our iterative design process for creating a range of visual attention-grabbing cues that are grounded in psychological literature on human attention, and two formal evaluations that measure attention-grabbing capability and impact on operator performance. Our results show that visually cueing on-screen points of interest does not distract operators, that operators perform poorly without the cues, and detail how particular cue design parameters impact operator cognitive load and task performance. Specifically, full-screen cues can lower cognitive load, but can increase response time; animated cues may improve accuracy, but increase cognitive load. Finally, from this design process we provide tested, and theoretically grounded cues for attention drawing in teleoperation.	computer vision;interrupt;iterative design;iterative method;point of interest;response time (technology);robot	Daniel J.

To seek the nature of such haptic invitation, we conducted a series of experiments consisting of sensory evaluations and ranking tasks for 36 materials to ascertain their perceptual properties and their degrees of haptic invitation. In addition, we recorded the human touch motions elicited by these materials. The results showed high degrees of haptic invitation for materials with perceptually prominent textures, which indicates that such textures frequently invite human touch motions. We also developed a Bayesian network model that represented the probabilistic relationships between invited touch motions and the properties of textures. The model substantiated the observation that different types of textural prominence led to different types of invited touch motions. These results collectively suggest that materials with prominent textures frequently encourage humans to touch them, using appropriate or specified touch motions.	bayesian network;coefficient;evaluation;experiment;haptic device component;haptic technology;motion;network model;prominence of facial canal;tactile graphic	Hikaru Nagano;Shogo Okamoto;Yoji Yamada	2014	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2014.2321575	computer vision;surface roughness;engineering;multimedia;correlation;weaving	Visualization	-43.430495518623964	-51.25765694888829	95024

These phenomena have been observed in both computer-generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper, we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for semiimmersive VR systems, i.e., a passive and active stereoscopic projection system as well as an immersive VR system, i.e., a head-mounted display, and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.	blinking;color vision;computer-generated holography;depth perception;eye movements;head-mounted display;movement;night blindness;saccades;stereopsis;stereoscopy;vr - veterans rand health survey;virtual reality;observers	Frank Steinicke;Gerd Bruder;Klaus H.

In this paper, an instruction robot for crutch walk training is introduced. This robot moves along a walking crutch user, and it measures his/her body parts motions. Based on the measurements, the robot provides advices to the crutch user for proper walk motions. As a result, the crutch user can review his/her own walk motions. It is expected that crutch walk training with this robot will improve the crutch userÂ»s walk motions, and it will decrease the possibility of accidents.	robot	Naoaki Tsuda;Susumu Tarao;Yoshihiko Nomura;Norihiko Kato	2018		10.1145/3173386.3176968	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;robot;computer science;crutch	Robotics	-46.75095927595648	-50.18992631546415	95694

To overcome the challenges associated with browsing social media feeds on mobile devices, we are developing an innovative scheme to automatically create and synthesize the mixed social media digest (pictures, texts and videos) into a magazine-page-like social media visual summary. Given a set of personalized social media digest, a multi-objective optimization is formulated to organize the digest into visual summary in a 9-block-partition fashion with consideration of informative delivery, aesthetic rules and visual perception principles. Each block will be optimized interactively in terms of size, position and color to best represent the overall social media digest. Extensive evaluation and analysis based on user studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in presenting social media content in a visually appealing and compact way. It is expected that this visual summary will lead to much enhanced user experiences for browsing social media digest on mobile devices.	color;cryptographic hash function;display size;function overloading;information;interactivity;mathematical optimization;maximal set;mobile device;mobile phone;multi-objective optimization;personalization;social media;usability testing;user experience	Shuang Ma;Chang Wen Chen	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532401	computer vision;media;visualization;mobile telephony;visual perception;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;electronic media	HCI	-35.11638370246845	-48.76490370374633	95717

We describe a methodology for conducting passive longitudinal studies, where the participant is able to go about their daily routine without taking any disruptive action such as writing a diary entry or responding to an interruption. Although passive user observations have been done through log analysis, our retrospective cued recall (RCR) method recorded participant screens over a month long period linked to logged trigger events, allowing for a later review that was is guided by retrospective recall as cued by the images of screen captures. We find this method of gathering user behaviors to be remarkably accurate, despite fairly lengthy delays between action and recall.	diary studies;interrupt;log analysis;precision and recall;retro city rampage;usability testing	Daniel M.

This paper presents five new performance metrics and utilizes two tasks from the literature to quantify differences between input devices in constrained threedimensional environments, similar to âfirst-personâ-genre games. The metrics are Mean Speed Variance, Mean Acceleration Variance, Percent View Moving, Target Leading Analysis, and Mean Time-to-Reacquire. All measures are continuous, as they evaluate movement during a trial. The tasks involved tracking a moving target for several seconds, with and without target acceleration. An evaluation between an X-Box gamepad and a standard PC mouse demonstrated the ability of the metrics to help reveal and explain performance differences between the devices.

001a3342cf9ad7b70129709fffa1b8c204a1eede	a touch sensitive keypad layout for improved usability of smartphones for the blind and visually impaired persons		Blind users face a number of challenges in performing common operations of text-entry, text selection, and text manipulation on smartphones. The existing keypad layouts make it difficult for the users to easily operate a touch screen device even for entry-level activities. This necessitates the need for customizing the current keypad and dialer to enable a blind user to perform common activities of making a call, sending and receiving SMS messages and e-mails and browsing internet without visual feedback. Based on our prior study on screen division layouts, this paper proposes and evaluates a dialer and keyboard for blind users of a smartphone. The proposed keypad was tested on selected groups of blind users from both the countries where the research was performed. They were initially trained on using the proposed keypad. Their experiences were then recorded using interviews and observation. The responses were then tested and analyzed using standard statistical tests. The results were then compared with the existing ordinary and QWERTY keypads. These results show that the proposed keypad and dialer has a gentle learning curve and results in minimum typing errors thus reducing cognitive load on the blind user.	smartphone;usability	Badam Niazi;Shah Khusro;Akif Khan;Iftikhar Alam	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-33625-1_38	embedded system;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-48.17410917925072	-44.66467942417494	96277

The HMD presents a pair of video streams to the operator (one to each eye) originating from a pair of stereo cameras located on the front of the robot, thus providing him/her with a sense of depth (stereopsis). A tracker on the HMD captures 3-DOF head orientation data which is then used for adjusting the camera orientation by moving the robot and/or the camera position accordingly, and rotating the displayed images to compensate for the operatorâs head rotation. This approach was implemented in a search and rescue robot (RAPOSA), and it was empirically validated in a series of short user studies. This evaluation involved four experiments covering two-dimensional perception, depth perception, scene perception, and performing a search and rescue task in a controlled scenario. The stereoscopic display and head tracking are shown to afford a number of performance benefits. However, one experiment also revealed that controlling robot orientation with yaw input from the head tracker negatively influenced task completion time. A possible explanation is a mismatch between the abilities of the robot and the human operator. This aside, the studies indicated that the use of an HMD to create a stereoscopic visualization of the camera feeds from a mobile robot enhanced the perception of cues in a static three-dimensional environment and also that such benefits transferred to simulated field scenarios in the form of enhanced task completion times.	augmented reality;cognitive science;control system;depth perception;display device;experiment;head-mounted display;human reliability;information;machine perception;mobile robot;motion capture;raposa;rescue robot;robotics;seamless3d;sensor;stereo camera;stereo cameras;stereopsis;stereoscopy;streaming media;yaws	Henrique Martins;Ian Oakley;Rodrigo Ventura	2015	Robotica	10.1017/S026357471400126X	computer vision;teleoperation;simulation;computer science;engineering;stereopsis;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;optical head-mounted display;computer graphics (images);mechanical engineering	Robotics	-44.59908435180931	-48.10857396667642	96667

On such websites, the audio quality of these music videos can differ from poor to very good since the content is uploaded by users. The results of a previous study indicated that music videos are very popular in general among the users. This paper addresses the question whether the audio quality of music videos has an influence on user ratings. A generic system for measuring the audio quality on video-sharing websites is described. The system has been implemented and was deployed for evaluating the relationship between audio quality and video ratings on YouTube. The analysis of the results indicate that, contrary to popular expectation, the audio quality of music videos has surprisingly little influence on its appreciation by the YouTube user.	sound card;sound quality	Michael Schoeffler;JÃ¼rgen Herre	2014		10.1145/2661714.2661725	psychology;multimedia;advertising;internet privacy	Web+IR	-34.033668824121285	-47.59475129137997	96817

Recently most AR occlusion handling algorithms aimed at general environment, more special research on AR occlusion handling for application in the context of industrial assembly, such as assembly training and assembly task guidance, is required. An occlusion handling method aimed at video see-through AR-based assembly system is presented based on the analysis of the occlusion between virtual part, visual assembly feature, navigation information, physical part and physical assembly environment in the context of virtual/physical assembly working space. The method was implemented in prototype AR-assembly system and was proved to be efficient in handling the virtual/physical occlusion in augmented assembly scene.	augmented reality	Chi Xu;Shiqi Li;Junfeng Wang;Tao Peng;Ming Xie	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88518-4_14	computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;computer science;engineering;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-40.385355181673226	-38.26550376985771	97014

Reliable action recognition in such a âdegradedâ environment would promote the development of privacy-preserving smart rooms that would facilitate intelligent interaction with its occupants while mitigating privacy concerns. This paper aims to explore the trade-off between action recognition performance, number of cameras, and temporal and spatial resolution in a smart-room environment. As it is impractical to build a physical platform to test every combination of camera positions and resolutions, we use a graphics engine (Unity3DÂ©) to simulate a room with various avatars animated using motions captured from real subjects with a Kinect v2 sensor. We study the performance impact of spatial resolutions from a single pixel up-to 10Ã10 pixels, the impact of temporal resolutions from 2 Hz up-to 30 Hz and the impact of using up-to 5 ceiling cameras. We found that reliable action recognition for smart-room centric gestures can still occur in environments with extremely low temporal and spatial resolutions. When using 5, single-pixel cameras at 30Hz we achieved a correct classification rate (CCR) of 75.70% across 9 actions, only 13.9% lower than the CCR for the same camera setup at 10Ã10 pixels. We also found that, in terms of the impact on action recognition performance, spatial resolution has the highest impact, followed by number of cameras, and temporal resolution (frame rate).	activity recognition;algorithm;best, worst and average case;game engine;graphics;image resolution;kinect;local consistency;pixel;privacy;simulation;unity;usability	Ji Dai;Jonathan Wu;Behrouz Saghafi;Janusz Konrad;Prakash Ishwar	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)	10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301356	computer vision;simulation;image resolution;mobile telephony;computer science;reliability;grayscale;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-38.755909298627905	-40.883587582523106	97296

While these solutions have mostly proven effective, there still remain certain shortcomings making further investigations worthwhile. Motivated by recent research, we propose the speech-based multimodal text entry system SWIFTER, which strives for simplicity while maintaining good performance. In an initial user study, we compared our approach to smartphone-based text entry within a CAVE-like virtual environment. Results indicate that SWIFTER reaches an average input rate of 23.6 words per minute and is positively received by users in terms of user experience.	a/ux;multimodal interaction;smartphone;usability testing;user experience;virtual reality;words per minute	Sebastian Pick;Andrew S.

Despite a putative lack of calibration of their auditory system with vision, blind subjects performed with a similar accuracy as sighted subjects. The average error was sufficiently low (10Â° in azimuth and 10 cm in distance) to orient a user towards a specific goal or to guide a hand grasping movement to a nearby object. Repeated white noise bursts of short duration induced better performance than continuous sounds of similar total duration. These types of sound could be advantageously used in an assistive device. They would provide indications about direction to follow or position of surrounding objects, with limited masking of environmental sounds, which are of primary importance for the Blind.	humans	Marc J.-M.

To better reflect the intent of our new interface, we have created a new type of hardware system with a large hybrid display, named ThunderPunch. Unlike the conventional method, which involves positioning the camera in front, the cameras are mounted on the ceiling so that they avoid covering the large screen. To achieve bare-hand interaction in this hardware structure, we propose real-time algorithms that detect multiple body poses and recognize punching and touching gestures from top-view depth images. A pointing and touching test shows that the proposed algorithm is usable and that it outperforms other algorithms. In addition, we created a game to make the best use of the proposed system.	application program interface;gesture recognition;interface device component;multi-user;name;new type;other named variants of lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma, lymph nodes of head, face, and neck;real-time clock;algorithm	Daehwan Kim;Hye-mi Kim;Yuka Terauchi;Deb A;Ki-Suk Lee;Ki-Hong Kim	2018	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/MCG.2018.053491734	computer vision;usable;punching;artificial intelligence;upper body part;computer graphics;ceiling (aeronautics);gesture;computer science	Visualization	-43.95845029521246	-42.91730722234886	97481

At later times, such tags could be retrieved from different locations and orientations. Our approach does not require any additional infrastructure support, localization scheme, specialized camera, or modification to smartphone's operating system. Designed and developed for current generation smartphones, our application shows promising initial results with retrieval accuracy of 82% in indoor environment without noticeable impact on the user experience.  If made commercially available, such system could be used in city tourism, infrastructure maintenance, and enabling new kind of social interactions.	augmented reality;interaction;internationalization and localization;operating system;real-time locating system;smartphone;user experience	Puneet Jain;Romit Roy Choudhury	2014		10.1145/2594368.2601472	computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-47.177759781748016	-40.72239228843411	97492

Participants were placed in a situation of perceptual conflict concerning the rotation speed of a cylindrical texture. Participants touched a cylindrical texture of gratings rotating around its axis at a constant speed, while they watched a cylinder without gratings rotating at a different speed on a computer screen. Participants were asked to estimate the speed of the gratings texture under the finger and the spacing (or spatial period) of the gratings. We observed that the tactual estimations of both speed and spacing co-varied with the speed of the visual stimulus, although the cylinder perceived tactually rotated at a constant speed. The first effect (speed effect) could correspond to the resolution of the perceptual conflict in favor of vision. The second effect (spacing effect) is apparently surprising, since no varying information about spacing was provided by vision. However, the physical relation between spacing and speed is well established according to every day experience. Thus, the parameter extraneous to the conflict could be influenced according to previous experience. Such cross-modal effects could be used by designers of virtual reality systems and haptic devices to improve the haptic sensations they can generate using simple (constant) tactile stimulations combined with visual feedback.	computer monitor;cylinder seal;doppler effect;haptic technology;mcgurk effect;modal logic;optic axis of a crystal;virtual reality	Anatole LÃ©cuyer;Marco Congedo;Edouard Gentaz;Olivier Joly;Sabine Coquillart	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14075-4_11	computer vision;simulation;computer science;communication	HCI	-44.67721754540526	-49.67430071402865	97854

In order to deliver a wider variety of information accurately and efficiently, significant design factors of the vibration need to be investigated and applied to haptic devices. In this study, the excitatory direction was examined as a design factor of the vibration in terms of sensitivity and emotion. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, the sensitivities of three excitatory directions--X (lateral), Y (fore-and-aft) and Z (vertical) axes were estimated by the absolute thresholds of the vibration perception with two frequency levels (150 and 280 Hz). Based on ten participants' estimated absolute thresholds, we conclude that the vibration with X axis is less sensitive than Z axis at the frequency of 150 Hz, while the vibration with Y axis is less sensitive than Z axis at the frequency of 280 Hz. In the second experiment, the agreeability of 29 emotional expressions to the vibrations was measured by a 7-point scale with a total of 12 conditions (2 frequencies Ã 2 amplitudes (i.e., 50 Ã 10?3 and 500 Ã 10?3 g) Ã 3 excitatory directions). Based on 20 participants' responses, it is concluded that at the frequency of 150 Hz and the amplitude of 50 Ã 10?3 g, the vibration is perceived as `light', and as even `lighter' if the vibration is with Y axis rather than with Z axis. Likewise, at the frequency of 150 Hz and the amplitude of 500 Ã 10?3 g, the vibration is perceived as `repulsive', and as even `more repulsive' if the vibration is with Y or Z axis rather than with X axis. Therefore, three excitatory directions can be selectively utilized to design the distinguishable vibration by its sensitivity and emotion.	haptic technology	Jihong Hwang;Wonil Hwang	2011	J.

They provide users with access to screen content that would otherwise be impossible or hard to reach, e.g., because it is located behind a bezel or far away from the user. Drag-and-pop is an extension of traditional drag-and-drop. As the user starts dragging an icon towards some target icon, drag-and-pop responds by temporarily moving potential target icons towards the userâs current cursor location, thereby allowing the user to interact with these icons using comparably small hand movements. Drag-and-Pick extends the drag-and-pop interaction style such that it allows activating icons, e.g., to open folders or launch applications. In this paper, we report the results of a user study comparing drag-and-pop with traditional drag-and-drop on a 15â (4.50m) wide interactive display wall. Participants where able to file icons up to 3.7 times faster when using the drag-and-pop interface.	bridging (networking);cursor (databases);drag and drop;interaction technique;tablet computer;usability testing;user (computing);video wall	Patrick Baudisch;Edward Cutrell;Mary Czerwinski;Daniel C.

This paper presents a study intended to evaluate the importance of possible assumptions made by the human visual system. Using a CAVE simulation, participants viewed and counted virtual furniture objects in a variety of experimental manipulations. The assumption of uprightness against inversion, or the `gravity constraint,' was identified as a significant assumption of the visual system (p <; 0.001). Monocular vs. binocular vision was also demonstrated as an important factor in this study (p = 0.01), while color vs. grayscale did not have a significant impact on task performance (p = 0.16). By including the binocular cue, and the assumption about the direction of gravity, the scene reconstruction produced by our computer vision model is reliable. The model can detect and count symmetrical objects in a 3D real scene and then recover their 3D shapes.	binocular vision;cave story;computer vision;grayscale;habbo;simulation;virtual reality	Eric Palmer;Aaron Michaux;Zygmunt Pizlo	2016	2016 IEEE Virtual Reality (VR)	10.1109/VR.2016.7504751	3d reconstruction;computer vision;simulation;gravity;computer science;solid modeling;human visual system model;perception;computational model;grayscale;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-42.98833733687563	-49.32074557201311	98402

On the other end, the information visualization community focuses on effective methods for conveying information to the user. What is lacking is research considering the information visualization and interactive retrieval as truly integrated parts of one content-based search system. In such an integrated system, there are many degrees of freedom like the similarity function, the number of images to display, the image size, different visualization modes, and possible feedback modes. To base the optimal values for all of those on user studies is unfeasible. We therefore develop search scenarios in which tasks and user actions are simulated. From there, the proposed scheme is optimized based on objective constraints and evaluation criteria. In such a manner, the degrees of freedom are reduced and the remaining degrees can be evaluated in user studies. In this article, we present a system that integrates advanced similarity based visualization with active learning. We have performed extensive experimentation on interactive category search with different image collections. The results using the proposed simulation scheme show that indeed the use of advanced visualization and active learning pays off in all of these datasets.	common criteria;image resolution;information visualization;machine learning;relevance feedback;similarity measure;simulation;usability testing	Giang P.

But there is lack of a complete solution to track the effectiveness of training methods adopted for improvement. A platform to assess the effectiveness of these training routines is discussed in this paper. The platform consists of wireless measurement sensors which work in conjunction with software analysis modules. The sensors can measure kinetic parameters in real-time and are attached to the racket and to the player's body. The software module enables visualization of sensor data and evaluates performance. The platform has been made versatile and customizable to enable easy integration with any training procedure involved in performance improvement. In this paper, the proposed platform is utilized to monitor the effectiveness of drills involved in improvement of tennis serves.

This can be achieved, for instance, using a social assistive robot as interface towards the environment services. In the context of the NICA (Natural Interaction with a Caring Agent) project we developed the behavioral architecture of a social robot able to assist the user in the interaction with a smart home environment.

Our main goal is to bring the virtual body into the user's FoV and to understand how this affects the virtual body/environment relation and quality of interaction. Subjects wore a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and were instructed to perform a selection and docking task while using either Perspective (â 106 Â° vertical FoV), Hammer or Equirectangular (â 180 Â° vertical FoV for both) projection. The increased FoV allowed for a shorter search time as well as less head movements. However, quality of interaction was generally inferior, requiring more time to dock, increasing docking error and producing more body/environment collisions. We also assessed cybersickness and the sense of embodiment toward the virtual body through questionnaires, for which the difference between projections seemed to be less pronounced.	docking (molecular);field of view in video games;head-mounted display;immersion (virtual reality);virtual body;virtual reality sickness	Henrique Debarba;Sami Perrin;Bruno Herbelin;Ronan Boulic	2015		10.1145/2821592.2821603	computer vision;simulation;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-45.08381370755239	-48.34543801754166	99183

The two display techniques are 2D display, and interactive 3D stereoscopic virtual holography display on a zSpace tablet. Experiments were conducted, by several users of different ages and computer training. The experiments involved selected pointing and manipulation tasks. The speed of performing the tasks using the two display techniques were recorded. Statistical analysis of the data is presented. As expected, the use of interactive 3D stereoscopic display resulted in faster performance of the tasks. The improvement in performance was particularly noticeable for the cases wherein the subjects needed to manipulate the haptic arm to reach objects / targets at different depths, and also when the objects / targets were occluded partially by the obstacles.	arm architecture;depth perception;experiment;haptic technology;holography;stereoscopy;tablet computer;virtual reality	Rifat Aras;Yuzhong Shen;Ahmed K.

By combining the thermoelectric characteristics of copper with the high thermal expansion rate of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, we are able to actuate the shape of flexible circuit composites directly. The shape-changing actuation is enabled by a temperature driven mechanism and reduces the complexity of fabrication for thin shape-changing interfaces. In this paper we describe how to design and fabricate thin uniMorph composites. We present composites that are actuated by either environmental temperature changes or active heating of embedded structures and provide a systematic overview of shape-changing primitives. Finally, we present different sensing techniques that leverage the existing copper structures or can be seamlessly embedded into the uniMorph composite. To demonstrate the wide applicability of uniMorph, we present several applications in ubiquitous and mobile computing.	digital modeling and fabrication;embedded system;flexible circuit;mobile computing;shape context	Felix Heibeck;Basheer Tome;Clark Della Silva;Hiroshi Ishii	2015		10.1145/2807442.2807472	unimorph;thin film;computer science;rapid prototyping;thermal expansion;composite material;organic user interface	HCI	-45.11081667176704	-38.55039247882568	99276
1ae17e45e8b32969a3127400eb6525d2ccd93c3a	hybrid user interfaces: breeding virtually bigger interfaces for physically smaller computers	hybrid user interfaces	While virtual worlds offer a compelling alternative to conventional interfaces, the technologies these systems currently use do not provide sufficient resolution and accuracy to support detailed work such as text editing. We describe a pragmatic approach to interface design that provides users with a large virtual world in which such high-resolution work can be performed. Our approach is based on combining heterogeneous display and interaction device technologies to produce a hybrid user interface. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively low resolution, but which cover a wide (visual and interactive) field are used to form an information surround. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively high resolution over a limited visual and interaction range are used to present concentrated information in one or more selected portions of the surround. These highresolution fields are embedded within the low-resolution surround by choosing and coordinating complementary devices that permit the user to see and interact with both simultaneously. This allows each embedded high-resolution interface to serve as a âsweet spotâ within which intonation may be preferentially processed, We have developed a preliminary implementation, described in this paper, that uses a Reflection Technology Private Eye display and a Polhemus sensor to provide the secondary lowresohttion surround, and a flat-panel display and mouse to provide the primary high-resolution interface.

6e30cdf83becd2b7764e9d5543055184a74e8be3	balancing exploration - exploitation in image retrieval		In recent years there has been an increased interest in developing explorationâexploitation algorithms for image search. However, little research has been done as to what type of image search such techniques might be most beneficial. We present an interactive image retrieval system that combines Reinforcement Learning with an interface designed to allow users to actively engage in directing the search. Reinforcement Learning is used to model the user interests by allowing the system to trade off between exploration (unseen types of image) and exploitation (images the system thinks are relevant). A task-based user study indicates that for certain types of searches a traditional exploitation-based system is more than adequate, while for others a more complex system trading off exploration and exploitation is more beneficial. Image retrieval techniques operating on meta-data, such as textual annotations, have become the industry standard. However, with the explosive growth of image collections, tagging new images quickly is not always possible. Secondly, there are many instances where image search by query is problematic, e.g. finding an illustration for an article about âyouthâ. A solution to such a problem is content-based image retrieval (CBIR) [6]. Early experiments show that CBIR can be improved through relevance feedback by involving the user in the search loop [1]. However, relevance feedback can lead to a context trap, where users specify the context so strictly that they can only exploit a limited area of information space. Combining exploration/exploitation strategies with relevance feedback is a popular attempt at avoiding the context trap [2, 3, 7]. However, few studies have been done showing the advantages (and disadvantages) of exploratory image retrieval systems. We report preliminary studies showing under what conditions exploratory image search might be most beneficial and where exploratory search may actually hinder the search results. For this purpose, we built a query-less image search system incorporating state of the art reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to allow the system to efficiently balance between exploration and exploitation. System Overview. The system assists users in finding images in a database of unannotated images without query typing. The RL methods and interactive interface allow users to direct the search according to their interests. The interface and an example search are presented in Figure 1. The search starts with a display of a collage of images. To ensure that the initial set is a good representation of the entire image space, we cluster all the images in k clusters, where k is the number of displayed images and then we sample an image from each cluster. Our pre-user study shows that this technique provides a good starting point for the search. When the mouse hovers over an image, 13 (Edited by IvÃ¡n Cantador and Min Chi) Proceedings of UMAP 2014 posters, demonstrations and late-breaking results (a) Iteration 1 (b) Iteration 2 (c) Iteration 3 (d) Iteration 4 Fig. 1. The first four iterations of an example search for âCity by nightâ. a slide bar appears at the bottom allowing the user to rate that particular image. The feedback ranges from -1 (no interest to the user) to 1 (highly relevant). Users can score as many images as they like. Images not rated by the user are assumed to have score of 0. Each image can be displayed at most once throughout the entire search session. We illustrate the interface and interaction design through a walkthrough exemple. The user wants to find an image to illustrate an article about âcity by nightâ. Initially (Figure 1a), the user is presented with a collage of images uniformly selected from the database and marks the fifth image in the second row and the second image in the third row as highly relevant. The user moves to the next iteration by pressing the âNextâ button at the top of the page. In the second iteration (Figure 1b), more images related to ânightâ are presented and the user selects four images. In iterations 3 and 4 (Figures 1c and 1d), more relevant images are presented and the user can further narrow down his search. To help the user to explore the image space, we use Gaussian Process bandits with Self-Organizing Maps (GP-SOM), with dependencies across arms, which in our system translates into similarities between images. The algorithm uses function f that makes predictions with regards to the relevance of all the images to the userâs interests. When selecting the next set of images to display, the system might select images with the highest estimated relevance score but since the estimate of f may be inaccurate, this exploitative choice might be suboptimal. Alternatively, the system might exploratively select an image for which the user feedback improves the accuracy of f , enabling better future image selections. A detailed description of the algorithm and the similarity measure between the images can be found in [5]. Experiments. We conducted a set of user studies to evaluate the impact of exploration on three types of searches [1]: (1) Target search looking for a particular image; (2) Category search looking for any image from a given category, e.g. image of a cat; (3) 14 (Edited by IvÃ¡n Cantador and Min Chi) Proceedings of UMAP 2014 posters, demonstrations and late-breaking results Open search browsing a collection of images without knowing what the target may look like. The study included three conditions: 1) our Gaussian Process system (GP), 2) a version of our system that uses only exploitation (EXPLOIT), and 3) a system that presents random images at each iteration (RAND). In EXPLOIT, the exploration level was set to 0, which means that the system can only present images similar to the ones marked as relevant. The same interface was used in all settings. We used the MIRFLICKR-25000 dataset [4] consisting of 25000 images from the social photography site Flickr and commonly used in assessment of image retrieval and annotation tasks. We recruited 20 post-graduate students to run the experiments. Each participant was asked to perform three tasks for all three types of searches, i.e. each participant performed 9 searchers. We counterbalanced between the tasks and the systems for each subject so that each task was performed the same number of times with each system. The participants were asked to finish the task when they find the target image (in target search) or when they feel they found the ideal image in category and open searches. In all the tasks, the search was limited to 25 iterations. In target search, participants were presented with an image and a short description of that image and then asked to look for that image. In category and open searches, no example images were provided and participants were only given a short description of what to look for, e.g. red rose or illustration for an article about gardening.	algorithm;chi;coat of arms;cognitive walkthrough;complex system;content-based image retrieval;database;emoticon;experiment;exploit (computer security);exploratory search;flickr;gardening (cryptanalysis);gaussian process;inferring horizontal gene transfer;interaction design;iteration;reinforcement learning;relevance feedback;session (web analytics);similarity measure;slide rule;tag (metadata);technical standard;the industry standard;usability testing;user interface	Dorota Glowacka;Sayantan Hore	2014				ML	-34.61703689495763	-49.871628285414666	99374
efa60944fc296786d6c2250a6994bb72da6ed344	a shared control method for obstacle avoidance with mobile robots and its interaction with communication delay	teleoperation;shared control;obstacle avoidance;communication delay;human-robot interaction;mobile robot	Teleoperation allows human operators to safely extend themselves to remote environments that are typically difficult or dangerous to access. The remote environments are often unstructured (i.e. not having clear roads or paths to follow) and only accessible by wireless communication (introducing factors such as degraded signals and communication delay). Teleoperated driving under these conditions can result in slow operation speeds and unintended collisions with obstacles. Automating portions of the teleoperation task can help mitigate some of the negative effects of wireless communication. Shared control is used to combine inputs from the human teleoperator and automation. This work presents a new model predictive control based shared control method. We introduce a new representation for obstacle free regions that works well with unstructured robot environments and allows for an model predictive control problem formulation that can be solved rapidly. The shared control method is implemented in a robot simulator and tested with human subjects. Two user studies involving a search task with a mobile robot evaluate the effectiveness of the shared control method and explore its interaction with factors such as communication delay and input interface style. Communication delay is found to have the largest magnitude effect on performance and safety measures. Results demonstrate that the shared control method can improve both performance and safety when delays are present.	control system;gamepad;input device;justin (robot);mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;robotic mapping;simulation;tablet computer;technical support;telerobotics;usability testing;voronoi diagram	Justin G.

cf8710d9d21a2b8a3be5aee9aa8af360a79e6cff	pda-assisted indoor-navigation with imprecise positioning: results of a desktop usability study		Although most of todayâs navigation systems are used for guidance of cars, recent progress in mobile computing made it possible for research and industry to develop various prototypes of indoor-navigation systems in combination with PDAs. Independent of the presentation mode of route instructions, it is desirable that such real-time route guidance system automatically delivers the correct piece of information to the user at the right time. This requires that the PDA knows the userâs position and orientation, which is not always available due to technical limitations of indoor sensing and positioning techniques, and potential signal dropouts. Using a desktop usability study, this chapter extends previous work on route instructions with mobile devices. The study explores the preferred modes of interaction between user and PDA in case of diluted position and orientation accuracies.	desktop computer;global positioning system;guidance system;mobile computing;mobile device;personal digital assistant;real-time locating system;usability testing	Hartwig H.

At the server, a physics simulation engine calculates the object states based on the position information received from the clients. At the clients, the object state information, received from the server, is used to update the local copy of the virtual environment. Forces displayed to the user through a haptic device are computed locally at the client based on the interactions with the objects. Communication delay leads to delayed object state updates and increased interaction forces rendered at the clients. Users perceive this as increased object weight. In this paper, we systematically analyze the loss of transparency caused by communication delay and propose a novel adaptive force rendering scheme to compensate for it. The proposed scheme reduces the objects' stiffness at the clients, based on delay, device velocity and motion constraints of the objects, only if necessary to achieve perceptual transparency. Simulations and subjective evaluations show that the effect of increased weight of objects is successfully compensated for the tested delay range of up to 150 ms. At the same time, if the object is unmovable, the perception of interaction with a rigid object is preserved.	algorithm;approximation;centralized computing;clientâserver model;computer simulation;cube 2: sauerbraten;damping factor;dynamical simulation;experiment;haptic technology;interaction;physics engine;server (computing);steady state;sticky bit;stiffness;velocity (software development);virtual reality	Clemens Schuwerk;Rahul Gopal Chaudhari;Eckehard G.

Two operation modes of the system were demonstrated: a vari-focal plane mode in which the accommodation cue is addressable, and a time-multiplexed multi-focal plane mode in which both the accommodation and retinal blur cues can be rendered. We further performed experiments to assess the depth perception and eye accommodative response of the system operated in a vari-focal plane mode. Both subjective and objective measurements suggest that the perceived depths and accommodative responses of the user match with the rendered depths of the virtual display with addressable accommodation cues, approximating the real-world 3-D viewing condition.	airplane mode;authorization;convergence (action);depth perception;dual;experiment;focal (programming language);flicker (screen);flicker-free;gaussian blur;head-mounted display;human factors and ergonomics;ieee xplore;image;liquid crystal on silicon;morphologic artifacts;multiplexing;numerous;photopsia;prototype;requirement;retina;stereoscopy;usability;user interface device component;visual accommodation;visual artifact;diopters	Sheng Liu;Hong Hua;Dewen Cheng	2010	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2009.95	three-dimensional space;computer vision;augmented reality;accommodation;visualization;convergence;depth perception;computer science;optical head-mounted display;lens;prototype;holography;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-41.3346630928189	-39.9956999494488	100094

An increasing number of everyday objects are equipped with smart technology and start to form the Internet of Things. Yet, interacting with these devices is based on conventional surfaces made of glass, metal, or plastic. We believe that textile interaction surfaces will be the next frontier of ubiquitous computing and identified many blank spots in the research landscape. Peoplesâ perception and acceptance of smooth and soft interaction surfaces is insufficiently understood. In this paper we present a study in which 90 people of a wide age range evaluated the suitability of smart textiles in different usage scenarios in the home environment. Overall, a solid willingness to use smart textiles as input devices was found, even though there were conditional acceptance criteria which should be given before participants would be willing to buy them. In contrast to many other technology contexts, however, age is not decisive in the evaluation of the usefulness of smart textiles. Younger and older adults seem to have a quite similar evaluation, hinting at a quite generic acceptance pattern.	atm adaptation layer;e-textiles;input device;interaction;internet of things;ubiquitous computing	Martina Ziefle;Philipp Brauner;Julia van Heek	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39943-0_26	public records;computer science;internet privacy	HCI	-48.00666747174245	-41.475631286561935	100274

Our results show that the pen, hand, and forearm can occlude up to 47% of a 12 inch display. The shape of the occluded area varies between participants due to differences in pen grip rather than simply anatomical differences. For the most part, individuals adopt a consistent posture for long and short selection tasks. Overall, many occluded pixels are located higher relative to the pen than previously thought. From the experimental data, a five-parameter scalable circle and pivoting rectangle geometric model is presented which captures the general shape of the occluded area relative to the pen position. This model fits the experimental data much better than the simple bounding box model often used implicitly by designers. The space of fitted parameters also serves to quantify the shape of occlusion. Finally, an initial design for a predictive version of the model is discussed.	fits;geometric modeling;hidden surface determination;input device;minimum bounding box;pen computing;pixel;poor posture;scalability;tablet computer	Daniel Vogel;Matthew Cudmore;GÃ©ry Casiez;Ravin Balakrishnan;Liam Keliher	2009		10.1145/1518701.1518787	simulation;computer science;geometric modeling;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.015276340056694	-47.10841411765263	100711

The piano-style keyboard is among the most widely used and versatile of digital musical interfaces. However, it lacks the ability to alter the pitch of a note after it has been played, a limitation which prevents the performer from executing common expressive techniques including vibrato and pitch bending. We present a system for controlling pitch from the keyboard surface using capacitive touch sensors to measure the locations of the player's fingers on the keys. The large community of trained pianists makes the keyboard a compelling target for augmentation, but it also poses a challenge: how can a musical interface be extended while making use of the existing techniques performers have spent thousands of hours learning? In this paper, user studies with conservatory pianists explore the constraints of traditional keyboard technique and evaluate the usability of the continuous pitch control system. The paper also discusses implications for the extension of other established interfaces in musical and non-musical contexts.	conservatory (greenhouse);control system;musical keyboard;pitch (music);sensor;usability	Andrew P.

However, making cell phones accessible to the deaf and hard-of-hearing community is still a challenge. Main available products on the market for this community offer no more than the possibility to boost/amplify volume. Many cellular provides individual cell phone models which are hearing aid compatible and possess speakerphone capabilities. However, if the user is completely deaf, these phones still tend to be somewhat complex or impossible to use. Another alternative, based on Video phones messages, are quickly widespread as the preferred method of communicating for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. However Video phones require significant computer processing power to compress and decompress video in real time. Nevertheless, this alternative still has to overcome the various technological challenges associated with utilizing video phone technology, especially via low bandwidth network. In this context, this paper describes a new application allowing the use of MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) to generate sign language animation in order to communicate with deaf people via cell phones. These animations are avatar based animation obtained by automatic interpretation of text into sign language. This application is a new component developed amongst WebSign kernel (Jemni et al., 2007; Jemni and Ellghoul, 2007).	avatar (computing);mobile phone	Mohamed Jemni;Oussama El Ghoul;Nour Ben Yahia;Mehrez Boulares	2007			speakerphone;multimedia messaging service;phone;animation;videotelephony;hearing aid;sign language;multimedia;computer science	HCI	-48.191288718414995	-38.14435924390935	101338

We used an innovative binaural Neuromorphic Auditory Sensor to obtain spike rates similar to those generated by the inner hair cells of the human auditory system. The design of the component that obtains the interaural intensity difference is inspired by the lateral superior olive. The spike stream that represents the IID is used to turn a robotic platform towards the sound source direction. The architecture was implemented on FPGA devices using general purpose FPGA resources and was tested with pure tones (1-kHz, 2.5-kHz and 5-kHz sounds) with an average error of 2.32Â°. Our architecture demonstrates a potential practical application of sound localization for robots, and can be used to test paradigms for sound localization in the mammalian brain.	covox speech thing;real-time web;robot	Elena Cerezuela-Escudero;Fernando Perez-PeÃ±a;Rafael Paz-Vicente;Angel JimÃ©nez-Fernandez;Gabriel JimÃ©nez-Moreno;Arturo Morgado Estevez	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2017.12.041	computer vision;field-programmable gate array;architecture;robot;artificial intelligence;binaural recording;acoustic source localization;auditory system;mathematics;pattern recognition;sound localization;neuromorphic engineering	Robotics	-36.20211097863538	-42.88676895631738	101457

Applications of such a device include search and rescue, travel aid in large and complex buildings, museum guides among others where external localization information such as from a GPS is not available. However, WITU relies on human intelligence both to maintain long term consistency of its location estimates and to efficiently manage its limited memory and processing capacity. This alludes to a symbiotic relationship between the user and the device and here we look at this symbiotic relationship from an end user perspective. Thus, in order to have a successful interaction, we argue that the user needs to feel comfortable wearing the device while carrying out the intended tasks. We hypothesize that this perceived comfort is dependent on the context in which the device is used. We test our hypothesis on three different scenarios; search and rescue worker, dementia patient in a long care facility and a person at a party which acts as the baseline. Results indicate an important consequence for the development of such wearable robotic systems.	baseline (configuration management);global positioning system;internationalization and localization;map;robot;wearable computer	Damith Chandana Herath;Tawna Chapman;Alethea Tomkins;Larissa Elliott;Michelle David;Amy Cooper;Denis Burnham;Sarath Kodagoda	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181757	humanârobot interaction;robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-34.617350657653844	-41.70213971700288	101623

In this paper we present a VR system consisting on a low cost dataÂ¿glove and a hand/arm model as a tool for study presence and body ownership in VE. We present also a novel study of the RHI within highly dynamic VE sessions with synchronous pure virtual vibrotactile stimulation of the fingers. The hand/arm participantÂ¿s movements are realistically reproduced on the VE and tactile stimulations are self-inflicted by the participant through actively touching the virtual objects. The results of the proprioceptive drift and the response ratings of a questionnaire applied seem to reveal that the RHI is possible in active and fully multisensored VE sessions	interaction;sacral nerve stimulation;synthetic intelligence;translational drift;virtual body;virtual reality;wired glove	Silvia Pabon;Miguel A.

Recently, many 3-dimensional input devices were developed using various kinds of sensors, e.g., gyro-sensors, acceleration sensors, magnetic sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and image sensors, etc. We developed a ball type space mouse which use a web camera to sense the spatial position of the device and can give some vibro-tactile stimulation on the user's fingertip. By using a web camera, we tracked the ball(circle), covered with a certain color, as a marker. The diameter of the ball type mouse is 4cm, and all the circuits for controlling the vibro-tactile device and wireless communication with the host computer and a battery to supply the power are integrated in the ball.	computer;gyro;host (network);image sensor;input device;webcam	Dong-Jin Yoo;Ho-joong Yong;Jongwon Back;Tae-Jeong Jang	2007		10.1145/1280720.1280898	embedded system;three-dimensional space;computer vision;interaction;computer science;operating system;image sensor;ultrasonic sensor;input device;wireless	HCI	-42.70368877440118	-42.34850408906735	101733

In this paper, we propose a new method of rendering live football game on mobile phones using vibration. A mobile phone is ldquosynchronizedrdquo with the ball in the real field. By holding the phone, users are able to experience dynamic movements of the ball, to know attacking directions and which team is leading the attack. The usability test of our system shows that vibrotactile display is suitable for rendering live football information on mobile phones by adopting designed coding schemes with a right training process.	mobile phone;usability testing	Shafiq ur RÃ©hman;Jiong Sun;Li Liu;Haibo Li	2008	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2008.2001352	embedded system;computer vision;mobile search;simulation;usability;content analysis;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;vibration;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web	Mobile	-47.45354272496275	-42.33417073899541	101787
c1cbf78cb882ec8d036b42ccfe52082c0a7801ef	employing smartwatch for enhanced password authentication		This paper presents an enhanced password authentication scheme by systematically exploiting the motion sensors in a smartwatch. We extract unique features from the sensor data when a smartwatch bearer types his/her password (or PIN), and train certain machine learning classifiers using these features. We then implement smartwatch-aided password authentication using the classifiers. Our scheme is user-friendly since it does not require users to perform any additional actions when typing passwords or PINs other than wearing smartwatches. We conduct a user study involving 51 participants on the developed prototype so as to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Experimental results show that the best classifier for our system is the Bagged Decision Trees, for which the accuracy is 4.58% FRR and 0.12% FAR on the QWERTY keyboard, and 6.13% FRR and 0.16% FAR on the numeric keypad.	authentication;password;smartwatch	Bing Chang;Ximing Liu;Yingjiu Li;Pingjian Wang;Wen Tao Zhu;Zhan Wang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-60033-8_59	numeric keypad;password;typing;wearable technology;computer hardware;computer science;decision tree;smartwatch;distributed computing;password authentication protocol	Crypto	-37.42321401115408	-46.24481259254433	101918
ed5250ac64e89015c9df0f28a9a315854bf794b6	ani-bot: a modular robotics system supporting creation, tweaking, and usage with mixed-reality interactions		Ani-Bot is a modular robotics system that allows users to control their DIY robots using Mixed-Reality Interaction (MRI). This system takes advantage of MRI to enable users to visually program the robot through the augmented view of a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). In this paper, we first explain the design of the Mixed-Reality (MR) ready modular robotics system, which allows users to instantly perform MRI once they finish assembling the robot. Then, we elaborate the augmentations provided by the MR system in the three primary phases of a construction kit's lifecycle: Creation, Tweaking, and Usage. Finally, we demonstrate Ani-Bot with four application examples and evaluate the system with a two-session user study. The results of our evaluation indicate that Ani-Bot does successfully embed MRI into the lifecycle (Creation, Tweaking, Usage) of DIY robotics and that it does show strong potential for delivering an enhanced user experience.	coherence (physics);head-mounted display;interaction;mixed reality;robotics;self-reconfiguring modular robot;tweaking;usability testing;user experience;video game bot	Yuanzhi Cao;Zhuangying Xu;Terrell Glenn;Ke Huo;Karthik Ramani	2018		10.1145/3173225.3173226	computer science;humanâcomputer interaction;mixed reality;self-reconfiguring modular robot;robot;user experience design;tweaking;user interface;humanârobot interaction;robotics;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-43.46499618945709	-38.2224734412452	102066

In the experimental task, participants were asked to virtually navigate (within two consecutive sessions), from a starting point to a destination location, across a spatial configuration consisting in three successive corridors (AâC). In the first session, all corridors were non-aversive. In the second session, the corridor B contained an aversive stimulation (i.e., fire, smokescreen, and warning alarm). Fourteen participants were involved in the experiment. Self-reported anxiety and affective states were measured at the end of each session. However, movement indicators (i.e., execution, time, average speed, speed and trajectory variability) were recorded on-line during the experiment. Results showed a significant increased (i) level of self-reported negative affects and state-anxiety between the two sessions, and (ii) speed and trajectory variability between the two sessions, while the participants were in corridor B. In conclusion, these results support the experimental validity of virtual reality for the induction of negative affects and state-anxiety. The relationships between reported negative affects and state-anxiety and behavior are discussed. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This device, called the Number Wheel, was developed for interactive control of highly dynamic three-dimensional displays but is not limited to this use: It is a general purpose valuator device. The implementation of the Number Wheel described here is based upon a digitizer tablet as the physical input device.  The character of the Number Wheel is best explained by developing an analogy with a hypothetical physical device. The Number Wheel can be thought of as a wheel which has a portion of its circumference, or tread, protruding through a slot on the surface of the tablet, somewhat like a giant thumb wheel. Each value in the desired range of the valuator is represented by a point on the circumference of the wheel with the value of the device at any given time being the point at the top of the wheel. The valuator is changed by putting the pen on the wheel where it protrudes through the tablet and moving it back or forth in the direction of rotation. Whenever the pen leaves the rim of the wheel while still moving, the Number Wheel maintains the same speed of rotation until the pen returns to the wheel in order to change or stop its movement.	graphical user interface;graphics tablet;input device;peripheral;tablet computer	Robert W.

Navigation systems shift the focus from printed maps to interactive systems. The key goal of navigation systems is to simplify specific tasks, e.g. route planning or route following. While users of navigation systems need less skills in navigation specific activities, e.g. reading maps or manual route planning, they must now interact with the user interface of the navigation device, which requires a different set of skills. Current navigation systems aim to simplify the interaction by providing interfaces that use basic interaction mechanisms (e.g. button based interfaces on a touch-screen), exploiting the fact that many users are already familiar with such techniques. In the presentation of the information most navigation systems employ map-like displays, possibly combined with additional information, again to exploit familiarity. While such an approach can help with early adoption, it can also limit usefulness and usability. There is, however, a large opportunity to improve input, output and functionality of navigation systems. In this paper we expand a model of classical map based communication to identify possibilities where """"dynamic maps"""" can enhance map based communication in navigation systems. We report on how an agile design exploration process was applied to examine the design space spanned by the new model and to develop system probes. We discuss the user feedback and its implications for future interface concepts for navigation systems."""	agile software development;map;user interface	Volker Paelke;Karsten Nebe	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02580-8_19	turn-by-turn navigation;input/output;computer vision;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;specific activity;user interface;mobile robot navigation;difference set	Robotics	-47.11659372564273	-42.009450206534964	102734

We implement an illustrator search system based on user impression categories. The impressions of illustrators are estimated from clues in the crowdsourced social-tag annotations on their illustrations. We evaluated our system in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain and found that using feedback on motifs and impressions for illustrations of relevant illustrators improved illustrator search by 11%.	crowdsourcing;flickr;sequence motif;social media;social network	Yohei Seki;Kiyoto Miyajima	2013		10.1145/2484028.2484133	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-33.99113475668267	-48.63028727570215	102839

Individuals had to perform several ob-ject manipulations (peg-in-hole, narrow passage) in a virtual assembly scenario with three different collision feedback modalities (visual vs. vibrotactile vs. force feedback) and two different task complexities (small vs. large peg or wide vs. narrow passage, respectively). The feedback modalities were evaluated in terms of assembly performance (completion time, movement precision) and subjective user ratings. Altogether, results indicate that high resolution force feedback provided by a robotic arm as input device is superior in terms of movement precision, mental workload, and spatial orientation compared to vi-brotactile and visual feedback systems.	haptic technology	Bernhard Weber;Mikel Sagardia;Thomas Hulin;Carsten Preusche	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39405-8_28	computer vision;simulation;computer science;multimedia	Visualization	-45.26138081637589	-48.08353433591635	103360

The user face on the camera preview screen is reconstructed into a 3D face model and the model is transformed to blend shape model which represents the facial expression. This way, the system can precisely analyze the facial expression of the user. With target 3D face model appearing on the screen, the 3D face model changes its facial expression, it leads the user to change his facial expression to become look like same. The system recognizes whether the facial expression of the user is same with the one of 3D face model. As the system gives the various missions to user to change his facial expression, user can practice the facial expression. It can be used for bell's palsy patient who needs face rehabilitation exercise or someone who need to practice unique facial expression such as stewardess smile or facial mimicry.	bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;regular expression	Byung-Hwa Park;Se-Young Oh	2015		10.1145/2814940.2814985	psychology;computer vision;facial action coding system;multimedia;communication;face hallucination	Vision	-38.7614039814252	-38.840487176926175	103551

Users hold the mobile device, which has an electro-tactile display attached at the back. When a finger touches the visual cues on the front screen panel, such as a button or an icon, the electro-tactile display at the back transmits the unique tactile sensation associated with this behavior of the cues to the palm of the hand. As a result, we speculate that the user can manipulate visual information with less visual attention, or even potentially in an eyes-free manner. In this paper we discuss the creation of this unique mobile device that allows the palm to be used for tactile feedback, thus enhancing the touch screen experience.	interaction;mobile device;simulation;touchscreen;usability testing	Shogo Fukushima;Hiroyuki Kajimoto	2011		10.1145/2076354.2076370	computer vision;engineering;multimedia;communication;display device	HCI	-46.12287446668935	-43.178404159919985	103675

An experiment was carried out with 40 participants who were asked to walk through a virtual street, which had virtual characters walking through it. The analysis of differences in participant responses at various stages of the experiment (baseline recordings, training, first half and second half of the urban simulation) is examined in detail. It was found that participants typically show a stress response during the training phase and a stress response towards the end of the simulation of the urban experience. The impact of realism on the reported presence was evaluated. The results suggest that the lowest presence was achieved with the higher fidelity characters but the less varied textures. There is some evidence also that variations in the level of visual realism based the texture strategy used was associated with changes in mental stress.	baseline (configuration management);simulation;urban computing	Andrea Brogni;Vinoba Vinayagamoorthy;Anthony Steed;Mel Slater	2007	IJVR		fight-or-flight response;simulation;index term;humanâcomputer interaction;experience design;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-46.80480685960146	-49.45521544702352	103869

Vection is known to be strong for peripheral vision stimulation and relatively weak for central vision. In this paper, the results of an experimental study of central linear vection with and without vibrotactile feet stimulation are presented. Three types of vibratory stimuli were used: a sinusoidal signal, pink noise, and a chirp signal. Six subjects faced a screen looking at a looming visual flow that suggested virtual forward motion. The results showed that the sensation of self-motion happened faster and its intensity was the strongest for sinusoidal vibrations at constant frequency. For some subjects, a vibrotactile stimulus with an increasing frequency (a chirp) elicited as well a stronger vection. The strength of sensation of self-motion was the lowest in the cases when pink noise vibrations and no vibrotactile stimulation accompanied the visual flow stimulation.

Their popularity has encouraged an ongoing invention of decoding methods. Barcodes can be categorized into 2 main groups, namely one-dimension (1D) barcodes at which information is stored horizontally and two-dimension (2D) barcodes which contain information in both vertical and horizontal direction, promising a higher storage capacity compared to 1D barcodes. Despite high data density, an amount of information obtained in 2D barcodes still limited to some extent. This study selected QR Code (Quick Response Code) is a type of 2D barcode because firstly, it can handle a variety of information. Secondly, decoding is reasonably straightforward. Finally, the structure of QR code is specified clearly by its developer. This research aimed to increase QR Code capacity by proposing a color Quick Response Code (color QR code) encoding concept which can hold a larger amount of information than that of the traditional black and white QR Code regarding their physical size. A two-color (black and white) QR Code can store 1 bit in each module only, whereas a module of a color QR code with sixteen different colors can contain 4-bit data. In order to decode a color QR code, this study used a code reader equipped with at least an 8-megapixel camera and a decoding application was developed on Android (Android application on mobile phone) and Java (Java application on PC) platform.	1-bit architecture;4-bit;android;areal density (computer storage);barcode;categorization;color;decoding methods;java;mobile phone;qr code	Nutchanad Taveerad;Sartid Vongpradhip	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)	10.1109/SITIS.2015.42	embedded system;computer hardware;computer science;computer graphics (images)	SE	-39.86754368261532	-40.15785785340927	104094
72fa2caed386e3ad95bb8a9988f918f5e7c8767e	a new gesture control for zooming on tablets and smartphones for visually impaired people		We propose a new interaction model for zooming in and out the screen content of smartphones and tablets for visually impaired people. It consists in gestures that are captured by the front-facing camera to control the zooming factor and to scroll in the zoomed-in image. A first prototype involving video processing has been developed. As it avoids using a hand to touch the screen, this interaction model is interesting for other mobile applications. Human factor study and tests has been performed on visually impaired people and operators using assistance with augmented reality on tablets.	smartphone;tablet computer	Nicolas Girard;Salma CherkÃ©;HÃ©lÃ¨ne Soubaras;Kees Nieuwenhuis	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94274-2_49	gesture recognition;video processing;operator (computer programming);computer vision;interaction model;augmented reality;zoom;gesture;artificial intelligence;computer science	HCI	-44.806112767110974	-42.19277620300504	104406
a0bff6eeaf915fbc363951113435f6ccca6fb763	auditory self-motion simulation is facilitated by haptic and vibrational cues suggesting the possibility of actual motion	individualized binaural recordings;vibrations;higher level cognitive influences;virtual reality;spatial sound;motion perception;human factors;cue integration;auditory vection;situation awareness;hrtf;circular vection;self motion simulation;self motion illusions;psychophysics	Sound fields rotating around stationary blindfolded listeners sometimes elicit auditory circular vection, the illusion that the listener is physically rotating. Experiment 1 investigated whether auditory circular vection depends on participants' situational awareness of âmovability,â that is, whether they sense/know that actual motion is possible or not. While previous studies often seated participants on movable chairs to suspend the disbelief of self-motion, it has never been investigated whether this does, in fact, facilitate auditory vection. To this end, 23 blindfolded participants were seated on a hammock chair with their feet either on solid ground (âmovement impossibleâ) or suspended (âmovement possibleâ) while listening to individualized binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating synchronously at 60Â°/s. Although participants never physically moved, situational awareness of movability facilitated auditory vection. Moreover, adding slight vibrations like the ones resulting from actual chair rotation increased the frequency and intensity of vection. Experiment 2 extended these findings and showed that nonindividualized binaural recordings were as effective in inducing auditory circular vection as individualized recordings. These results have important implications both for our theoretical understanding of self-motion perception and for the applied field of self-motion simulations, where vibrations, nonindividualized binaural sound, and the cognitive/perceptual framework of movability can typically be provided at minimal cost and effort.	binaural beats;haptic technology;motion simulator;movable type;simulation;stationary process	Bernhard E.

Our previous findings indicate that the pulse frequency determines the effective generation of the kinesthetic illusion of being pulled. However, whether pulse frequency or pulse width for force perception has not been clarified. If the pulse width is more dominant, the force sensation induced by sequential pulses will be more continuous. This is important because many of those who have experienced the asymmetric oscillation pointed out that the force sensation induced by the stimuli was not felt smoothly compared to physical force. This paper describes the design and development of a new multicylinder-like mechanism for generating sequential pulses, which should enable us to determine which is dominant for force perception.	pulse generator;smoothing	Tomohiro Amemiya;Taro Maeda	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69057-3_75	psychology;computer vision;simulation;communication	Crypto	-45.57412435497625	-50.74103749809577	104567

Three wearable orientation interfaces were developed and evaluated toward this purpose: a stereophonic sonic guide (sonic âcarrotâ), speech output, and shoulder-tapping system. Street crossing was used as a critical test setting in which to evaluate these interfaces. The shoulder-tapping system was found most universally usable. Considering the great variety of co-morbidities within this population, the authors concluded that a combined tapping/speech interface would provide usability and flexibility to the greatest number of people under the widest range of environmental conditions.	usability;wearable computer	David A.

Spatial visualization is the ability to mentally transform complex stimuli in space. However, this ability declines with human age, resulting in spatial problems in oneâs normal life. Based on the fact that AR interface can reduce cognitive load and provide correct spatial information, we are devoted to designing an AR spatial visualization training system for older adults to use. The system consists of a manual controller and a visualization training task. In the process of manual controller design, think aloud experiment is adopted to generate intuitive manipulation, and morphological analysis is used to evaluate the most elderly-friendly controller. In the process of training task design, by analyzing spatial training factors, a new visualization training task is designed. In the process of AR integration, the system is implemented by Qualcomm AR in Unity3D with Vuforia protal, and the final AR based spatial visualization ability training system is completed.	augmented reality;controller (computing);mixed reality;think aloud protocol;unity	Randall Shumaker;Stephanie Lackey	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21067-4	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;engineering;multimedia	Visualization	-47.3771371310703	-49.34927051956967	104759

It can seamlessly extend outdoor GPS tracking to the indoor environment. In a novel manner, fluorescent light is used as the medium to transmit information, which is encoded by using a pulse-frequency modulation technique. The user receives the encoded light information through a photo-receiver. The information is passed into the wearable or mobile computer after the data is decoded. This information allows positioning information to be given to indoor mobile and wearable computers. We design an economical transmitter circuit by adding few components to a commercial electronic ballast circuit for fluorescent lamps with price of less than US $10. The propose system can be used in indoor guidance and navigation applications. Exemplary applications are included in the paper, with experimented results detailed.	electrical ballast;gps tracking unit;global positioning system;humanâcomputer interaction;mobile computing;modulation;transmitter;wearable computer	Adrian David Cheok;Yue Li	2007	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-007-0140-9	embedded system;augmented reality;navigation;pulse-frequency modulation;wearable computer;humanâcomputer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;operating system	Mobile	-44.56579987107938	-41.45424917831596	104907

Gradients were particularly effective when they spanned the low end of the intensity range. This trend likely reflects saturation of the device's rendering capabilities at high intensities, as confirmed by measurements with a manual linear tribometer. The results show promise for use of gradients rendered with variable friction displays to aid non-visual navigation on tablets.	experiment;image gradient;machine vision	Roberta L.

The current case study explored conditions such learning can occur. An experienced human observer watched computer generated graphical simulations of randomly shaped hyper-tetrahedrons and made judgments about the Euclidean distance between two of the vertices in four-dimensional space. The geometric objects were displayed using a slicing technique with the objects either translating along the w-axis or rotating along the wx-plane, or using a projection technique. The results showed that learning four-dimensional objects for distance judgment does not require active manipulation of the objects and can be achieved through various display techniques.	apache axis;computer graphics;display device;euclidean distance;graphical user interface;randomness;simulation;virtual reality	Ranxiao Frances Wang	2009	2009 Fourth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology	10.1109/FCST.2009.93	computer vision;simulation;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;euclidean distance;virtual reality	Visualization	-43.29329894601574	-48.83254259763774	105399

Although SDG is simple in concept, there are surprisingly many problems in how interactions within SDG are managed. One problem is the potential for interference, where one person can raise an interface component (such as a menu or dialog box) in a way that hinders what another person is doing i.e., by obscuring another personâs working area that happens to be underneath the raised component. We propose transparent interface components as one possible solution to interference: while one person can raise and interact with the component, others can see through it and can continue to work underneath it. To test this concept, we first implemented a simple SDG game using both opaque and transparent SDG menus. Through a controlled experiment, we then analysed how interference affects peoplesâ performance across an opaque and transparent menu condition: a solo condition (where a person played alone) acts as our control. Our results show that the transparent menu did lessen the effect of interference, and that SDG players overwhelmingly preferred it to opaque menus.	collaborative software;experiment;input device;interaction;interference (communication);structure of observed learning outcome;widget (gui);dialog	Ana Zanella;Saul Greenberg	2001		10.1007/0-306-48019-0_18	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;communication;world wide web;input device	HCI	-46.614727478104534	-38.46143554236117	105618

Viewing conditions like the convergence-accommodation (C-A) conflict have an unnatural influence on the visual system and might even lead to visual discomfort. As visual perception is individual we assumed the impact of simulated 3D content on the visual system to be as well. In this study we aimed to analyze the stereoscopic visual performance of 17 subjects for disparities inside and outside the in literature defined zone of comfortable viewing to provide an individual evaluation of the impact of increased disparities on the performance of the visual system. Stereoscopic stimuli were presented in a four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) setup in different disparities. The response times as well as the correct decision rates indicated the performance of stereoscopic vision. The results showed that increased disparities lead to a decline in performance. Further, the impact of the presented disparities is dependent on the difficulty of the task. The decline of performance as well as the deciding disparities for the decline were subject dependent.	color vision;stereo display;stereopsis;stereoscopy	Jan Paulus;Georg Michelson;Marcus Barkowsky;Joachim Hornegger;Bjoern M.

The evaluation involved estimating the perceived weight of a virtual avatar seen from a first person perspective, as well as the suitability of the sound effect relative to the context. The results show significant differences for three cases between the presentation formats, both for weight estimates and suitability ratings over all variations of the footstep sound design. The remaining 15 comparisons each for both weight estimates and suitability ratings were not significant.

The mobile nature of MAR applications limits usersâ interaction capabilities such as inputs, and haptic feedbacks. This survey reviews current research issues in the area of human computer interaction for MAR and haptic devices. The survey first presents human sensing capabilities and their applicability in AR applications. We classify haptic devices into two groups according to the triggered sense: cutaneous/tactile: touch, active surfaces, and mid-air; kinesthetic: manipulandum, grasp, and exoskeleton. Due to the mobile capabilities of MAR applications, we mainly focus our study on wearable haptic devices for each category and their AR possibilities. To conclude, we discuss the future paths that haptic feedbacks should follow for MAR applications and their challenges.	a/ux;augmented reality;ecosystem;haptic technology;human computer;humanâcomputer interaction;software deployment;wearable computer;wearable technology	Carlos Bermejo;Pan Hui	2017	CoRR		multimedia;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;haptic technology;computer-mediated reality;wearable computer;augmented reality;grasp;kinesthetic learning	HCI	-48.00912053073046	-41.37984851939109	105753

Second was a mobile phone application that allowed people to customise color and responsive behaviours in the overhead lighting system. Third was ambient lighting, responding to wind velocity. The study extends the discussion on multiuser interaction design in public lighting by asking: how can interactions using mobile phones, thermal tracking and wind inputs afford new social behaviors, without disturbing the usual public functions of street lighting? This research lays foundational work on the affordances of mobile phones for engagement and interaction with public lighting. The study indicates the use of personal phones as a tool for interaction in this setting has potential to provide a stronger ownership to urban place.	interaction design;mobile app;mobile phone;multi-user;overhead (computing);the wall street journal;velocity (software development)	Esben Skouboe Poulsen;Ann Morrison;Hans JÃ¸rgen Andersen;Ole Bjarlin Jensen	2013		10.1145/2493190.2493218	experiment;simulation;mobile interaction;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;interaction design;lighting;multimedia;smart lighting	HCI	-47.04993039918075	-39.7285149593494	106074

The free-viewpoint video is generated by multiple 4K resolution cameras in sport games such as soccer and american football. This method can provide us a player's perspective. We adopt a billboard method to make a free-viewpoint video which is consisted of multiple textures accoding to user specified viewpoint. For implementing the program and displaying images effectively we used a game development system, a HMD and a game controller that user can operate their own views in the high degree of freedom.

Especially for short intermittent interactions many users therefore choose to use their bare fingers. Although convenient, this increases targeting times and error rates. We argue that the main reasons are the occlusion of the target by the user's finger and ambiguity about which part of the finger defines the selection point. We propose a pointing technique we call Shift that is designed to address these issues. When the user touches the screen, Shift creates a callout showing a copy of the occluded screen area and places it in a non-occluded location. The callout also shows a pointer representing the selection point of the finger. Using this visual feedback, users guide the pointer into the target by moving their finger on the screen surface and commit the target acquisition by lifting the finger. Unlike existing techniques, Shift is only invoked when necessary--over large targets no callout is created and users enjoy the full performance of an unaltered touch screen. We report the results of a user study showing that with Shift participants can select small targets with much lower error rates than an unaided touch screen and that Shift is faster than Offset Cursor for larger targets.	conditional (computer programming);dos;hidden surface determination;interaction;lambda lifting;microsoft research;personal digital assistant;pointer (computer programming);privilege escalation;raman scattering;software deployment;stylus (computing);touchscreen;usability testing	Daniel Vogel;Patrick Baudisch	2007		10.1145/1240624.1240727	computer vision;humanâcomputer interaction;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;mobile device;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-46.240579134873904	-45.64347217040505	106592

Therefore, we aimed to construct a unified 3D CG space, that is, a unified 3D geometric modeling system. As for the basic coding method, """"Extended Geometry Scheme"""" is proposed. By using this scheme, we have realized the 3D CG space with unified structure. Another important aspect of the space-shared communication is the development of teleoperation using robots on networks. It is important that 3D images are displayed naturally without wrong feeling in such real operation space. We have developed a 3D image display method using the parallax and focus function of human's eyes simultaneously. The proposed 3D display method is a combination of real image generation by Fresnel lens and parallax display with stereoscopic glasses.

We explore how touch contact areas, such as lines generated by flat fingers, can be used to increase input expressivity in these diminutive systems in three ways. Firstly, we present four design themes that emerged from an ideation workshop in which five designers proposed concepts for smartwatch touch area interaction. Secondly, we describe a sensor unit and study that captured user performance with 31 area touches and contrasted this against standard targeting performance. Finally, we describe three demonstration applications that instantiate ideas from the workshop and deploy the most reliably and rapidly produced area touches. We report generally positive user reactions to these demonstrators: the area touch interactions were perceived as quick, convenient and easy to learn and remember. Together this work characterizes how designers can use area touches in watch UIs, which area touches are most appropriate and how users respond to this interaction style.	android;apple watch;application programming interface;bespoke;ecology;expressive power (computer science);interaction;machine learning;next-generation network;operating system;sensor;smartwatch;theme (computing);typical set;warez	Ian Oakley;Carina Lindahl;Khanh Le;Doyoung Lee;Md.

This system provides images inputted from a stereo camera head not only to the processor but also to the userâs sight as binocular wide-angle foveated (WAF) information, thus it is applicable for Virtual Reality (VR) systems such as tele-existence or training experts. The stereo camera head plays a role to get required input images foveated by special wide-angle optics under camera view direction control and 3D head mount display (HMD) displays fused 3D images to the user. Moreover, an analog video signal processing device much inspired from a structure of the human visual system realizes a unique way to provide WAF information to plural processors and the user. Therefore, this developed vision system is also much expected to be applicable for the human brain and vision research, because the design concept is to mimic the human visual system. Further, an algorithm to generate features using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for binocular fixation in order to provide well-fused 3D images to 3D HMD is proposed. This paper examines influences of applying this algorithm to space variant images such as WAF images, based on experimental results.	algorithm;binocular vision;central processing unit;computer stereo vision;discrete fourier transform;feature selection;head-mounted display;machine vision;sensor;shroud of the avatar:;signal processing;stereo camera;television;virtual reality;waf	Sota Shimizu;Shinsuke Shimojo;Hao Jiang;Joel W.

For example, the system interface has been shown to associate positively with overall levels of user satisfaction. However, little is known about how the interfaces can constitute the user experience and the social interactions. In this paper, I plan to propose a visual diversity-enhanced interface that supports the user to inspect and control the multi-relevance recommendations. The goal is to let the users explore the different relevance prospects of recommended items in parallel and to stress their diversity. Two preliminary user studies with real-life tasks were conducted to compare the visual interface to a standard ranked list interface. The usersÂ» subjective evaluations show significant improvement in many metrics. I further show that the users explored a diverse set of recommended items while experiencing an increase in overall user satisfaction. A user-centered evaluation was used to reveal the mediating effects between the subjective and objective conceptual components. The future plans are discussed to extend the current findings.	agi-plan;computer user satisfaction;interaction;real life;recommender system;relevance;usability testing;user experience;user-centered design	Chun-Hua Tsai	2018		10.1145/3176349.3176357	computer science;recommender system;user control;information retrieval;data mining;user experience design;ranking	HCI	-36.87130326599125	-51.716546601731174	107560

A well-known issue is interpreting the map's geocentric content, which is known to become prone to errors when the map is not aligned to the environment. In this paper we report our investigation of providing a cue about the destination's location from an egocentric perspective in order to improve the interpretation of the map. We used a vibrotactile belt to continuously indicate a destination's direction relative to the user's orientation. In an outdoor field study we compared the performance of map-based navigation with and without the added tactile cue. We found evidence that people take shorter routes, consult the map less often, and were less often disoriented with the tactile cue. Furthermore, females found the tactile cue more useful and used it more often.	belt machine;field research;map	Martin Pielot;Niels Henze;Susanne Boll	2009		10.1145/1613858.1613888	computer vision;simulation;field research	HCI	-44.50952770548759	-45.67890066305169	107793

VM is a technique that combines multiple 2D views of a 3D scene into a single composite image by overlaying views onto virtual mirrors. Given multiple views of a scene, one view is augmented with the remaining views by placing virtual mirrors on the first view and overlaying onto them the corresponding remaining views. Unlike a standard array presentation, where 2D views are not integrated and simply placed adjacent to one another, the VM presentation preserves the relative location, orientation, and scale between views. As such, it is our contention that humans will fare better at performing certain visual tasks, such as scene identification, when viewing a 3D scene via a VM presentation than when viewing an array presentation. We performed an experiment on 12 participants, where participants were required to identify 96 scenes both with a VM and an array presentation and we compared their % correctness and response times. Moreover, we studied the effects of adding an auditory attentional load on performance. We found that regardless of load, participants were able to identify scenes using VM presentation with greater accuracy and at greater speeds.	auditory processing disorder;correctness (computer science);disk mirroring;standard array	Carmen E.

In order to make autonomous vehicles more familiar with the public, it is necessary to develop not only advanced auto driving control but also comfortable environments for the passengers. This paper proposes our trial to improve comfort of passengers on autonomous vehicles. We developed an experimental vehicle equipping Mixed Reality (MR) display system which aims to reduce anxiety using visual factors. Our proposed system visualizes a road surface that is out of the passenger's field of view by projecting the see-through image on the dashboard. Moreover, it overlays the computer graphics of the wheel trajectories on the displayed image using MR so that the passengers can easily confirm the auto driving control is working correctly. The displayed images enable passengers to comprehend the road condition and the expected vehicle route out of the passenger's field of view.

Controlling the burst frequency according to measured rubbing motion, reality of the displayed sensation can be enhanced. In this paper, we proposed a transparent tactile display.

Effectively evaluating optical see-through (OST) head-mounted display (HMD) calibration is problematic and largely relies on feedback from the user. Studies evaluating OST HMD calibration, such as those by McGarrity, Tang, and Navab et al. [2, 3, 1], utilize user interaction methods, such as touch pads, to facilitate on-line evaluation and correction of calibration results. In all of these studies, however, only the users themselves receive any visual feedback related to the calibration quality or the corrective actions taken to improve it. In this video, we present the use of standard frustum visualization to provide calibration quality information to the researcher in real time. We use a standard Single Point Active Alignment Method (SPAAM) calibration, [4], after which both the eye location estimate and resulting intrinsic values are displayed superimposed onto the user. Presenting the eye position relative to the user's head benefits studies on system error sources, and rendering on-screen visuals also allows outside observers to identify calibration issues and offer corrective suggestions. We believe that techniques, such as frustum visualization, will expand the amount of information available for evaluating calibration results, and will greatly aid those investigating new and improved calibration procedures.	frustum;head-mounted display;online and offline	Kenneth R.

Their interaction with search engines differ from high-literate users on strategies used, perception, communication and performance. In order to improve search engines and create solutions, we need to understand these users' needs. This research aimed to identify how search engine features influence the interaction of low-literate users. We analyzed the interaction of ten users through user tests that were part of a case study. Based on a limited set of features of a specific search engine, we identified what features were used, the perception about them and some barriers faced by these users. This study led to a list of recommendations for the development of search interfaces focused on low-literate users.	accessibility;web search engine	DÃ©bora Maurmo Modesto;Simone Bacellar Leal Ferreira;Aline da Silva Alves	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39265-8_36	metasearch engine;spamdexing;multimedia;search analytics;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	HCI	-35.05574709452453	-52.07733438632153	108770

The novelty of the system lies in the fact that users can see and use their real hands - by means of a Kinect-like camera mounted on the HMD - in order to naturally interact with the virtual objects. Our working hypothesis are that the introduction of the photorealistic capture of users' hands in a coherently rendered virtual scenario induces in them a strong feeling of presence and embodiment without the need of using a synthetic 3D modelled avatar as a representation of the self. We also argue that the users' ability of grasping and manipulating virtual objects using their own hands not only provides an intuitive interaction experience, but also improves self-perception as well as the perception of the environment.	avatar (computing);head-mounted display;kinect;mixed reality;synthetic intelligence	Franco Tecchia;Giovanni Avveduto;Marcello Carrozzino;Raffaello Brondi;Massimo Bergamasco;Leila Alem	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)	10.1109/ISMAR.2014.6948466	immersive technology;computer vision;computer-mediated reality;computer science;mixed reality;multimedia;immersion;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-43.37912700079392	-38.02788798703092	108984

It learns and interactively plays with a user in the user's style. Music-generation systems have traditionally belonged to one of two categories: interactive systems in which players trigger musical phrases, events, or effects, such as the Karma musical workstation, and systems such as Risset's interactive piano, which allow for user input such as keystrokes or chords, but can't learn and use preprogrammed musical styles. Most of these systems propose musical effects libraries (a term used in the Karma workstation meaning a generation of music material based on user input). Although some of these effects are musically impressive, these systems can't be considered cybernetic musicians or even musical companions, because they use preprogrammed reactions and have no memory or facility for evolving.	cns disorder;categories;cybernetics;event (computing);interaction;interactivity;jam;libraries;phrases;side effect (computer science);software design;workstation	FranÃ§ois Pachet	2004	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/MCG.2004.1255806	new interfaces for musical expression;computer vision;simulation;cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;music;multimedia;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-36.072956322435374	-43.76451502144533	109117

Through followup experiments in multiple locales, we have verified that the key factor enabling this distance perception accuracy is fact of co-location, rather than any particular characteristics of the physical environment [1].One possible interpretation of these intriguing results is that observers are better enabled to make accurate judgments of egocentric distance in an IVE when they are when they are cognitively 'immersed' or 'present' in the IVE -- i.e. when they readily accept the virtual environment as being 'equivalent' to the real world and are therefore prepared to act in the virtual world in the same way that they act in the real world [3]. However, another interpretation is also possible: it could be that people are able to make accurate judgments of egocentric distances in a virtual environment when they know that it exactly corresponds to a recently viewed real environment because they are able to form a metrically accurate mental model of the spatial structure of the real environment from their brief exposure to it, so that when they are subsequently presented with the virtual environment they simply calibrate their mental model of distances in the IVE to be consistent with their remembered model of the corresponding real environment.In order to disambiguate between the 'presence' hypothesis and the 'spatial memory' hypothesis, we conducted the following study. Using a between-subjects design, we asked observers to make judgments of egocentric distance via blind walking in a real room and in one of three different virtual models, each of which was described to the participants as representing a """"high fidelity virtual model of that same room"""". However, only one of the virtual models was actually an identical match in size to the real room. Nine of our 23 participants viewed a virtual model in which each of the walls had been surreptitiously moved 3 ft inward towards the center of the room, and another nine viewed a virtual model in which each of the walls had been surreptitiously moved 3.75 ft outwards from the center of the room. In each case, the textures were touched up in Photoshop to effect the changes without scaling anything. The remaining 5 participants viewed the same sized virtual model, replicating our earlier study. Acoustic cues were muffled for all participants by a radio playing static, and no training or feedback was given at any time.If the 'presence' hypothesis holds, we would either expect that the performance of participants in each group would be about the same, or that distances would be slightly underestimated in each of the artificially manipulated rooms. However, if the 'spatial memory' hypothesis holds, then we would expect that distance judgments would tend to deviate in opposite directions in the smaller and larger rooms, relative to the in the same room: participants who experience the smaller virtual room should overestimate distances in the virtual environment, and participants who experience the larger room should underestimate distances in the virtual environment, relative to in the real room.Figure 1 shows the three virtual environments used in this study, and figure 2 shows the average relative error in the distance judgments made by each participant in each virtual environment (vertical axis), compared to their error in the real environment (horizontal axis). We can see that most participants who experienced the accurately sized virtual room made distance judgments that were nearly equivalent in the real and virtual environments, consistent with our earlier findings [2]. However, many of the participants who experienced the smaller room model, and nearly all of the participants who experienced the larger room model, judged distances to be shorter, on average, in the virtual world than in the real world. These trends are statistically significant, and seem to support the 'presence' hypothesis more strongly than the 'remembered size' hypothesis."""	3d modeling;acoustic cryptanalysis;adobe photoshop;apache axis;approximation error;direct inward dial;expect;experiment;image scaling;memory management;mental model;virtual reality;virtual world	Brian Ries;Victoria Interrante;Lee Anderson;Jason Lindquist	2006		10.1145/1179622.1179841	computer vision;simulation;field of view;computer science;optical flow;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-44.06902591276189	-49.25539033178668	109181

The nose position along with the mouth status (close/open) is detected by the proposed algorithm to control and navigate the cursor as computer user input. The algorithm is based on an improved Randomized Decision Tree, which is capable of detecting the facial information efficiently and accurately. A more comfortable user experience is achieved by mapping the nose motion to the cursor motion via a nonlinear function. The infrared depth camera enables the system to be independent of illumination and color changes both from the background and on human face, which is a critical advantage over RGB camera-based options. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms existing assistive technologies in terms of quantitative and qualitative assessments.	assistive technology;cursor (databases);decision tree;evaluation procedure;fm broadcasting;humanâcomputer interaction;interface device component;nonlinear system;quadriplegia;randomized algorithm;self-help devices;sensor;user (computing);user experience	Zhen-Peng Bian;Junhui Hou;Lap-Pui Chau;Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann	2016	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2015.2412125	computer vision;simulation;informatics	Robotics	-42.54269042954626	-46.12470820413386	109345
6418e99945eab2a7f14c8861b3c28b83b6cfd2c4	a single layer 3-d touch sensing system for mobile devices application		Touch sensing has been widely implemented as a main methodology to bridge human and machine interactions. The traditional touch sensing range is 2-D and therefore limits the user experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3-D contactless touch sensing called Airtouch system, which improves user experience by remotely detecting single/multi-finger position. A single layer touch panel with triangle-shaped electrodes is proposed to achieve multitouch detection capability as well as manufacturing cost reduction. Moreover, an oscillator-based-capacitive touch sensing circuit is implemented as the sensing hardware with the bootstrapping technique to eliminate the interchannel coupling effects. To further improve the system accuracy, a grouping algorithm is proposed to group the useful channelsâ data and filter out hardware noise impact. Finally, improved algorithms are proposed to eliminate the fringing capacitance effect and achieve accurate finger position estimation. EM simulation proved that the proposed algorithm reduced the maximum systematic error by 11 dB in the horizontal position detection. The proposed system consumes 2.3 mW and is fully compatible with existing mobile device environments. A prototype is built to demonstrate that the system can successfully detect finger movement in a vertical direction up to 6 cm and achieve a horizontal resolution up to 0.6 cm at 1 cm finger-height. As a new interface for human and machine interactions, this system offers great potential in finger movement detection and gesture recognition for small-sized electronics and advanced human interactive games for mobile device.	algorithm;apple watch;capacitive sensing;contactless smart card;electronic circuit;gesture recognition;humanâcomputer interaction;interaction;mobile device;multi-touch;prototype;sensor;simulation;smart tv;tiny basic;touchscreen;user experience;wearable technology;xslt/muenchian grouping	Li Du;Chun-Chen Liu;Yan Zhang;Yilei Li;Yuan Du;Yen-Cheng Kuan;Mau-Chung Frank Chang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2017.2702630	electronics;computer science;network layer;gesture recognition;electronic engineering;horizontal position representation;bootstrapping;mobile device;touchscreen;communication channel	Mobile	-42.613356792555976	-41.711509236897086	109555

We also discuss results with respect to breadth (number of menu items) and depth (top-level and child menus). Standard ray pointing was usually faster than PAM, especially in second-level (child) menus, but error rates were lower for PAM in some cases. Subjective ratings were higher for ray-casting. Pie menus performed better than list layouts.

b1e765d1f7d74004950e4c0dbb33d3c95ea4b596	computer simulated tests for lever controls with circular displays	indexing terms;computer simulation	Using computer simulated tests, this study examined direction-of-motion stereotypes and response times for different configurations of lever controls and circular displays. Quantitative measures of the strength and reversibility of stereotypes were used to analyze the effects of pointer position, direction of turn instruction, and control plane on movement compatibility. The results showed that strong and significantly reversible stereotypes were obtained for horizontal and vertical levers, at the 12 and 9 oâclock pointer positions, respectively. Response times were generally longer when there were no clear movement stereotypes. In the analysis of contributions of component principles to overall stereotypes, the results were explained in terms of a number of common control operating principles. Based on the experimental findings, recommendations for check reading or resetting purposes are that the pointer should be placed at 12 and 9 oâclock positions for the horizontal and vertical levers, respectively. Both the levers and the display should be positioned in the frontal plane. Due to weak response preferences and low reversibility, vertical and horizontal levers were found not suitable for use with other control/display configurations tested here. This study provided useful design guidance for improving the design of control panels used in person-machine interfaces.	computer simulation;control plane;plugboard;pointer (computer programming)	W.

The participants were to evaluate without any training the meaning of each presented stimuli using three response options: âaccelerate your speedâ, âkeep your speed constantâ, and âdecelerate your speedâ. Participants rated also how emotionally pleasant and arousing the different stimulations were. The results showed that the stimuli were predominantly perceived analogously with the vibration frequency modulation. The best stimuli represented âaccelerate your speedâ, âkeep your speed constantâ, and âdecelerate your speedâ information in accuracies of 88, 100, and 79 %, respectively. Stimulations were experienced as more pleasant in the wrist compared to the chest location. Both ascending and descending stimulations were rated as more arousing than stimuli with constant frequency. Our results suggest that tactile stimulation could be used in real life mobile applications, for example, in sports to inform the users on how they should regulate their performance.	mobile app;modulation;real life;sawtooth (cellular automaton);waveform	Jani Lylykangas;Veikko Surakka;Jussi Rantala;Jukka Raisamo;Roope Raisamo;Esa Tuulari	2009		10.1145/1671011.1671024	psychology;simulation;communication;social psychology	HCI	-46.55658783786319	-50.43748001462571	110162

This system requires a smart phone from the user and a server. The smart phone captures and transmits images of the user facing forward to the server. The server processes the phone images to detect and describe 2D features by SURF and then matches them to the 2D features of the stored map images that include their corresponding 3D information of the building. After features are matched, Direct Linear Transform runs on a subset of correspondences to find a rough initial pose estimate and the LevenbergâMarquardt algorithm further refines the pose estimate to find a more optimal solution. With the estimated pose and the cameraâs intrinsic parameters, the location and orientation of the user are calculated using 3D location correspondence data stored for features of each image. Positional information is then transmitted back to the smart phone and communicated to the user via text-to-speech. This indoor guiding system uses efficient algorithms such as SURF, homographs, multi-view geometry, and 3D to 2D reprojection to solve a very unique problem that will benefit the visually impaired. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using a simple machine vision system design to accomplish a complex task and the potential of building a commercial product based on this design.	camera resectioning;download;guidance system;levenbergâmarquardt algorithm;machine vision;map projection;mobile device;mobile phone;prototype;requirement;router (computing);sensor;server (computing);smartphone;speech synthesis;speeded up robust features;systems design;virtual reality headset;wireless router	Dong Zhang;Dah-Jye Lee;Brandon Taylor	2013	Machine Vision and Applications	10.1007/s00138-013-0575-0	computer vision;simulation;pose;computer science;multimedia	Mobile	-38.78145469207831	-44.4412369356358	110305

A first prototype based on 16 nodes and 48 linkages with prismatic joints is presented. The SmartMesh can be embedded into a table, into walls, ceilings and floors. The resolution of the SmartMesh depends on the amount of nodes and the length of the linkages.

Designing devices that more closely match the limits of human perception will make them smaller, less expensive, and more useful. However, many device-centric perception thresholds have yet to be evaluated. To this end, three experiments were conducted, using one degree-of-freedom contact location feedback device in combination with a kinesthetic display, to provide a more explicit set of specifications for similar tactile-kinesthetic haptic devices. The first of these experiments evaluated the ability of humans to repeatedly localize tactile cues across the fingerpad. Subjects could localize cues to within 1.3 mm and showed bias toward the center of the fingerpad. The second experiment evaluated the minimum perceptible difference of backlash at the tactile element. Subjects were able to discriminate device backlash in excess of 0.46 mm on low-curvature models and 0.93 mm on high-curvature models. The last experiment evaluated the minimum perceptible difference of system delay between user action and device reaction. Subjects were able to discriminate delays in excess of 61 ms. The results from these studies can serve as the maximum (i.e., most demanding) device specifications for most tactile-kinesthetic haptic systems.	blinded;cns disorder;color layout descriptor;display device;experiment;haptic device component;haptic technology;large;millimeter per second;motion;offset binary;phase i/ii trial;repeatability;requirement;sensor;small;specification;tactile reflex epilepsy;velocity (software development)	Andrew J.

Needless to say, in any outdoor application, there is no escape from âbadâ weather. Ultimately, computer vision systems must include mechanisms that enable them to function (even if somewhat less reliably) in the presence of haze, fog, rain, hail and snow. We begin by studying the visual manifestations of different weather conditions. For this, we draw on what is already known about atmospheric optics. Next, we identify effects caused by bad weather that can be turned to our advantage. Since the atmosphere modulates the information carried from a scene point to the observer, it can be viewed as a mechanism of visual information coding. Based on this observation, we develop models and methods for recovering pertinent scene properties, such as threedimensional structure, from images taken under poor weather conditions. 1 Vision and the Atmosphere Virtually all work in vision is based on the premise that the observer is immersed in a transparent medium (air). It is assumed that light rays reflected by scene objects travel to the observer without attenuation or alteration. Under this assumption, the brightness of an image point depends solely on the brightness of a single point in the scene. Quite simply, existing vision sensors and algorithms have been created only to function on âclearâ days. A dependable vision system however must reckon with the entire spectrum of weather conditions, including, haze, fog, rain, hail and snow. The study of the interaction of light with the atmosphere (and hence weather) is widely known as atmospheric optics. Atmospheric optics lies at the heart of the most magnificent visual experiences known to man, including, the colors of sunrise and sunset, the blueness of the clear sky, and the rainbow (see[Minnaert, 1954]). The literature on this topic has been written over the past two centuries. A summary of where the subject as a whole stands would be too ambitious a pursuit. Instead, our objective will be to sieve out of this vast body of work, models of atmospheric optics that are of direct relevance to computational vision.

The authors thank Jan Koenderink of Utrecht University for pointers to early work on atmospheric optics. prominent sources of background material will be the works of McCartney[McCartney, 1976 ] and Middleton[Middleton, 1952] whose books, though dated, serve as excellent reviews of prior work. The key characteristics of light, such as its intensity and color, are altered by its interactions with the atmosphere. These interactions can be broadly classified into three categories, namely,scattering, absorptionandemission. Of these, scattering due to suspended particles is the most pertinent to us. As can be expected, this phenomenon leads to complex visual effects. So, at first glance, atmospheric scattering may be viewed as no more than a hindrance to an observer. However, it turns out that bad weather can be put to good use. The farther light has to travel from its source (say, a surface) to its destination (say, a camera), the greater it will be effected by the weather. Hence, bad weather could serve as a powerful means for coding and conveying scene structure. This observation lies at the core of our investigation; we wish to understand not only what bad weather does to vision but also what it can dofor vision. Surprisingly little work has been done in computer vision on weather related issues. An exception is the work of Cozman and Krotkov[Cozman and Krotkov, 1997 ] which uses the scattering models in [McCartney, 1976 ] to compute depth cues. Their algorithm assumes that all scene points used for depth estimation have the same intensity on a clear day. Since scene points can have their own reflectances and illuminations, this assumption is hard to satisfy in practice. In this paper, we develop algorithms that recover complete depth maps of scenes without making assumptions about the properties of the scene points or the atmospheric conditions. How do such scene recovery methods compare with existing ones? Unlike binocular stereo, they do not suffer from the problems of correspondence and discontinuities. Nor do they require tracking of image features as in structure from motion. Furthermore, they are particularly useful for scenes with distant objects (even miles away) which pose problems for stereo and motion. The techniques we present here only require changes in weather conditions and accurate measurement of image irradiance. 2 Bad Weather: Particles in Space Weather conditions differ mainly in the types and sizes of the particles involved and their concentrations in space.

The system tracks the head positions of both users and computes four images one for each eye of each person. To display the four images as two stereo pairs, we must ensure each image is correctly presented to the appropriate eye. We describe a hardware solution to this display problem as well as registration and calibration procedures. These procedures ensure that when two users point to the same location on a virtual object, their fingers will physically touch. Since the stereo pairs are independent, we have the option of displaying specialized views of the shared virtual environment to each user. We present several scenarios in which specialized views might be useful. CR	responsive web design;stereoscopy;virtual reality;workbench	Maneesh Agrawala;Andrew C.

We contrast the use case that includes an external display to their use as a standalone application platform.

However, it remains one of the most difficult gestures to master for medical students. Given the lack of sufficiently realistic training devices available for future physicians, we propose a new haptic simulator which reproduces the haptic sensations felt by anaesthesiologists when performing this kind of operation. The originality of this simulator is the coupling of a Geomagic TouchÂ® device with a pneumatic cylinder to reproduce the âLoss of Resistanceâ phenomenon which helps the physician to control the needle depth. In this paper, we introduce the parametric 3D model of the region of interest and the control laws used jointly. Even though this device could not reproduce the right level of forces required in this type of anaesthesia, an anaesthesiologist involved in the project gave positive feedback about its haptic tissue rendering.	cylinder seal;experiment;geomagic;haptic technology;parametric model;positive feedback;region of interest;simulation;spectral leakage	Pierre-Jean Ales;Nicolas Herzig;Arnaud LelevÃ©;Richard Moreau;Christian Bauer	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759760	simulation;pneumatic actuator;engineering;biological engineering;solid modeling;force	Robotics	-41.64041857932002	-47.20093170690033	110951

3cba9922b798f017726f5320c3ca9434c4ff361c	interactive visual calibration of volumetric head-tracked 3d displays		Head-tracked 3D displays can provide a compelling 3D effect, but even small inaccuracies in the calibration of the participant's viewpoint to the display can disrupt the 3D illusion. We propose a novel interactive procedure for a participant to easily and accurately calibrate a head-tracked display by visually aligning patterns across a multi-screen display. Head-tracker measurements are then calibrated to these known viewpoints. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual patterns and different display shapes. We found that the easiest to align shape was the spherical display and the best calibration pattern was the combination of circles and lines. We performed a quantitative camera-based calibration of a cubic display and found visual calibration outperformed manual tuning and generated viewpoint calibrations accurate to within a degree. Our work removes the usual, burdensome step of manual calibration when using head-tracked displays and paves the way for wider adoption of this inexpensive and effective 3D display technology.	align (company);calibration (statistics);cubic function;display device;stereo display;usability testing	Andrew John Wagemakers;Dylan Brodie Fafard;Ian Stavness	2017		10.1145/3025453.3025685	calibration;stereo display;computer graphics (images);artificial intelligence;illusion;computer science;visual perception;computer vision	HCI	-41.379840169932315	-39.381140634695086	111000

b1e0f06e0cbbe316ce10169acd4b579203e4b009	direct hand manipulation of constrained virtual objects		We propose a direct object manipulation system that a user can manipulate objects constrained to each other by his or her hands. Because there is no haptic feedback to a user, manipulation of constrained objects is much harder than that of a simple rigid body. In addition, many physics simulator usually suffers from instability in handling the constrained objects in a virtual system. We solve the problem by adding another micro simulator which enforce the constraint between the objects, and guarantees that the rendered image of an object and its physics counterpart always satisfy the given constraint. The experiment shows that the proposed method makes a user manipulate constrained objects with no difficulties in the way that he or she manipulates such objects in the real world.	experiment;haptic technology;head-mounted display;instability;mathematical optimization;principle of good enough;simulation;virtual reality;visualization (graphics)	Jun-Sik Kim;Jung-Min Park	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8202180	computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;haptic technology;rigid body;hand manipulation	Robotics	-40.78401629530724	-38.474099962079165	111060

54b32fb4a6b6689fe8906a0e1a510e5bc79ebb8f	one-handed input through rotational motion for smartwatches		ABSTRACTOne-handed input for smartwatches is crucial when usersâ hands are occupied. A rotational motion is leveraged, which can be detected by built-in motion sensors in most smartwatches, as input to provide item selection. Users control a cursor by rotating the smartwatch into different orientations using the proposed item selection gestures. To understand human wrist dexterity and the ability to perform rotational motion input along each degree of freedom on smartwatches, a human-factor study was performed. Except dexterity, usersâ consensus and agreement of user-defined rotational motion input gestures for selection and commitment on smartwatches in an exploratory user study were also observed. Based on both the studies, gestures roll and tilt are proposed as selection gestures, and shake and nod are used as commitment gestures.

The motion sickness can affect both these systems, and severity of the motion sickness is expected to be measured by dysfunction of the equilibrium system. We have proposed a new index, sparse density (SPD), of stationary stabilograms for detecting the metamorphism in the (temporally averaged) potential function of stochastic differential equations, which occurs when a human attempts to maintain an upright posture. It is known that a mathematical model of the body sway can be developed by a stochastic process. The authors have succeeded in finding the nonlinearity in the potential function. Subjects in a standing position were stimulated by a movie scrolling from left to right on a liquid crystal display (LCD) in measurement 1 and a stereoscopic video clip on an LCD in measurement 2. As a result, the dynamics of the body sway in the presence of the stimulus as well as in its absence were considered to be stochastic. The metamorphism in the potential function during exposure to blurred images and a stereoscopic video clip could be detected by using the SPD.	liquid-crystal display	Hiroki Takada;Kazuhiro Fujikake;Yasuyuki Matsuura;Masaru Miyao	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39191-0_36	computer vision;simulation;geography;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-42.85457905580817	-50.4770718936654	111489

The difficulty lies in treating a mixture of sounds, occlusion (some talkers are hidden) and real-time processing. Our approach consists of three components; (1) the extraction of the direction of each speaker by using interaural phase difference and interaural intensity difference, (2) the resolution of each speakerâs direction by multi-modal integration of audition, vision and motion with canceling inevitable motor noises in motion in case of an unseen or silent speaker, and (3) the distributed implementation to three PCs connected by TCP/IP network to attain real-time processing. As a result, we attain robust real-time speaker tracking with 200 ms delay in a non-anechoic room, even when multiple speakers exist and the tracking person is visually occluded.	hidden surface determination;internet protocol suite;mobile robot;modal logic;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Kazuhiro Nakadai;Ken-ichi Hidai;Hiroshi G.

While there are various navigation system products for automobiles, motorcyclist has issues in using currently provided navigation system. It is known from previous researches that motorcycle rider moves their viewpoint in a characterful way while driving, which makes it difficult for the rider to look at small liquid crystal displays. To solve this issue, we propose a navigation system utilizing the technology of head-up display. While considering the motorcycle rider's viewpoint behavior, we constructed a head-up display to conduct experiments and observe the effects by presenting information on the head-up display. Regarding safety, experiments were conducted inside an immersive projection environment using a motorcycle simulator. The results of experiments clarified the preferable display position and the amount of information to present on the head-up display.	experiment;head-up display;liquid-crystal display;simulation	Kenichiro Ito;Hidekazu Nishimura;Tetsuro Ogi	2015		10.1145/2818406.2818415	head-up display;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.91797832372684	-47.52046683525841	111819

We focus on first-person navigation in virtual environments which involves forward and backward motions on a ground-surface with turns toward the left or right. We found that gaze behavior in virtual reality, with input devices like mice and keyboards, is similar to the one observed in real life. Participants anticipated turns as in real life conditions, i.e. when they can actually move their body and head. We also found influences of visual occlusions and optic flow similar to the ones reported in existing literature on real navigations. Then, we propose three simple gaze prediction models taking as input: (1) the motion of the user as given by the rotation velocity of the camera on the yaw axis (considered here as the virtual heading direction), and/or (2) the optic flow on screen. These models were tested with data collected in various virtual environments. Results show that these models can significantly improve the prediction of gaze position on screen, especially when turning, in the virtual environment. The model based on rotation velocity of the camera seems to be the best trade-off between simplicity and efficiency. We suggest that these models could be used in several interactive applications using gaze point as input. They could also be used as a new top-down component in any existing visual attention model.	course (navigation);input device;optic axis of a crystal;optical flow;real life;top-down and bottom-up design;velocity (software development);virtual reality;yaws	SÃ©bastien Hillaire;Anatole LÃ©cuyer;Gaspard Breton;Tony Regia-Corte	2009		10.1145/1643928.1643941	computer vision;simulation;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;top-down and bottom-up design;optical flow;virtual reality;predictive modelling;input device;data collection	Visualization	-45.09188851238477	-47.57220537700275	112107

d4346aaff51db79a9f1aa7f00177f90ec9877ebe	user preference for sharpview-enhanced virtual text during non-fixated viewing		For optical see-through head-mounted displays, the mismatch between a display's focal length and the real world scene inadvertently prevents users from simultaneously focusing on the presented virtual content and the scene. It has been shown that it is possible to ameliorate the out-of-focus blur for images with a known focus distance, by applying an algorithm called Sharp View. However, it remains unclear if Sharp View also improves the readability and clarity of text rendered on the display. In this study, we investigate whether users reported increased text clarity when Sharp View was applied to a text label, and how the focal demand of the display, the focal distance to real world content, and gaze condition affect the result. Our results indicate that, in non-fixated viewing, there is a significant user preference for Sharp View-enhanced text strings.	algorithm;ar (unix);augmented reality;bus mastering;context switch;focal (programming language);gaussian blur;head-mounted display;interaction;text-based (computing);usability	Trey Cook;Nate Phillips;Kristen Massey;Alexander Plopski;Christian Sandor	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	10.1109/VR.2018.8446058	computer vision;optical imaging;gaze;artificial intelligence;readability;focal length;computer science;visualization;augmented reality;clarity;lens (optics)	Visualization	-43.599694731206945	-47.24121579508421	112298

Researchers have been introducing haptic feedback systems in order to facilitate the process of learning motor skills but little research has expanded the possibility of applying to the field of musical instruments. Hence, we developed a system called """"MoveMe"""" that provides three-dimensional haptic support for playing a musical instrument. The system guides a user's hands as if someone else was holding their hands to help a beginner play a musical instrument. With the system, an expert can pre-record his/her movements so that a beginner can play it back later as necessary. Alternatively, the system connects an expert and a beginner via two haptic robots and the expert can, in real time, guide and correct the beginner's movement. In addition to those functionalities, we introduce a new proficiency metric provided by force feedback. A master can evaluate how much a beginner has improved using both audio feedback as well as this new force-based metric. Through the experiments that we conducted, we found that our system is effective in terms of playing a song at a correct speed and rhythm."""	audio feedback;experiment;haptic technology;robot	Katsuya Fujii;Sophia S.

dc8c21f9f6ece2d8510772fcd2bdb009bbadddab	scale impacts elicited gestures for manipulating holograms: implications for ar gesture design		Because gesture design for augmented reality (AR) remains idiosyncratic, people cannot necessarily use gestures learned in one AR application in another. To design discoverable gestures, we need to understand what gestures people expect to use. We explore how the scale of AR affects the gestures people expect to use to interact with 3D holograms. Using an elicitation study, we asked participants to generate gestures in response to holographic task referents, where we varied the scale of holograms from desktop-scale to room-scale objects. We found that the scale of objects and scenes in the AR experience moderates the generated gestures. Most gestures were informed by physical interaction, and when people interacted from a distance, they sought a good perspective on the target object before and during the interaction. These results suggest that gesture designers need to account for scale, and should not simply reuse gestures across different hologram sizes.	augmented reality;desktop computer;discoverability;gesture recognition;holography;humanâcomputer interaction	Tran Pham;Jo Vermeulen;Anthony Tang;Lindsay MacDonald Vermeulen	2018		10.1145/3196709.3196719	engineering;holography;multimedia;humanâcomputer interaction;augmented reality;gesture	HCI	-45.61153976427738	-46.637458862413744	112577

Previous work has investigated how aiming assistance can be applied in a 3D environment to assist weaker players; however, there is little information on whether aiming assistance balances gameplay in a multiplayer environment or on how aim assistance affects player experience. We carried out a study to test the effectiveness of two aim assistance techniques (Bullet Magnetism and Area Cursor) that have been shown to help aiming in a 3D FPS. Our study had novice-expert pairs play deathmatch games in a multiplayer 3D FPS with and without the assistance techniques. The study showed that although Area Cursor and Bullet Magnetism resulted in better performance of the weaker player, it did not result in closer scores, and had no effect on the players' enjoyment of the game. Our results indicate that balancing performance in 3D FPS games is more complex than simply helping weaker players' aim, and we suggest possible reasons that warrant further investigation. This study is the first realistic evaluation of balancing techniques for 3D First Person Shooters, providing empirical evidence of the difficulty of using aim assistance techniques for balancing competitive gameplay.	assistive technology;competitive learning;first person shooter;first-person (video games);floating point systems	Rodrigo Vicencio-Moreira;Regan Lee Mandryk;Carl Gutwin	2014	2014 IEEE Games Media Entertainment	10.1109/GEM.2014.7048086	simulation;engineering;game mechanics;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-45.63765969378344	-48.27694392597797	112589
d2202b1e545017ac24cac9a911c26000b38cfe87	achieving human presence in space exploration		One of the primary goals of human spaceflight has been putting human cognition on other worlds. This is at the heart of the premise of what we call space exploration. But Earth-controlled telerobotic facilities can now bring human senses to other worlds and, in that respect, the historical premise of exploration, of boots on the ground, no longer clearly applies. We have ways of achieving remote presence that we never used to have. But the distances over which this must be achieved, by humans based on the Earth, is such that the speed of light seriously handicaps their awareness and cognition. The highest quality telepresence can be achieved not only by having people on site, but also by having people close, and it is that requirement that truly mandates human spaceflight. In terms of cost, safety, and survival, getting people close is easier than getting people all the way there. It is suggested here that to the extent that space exploration is best accomplished by achieving a sense of real human off-Earth presence, that presence can be best achieved by optimally combining human spaceflight to mitigate latency, with telerobotics, to keep those humans secure. This is culturally a new perspective on exploration.	cognition;requirement;telerobotics	Dan Lester	2013	PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments	10.1162/PRES_a_00160	simulation;artificial intelligence	HCI	-45.38107663711418	-49.10857994623413	112599

To minimize operation time, a multimodal user interface enables freehand robotic manipulation of an extracorporeal stereoscopic digital camera (exoscope) and an endoscope. The surgeon thereby wears a head-mounted unit with a binocular display, a head tracker, a microphone and earphones. Different view positioning and adjustment modes can be selected by voice and controlled by head rotation while pressing a miniature confirmation button with a finger. Initial studies focused on the evaluation and optimization of the intuitiveness, comfort and precision of different modes of operation, including a user test with neurosurgeons in a virtual reality simulation. The first labtype of the system was then implemented and demonstrated in the operating room on a phantom together with the clinical partners.	adobe freehand;binocular vision;block cipher mode of operation;digital camera;endoscope device component;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;head-mounted display;headphones;imaging phantom;mathematical optimization;microphone device component;multimodal interaction;operating room;operation time;phantoms, imaging;robot;semiconductor industry;simulated reality;simulation;stereoscopy;user interface device component;virtual reality;confirmation - responselevel	Stefanos Serefoglou;Wolfgang Lauer;Axel Perneczky;Theodor Lutze;Klaus Radermacher	2006	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

These are some features of the material object model that cannot be perceived by the observer through his/her senses (i.e. magnetization, radiation, humidity). Exploration of such features requires additional means and techniques that expand the perception range of the observer's different sensory channels. Traditional approaches use only a few of the explicit properties of objects models (mainly its geometric, structural and topological characteristics) for their building. We believe that the supplement of implicit properties, the selection of an appropriate combination of stimuli for separate sensory channels, their effective presentation to the observer and the ability for their modification directly in the virtual world will turn this situation in a way that may lead to a disruption in the generally accepted practices for different research fields, thus allowing for the virtual reality to unfold its full potential as a significant engineering design tool. Respectively, this will considerably enhance and intensify the information perception of the observer during object exploration in the virtual environment. Here, a brief introduction in the Virtual Reality and its engineering application is presented. The concepts about the material objects and their properties, as well as systems and norms for standardized properties sets and classes, have been surveyed.

Most of the previously built conversational robots cannot perform dialogue management necessary for accurately recognizing human intentions and providing information to humans. This model integrates robot behavior planning models with spoken dialogue management that is robust enough to engage in mixed-initiative dialogues in specific domains. It has two layers; the upper layer is responsible for global task planning using hierarchical planning and the lower layer engages in local planning by utilizing modules called experts, which are specialized for performing certain kind of tasks by performing physical actions and engaging in dialogues. This model enables switching and canceling tasks based on recognized human intentions. A preliminary implementation of the model, which has been integrated with Honda ASIMO, has shown its effectiveness.	asimo;algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;dialog system;humanoid robot;reinforcement learning;robot;vii;vocabulary	Mikio Nakano;Yuji Hasegawa;Kazuhiro Nakadai;Takahiro Nakamura;Johane Takeuchi;Toyotaka Torii;Hiroshi Tsujino;Naoyuki Kanda;Hiroshi G.

The resolution of the textures rendered with such devices and their matching to real textures have never been investigated. The paper first contributes to the evaluation of the texture resolution of friction based tactile displays. In a controlled experiment, we investigate the differential thresholds for square gratings simulated with a friction based tactile device by dynamic touch. Then we compare them to the differential thresholds of real square wave gratings. We found that the Weber fraction remains constant across the different spatial period at 9%, which is close to the Weber fraction found for corresponding real square gratings. This study inclines us to conclude that friction based tactile displays offers a realistic alternative to pin based arrays and can be used for co-located vision and tactile rendering. From the results of the experiment, we also give the design guidelines to improve the perception of textures on friction based tactile displays.	cloud fraction;image resolution;laptop;simulation;texture mapping;touchpad;trochoidal wave	Melisande Biet;GÃ©ry Casiez;FrÃ©dÃ©ric Giraud;Betty Lemaire-Semail	2008	2008 Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems	10.1109/HAPTICS.2008.4479912	computer vision;engineering;communication;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-43.53431251883931	-49.057600923456306	113531

Named the blind driver challenge, the purpose of the project is to improve the independence of the visually-impaired by allowing them to travel at their convenience. The system development is targeted to be deployed on Team Victor Tangopsilas DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle ldquoOdin.rdquo The system uses tactile and audio interfaces to relay information to the driver about vehicle heading and speed. The driver then corrects his steering and speed using a joystick. The tactile interface is a modified massage chair, which directs the driver to accelerate or brake. The audio interface is a pair of headphones, which directs the driver where to turn.

These images have to be generated using transformations which correctly project a point in virtual space onto its corresponding point in the real world. We present a simple and fast calibration scheme for head-mounted displays (HMDs), which does not require additional instrumentation or complicated procedures. The user is interactively guided through the calibration process, allowing even inexperienced users to calibrate the display to their eye distance and head geometry. The calibration is stable - meaning that slight errors made by the user do not result in gross miscalibrations - and easily applicable for see-through and video-based HMDs.	augmented reality;experience;head-mounted display;interactive media;virtual reality	Anton L.

For example, operating a rock breaker requires two handed joystick control to position and fire the jackhammer, leaving the camera control to either automatic control or require the operator to switch between controls. We modelled such a teleoperated setting by performing experiments using a simple physical game analogue, being a half size table soccer game with two handles. The complex camera angles of the mining application were modelled by obscuring the direct view of the play area and the use of a Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera. The camera control was via either a keyboard or via head tracking using two different sets of head gestures called âhead motionâ and âhead flickingâ for turning camera motion on/off. Our results show that the head motion control was able to provide a comparable performance to using a keyboard, while head flicking was significantly worse. In addition, the sequence of use of the three control methods is highly significant. It appears that use of the keyboard first depresses successful use of the head tracking methods, with significantly better results when one of the head tracking methods was used first. Analysis of the qualitative survey data collected supports that the worst (by performance) method was disliked by participants. Surprisingly, use of that worst method as the first control method significantly enhanced performance using the other two	automatic control;experiment;joystick;motion capture;panâtiltâzoom camera	Dingyun Zhu;TamÃ¡s D.

To this purpose, vibrotactile actuators have been embedded in the end-effector of the master interface of a tele-operated robotic system made of the haptic joystick Novint Falcon and the Kuka Light Weight Robot III. Vibrotactile feedback can be used to support the surgeon during the surgical procedure, guiding him/her during the intervention, and to train unskilled surgeons with simulators. The development and the experimental validation of the master interface with the vibrotactile feedback is presented in this paper. The system has been validated on 12 subjects, who were requested to control the movement of a sphere along a desired path in a virtual environment. Results have been compared with the three cases of absence of feedback, visual feedback and combined vibrotactile and visual feedback. The obtained results demonstrate that a vibrotactile feedback can improve in a statistically significant manner the accuracy of the procedure with respect to the absence of feedback.	embedded system;falcon (video game series);feedback;haptic technology;joystick;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);modulation;novint technologies;remote surgery;robot end effector;sensory substitution;simulation;television;virtual reality	Elena F.

An NLI should provide feedback on what it does and what it understands. In addition, user queries and intermediate results have to be analyzed for errors, so that the interface can signal potential problem situations. This paper discusses the application of the critic paradigm for human-computer interaction to natural language interfaces, and presents a computer-based assistant for the NLI-Z39.50, a natural language interface for access to library databases. The search assistant, a so called critic system, spots errors in the natural language input, provides feedback on intermediate results, suggests search terms for query refinement, and aids the users when they do not know how to perform a search successfully or when they encounter common search problems.	database;feedback;humanâcomputer interaction;native-language identification;natural language processing;natural language user interface;programming paradigm;recommender system;refinement (computing);search problem;spell checker;usability;web search engine;dialog	Johannes Leveling	2004			natural language processing;natural language programming;natural language user interface;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	DB	-37.23247789314503	-50.82432935255734	114931

According to the landmark-route-survey model, metric spatial knowledge (survey knowledge) is acquired only following the acquisition of landmark and route knowledge. A dual mode model was proposed that assumes that survey knowledge may be quickly acquired for local regions. Research was conducted to understand how people rapidly acquire survey knowledge. Participants in three experiments briefly navigated on one floor of a virtual building, moving down hallways and performing tasks by using objects in rooms. Participants were later asked to answer from memory about the direction of objects by using pointing and map-drawing measures. A room effect was found for both measures; the angular positions of two objects in the same room were more accurately reported than those in different rooms. Accurate metric spatial information was available for objects in the same room, supporting an early acquisition assumption.	angularjs;building information modeling;experiment;virtual world	Herbert A.

As the spoken languages, several sign languages do exist. The way sign language is learned by deaf people may have some details to be improved, but one can state that the existing learning mechanisms are effective when we talk about a deaf child, for example. The problem arises for the non-deaf persons that communicate with the deaf persons â the so-called listeners. If, for example, one couple has a new child that turns to be deaf, these two persons find a challenge to learn the sign language. In one hand, they cannot stop their working life, especially because of this sad news turns to be more costly, on the other hand, the existing mechanisms target the deaf-persons and are not prepared for the listeners. This paper proposes a new playful approach to help these listeners to learn the sign language. The proposal is a serious game composed of two modes: School-mode and Competition-mode. The first provides a school-like environment where the user learns the letter-signs and the second provides the user an environment used towards testing the learned skills. Behind the scenes, the proposal is based on two phases: 1 â the creation of a gestures library, relying on the Kinect depth camera; and 2 â the realtime recognition of gestures, by comparing what the depth camera information to the existing gestures previously stored in the library. A prototype system was developed â the Kinect-Sign â and tested in a Portuguese Sign-Language school resulting in a joyful acceptance of the approach. Â© 2014 The Authors.

911414dbe1129c361335ddcbccf374712757182a	rectangular stable power-aware mobile projection on planar surfaces	projector stabilization;keystone correction;projector calibration	Pico projectors are becoming increasingly popular and can be used in conjunction with handheld mobile devices, portable media players, digital cameras in the foreseeable future. Mobile projection provides new opportunities realizing mobile spatial augmented reality applications. Projection from handheld devices bring in challenges of stabilizing the imagery in the persence of hand movements which entails more complex problems like keystone, zoom and jitter correction. However, no suitable software interface exists today that integrates these pico-projectors with handheld mobile devices.  This paper develops the first power-efficient software methods and interface to project a rectangular, stable image from a pico-projector augmented to a handheld mobile device that can allow users to make contents legible on such devices via real-time solutions for keystone correction, zoom and jitter correction. To provide power efficient solutions in the context of mobile power-sensitive devices, we achieve the keystone correction, zoom and hand-movement stabilization mostly using data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) while minimizing the use of less power-efficient sensor like camera. For zoom stabilization, we use a very inexpensive low power distance sensor. The camera is used only for initialization. We have developed two prototype systems to show our software interface: the first one is implemented on cellphone running Android OS; and the second one used a raspberry pi interface to the projectors.	android;augmented reality;digital camera;handheld game console;handheld projector;keystone effect;mobile device;mobile phone;movie projector;multi-user;operating system;output device;pico;power distance;prototype;range imaging;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);real-time transcription;sensor;video projector	Mehdi Rahimzadeh;Hung Nguyen;Ardalan Amiri Sani;Fadi J.

A portable numeric keypad is used to interact with the OSDS, which can either be held by the user, or can be affixed to a surface for interaction. A study to determine the feasibility of the system was conducted with three individuals with physical disabilities. While it was noted that the time taken was higher to complete a task compared to their existing methods of computer-based input, findings also indicate that the system offers potential for tasks involving a combination of text entry and cursor movement (e.g., completing online forms). Furthermore, as the keypad is smaller in size compared with a traditional keyboard, participants suggested that it offered potential to reduce effort spent in the fatiguing process of traversal.	cursor (databases);humanâcomputer interaction;pointing device gesture;r language;tree traversal;usability;user interface	Sidas A.

It makes up shortcomings of sound under certain conditions and be an important channel of information transfer for route guidance field. As a special kind of walkers, the visually impaired pedestrians have a specific type of cognition or perception of route guidance environment (including spatial orientation, distance and walking speed etc.). And they have more sensitive sense of touch than that the ordinary people have. This work integrated application of GPS, GIS and Haptic (vibration) technology to develop more reliable mode route guidance for the visually impaired. It provides different vibration to the user under two circumstances: key nodes of roads ahead and deviation planning path. It has several obvious advantages, such as higher anti-noise, sensitivity and effectiveness. Using HTC Legend phone, we developed the prototype and realized the designed functions, and verify the effectiveness of the system. We initially determined the thresholds of deviating from the path, those at road junctions and other nodes through experiments, interviews etc. And we used the thresholds for experiments testing and guiding. Then they were inspected, corrected and improved in the field practice.

To evaluate these algorithms, we have developed a simple experimental framework. Subjects wear an instrumented data glove that records finger motions. The high-dimensional glove signals remotely control the joint angles of a simulated planar two-link arm on a computer screen, which is used to acquire targets. A machine learning algorithm was applied to adaptively change the transformation between finger motion and the simulated robot arm. This algorithm was either LMS gradient descent or the Moore-Penrose (MP) pseudoinverse transformation. Both algorithms modified the glove-to-joint angle map so as to reduce the endpoint errors measured in past performance. The MP group performed worse than the control group (subjects not exposed to any machine learning), while the LMS group outperformed the control subjects. However, the LMS subjects failed to achieve better generalization than the control subjects, and after extensive training converged to the same level of performance as the control subjects. These results highlight the limitations of coadaptive learning using only endpoint error reduction.	algorithm;communication endpoint;computer monitor;gradient descent;machine learning;mooreâpenrose pseudoinverse;motion;robotic arm;wired glove	Zachary C Danziger;Alon Fishbach;Ferdinando A.

Interactivity in this context means that the user is able to explore and navigate audio-visual scenes by freely choosing viewpoint and viewing direction. In order to provide this key feature, omnidirectional video is typically represented as a classical two-dimensional (2D) rectangular panorama video that is mapped onto a (spherical or cylindrical) mesh and then rendered on the client's screen. Early transmission models of this full panorama video and mesh content simply deal with the panorama as a high-resolution video to be encoded at uniform quality. Generally the user can only view a restricted field-of-view of the content and then interact with pan-tilt-zoom commands. This means that a significant part of the bandwidth is wasted by transmitting quality video in regions that are not being visualized. In this paper we evaluate the relevance and optimality of a personalized transmission where quality is modulated in spherical or cylindrical regions depending on their likelihood to be viewed during a live user interaction. We show, based on interaction delay as well as bandwidth constraints, how tiling and predictive methods can improve on existing methods.

The method is novel in that the user does not receive the results of the recognition process, except at the end of a phrase. The method is justified over soft keyboards in terms of a Frame Model of Visual Attention, which reveals both the presence and advantage of reduced visual attention. With less on-going feedback to monitor, there is a tendency for the user to enter gestures more quickly. Preliminary testing reveals reasonably quick text entry speeds (>20 wpm) with low errors rates (<5%).	error detection and correction;forward error correction;graffiti (palm os);touchscreen;words per minute	I.

Unfortunately the touch-based interaction paradigm commonly adopted on most devices is not convenient for these users, motivating the study of different interaction technologies. In this paper, following up on our previous work, we consider a system where a smartwatch is exploited to provide hands-free interaction through arm gestures with an assistive application running on a smartphone. In particular we focus on the task of effortlessly customizing the gesture recognition system with new gestures specified by the user. To address this problem we propose an approach based on a novel transfer metric learning algorithm, which exploits prior knowledge about a predefined set of gestures to improve the recognition of user-defined ones, while requiring only few novel training samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation.	algorithm;gesture recognition;mobile device;programming paradigm;smartphone;smartwatch	Gabriele Costante;Lorenzo Porzi;Oswald Lanz;Paolo Valigi;Elisa Ricci	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;gesture recognition;communication	HCI	-37.88943862257785	-46.16577903091959	116486

Our goal is to develop MR content in which users and characters can coexist in an actual room and experience a story. This study represents a preliminary step in the development of such an MR experience. We proposed a method to construct an MR environment that uses three-dimensional information acquired from the actual environment based on rules. We extract valid plane information from three-dimensional information and use it. Virtual objects used for MR content can be placed in real space automatically. Rules are created by specifying the area and height of the plane of the real space. In this study, we placed seven types of objects in two types of rooms and confirmed that it is possible to construct an environment using a transmission-type head mount-ed display. However, under the current system, users cannot experience a story.	mixed reality	Kazuma Nagata;Soh Masuko;Junichi Hoshino	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-99426-0_27	simulation;mixed reality;computer science	Visualization	-42.543074128994505	-38.594611670144026	116665

We are developing a wheelchair system that can help ALS patients, and others who can't use physical interfaces such as joysticks or gaze tracking, regain some autonomy. The system must be usable in hospitals and homes with minimal infrastructure modification. It must be safe and relatively low cost and must provide optimal interaction between the user and the wheelchair within the constraints of the brain-computer interface. To this end, we have built the first working prototype of a brain-controlled wheelchair that can navigate inside a typical office or hospital environment. This article describes the BCW, our control strategy, and the system's performance in a typical building environment.

8a0dfd273a8cd52ad58de02788324d3ae84a62d3	vos - designing a visual orientation system		While humans possess a well-developed sense of direction and can easily walk to a visible target, that ability is drastically reduced when lacking visual cues. In situations where people cannot depend on sight, orientation might become a critical issue, as when escaping a room filled with smoke, swimming in open waters, hiking in the fog or crossing the woods at night. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of VOS - a Visual Orientation System for providing an augmented sense of direction. Our system uses LEDs to offer cues on how to correct the current heading. Our findings consist of demonstrating the viability of such system, as well as its usability. We discuss the implications for designing technology that enables people to orient themselves and navigate places with little or no visual cues.	course (navigation);usability	Francisco Esteban Kiss;Albrecht Schmidt;Pawel W.

c479aa129e2db7ac1d67b136b036b375ff64f9a5	the design and validation of the r1 personal humanoid		In recent years the robotics field has witnessed an interesting new trend. Several companies started the production of service robots whose aim is to cooperate with humans. The robots developed so far are either rather expensive or unsuitable for manipulation tasks. This article presents the result of a project which wishes to demonstrate the feasibility of an affordable humanoid robot. R1 is able to navigate, and interact with the environment (grasping and carrying objects, operating switches, opening doors etc). The robot is also equipped with a speaker, microphones and it mounts a display in the head to support interaction using natural channels like speech or (simulated) eye movements. The final cost of the robot is expected to range around that of a family car, possibly, when produced in large quantities, even significantly lower. This goal was tackled along three synergistic directions: use of polymeric materials, light-weight design and implementation of novel actuation solutions. These lines, as well as the robot with its main features, are described hereafter.	dependability;humanoid robot;humans;microphone;network switch;prototype;robotics;synergy	Alberto Parmiggiani;Luca Fiorio;Alessandro Scalzo;Anand Vazhapilli Sureshbabu;Marco Randazzo;Marco Maggiali;Ugo Pattacini;Hagen Lehmann;Vadim Tikhanoff;Daniele Domenichelli;Alberto Cardellino;Pierpaolo Congiu;Andrea Pagnin;Roberto Cingolani;Lorenzo Natale;Giorgio Metta	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8202224	computer science;humanoid robot;simulation;computer vision;artificial intelligence;robot;doors;robotics	Robotics	-37.151548739535556	-40.203931925646096	117391

Due to the smartphone built-in accelerometer, the user can easily and intuitively control the movements around the virtual world. Also, the Wii-remoteÂ® is used as an auxiliary input device to interact with the application. The proposed method permits to interact and visualize three-dimensional virtual scenarios without the need of specialized software or browser-plugins installed in the smartphone. By taking advantage of today's smartphone technological features, students feel highly motivated to use this device as an amusing learning tool. Since this application resembles three-dimensional computer games, it attracts students, increases their concentration, and keeps their attention during the learning process.	gesture recognition;head-mounted display;image resolution;input device;labview;pc game;plug-in (computing);real life;remote control;sensor;smartphone;stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy;virtual world;wii remote plus	Ernesto Granado;Julio Viola;Julio Zambrano;Flavio Quizhpi	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2016.7587942	computer vision;simulation;engineering;instructional simulation;multimedia	Visualization	-45.2493916010223	-39.616931740923725	117615

The device, which we call CyARM, measures the distance between a person and an object with an ultrasonic sensor and transmits the distance information to the user's haptic sense. In this report, we will: (1) outline the concept of CyARM, (2) describe its mechanism, and (3) demonstrate three preliminary experiments that verify the usability of CyARM. We conducted the experiments in terms of detection of objects, detection of space, and tracking object movement. As a result of these experiments, we have concluded that CyARM is potentially effective for visually impaired persons. Our study will encourage the related studies of user interfaces, particularly focusing on electric aid devices that guide visually impaired persons in detecting their environment.	experiment;sensor;usability;user interface	Kiyohide Ito;Makoto Okamoto;Junichi Akita;Tetsuo Ono;Ikuko Gyobu;Tomohito Takagi;Takahiro Hoshi;Yu Mishima	2005		10.1145/1056808.1056947	computer vision;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;user interface	HCI	-43.209503905079124	-43.92916705501189	117973

We think if they can use applications of smart phones by a blink, it will be big help for them to tell caregivers what they really need or want to say. Fist, we try to detect an eye area by using OpenCv. Then we develop the way to detect opening and closing of eyes. We combine two methods, using saturation and using complexity of image, to get more accurate results of detecting a blink. The level of handicap is varied in children. So we are trying to develop the application to be able to customize depends on the situation of users. And also, we are trying to reduce the error in detecting a blink and pursue the high precision of the eye chased program.	blink;closing (morphology);opencv;sensor;smartphone	Ippei Torii;Shunki Takami;Kaoruko Ohtani;Naohiro Ishii	2014	IISA 2014, The 5th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications	10.1109/IISA.2014.6878718	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;communication	HCI	-36.95850478682844	-44.4372276357321	118152

Tools and techniques are required to sense the variety of children's touch and to interpret the volumes of data generated. This explorative user study investigated children's patterns of touch during game play with a robot. We examined where the children touch the robot and their patterns of touch over time, using a raster-based visualisation of each child's time series of touches, recording patterns of touch across different games and children. We found that children readily engage with the robot, in particular spontaneously touching the robot's hands more than any other area. This user study and the tools developed may aid future designs of robots to autonomously detect when they have been touched.	raster graphics;requirement;social robot;time series;usability testing	Kristyn Hensby;Janet Wiles;Marie BodÃ©n;Scott Heath;Mark Nielsen;Paul Pounds;Joshua Riddell;Kristopher Rogers;Nikodem Rybak;Virginia Slaughter;Michael Smith;Jonathon Taufatofua;Peter Worthy;Jason Weigel	2016	2016 11th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)		robot;games;computer vision;simulation;torso;computer science;artificial intelligence;prototype;multimedia;data visualization	Robotics	-45.528542207024344	-42.7086192217104	118288

These problems include bandwidth limitations, screen real-estate shortage, battery capacity, and the time costs of pen-based search keyword input. As a way to address bandwidth and battery life limitations, we provide local site search facilities for all sites. We incrementally index Web sites in real time as the PDA user visits them. These indexes have narrow scope at first, and improve as the user dwells on the site, or as more users visit the site over time. We address the keyword input problem by providing site specific keyword completion, and indications of keyword selectivity within sites. The system is implemented on the Palm Pilot platform, using a Metricom radio link. We describe the user level experience, and then present the analyses that informed our technical decisions.	bandwidth (signal processing);interaction;personal digital assistant;selectivity (electronic);web search query;world wide web	Orkut Buyukkokten;Hector Garcia-Molina;Andreas Paepcke	2000	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(00)00060-8	simulation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;real estate	HCI	-33.86854975123936	-51.021967588289996	118295

07159620464c9c7ab0d2114d88c744fbacec2aeb	tap sensor: evaluating a new physical user interface for connected lighting	lighting control;connected lighting;user experience	The commercial introduction of connected lighting that can be integrated with sensors and other devices is opening up new possibilities for creating responsive and intelligent environments. However, the current approach for controlling such systems is to simply replace the light switch with a somewhat more sophisticated smartphone-based remote control. In this position paper we present a study of a new connected lighting control interface -- tap sensors. The tap sensor is a wireless device equipped with an accelerometer sensor that can detect a tap interaction and send a signal to the connected lighting system, for controlling light or other outputs. The tap sensors are small enough to be discretely attached to objects, such as a table, a picture frame, or a door, and it will then turn that object into an interactive control device. Therefore, by tapping on the object, the tap sensor that is attached to it will detect the tap input and an output can subsequently be triggered. These sensors were given to participants who lived with them in their own homes for a few weeks. The results of the study showed a great appreciation for this type of interaction from both practical and hedonic perspectives. Participants informed us that the tap sensors were effective, helpful, fun and playful ways of controlling their light.	intelligent environment;lighting control system;picture-in-picture;remote control;sensor;smartphone;table (database);user interface	Dzmitry Aliakseyeu;Jon Mason	2016		10.1145/2968219.2968522	embedded system;user experience design;real-time computing;humanâcomputer interaction;computer hardware;computer science	HCI	-44.55938752815881	-41.80530616159887	118342

First, a GS simulation model was defined for a menu search task. Second, model parameters were estimated to provide the best fit between model predictions and experimental data. Third, an optimization algorithm was used to identify the menu design that minimized model predicted search times based on predefined search frequencies of different menu items. Fourth, the design was tested. The results indicate that the GS model has the potential to be part of a system for predicting or automating the design of menus. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.	algorithm;color;computer memory;confusion matrix;curve fitting;experiment;humanâcomputer interaction;mathematical optimization;optimal design;roland gs;simulation;surround sound;top-down and bottom-up design	Baili Liu;Gregory Francis;Gavriel Salvendy	2002	Int.

Lederman and Klatzky [1987] have proposed a set of stereotyped movement patterns called Exploratory Procedures (EPs) that are linked to the acquisition of knowledge concerning specific object properties. For example, lateral motion is the optimal EP for acquiring roughness information and compliance is best estimated by employing pressure.	expectation propagation;exploratory testing;haptic technology;lateral thinking	Sander E.

The Touch-Shake has a LED and a speaker, and is shaped like a baton. When each user holds a Touch-Shake and one user touches the body of the other, the LEDs of the Touch-Shakes turn on and the Touch-Shakes output sounds. Additionally, the output sounds and lighting pattern of LEDs vary based on how the user touches the other body, the users' body condition, and the users' physical attributes, which are measured using a capacitive sensor built into the Touch-Shake. The results of an evaluative experiment revealed that the subjects enjoyed physical contact with the Touch-Shake, and they were able to experience rich face-to-face communication.	baton;capacitive sensing;touch id	Yohei Yamaguchi;Hidekatsu Yanagi;Yoshinari Takegawa	2013	2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664789	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;communication	HCI	-46.56526877613275	-40.45447911337127	118452

The results show that despite the fact that participants had no experience using gestures for magnification or navigation, participants were more satisfied with them. Gestures were faster and more preferred than the indirect input methods for pushing a button or rotating a knob, which had previously been familiar to participants from other electronic device interfaces. The study suggests that the use of gestures may afford an alternative and more natural magnification and navigation method for a new user-centric low vision magnifier.	control knob;gesture recognition;handheld game console;input method;touchscreen	Seunghyun Tina Lee;Jon A.

Cardinality and characteristics of the set, together with volatility of the information, resulting from fast and continuous creation, deletion and updating of entries, trigger novel research questions. In this context, we plan to investigate and contribute to the data analysis, and user interface design of exploratory experiences. The proposed approach is an iterative process where analysis and design phases are performed in cycles. The long-term vision is to understand the underlying reasoning in order to be able to automatically replicate it.	iterative method;self-replicating machine;social media;tree accumulation;user interface design;user-generated content;volatility	Luca Chiarandini	2012		10.1145/2124295.2124386	user interface design;user experience design;social media;computer science;data science;data mining;data analysis;user interface;user-generated content;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-34.30230897345712	-49.568902647139815	118643

Moreover, in realistic context-aware applications, these tasks have to be carried out in a non-obtrusive fashion. In this paper we present a set of robust person-identification and tracking algorithms, based on audio and visual processing. A main characteristic of these algorithms is that they operate on far-field and un-constrained audioâvisual streams, which ensure that they are non-intrusive. We also illustrate that the combination of their outputs can lead to composite multimodal tracking components, which are suitable for supporting a broad range of context-aware services. In combining audioâvisual processing results, we exploit a context-modeling approach based on a graph of situations. Accordingly, we discuss the implementation of realistic prototype applications that make use of the full range of audio, visual and multimodal algorithms.	algorithm;context awareness;context-aware network;jog dial;middleware;multimodal interaction;prototype;scalability;sensor;smart tv;ubiquitous computing;user experience	Aristodemos Pnevmatikakis;John Soldatos;Fotios Talantzis;Lazaros Polymenakos	2007	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-007-0169-9	computer vision;real-time computing;computer science;multimedia;context model	HCI	-47.75754129907358	-40.650583811394306	118907

We investigate the use of four nonverbal cues extracted automatically from the audio channel to measure the behavior of vloggers and explore the relation to their degree of popularity and that of their videos. Our study is validated on over 2200 videos and 150 hours of data, and shows that one nonverbal cue (speaking time) is correlated with levels of popularity with a medium size effect.	video blog	Joan-Isaac Biel;Daniel Gatica-Perez	2010			multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-33.75876927990662	-47.87345983443558	119069

It is shown that such devices have some important properties that differentiate them from other input devices (such as mice and joysticks). The analysis serves two purposes: (1) it sheds light on touch tablets, and (2) it demonstrates how other devices might be approached. Three specific distinctions between touch tablets and one button mice are drawn. These concern the signaling of events, multiple point sensing and the use of templates. These distinctions are reinforced, and possible uses of touch tablets are illustrated, in an example application. Potential enhancements to touch tablets and other input devices are discussed, as are some inherent problems. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work.	computer mouse;humanâcomputer interaction;input device;joystick;tablet computer;touchscreen	William Buxton;Ralph Hill;Peter Rowley	1985		10.1145/325334.325239	simulation;computer science;operating system;input device	HCI	-47.2904238129292	-43.76267576420952	119125

In this paper, we present a comparison between full guidance and partial guidance using a haptic learning tool which supports these two modes. The full guidance mode leads the user along a pre-recorded trajectory, whereas the partial guidance mode allows the user a free movement and provides corrective forces if they deviate significantly from the desired path. Experimental results with 22 participants demonstrated that there is no significant difference between partial haptic guidance and full haptic guidance for improving learning outcomes, while both have significantly improved the learner's performance compared to no haptics feedback. However, when the two modes are combined, partial guidance followed by full guidance yielded better overall performance. We conclude the paper by summarizing our findings and providing perspectives for future work.	experiment;haptic technology;human factors and ergonomics;stylus (computing)	Akiko Teranishi;Timothy Mulumba;Georgios Karafotias;Jihad Mohamad Jaam;Mohamad A.

4ce1802f8f9e2ebd60cea34171695bed49c9ed2d	modeling user quality of experience of olfaction-enhanced multimedia		Research on modelling user quality of experience (QoE) to date has primarily focused the combination of traditional media components; audio and video, or the individual influence of each. However, multisensory experiences have recently gained significant traction in the research community as a novel method to enhance QoE beyond what is possible with traditional media. This paper presents a model developed based on empirical data. It estimates user QoE of olfaction-enhanced multimedia. A set of 12 olfaction enhanced video clips were viewed by 84 assessors. A strong age and gender balance produced 6048 user ratings across six questions. Employing this dataset, the proposed model considers the influence of: system factors, user factors and content factors on user perceived QoE. The model is instantiated and validated. The analysis indicates that: content factors have a 10% influence on user QoE; age factors have an 11% influence; and gender factors have an 8% influence on user QoE. Also, content factors had the highest number of statistically significant influences across all of the factors evaluated. These results suggest that human, and content in addition to system factors play a key role in perceptual multimedia quality of olfaction enhanced multimedia. Further work is required to understand the remaining factors as well as the relationship between the media components has on QoE.	digital video;experience;recommender system;traction teampage;user (computing);user profile;utility;video clip	Niall Murray;Gabriel-Miro Muntean;Yuansong Qiao;Sean Brennan;Brian Lee	2018	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2018.2825297	quality of experience;perception;quality of service;multimedia;computer science	Visualization	-34.01777320285662	-47.53157593925267	119251

In this context, the actions a participant may perform depend on the institutional rules and the current execution state. We propose to include iObjects, intelligent objects, as entities having both visualization properties and decision mechanisms in the virtual institution. They are a new key element to improve users participation in virtual institutions.

f0254d2e344b8d84efd86c6a808307e19d055853	small inspection vehicles for non-destructive testing applications	electrical engineering electronics nuclear engineering	One of the fundamental questions in service robotics is how we can get those machines to work efficiently in the same environment with and under the command of the average user. The answer â not an easy one â is in the development of human-robot interfaces (HRI), which should be able to transmit the will of the user to the robot in a simple but effective way preferably using means that are natural to humans. The paper introduces a generic interface concept based on exchanging cognitive information between the robot and the user, both present in the same environment. The information is exchanged through a virtual world called âcommon situation awarenessâ or âcommon presenceâ of both entities. The virtual world is a simple map augmented by database of semantic information. Functions of the HRI are based on utilizing interactively the senses of both the human and machine entities, the human when perceiving the environment and commanding the machine and the machine when looking for working targets or moving in the environment. The syntax of the communication language utilizes the objects and work targets currently existing in the common presence. A multitasking humanoid robot, called WorkPartner, is used to demonstrate the interface principles. The interface is designed to support interaction, including teaching and learning, with the human user in various outdoors work tasks. Natural to human communication methods, such as speech and gestures, are promoted in order to ease the userâs load. Methods and hardware presented have been designed for the WorkPartner robot, but many of them are generic in nature and not dependent upon the robot physics.		Markus Friedrich;L.

Despite considerable prior work exploring foot-based interaction techniques, direct comparisons of the performance of these approaches have been lacking. Here, we compare the performance of the two most common approaches found in previous studies: rocking (applying pressure to different parts of the foot) versus rotating and sliding, considering the use case of a hands-free interface intended for seated musicians. Participants performed a number of representative operations, such as setting the tempo of a metronome, using the two strategies. Results indicate superiority of the rotating and sliding approach, both in completion time and responses to NASA TLX questionnaires, although rocking was preferred by some participants due to its ergonomics and subtle movements required for parameter-controlling tasks. Beyond the comparison itself, the decisions we faced related to menu design and feedback for our use case may offer helpful insight for the design of future foot-based interfaces.	human factors and ergonomics;interaction technique;pedobarography	Taeyong Kim;Hao Ju;Jeremy R.

This process is complicated and difficult for people who do not have modeling skills. We propose ProtoHole, a system for prototyping interactive 3D printed objects using holes, internal cavity and swept-frequency acoustic sensing. By emitting a high-frequency sweep signal inside the object, our system enables to classify changes in resonance properties when closing holes using a machine learning technique. Therefore, an object can be easily made interactive without considering an arrangement of internal electronic parts and wiring. We show examples of prototypes created with our system.	3d printing;acoustic cryptanalysis;closing (morphology);machine learning;prototype;radio-frequency sweep;resonance;user interface;wiring	Shohei Katakura;Keita Watanabe	2018		10.1145/3170427.3188471	humanâcomputer interaction;computer hardware;3d printing;resonance;enclosure;chirp;computer science;rapid prototyping;user interface	HCI	-42.49455334901215	-41.383802116219925	119758

In this paper, we address this issue and present a novel tabletop-based tangible editor, called NatCut, that allows the quick and easy design of physical enclosures for interactive prototypes. To generate an enclosure with NatCut, the user first chooses a basic geometric shape for it on the tabletop surface. By simply placing electronic components on the displayed 2D layout for the enclosure, respective cut-outs and holes are generated. Further, a number of user interactions on the tabletop screen are supported to modify, personalize, and enrich the casing. The resulting 2D layout contains all joints needed to assemble the parts after laser cutting. We discuss the results of a user study in which we tested the approach.	electronic component;interaction;personalization;usability testing	Stefan SchneegaÃ;Alireza Sahami Shirazi;Tanja DÃ¶ring;David Schmid;Albrecht Schmidt	2014		10.1145/2559206.2581189	enclosure;humanâcomputer interaction;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-44.064092166665425	-39.5265814823776	119782

Many of these videos show demonstrations of physical tasks, such as fixing a machine, assembling furniture, or demonstrating dance steps. It is often difficult for the authors of these videos to control camera focus, view, and position while performing their tasks. To help authors produce videos, we introduce Kinectograph, a recording device that automatically pans and tilts to follow specific body parts, e.g., hands, of a user in a video. It utilizes a Kinect depth sensor to track skeletal data and adjusts the camera angle via a 2D pan-tilt gimbal mount. Users control and configure Kinectograph through a tablet application with real-time video preview. An informal user study suggests that users prefer to record and share videos with Kinectograph, as it enables authors to focus on performing their demonstration tasks.	kinect;real-time transcription;structured-light 3d scanner;tablet computer;usability testing;video clip	Derrick Cheng;Pei-Yu Chi;T.

c15a4f8cba3a4d9c6b4de350e57872be457b86be	an interactive image clipping system using hand motion recognition	kinect;image clipping;hand recognition;region recognition	We present an efficient hand recognition algorithm for an interactive image clipping system, which is widely used for environments such as public facilities and security environments where personal capturing devices including mobile phones are not allowed. User-friendly interface and accurate image capturing function are required for an image clipping system. We build the system by combining Microsoft Kinect, HD webcam and projector. The Kinect and webcam are used to capture the motions of users' hand and project is to display the user-selected area from the capturing material. Hand recognition is composed of three steps: (i) the region occupied by users' hand is extracted from an image, (ii) the fingertips of the extracted hand region are analyzed using k-curvature algorithm, and (iii) the height of the fingertip is estimated using the depth image from Kinect. The height of the fingertip informs whether users' finger touched the surface of the target. The region captured by the fingertip is clipped from the image and stored as the target image. The excellence of our hand recognition algorithm is proved through a user test.		Kowoon Lee;Kyungha Min	2015	Inf.

People can use a smartphone camera to capture the code, and then decode it through a dedicated reader application. Specifically, that code stands for concise text, contact information, or a web hyperlink. Its existence assists phone users in keypad typing more easily. This paper proposes an on-street parking fee payment mechanism based on the QR code of an E-bill. People can regard the code as a bill to pay their parking fee, where the parking information is recorded into a remote server by the fee collectors. The main idea of this mechanism is to save on resources such as reducing paper consumption. Simulation results showed that the proposed mobile application provides a new mode for E-bill payment for on-street parking in Taiwan. Furthermore, the said application also serves as an exemplary model for other parking payment methods.	hyperlink;mobile app;mobile phone;qr code;server (computing);simulation;smartphone	Wen Chuan Wu	2014	2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.33	web service;computer vision;computer science;operating system;parking guidance and information;world wide web;computer security;histogram equalization;mobile payment	Mobile	-39.883755637119336	-40.02511358212016	120140

9c060d7d57e9699d81dd82afadb5309c791e84c6	assessing visual search performance in ocular compared to cerebral visual impairment using a virtual reality simulation of human dynamic movement		Virtual reality (VR) can provide robust assessment of cognitive spatial processing skills in individuals with visual impairment. VR combined with objective measures of behavioral performance (i.e., eye tracking) affords a high degree of experimental control, task flexibility, participant engagement, and enhanced data capture. Individuals with visual impairment typically have difficulties identifying people in crowded environments; these difficulties may differ depending on the origin of the visual impairment. Specifically, individuals with cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) may show a greater sensitivity to scenarios of high dynamic visual complexity compared to those with ocular based visual impairment (OVI). To test potential differences in visual search performance, we have developed a first-person perspective VR environment integrated with eye tracking designed to simulate the dynamic movement of humans in a hallway. Participants were tasked with locating a specific target individual walking among a crowd of people moving in various directions in the hallway. To assess the effect of task difficulty, we manipulated factors of crowd density and presence of object clutter within the hallway. Results to date show that both visually impaired groups demonstrate increased variability in search patterns and reaction times as compared to controls. Additionally, performance of the CVI group fluctuates greater as a function of task difficulty. Findings from the current work demonstrate a successful interaction between individuals with visual impairments and VR simulations in assessing high level visual function. Further studies will serve as a theoretical foundation for the creation of new assessment and training paradigms for visually impaired individuals.	clutter;eye tracking;first-person (video games);high-level programming language;labwindows/cvi;ovi (nokia);simulation;spatial variability;virtual reality;visual basic[.net]	Christopher R.

We propose a system based on Virtual and Augmented Reality that has the potential to act as an educational and support tool in everyday tasks for people with cognitive disabilities. Our solution consists of two components: the first that enables users to train for several essential quotidian activities and the second that is meant to offer real time guidance feedback for immediate support. In order to illustrate the functionality of our proposed system, we chose to train and support navigation skills. Thus, we conducted a preliminary study on people with Down Syndrome (DS) based on a navigation task. Our experiment was aimed at evaluating the visual and spatial perception of people with DS when interacting with different elements of our system. We provide a preliminary evaluation that illustrates how people with DS perceive different landmarks and types of visual feedback, in static images and videos. Although we focused our study on people with DS, people with different cognitive disabilities could also benefit from the features of our solution. This analysis is mandatory in the design of a virtual intelligent system with several functionalities that aims at helping disabled people in developing basic knowledge in every day tasks.	artificial intelligence;augmented reality;interaction	Alexandra Covaci;Dean Kramer;Juan Carlos Augusto;Silvia Rus;Andreas Braun	2015	2015 International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2015.14	computer vision;computer-mediated reality;simulation;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-43.06139388205363	-45.35627648984777	120276

One critical aspect is distance perception. When judging distances, compression is a phenomenon where humans tend to underestimate the distance between themselves and target objects (termed egocentric or absolute compression), and between other objects (exocentric or relative compression). Results of studies in virtual worlds rendered through head mounted displays are striking, demonstrating significant distance compression error. Distance compression is a multisensory phenomenon, where both audio and visual stimuli are often compressed with respect to their distances from the observer. In this paper, we propose and test a method for reducing crossmodal distance compression in VEs. We report an empirical evaluation of our method via a study of 3D spatial perception within a virtual reality (VR) head mounted display. Applying our method resulted in more accurate distance perception in a VE at longer range, and suggests a modification that could adaptively compensate for distance compression at both shorter and longer ranges. Our results have a significant and intriguing implication for designers of VEs: an incongruent audiovisual display, i.e. where the audio and visual information is intentionally misaligned, may lead to better spatial perception of a virtual scene.	anomalous experiences;head-mounted display;virtual reality;virtual world	Daniel J.

The Steady Clicks assistance feature suppresses these errors by freezing the cursor during mouse clicks, preventing overlapping button presses and suppressing clicks made while the mouse is moving at a high velocity. Evaluation with eleven target users found that Steady Clicks enabled participants to select targets using significantly fewer attempts. Overall task performance times were significantly improved for the five participants with the highest slip rates. Blocking of overlapping and high velocity clicks also shows promise as an error filter. Nine participants preferred Steady Clicks to the unassisted condition. If used in conjunction with existing techniques for cursor positioning, all of the major sources of clicking errors observed in empirical studies would be addressed, enabling faster and more effective mouse use for those who currently struggle with the standard mouse.	cursor (databases);error-tolerant design;slip (programming language);velocity (software development)	Shari Trewin;Simeon Keates;Karyn Moffatt	2006		10.1145/1168987.1168993	simulation;speech recognition;empirical research	HCI	-46.68542207105543	-45.87832753432296	120647

Our implementation is based upon sensory substitution principle, which dictates that information captured by a sensor is fed to user through a different sensory channel. In our case, a depth sensor is mounted on user's chest which scans the environment in vicinity. The depth information, after being processed, is translated to a tactile image on torso rendered by a two dimension array of actuators. In this way, a mental representation of the obstacles in the scene is created.	cognitive dimensions of notations;mental representation;sensory substitution;structured-light 3d scanner	Dimitris Kalampalikis;Konstantinos Moustakas	2018		10.1145/3200947.3201055	computer vision;mental representation;image processing;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;sensory system;wearable computer;vest;sensory substitution;communication channel	HCI	-42.614897447861914	-42.53846813941456	120860

We used real lines and an opaque illusory surface to compose the Poggendorff configuration, which was presented in an intermittent display method so that the real lines were displayed continuously and the opaque illusory surface was displayed periodically with various duration and interval times. The results showed that the opaque illusory surface required a minimum duration of approximately 220 msec for sustained perception. An interval of as much as 2200 msec was needed to obliterate the perception of the opaque illusory surface. We decided the intermittent display method was effective to directly examine the time course of illusory surface perception. Furthermore, we concluded that we could achieve better understanding of the surface perception mechanism of the human visual system by utilizing the intermittent display method and probing method of the Poggendorff configuration.

While various approaches exist that reduce these errors at recording time, only few methods reduce the errors of a given tracking system after recording. In this paper we introduce a novel correction algorithm that can significantly reduce the drift in recorded gaze data for eye tracking experiments that use static stimuli. The algorithm is entropy-based and needs no prior knowledge about the stimuli shown or the tasks participants accomplish during the experiment.	algorithm;entropy (information theory);experiment;eye tracking;tracking system	Samuel John;Erik Weitnauer;Hendrik Koesling	2012		10.1145/2168556.2168620	computer vision;simulation;computer science;communication	HCI	-43.09377701191834	-51.12880001372293	120969

The multi-modal interaction design utilizes a combination of visual, audio, and laser scanner data for reliable detection and tracking of an interested user. During tracking motion, obstacle avoidance behavior will be activated any time required to ensure safety. Furthermore, user can further assign the robot to interact with other user by speech command.

d1a8f7cebabb6bd75c2998bbbe0e70777c218b9b	head-tracked off-axis perspective projection improves gaze readability of 3d virtual avatars.		Virtual avatars have been employed in many contexts, from simple conversational agents to communicating the internal state and intentions of large robots when interacting with humans. Rarely, however, are they employed in scenarios which require non-verbal communication of spatial information or dynamic interaction from a variety of perspectives. When presented on a flat screen, many illusions and visual artifacts interfere with such applications, which leads to a strong preference for physically-actuated heads and faces. By adjusting the perspective projection used to render 3D avatars to match a vieweru0027s physical perspective, they could provide a useful middle ground between typical 2D/3D avatar representations, which are often ambiguous in their spatial relationships, and physically-actuated heads/faces, which can be difficult to construct or impractical to use in some environments. A user study was conducted to determine to what extent a head-tracked perspective projection scheme was able to mitigate the issues in readability of a 3D avataru0027s expression or gaze target compared to use of a standard perspective projection. To the authorsu0027 knowledge, this is the first user study to perform such a comparison, and the results show not only an overall improvement in viewersu0027 accuracy when attempting to follow the avataru0027s gaze, but a reduction in spatial biases in predictions made from oblique viewing angles.

On the other hand, the virtual space computing technologies enable users to use remote computer resources from their desktop environments through intuitive operations. By combining these two kinds of computing technologies, we can construct a more flexible and general platform for computing in either space. Based on this viewpoint, we have realized a communication environment, called the 'invisible person' environment, where virtual space and real space are strongly associated. In this paper, we discuss the system architecture of this environment. The policies that we took in its design are 1) reduction to a feasible design at present, 2) wide-spread popularity to become an invisible person, and 3) emphasis on the realization of communication rather than the concrete analysis and accurate presentation of the real space. These policies are reflected on our system design where we provide users with several kinds of browsers for the flexibility of their operations.

Using touch on bare skin to issue commands, however, requires users to recall the location of items without direct visual feedback. We present an in-depth study in which participants placed 30 items on the hand and forearm and attempted to recall their locations. We found that participants used a variety of landmarks, personal associations, and semantic groupings in placing the items on the skin. Although participants most frequently used anatomical landmarks (e.g., fingers, joints, and nails), recall rates were higher for items placed on personal landmarks, including scars and tattoos. We further found that personal associations between items improved recall, and that participants often grouped important items in similar areas, such as family members on the nails. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for design of skin-based interfaces.	high availability;mobile phone;scar (physics);skin (computing);smartwatch	Joanna Bergstrom-Lehtovirta;Sebastian Boring;Kasper HornbÃ¦k	2017		10.1145/3025453.3026030	multimedia;interface design;recall;computer science	HCI	-45.663887267195875	-44.009097024954826	121490

This study investigates motion detection thresholds for various types of label movement in realistic and complex virtual environments, which can be helpful for designing less salient and disturbing algorithms. Our results show that label movement in stereoscopic depth is shown to be less noticeable than similar lateral monoscopic movement, inherent to 2D label placement algorithms. Furthermore, label movement can be introduced more readily into the visual periphery (over 15Â° eccentricity) because of reduced sensitivity in this region. Moreover, under the realistic viewing conditions that we used, motion of isolated labels is more easily detected than that of overlapping labels. This perhaps counterintuitive finding may be explained by visual masking due to the visual clutter arising from the label overlap. The quantitative description of the findings presented in this paper should be useful not only for label placement applications, but also for any cluttered AR or VR application in which designers wish to control the users' visual attention, either making text labels more or less noticeable as needed.	algorithm;ar (unix);automatic label placement;clutter;distance (graph theory);lateral computing;lateral thinking;stereoscopy;virtual reality	Stephen D.

Directory and Google advanced search. The effect or three general usability criteria for the elderly, simplicity, difficulties using the mouse and cautious clicking and reading, on the total search time older people spend seeking complex online information with the three strategies has been studied. The hypothesis that basic search is the fastest strategy because it meets the three usability criteria, unlike the other two strategies, is confirmed.

22cd3c2c1c96783a725bb59c06f3b82279326180	the effects of operator spatial perception and sensory feedback on human-robot teleoperation performance	sensory feedback;spatial perception	Teleoperation requires a complex combination of the operator's cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills. Our experiment tested the ability of subjects to teleoperate a remote robot under different conditions of increasing sensory feedback. We also evaluated each operator's spatial perception skills using a battery of tests to understand the effect of spatial perception on the operator's ability to perform the teleoperation task. The experiment showed that the spatial ability of an operatoras reflected by a test battery of two spatial recognition and two spatial manipulation testswas significantly correlated with the ability to teleoperate the robot through a maze. Surprisingly, providing different combinations of visual, auditory, and vibrotactile feedback to the operator did not significantly change performance. However, there was an interaction between spatial ability and feedback condition that affected teleoperation performance.	feedback;robot;simulation;virtual reality;aptitude	Corinna E.

The device is a combination of camera-based multitouch sensing and a supporting therapeutic software application that advances the treatment, provides feedback, and records a user's progress. The image-based analysis of hand position provided by a Microsoft Surface is used as an input into a tabletop game environment. Tailored image analysis algorithms assess rehabilitative hand movements. Visual feedback is provided in a game context. Experiments were conducted in a sub-acute rehabilitation center. Preliminary user studies with a stroke-afflicted population determined essential design criteria. Hand and wrist sensing, as well as the goals of the supporting game environment, engage therapeutic flexion and extension as defined by consulted physicians. Participants valued personalization of the activity, novelty, reward and the ability to work at their own pace in an otherwise repetitive therapeutic task. A """"character"""" - game element personifying the participant's movement - was uniquely motivating relative to the media available in the typical therapeutic routine."""	algorithm;image analysis;multi-touch;personalization;usability testing	Cati N.

Assuming that the human cognitive process is represented as a series of associated events, we proposed a virtually touchable space associated with robotic hands. Additionally, in a humanoid robot, the motions of two arms are considered as a crucial non-verbal communication channel because large spatial changes capture the attention of a human agent. Additionally, virtual spaces related to certain events are described by robotic hands. The concept of virtual spaces is tested with regard to the expression of the robot's cognitive process with a combination of predefined motion sets.	channel (communications);coat of arms;cognition;humanoid robot;robotic arm	Jeong-Yean Yang;Dong-Soo Kwon	2014	2014 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2014.7057497	computer vision;simulation;shape;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;social robot;robot control	Robotics	-34.25695488581999	-40.44417237905373	122019

Producing perhaps millions of unique versions of essentially the same document not only presents challenges to the printing process but also disrupts the standard quality control procedures. The quality of the alignment in each document can easily distinguish professionally looking documents from amateur designs and some computer generated layouts. A multicomponent measure of document alignment and regularity, derived directly from designer knowledge, is developed and presented in computable form. The measure includes: edge quality, page connectivity, grid regularity and alignment statistics. It is clear that these components may have different levels of importance, relevance and acceptability for various document types and classes, thus the proposed measure should always be evaluated against the requirements of the desired class of documents.	computable function;display resolution;document;information extraction;path ordering (term rewriting);personalization;printing;relevance;requirement;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;supervised learning;while	Helen Balinsky;Anthony Wiley;Matthew C.

One such system that is presented here, See ColOr, is a dedicated interface part of a mobility aid for visually impaired people. It transforms a small portion of a colored video image into spatialized instrument sounds. In this work the purpose is to verify the hypothesis that sounds from musical instruments provide an alternative way to vision for obtaining color information from the environment. We introduce an experiment in which several participants try to match pairs of colored socks by pointing a head mounted camera and by listening to the generated sounds. Our experiments demonstrated that blindfolded individuals were able to accurately match pairs of colored socks. The advantage of the See ColOr interface is that it allows the user to receive a feed-back auditory signal from the environment and its colors, promptly. Our perceptual auditory coding of pixel values opens the opportunity to achieve more complicated experiments related to vision tasks, such as perceiving the environment by interpreting its colors.	color;experiment;feedback;pixel;socks	Guido Bologna;BenoÃ®t Deville;Michel Vinckenbosch;Thierry Pun	2008	2008 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4634014	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;artificial neural network	Vision	-43.00281873349263	-44.69932281211396	122310

A signpost is usually installed at each fork of a path and tells people which fork they should take. Our system locates the userâs position by reading visual markers, which represent signposts. After that, it retrieves floor maps from the database and allows the user to turn around seeing labels from the perspective of the userâs position, which are overlaid on the real world. It also navigates the userâs way not only at the signpost but also between signposts by allowing the user to move around in the corresponding virtual world. From an experiment in usability, our system demonstrated good results for indoor navigation.

Modern work environments strive to improve these conditions by better selection of luminaires (fixtures), wall, floor, and furniture colour and texture, and intelligent lighting control that ensures that occupants each receive the proper amount of light needed at their workstations for the task at hand. Daylight infiltration is generally good for occupant comfort, and provides opportunities to """"harvest"""" this daylight and save energy on electric lighting, provided that it is harnessed in a way that it does not over illuminate or cause glare. Building an intelligent lighting control system is challenging due to incompatible or sometimes conflicting lighting preferences from adjacent people or areas. Some office environments can be additionally challenging because of complex geometries, time-varying nondeterministic daylight contributions through windows, and glare. Here we address the challenges of meeting users' individual lighting preferences using a highly accurate illumination model to enable balancing the various lighting requirements among spatially grouped task areas, while minimizing the energy needed to do so (and in the future, minimizing the number of wireless sensors needed for this application). We propose an illumination model-based method and algorithm for intelligent open-loop lighting control, and present the results of a simulation study using a simplistic virtual room model to demonstrate the validity of our method.

Based upon Wicken's Multiple Resource Theory (MRT), information delivered using multiple modalities (i.e., visual and tactile) could be more effective than communicating the same information through a single modality. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare user effectiveness when using visual-tactile task feedback (a multimodality) to using only visual task feedback (a single modality). Results indicate that using visual-tactile feedback enhances task effectiveness more so than visual feedback (g = .38). When assessing different criteria, visual-tactile feedback is particularly effective at reducing reaction time (g = .631) and increasing performance (g = .618). Follow up moderator analyses indicate that visual-tactile feedback is more effective when workload is high (g = .844) and multiple tasks are being performed (g = .767). Implications of results are discussed in the paper.	cognition;google moderator;information display systems;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);multimodal interaction;visual basic[.net]	Matthew S.

We introduce our edutainment tool called Magic Stick that helps children learn about new objects by providing their names associated by visual representations regarding these objects. Children's parents or teachers can pick the entities they would like their children to learn about by simply attaching RFID tags to these entities. Afterwards, they can customize the type of information and visualizations related to these entities through the use of a friendly GUI designed for this purpose. In our study with young children, we found that the Magic Stick created an entertaining atmosphere among children and greatly engaged them in learning.	educational entertainment;entity;graphical user interface;radio-frequency identification;tangible user interface	Ali Karime;M.

Specifically, both force and vibrotactile feedback have been evaluated, as well as the direct use of the sense of touch, to detect different textures. To this end, a force feedback Phantom device, a custom built vibrotactile data glove and paper palpable prototypes, which represent an ideal model of tactile feedback, have been compared. These three methods have been used to detect two types of patterns, one formed by different geometrical shapes, and the other with different grooves width. Results show that the vibrotactile data glove has a notable behaviour in the detection of textures where the frequency of tactile stimuli varies, and it is even useful to detect more complex textures.	algorithm;design of experiments;dynamic problem (algorithms);effective method;feedback;haptic technology;imaging phantom;virtual reality;wired glove	Jonatan MartÃ­nez;Diego MartÃ­nez;JosÃ© Pascual Molina;Pascual GonzÃ¡lez;Arturo S.

According to the naive intuition, using real objects that has similar shapes as in VR is the better way than using controllers like mouses or game controllers to manipulate objects showed in VR. But is it true? To make it clear, we develop an game system like tower defense. Users played the game in two ways, one is using real objects, the other is using mouse to place """"Towers"""". As the result of questionnaire after game plays, """"easy to use"""" factor was lower for the real objects operation mainly because of the technical difficulties like object detection failure.

The method consists of the execution of a series of tasks on that interface, which is subsequently systematically analyzed to identify breakdowns in the usersâ actions. The systematic analysis of breakdowns is allowed by the support of video-coding software (The Observer by Noldus). This method is described on its theoretical bases and then applied to the evaluation of a natural interface, a walk-in-place locomotion system for virtual spaces called Superfeet. The procedure is comparative, since Superfeet is compared to two locomotion devices, Superfeet enhanced with headtracker and a more traditional Joypad. The test involves 36 participants (mean ageÂ =Â 23.68, SDÂ =Â 3.14). The outcomes of the breakdown analysis are illustrated at a progressively finer level of granularity from the amount and length of breakdowns, to the circumstances of the breakdowns, to the type of actions involved in the breakdowns. The potential of this procedure for usability studies is finally synthesized.	in-place algorithm;joystick;natural mapping (interface design);natural user interface;top-down and bottom-up design;unfolding (dsp implementation);unintended consequences;usability testing;vagueness;video content analysis	Luciano Gamberini;Anna Spagnolli;Lisa Prontu;Sarah Furlan;Francesco Martino;Beatriz Rey;Mariano AlcaÃ±iz Raya;JosÃ© Antonio Lozano	2011	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-011-0476-z	simulation;naturalness;usability;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-47.56015772533584	-47.523146271887065	123123

However, strategic vantage points must often be revisited repeatedly, adding time and error and taxing memory. We describe a new approach that allows users to take snapshots of augmented scenes that can be virtually revisited at later times. The system stores still images of scenes along with camera poses, so that augmentations remain dynamic and interactive. Users can manipulate virtual objects while viewing snapshots, instead of moving to real-world views. We present a study comparing performance in snapshot and live mode conditions in a task in which a virtual object must be aligned with two pairs of physical objects. Proper alignment requires sequentially visiting two viewpoints. Participants completed the alignment task significantly faster and more accurately using snapshots than when using the live mode. Moreover, participants preferred manipulating virtual objects using snapshots to the live mode.	ar (unix);augmented reality;broadcast domain;habbo;ibm notes;interaction technique;microsoft xna;mobile device;overhead (computing);prototype;snapshot (computer storage);usability testing	Mengu Sukan;Steven K.

Using the PlayStation 3 game console coupled with the PlayStation Move Controller, we explored five different games that combine 3D stereo and 3D spatial interaction. For each game, quantitative and qualitative measures were taken to determine if users performed better and learned faster in the experimental group (3D stereo display) than in the control group (2D display). A game expertise pre-questionnaire was used to classify participants into beginners and expert game player categories to analyze a possible impact on performance differences. The results show two cases where the 3D stereo display did help participants perform significantly better than with a 2D display. For the first time, we can report a positive effect on gaming performance based on stereoscopic vision, although reserved to isolated tasks and depending on game expertise. We discuss the reasons behind these findings and provide recommendations for game designers who want to make use of 3D stereoscopic vision and 3D motion control to enhance game experiences.	experiment;motion capture;motion controller;playstation 3;playstation move;polystation;stereo display;stereopsis;stereoscopy	Arun Kulshreshth;Jonas Schild;Joseph J.

However interfaces that use a pen alone can be slow and inefficient. Thus most pen interfaces also support keyboard and mouse input. Multi-modal input exponentially increases the complexity of the design and usability of these systems. Here we describe our usability testing experiences of four different pen-dominant software tools. One is designed for a digital whiteboard, two for a Tablet PC and the last for a Tablet PC coupled to a haptic pen. Our experiences suggest that pen only input is difficult to achieve with a standard operating system because the pen is appreciably overloaded. However, in situations where a keyboard and mouse is convenient, users tolerate the inefficient of pen interaction in exchange for convenience.	computer mouse;digital pen;game controller;haptic technology;interactive whiteboard;modal logic;operating system;pen computing;tablet computer;usability testing	Beryl Plimmer	2008	Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces	10.1007/s12193-008-0002-4	active pen;natural computing;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia;handwriting recognition;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-48.21302733575818	-41.87100870873743	123228

To facilitate reading activities despite these limitations, reading with Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) has been shown to be feasible. However, when text is presented in rapid sequence, single words are easily missed due to blinking or briefly glancing up from the screen. This gets worse the more the reader is engaged in a secondary task, such as walking. To give implicit control over the reading flow we combined an RSVP reading application on a smartwatch with a head-worn eye tracker. When the reading flow is briefly interrupted, the text presentation automatically pauses or backtracks. In a user study with 15 participants we show that using eye tracking in combination with RSVP increases users' comprehension compared to a touch-based UI to control the text presentation. We argue that eye tracking will be a valuable extension for future smartwatch interaction.	backtracking;display size;eye tracking;interrupt;mobile device;mobile interaction;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);prototype;smartwatch;usb on-the-go;usability testing;user interface	Tilman Dingler;Rufat Rzayev;Valentin Schwind;Niels Henze	2016		10.1145/2971763.2971794	computer vision;eye tracking;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-46.88901277091498	-43.88360233574902	123406

The project finished in December 1996. The objective of the project was the development of an advanced wheelchair with omnidirectional manoeuvrability and navigational intelligence that is well suited for vocational rehabilitation. It provides an opportunity of intuitive wheelchair control to people with severe physical or multiple (incl. mental) handicap. Cramped offices are made accessible by the small outline, high mobility and navigational support of the chair. The userâs safety and driving accuracy are guaranteed by a novel sensor system and navigation modules.

Other relevant types of interaction include virtual navigation, text entry, and direct manipulation of control widgets. However, most techniques for remotely acquiring targets with high precision have studied remote pointing in isolation, focusing on pointing efficiency and ignoring the need to support these other types of interaction. We investigate high-precision pointing techniques capable of acquiring targets as small as 4 millimeters on a 5.5 meters wide display while leaving up to 93 % of a typical tablet device's screen space available for task-specific widgets. We compare these techniques to state-of-the-art distant pointing techniques and show that two of our techniques, a purely relative one and one that uses head orientation, perform as well or better than the best pointing-only input techniques while using a fraction of the interaction resources.	direct manipulation interface;glossary of computer graphics;image resolution;mobile device;tablet computer	Mathieu Nancel;Olivier Chapuis;Emmanuel Pietriga;Xing-Dong Yang;Pourang Irani;Michel Beaudouin-Lafon	2013		10.1145/2470654.2470773	computer vision;simulation;computer science;operating system;mobile device	HCI	-44.35630312487869	-42.49873589626929	123979

Now a standard feature of most smart phones, MEMS-based motion tracking enhances the user interface by allowing response to user motions, complements the GPS receiver by providing dead-reckoning indoor navigation and supporting location-based services, and holds the promise of enabling handset optical image stabilization in next-generation handsets by virtue of its lower cost and small form factor. This tutorial provides an overview of MEMS technology and describes the essential features of the mechanical systems underlying the most common sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes. It also highlights some fundamental trade-offs related to mechanical system dynamics, force and charge transduction methods, and their implications for the mixed-signal systems that process the sensor outputs. The presentation of an energy-based metric allows a comparison of the performance of competing sensor solutions. For each type of sensor, descriptions of the underlying mechanical theory, canonical sensor architectures, and key design challenges are also presented. Finally, the tutorial reviews multisensor silicon MEMS/CMOS monolithic integration, which is driving the cost and form factor reduction behind the current proliferation of these devices.	cmos;dead reckoning;global positioning system;image;location-based service;microelectromechanical systems;mixed-signal integrated circuit;sensor;small form factor;smartphone;system dynamics;tablet computer;television;toys;transduction (machine learning);user interface;wearable computer	Derek K.

The upcoming HTML5 and CSS3 standards propose features that can be used to build more flexible web page layouts, but their potential to accommodate a wider range of display environments is currently relatively unexplored. We examine the proposed standards to identify the most promising features and report on experiments with a number of adaptive layout mechanisms that support the required forms of adaptation to take advantage of greater screen real estates, such as automated scaling of text and media. Special attention is given to the effective use of multi-column layout, a brand new feature for web design that contributes to optimising the space occupied by text, but at the same time still poses problems in predominantly continuous vertical-scrolling browsing behaviours. The proposed solutions were integrated in a flexible layout template that was then applied to an existing news web site and tested on users to identify the adaptive features that best support reading comfort and efficiency.	blog;bundle adjustment;cascading style sheets;client-side;display size;experiment;html5;image resolution;image scaling;scrolling;task manager;user experience;web application;web content;web design;web developer;web page;webmail;wiki	Michael Nebeling;Fabrice Matulic;Lucas Streit;Moira C.

The relevant restrictions are a result of the input function, i.e. the normal TV remote control. Researchers have proposed various solutions for improving the normal TV remote control. However, these are difficult to be in practice now. Nowadays, it has been established that dual-device services may be helpful for TLearning. These studies usually lay more emphasis and stress on the cooperation of output function, while ignoring the input function of the cooperative device. Thus, this study is aimed at improving the normal TV remote control for advanced T-Learning. In the present study, an advanced T-Learning framework named as âDDRC T-Learning Frameworkâ is proposed which is based on M2M cooperation to improve the input function in T-Learning., In the DDRC T-Learning Framework, the touch screen of a handheld device can be effectively used by the learner as an advanced TV remote controller for interactive T-Learning.	m2m (eclipse);mobile device;remote control;touchscreen	Tzu-Chih Chung;Li-Ya Tseng	2010	JDCTA		computer science;remote control	HCI	-41.66459599398853	-45.35103861093937	124324

In this paper we present a new interaction metaphor for fast, accurate and comfortable manipulation of external GUIs displayed as texture-mapped rectangles. The main idea is to decouple the motor space from the visual space so that the external application can be manipulated within a user-defined working volume whose location and size is completely independent from the application's visual representation. This decoupling is accomplished through a virtual pad which receives user actions and maps them into cursor movements. The main advantage of our approach is that both the working space and the visual space can be adjusted independently to suit user preferences. This allows users to seamlessly balance speed and accuracy without affecting the visual representation of the application's GUI. We have implemented an interaction technique adopting our metaphor in combination with a pointing technique and we have evaluated its effectiveness in terms of task performance and user preference. Our experiments indicate that the proposed technique increases user's comfort while providing dynamic management of speed/accuracy tradeoff	coupling (computer programming);cursor (databases);experiment;graphical user interface;interaction technique;map;microsoft windows;texture mapping;user (computing);workspace	Carlos AndÃºjar;Ferran Argelaguet	2007	2007 IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces	10.1109/3DUI.2007.340781	computer vision;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science	Visualization	-43.2361209994352	-40.03266941957139	124342

In other words, it makes a pair of users, one outdoors and the other indoors, feel as if they are going outside together. To achieve this, it is important that both users (1) can freely peruse the outdoor user's surroundings, (2) can see what the outdoor user is looking at, and (3) can focus together on the same point. To realize these features, we have designed and implemented a system called WithYou. It consists of two subsystems: a wearable system for the outdoor user and an immersive space for the indoor user. The indoor user wears an HMD and watches video from a Pan/Tilt/Zoom camera mounted on the outdoor user's chest. Thus, the indoor user can look around by simply turning his/her head to the left or right. The orientation of the outdoor user's face is also displayed on the HMD screen to indicate where he/she is looking. In the preliminary test, both users experienced the Out Together Feeling to some extent.	head-mounted display;panâtiltâzoom camera;wearable computer	Ching-Tzun Chang;Shin Takahashi;Jiro Tanaka	2012		10.1145/2254556.2254617	humanârobot interaction;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;communications system	HCI	-43.19857785924723	-44.25683197205171	124403

The underlying algorithm accounts for the type and physical properties of the different game components. An area of influence, which identifies the possible space of interaction, is identified for each component. The influence areas of all components in a given design are then merged considering the componentsâ type and the context information. The tool can be used offline where complete designs are analyzed and the final interactive space is projected, and online where edits in the interactive space are projected on the canvas in realtime permitting continuous assistance for game designers and providing informative feedback about playability.	airplane mode;algorithm;artificial intelligence;canvas element;entity;information;interaction;internet access;online and offline;real-time web;virtual world	Mohammad Shaker;Noor Shaker;Mohamed Abou-Zleikha;Julian Togelius	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_35	simulation;video game design;dykstra's projection algorithm	HCI	-44.68199501048305	-38.986820619556745	124618

We present here our approach to simulating the surface of a frozen pond, including ice cracking under increased foot pressure. This serves as a compelling example of a wearable mobile augmented foot-based surface simulator, whose response varies as a function of applied foot pressure. To enhance the illusion, we render multi-sensory feedback, comprising audio, visual, and haptic effects.

While pursuits have been evaluated in controlled laboratory studies, the technique has not yet been evaluated with respect to usability in the wild. We report on a field study in which we deployed a game on a public display where participants used pursuits to select fish moving in linear and circular trajectories at different speeds. The study ran for two days in a busy computer lab resulting in a total of 56 interactions. Results from our study show that linear trajectories are statistically faster to select via pursuits than circular trajectories. We also found that pursuits is well perceived by users who find it fast and responsive.	computer lab;field research;interaction;kinetic data structure;spontaneous order;usability	Mohamed Khamis;Florian Alt;Andreas Bulling	2015		10.1145/2800835.2804335	computer vision;simulation;smooth pursuit;field research	HCI	-46.062120647621065	-43.68608983792438	125051

The feel of manual controls, such as knobs, sliders, and buttons, becomes critical when these controls are used in certain settings. Appropriate feel enables designers to create consistent control behaviors that lead to improved usability and safety. For example, a heavy knob with stiff detents for a power plant boiler setting may afford better feedback and safer operations, whereas subtle detents in an automobile radio volume knob may afford improved ergonomics and driver attention to the road. To assess the quality of our identification method, we compared previously reported automated model captures for five real mechanical reference knobs with captures by novice and expert human participants who were asked to adjust four parameters of a rendered knob model to match the feel of each reference knob. Participants indicated their satisfaction with the matches their renderings produced. We observed similar relative inertia, friction, detent strength, and detent spacing parameterizations by human experts and our automatic estimation methods. Qualitative results provided insight on users' strategies and confidence. While experts (but not novices) were better able to ascertain an underlying model in the presence of unmodeled dynamics, the objective algorithm outperformed all humans when an appropriate physical model was used. Our studies demonstrate that automated model identification can capture knob dynamics as perceived by a human, and they also establish limits to that ability; they comprise a step towards pragmatic design guidelines for embedded physical interfaces in which methodological expedience is informed by human perceptual requirements.	algorithm;behavior;control knob;embedded system;embedding;friction;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;human factors and ergonomics;knob device component;potentiometer;power plants;requirement;spacing;system identification;usability	Colin Swindells;Karon E.

With the increase of touch devices, gesture-based authentication behaviour becomes more important. This paper analyzes the distinctness of a gesture in a touch base mobile device. Analysis show that specific user has distinct gesture of different fingers. Experimental study reveals that finger accuracy in a gesture-based authentication is increased by an individual's index finger and thumbs.

In recent years, many 3D display methods that enable parallax images to be seen with the naked eye have been developed. In addition, there has been an increase in research to design interfaces that enable humans to intuitively interact with and operate 3D objects using their hands. However, realizing 3D object interaction as if the user is actually touching the object in the real world is quite difficult. One of the reasons for this is that the screen shape in conventional methods is restricted to a flat panel. In addition, it is difficult to achieve a balance between displaying the 3D image and sensing the user input. Therefore, we propose a novel full-parallax 3D display system that is suitable for interactive 3D applications. We call this system RePro3D. Our approach is based on a retro-reflective projection technology[Inami et al. 2000]. A number of images from a projector array are projected onto the retro-reflective screen. When a user looks at the screen through a half mirror, he or she, without the use of glasses, can view a 3D image that has motion parallax. We can choose the screen shape depending on the application. Image correction according to the screen shape is not required. Consequently, we can design a touch-sensitive soft screen, a complexly curved screen, or a screen with an automatically moving surface. RePro3D has a sensor function to recognize the user input. Some interactive features, such as operation of 3D objects, can be achieved by using it.	curved screen;flat panel display;interactivity;parallax barrier;stereo display;stereoscopy;touchscreen;video projector	Takumi Yoshida;Sho Kamuro;Kouta Minamizawa;Hideaki Nii;Susumu Tachi	2010		10.1145/1836821.1836841	parallax;parallax barrier;stereoscopy;computer vision;simulation;stereo display;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.28195010196626	-39.69512656842912	125804

The system is based on cheap off-the-shelf components, is easy to deploy, and features a large range of coverage. It is capable of tracking a large number of tags without significant performance impact, since the sampling rate remains constant with an increasing number of tags. A test installation of the system has been evaluated in a lecture hall. The positioning system is utilized by our audio-centric user terminal called Talking Assistant.

f4dbcab636f2ee03466f32a27cebb5777629aa5d	isee: an android application for the assistance of the visually impaired		Smart phone technology and mobile applications have become an indispensable part of our daily life. The primary use however, is targeted towards social media and photography. While some camera-based approaches provided partial solutions for the visually impaired, they still constitute a cumbersome process for the user. iSee is an Android based application that benefits from the commercially available technology to help the visually impaired people improve their day-to-day activities. A single screen tap in iSee is able to serve as a virtual eye by providing a sense of seeing to the blind person by audibly communicating the object(s) names and description. iSee employs efficient object recognition algorithms based on FAST and BRIEF. Implementation results are promising and allow iSee to constitute a basis for more advanced applications.

764193fc925e817a3afe5930e1399268c9eaa136	quick bootstrapping of a personalized gaze model from real-use interactions		Understanding human visual attention is essential for understanding human cognition, which in turn benefits human--computer interaction. Recent work has demonstrated a Personalized, Auto-Calibrating Eye-tracking (PACE) system, which makes it possible to achieve accurate gaze estimation using only an off-the-shelf webcam by identifying and collecting data implicitly from user interaction events. However, this method is constrained by the need for large amounts of well-annotated data. We thus present fast-PACE, an adaptation to PACE that exploits knowledge from existing data from different users to accelerate the learning speed of the personalized model. The result is an adaptive, data-driven approach that continuously âlearnsâ its user and recalibrates, adapts, and improves with additional usage by a user. Experimental evaluations of fast-PACE demonstrate its competitive accuracy in iris localization, validity of alignment identification between gaze and interactions, and effectiveness of gaze transfer. In general, fast-PACE achieves an initial visual error of 3.98 degrees and then steadily improves to 2.52 degrees given incremental interaction-informed data. Our performance is comparable to state-of-the-art, but without the need for explicit training or calibration. Our technique addresses the data quality and quantity problems. It therefore has the potential to enable comprehensive gaze-aware applications in the wild.	aggregate data;cognition;data acquisition;data quality;data validation;eye tracking;humanâcomputer interaction;interactive computing;personalization;tracking system;webcam	Michael Xuelin Huang;Jiajia Li;Grace Ngai;Hong Va Leong	2018	ACM TIST	10.1145/3156682	machine learning;gaze;data mining;artificial intelligence;data validation;bootstrapping;exploit;computer science;cognition;data quality	HCI	-37.17558708155553	-47.6017849574747	126363

Both these ideas converge into ubiquitous computing the Digital Desk is an example of this idea. In this paper we concentrate on an input device for the Digital Desk, namely the userâs fingertip, which is made to act like a mouse. Tracking such an input device is common to a number of augmented reality environments and involves vision and motion analysis. However, previous attempts have focused more on the vision aspect of tracking general objects than on using the information already known about the userâs hand, which is the approach taken here. We adopted the goal of tracking the userâs fingertip as fast as possible in real-time so the system could be compared with other input devices, using models such as Fittsâ Law. Our system is shown to comply with the law adequately.	augmented reality;computer mouse;converge;finger tracking;fitts's law;input device;real-time clock;ubiquitous computing	Thomas Brown;Richard C.

Although capable of displaying complex content, their extremely small screens poorly match many of the touchscreen interaction techniques dominant on larger mobile devices. Addressing this problem, this paper presents beating gestures, a novel form of input based on pairs of simultaneous or rapidly sequential and overlapping screen taps made by the index and middle finger of one hand. Distinguished simply by their temporal sequence and relative left/right position these gestures are designed explicitly for the very small screens (approx. 40mm square) of smartwatches and to operate without interfering with regular single touch input. This paper presents the design of beating gestures and a rigorous empirical study that characterizes how users perform them -- in a mean of 355ms and with an error rate of 5.5%. We also derive thresholds for reliably distinguishing between simultaneous (under 30ms) and sequential (under 400ms) pairs of screen touches or releases. We then present five interface designs and evaluate them in a qualitative study in which users report valuing the speed and ready availability of beating gestures.	approximation;interaction technique;mobile device;smartwatch;touchscreen	Ian Oakley;Doyoung Lee;Md.

The enabling technology is a wireless tag which acts as a radio frequency identity and geometry (RFIG) transponder. We show how addition of a photo-sensor to a wireless tag significantly extends its functionality to allow geometric operations - such as finding the 3D position of a tag, or detecting change in the shape of a tagged object. Tag data is presented to the user by direct projection using a handheld locale-aware mobile projector. We introduce a novel technique that we call interactive projection to allow a user to interact with projected information e.g. to navigate or update the projected information.The ideas are demonstrated using objects with active radio frequency (RF) tags. But the work was motivated by the advent of unpowered passive-RFID, a technology that promises to have significant impact in real-world applications. We discuss how our current prototypes could evolve to passive-RFID in the future.	interaction;movie projector;self-documenting code;shader lamps	Ramesh Raskar;Paul A.

One potential design approach to improve the learnability of mobile devices is a Multi-Layered (ML) interface, where novice users start with a reduced-functionality interface layer that only allows them to perform basic tasks, before progressing to a more complex interface layer when they are comfortable. We studied the effects of a ML interface on older adultsâ performance in learning tasks on a mobile device. We conducted a controlled experiment with 16 older (ages 65--81) and 16 younger participants (age 21--36), who performed tasks on either a 2-layer or a nonlayered (control) address book application, implemented on a commercial smart phone. We found that the ML interfaceâs Reduced-Functionality layer, compared to the controlâs Full-Functionality layer, better helped users to master a set of basic tasks and to retain that ability 30 minutes later. When users transitioned from the Reduced-Functionality to the Full-Functionality interface layer, their performance on the previously learned tasks was negatively affected, but no negative impact was found on learning new, advanced tasks. Overall, the ML interface provided greater benefit for older participants than for younger participants in terms of task completion time during initial learning, perceived complexity, and preference. We discuss how the ML interface approach is suitable for improving the learnability of mobile applications, particularly for older adults.	learnability;mobile app;mobile computing;mobile device;smartphone	Rock Leung;Leah Findlater;Joanna McGrenere;Peter Graf;Justine Yang	2010	TACCESS	10.1145/1838562.1838563	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia;mobile computing	HCI	-47.42764805960017	-45.282908958425566	126951
4ad953bb67848c80d00641ac9668ddbda8ce113b	headgesture: hands-free input approach leveraging head movements for hmd devices		We propose HeadGesture, a hands-free input approach to interact with Head Mounted Display (HMD) devices. Using HeadGesture, users do not need to raise their arms to perform gestures or operate remote controllers in the air. Instead, they perform simple gestures with head movement to interact with the devices. In this way, users' hands are free to perform other tasks, e.g., taking notes or manipulating tools. This approach also reduces the hand occlusion of the field of view [11] and alleviates arm fatigue [7]. However, one main challenge for HeadGesture is to distinguish the defined gestures from unintentional movements. To generate intuitive gestures and address the issue of gesture recognition, we proceed through a process of Exploration - Design - Implementation - Evaluation. We first design the gesture set through experiments on gesture space exploration and gesture elicitation with users. Then, we implement algorithms to recognize the gestures, including gesture segmentation, data reformation and unification, feature extraction, and machine learning based classification. Finally, we evaluate user performance of HeadGesture in the target selection experiment and application tests. The results demonstrate that the performance of HeadGesture is comparable to mid-air hand gestures, measured by completion time. Additionally, users feel significantly less fatigue than when using hand gestures and can learn and remember the gestures easily. Based on these findings, we expect HeadGesture to be an efficient supplementary input approach for HMD devices.

In the motivation, we state the purpose of this specific platform, which aims to balance ease-of-use (learning, setup, initialization), size, speed, flexibility and cost, aimed at wearable and ultra-mobile prototyping where fast reaction is needed (e.g. in controlling sound), and we mention general issues facing this category of embodied interaction design tools. We briefly present the platform, both regarding hardware and software. In the evaluation, we present our experiences with the platform both in design projects and in teaching. We conclude that DUL Radio was the preferred platform for sketching sensor-based interaction compared to other solutions, and that it does seem to be a relatively easy-to-use tool, but that there are many ways to improve it. Target users include designers, students, artists etc. with minimal programming and hardware skills, but this paper addresses the issues with designing the tools, which includes some technical considerations.	computer hardware;dialup users list;interaction design;sensor;wearable computer	Martin Brynskov;Rasmus B.

We present a concept of a collaborative infrastructure which generates a common operation picture in realtime. A complex, stressful and uncommon situation like an MCI creates strong psychological influences and burdens on the rescue workers. Based on our psychological findings we derived eleven special requirements for efficient and intuitive user interfaces in unstable, time-critical emergency situations. Taking the requirements into consideration we developed a concept to overcome the MCI through the combination of multiple devices. The devices are carefully chosen according to the task of the EMS personnel in the field as well as in the incident command post. Three different interfaces - PDAs for the rescue units in the field, tablet PCs for the incident commanders and a multitouch table in the incident command post - help the entire rescue team to gain efficient situational awareness.	control theory;multi-touch;personal digital assistant;requirement;rugged computer;tablet computer;user interface;user-centered design;vii;window of opportunity	Eva Artinger;Patrick Maier;Tayfur Coskun;Simon Nestler;Mareike MÃ¤hler;Yeliz Yildirim-Krannig;Fabian Wucholt;Florian Echtler;Gudrun Klinker	2012	2012 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth) and Workshops		embedded system;lead;scalability;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;irrigation;user interface;computer security	HCI	-48.216965428770294	-46.80817539774647	127171

The interface provides a turntable as walking platform, on top of which users will stand at its center, and facing a large screen, to perform life-like walking actions that steer their navigation through the virtual environment. Steering actions are tracked seamlessly without attachment to the body through a set of pressure sensors embedded within the turntable and a computer vision system. For instance, in place stepping is treated as a gesture indicating the intention to move forward. Rotation about the body's vertical axis is treated as a gesture changing the walking direction. However, as large screens are usually limited in size and do not allow a surrounding projection, a large turning action may put users in a visual-less situation, which hamper considerably the effectiveness of the walking experience. To avoid such case and keep users always provided with sufficient visual feedback, the turntable will passively and smoothly rotate in opposite direction of users' turning. Rotation speed and acceleration of the turntable are well optimized to keep users well balanced and easily withstand the passive rotation. The interface is shown to be easy and simple to use in virtual environments equipped with large screen.	attachments;computer vision;embedded system;gesture recognition;in-place algorithm;optic axis of a crystal;sensor;smoothing;stepping level;virtual reality	Laroussi Bouguila;Masahiro Ishii;Makoto Sato	2002		10.1145/1556262.1556299	computer vision;simulation;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;pressure sensor;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.502886562706806	-48.38176195602664	127192

The visual requirements of their experimental tasks were similar to those needed for visually-guided manual assembly of aircraft wire harnesses. In the first experiment subjects visually traced wire paths with a head-referenced cursor, subjectively rated aspects of viewing, and had their vision tested before and after monocular, biocular, or stereo viewing. Only the viewing dificulty with the biocular display was adversely effected by the visual task. This viewing dtfficulty is likely due to conflict between looming and stereo disparity cues. A second experiment examined the precision with which operators could manually move ringshaped virtual objects over virtual paths without collision. Accuracy of per$ormance was studied as a function of required precision, path complexity, and system response latency. Results show that high precision tracing is most sensitive to increasing latency. Ring placement with less than 1.8 cm precision will require system latency less than 50 msec before asymptotic per$ormance is found.	binocular disparity;cursor (databases);requirement	Stephen R.

2283456dd3e1c17c1375517c0c458cf6bb98587d	wearable gesture control of agile micro quadrotors		Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have seen a surge of use in various applications due to its structural simplicity and high maneuverability. However, conventional control methods using joysticks prohibit novices from getting used to maneuvering quadrotors in short time. In this paper, we suggest the use of a wearable device, such as a smart watch, as a new remote-controller for a quadrotor. The user's command is recognized as gestures using the 9-DoF inertial measurement unit (IMU) of a wearable device through a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Our implementation also makes it possible to align the heading of a quadrotor with the heading of the user. Our implementation allows nine different gestures and the trained RNN is used for real-time gesture recognition for controlling a micro quadrotor. The proposed system exploits available sensors in a wearable device and a quadrotor as much as possible to make the gesture-based control intuitive. We have experimentally validated the performance of the proposed system by using a Samsung Gear S smart watch and a Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter.	aerial photography;agile software development;align (company);artificial neural network;course (navigation);experiment;gnu nano;gesture recognition;joystick;long short-term memory;natural user interface;random neural network;real-time transcription;recurrent neural network;samsung gear;sensor;server (computing);smartphone;smartwatch;unmanned aerial vehicle;wearable technology	Yunho Choi;Inhwan Hwang;Songhwai Oh	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2017.8170439	computer vision;gesture recognition;joystick;artificial intelligence;embedded system;wearable computer;computer science;smartwatch;inertial measurement unit;recurrent neural network;quadcopter;gesture	Robotics	-37.961021191254595	-45.23109966591145	127471

Our method addresses the need for generating concise visualizations from the increasingly large number of videos being captured from portable devices. Our main contributions are (1) the process of finding salient people and moments to form a montage, and (2) the application of this method to videos taken âin the wildâ where the camera moves freely. As such, we demonstrate results on head-mounted cameras, where the camera moves constantly, as well as on videos downloaded from YouTube. Our approach can operate on videos of any length; some will contain many montageable moments, while others may have none. We demonstrate that a novel âmontageabilityâ score can be used to retrieve results with relatively high precision which allows us to present high quality montages to users.	digital camera;display resolution;head-mounted display;high- and low-level;ibm notes;mobile device;montagejs;wearable technology	Min Sun;Ali Farhadi;Ben Taskar;Steven M.

12eae0d433f39f830fa4c75bb170fe85e4fb13b4	3d contour perception for flow visualization	depth cues;stereo viewing;depth perception;flow field;data visualization;motion parallax;flow visualization	One of the most challenging problems in data visualization is the perception of 3D flow fields because judging the orientation of 3D paths is perceptually difficult. It is hypothesized that perception of the orientations of streamlines in space can greatly benefit from stereoscopic depth cues and motion parallax. In addition, because stereoscopic depth perception is a super-acuity and relies on such factors as small-scale stereoscopic disparity gradient based on texture, stereoscopic depth judgments will be exceptionally sensitive to display quality. In conventional displays, the aliasing of pixels gives completely spurious texture information to the mechanisms of stereoscopic depth perception. We carried out a study to evaluate the importance of 3D cues in perceiving the orientation of curved contours. The result showed that stereo and motion cues are essential to perceiving the orientation of 3D lines. If, however, the contours are rendered as shaded tubes, good orientation information is available even without stereo or motion depth cues.	aliasing;binocular disparity;data visualization;depth perception;gradient;parallax;pixel;shading;stereopsis;stereoscopy	Colin Ware	2006		10.1145/1140491.1140512	computer vision;depth perception;multimedia;optics;data visualization;kinetic depth effect;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-43.15644176726698	-49.469265913981545	127689

332066e3523e28c3c8eddb0a016900f251be64cc	hssim: an objective haptic quality assessment measure for force-feedback signals		Recent advances in haptic communication cast light onto the promise of full immersion into remote real or virtual environments. The quality of compressed haptic signals is crucial to fulfill this promise. Traditionally, the quality of haptic signals is evaluated through a series of subjective experiments. So far, only very limited attention was directed toward developing objective quality measures for haptic communication. As touch applications continue to grow, the need for efficient haptic quality assessment (HQA) measures is becoming more pronounced. In this work, we attempt to pragmatically approach this problem inspired by recent advances in the visual domain. More specifically, we design a HQA measure based on our knowledge of human haptic perception represented by Stevens power law and a similarity comparison between a reference and a compressed haptic force-feedback signal represented by the SSIM index as a full-reference quality measure. The proposed HSSIM measure provides clear advantages over existing approaches. We validate the performance of the proposed HQA measure with subjective experiments which show high correlation with human quality assessment results.	distortion;experiment;feedback;haptic technology;immersion (virtual reality);internet protocol suite;lossy compression;network packet;nonlinear system;real-time clock;similarity measure;structural similarity;virtual reality	Rania Hassen;Eckehard G.

In AR classrooms, it is necessary to allow both lecturers and students to utilize virtual teaching materials without any spatial restrictions, while handling virtual objects easily, regardless of distance. To provide efficient and accurate methods of handling AR classroom objects, our system requires only simple intuitive freehand gestures to control the users virtual hands in an enlarged, shared control space of users. We modified the GoGo interaction technique [5] by adding simple trigger gestures, and we evaluated performance against gaze-assisted selection (GaS) capabilities. Our proposed system enables both lecturers and students to utilize virtual teaching materials easily from their remote positions.	adobe freehand;augmented reality;experiment;interaction technique;microsoft hololens;user interface	Whie Jung;Woojin Cho;Hayun Kim;Woontack Woo	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)	10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2017.96	artificial intelligence;computer science;multimedia;free object;computer vision;humanâcomputer interaction;interaction technique;computer graphics (images);nonlinear system;augmented reality;gesture	Visualization	-43.382400368249414	-38.746136153004784	128479
a0a9efbe34679fb47391d62979e6efcd34617ae4	context-based visual feedback recognition	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	During face-to-face conversation, people use visual feedback (e.g., head and eye gesture) to communicate relevant information and to synchronize rhythm between participants. When recognizing visual feedback, people often rely on more than their visual perception. For instance, knowledge about the current topic and from previous utterances help guide the recognition of nonverbal cues. The goal of this thesis is to augment computer interfaces with the ability to perceive visual feedback gestures and to enable the exploitation of contextual information from the current interaction state to improve visual feedback recognition. We introduce the concept of visual feedback anticipation where contextual knowledge from an interactive system (e.g. last spoken utterance from the robot or system events from the GUI interface) is analyzed online to anticipate visual feedback from a human participant and improve visual feedback recognition. Our multi-modal framework for context-based visual feedback recognition was successfully tested on conversational and non-embodied interfaces for head and eye gesture recognition. We also introduce Frame-based Hidden-state Conditional Random Field model, a new discriminative model for visual gesture recognition which can model the substructure of a gesture sequence, learn the dynamics between gesture labels, and can be directly applied to label unsegmented sequences. The FHCRF model outperforms previous approaches (i.e. HMM, SVM and CRF) for visual gesture recognition and can efficiently learn relevant contextual information necessary for visual feedback anticipation. A real-time visual feedback recognition library for interactive interfaces (called Watson) was developed to recognize head gaze, head gestures, and eye gaze using the images from a monocular or stereo camera and the context information from the interactive system. Watson was downloaded by more then 70 researchers around the world and was successfully used by MERL, USC, NTT, MIT Media Lab and many other research groups.

Next, we discuss the suitable measurement range for recognition technologies of touch interface, voice recognition, human detection, gesture recognition, and others. Based on the suitable measurement ranges, we propose an integration method to estimate human behaviors based on the human detection using color image and 3-D distance information, and gesture recognition by the multilayered spiking neural network using the time series of human-hand positions. Furthermore, we propose a conversation system to realize the multimodal communication with a person. Finally, we show several experimental results of the proposed method, and discuss the future direction of this research.	algorithm;artificial neural network;color image;environment (systems);gesture recognition;multimodal interaction;prototype;robot;sensor;signal processing;speech recognition;spiking neural network;time series;touch user interface	Naoyuki Kubota;Yuichiro Toda	2012	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)	10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2213810	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;gesture recognition;sketch recognition;artificial neural network	Robotics	-36.72283223207825	-42.51831820611916	128584

We can split such an assumption into the necessity of effective gestural recognition and likelihood of virtual tools to reality. In this paper we will present a system to draw virtual graffiti on the PC screen, as it were a wall. A virtual, but tangible aerosol bomb has been designed and built, by exploiting the Nintendo console gaming device and sensor system. Our object has the same shape and the same way of use as a common, real spray paint dispenser and it can be used on quite every available graphics application on a Desktop or notebook case. Besides the advantages due to the low costs and the good accuracy of gesture recognition, our system confirms the importance of similarity in simulated scenarios.	cognitive walkthrough;desktop computer;documentation;experiment;feedback;gesture recognition;graphics software;haptic technology;prototype;remote control;simulation;usability;virtual graffiti;virtual reality;wii remote plus	Paola Salomoni;Ludovico Antonio Muratori;Silvia Mirri;Francesco Pozzi	2009	2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops	10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345524	simulation;network switch;computer science;graphics;multimedia;bluetooth;ubiquitous computing;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-45.10505832787789	-42.54225691493357	128988

The proposed portable system interprets the visual scene using the depth sensor, converts it into distance map, processes, and evaluates this information using a tablet computer. In addition, it provides haptic cues to the user through an array of vibration motors woven into the gloves. Throughout preliminary evaluation, this system has shown to successfully identify, track, and present closest objects, closest humans, multiple humans, and perform real-time distance measurements.	assistive technology;computer vision;distance transform;haptic technology;range imaging;real-time computing;real-time locating system;robotics;sensor;structured-light 3d scanner;tablet computer	Kumar Yelamarthi;Kevin Laubhan	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)	10.1109/EIT.2015.7293328	microcontroller;embedded system;computer vision;navigation;simulation;computer science;engineering;vibration	Robotics	-42.6519502049799	-43.91165467023784	129003

When such displays are static, the amount of information that can be presented is limited and the display may become boring or routine over time. Adding animation to peripheral displays can allow them to show more information and can potentially enhance visual interest and appeal, but it may also make the display very distracting. Is it possible to employ animation for visual benefit without increasing distraction? We have created a peripheral display system called BlueGoo that visualizes R.S.S. news feeds as animated photographic collages. We present an empirical study in which participants did not find the system to be distracting, and many found it to be appealing. The study also explored how different display sizes and positions affect information conveyance and distraction. Animations on an angled second monitor appeared to be more distracting than three other configurations.	multi-monitor;peripheral	Christopher Plaue;John T.

The UI elements being considered for evaluation include location, window length and font size of the popover in three visual search tasks. The results show that there were significant differences in reaction time and accuracy rate between age groups. The worst performance was found in the older group. The best button position was on the bottom screen. In addition, significant performance differences between popover window length and font size were also found. Generally speaking, it is recommended to use the popover window with long cell length, and bigger font size for better readability, especially for the older age group users.	usability;user interface design	Chih-Yu Hsiao;You-Jia Liu;Mao-Jiun J.

A digital driver model was developed based on the task-independent cognitive architecture of QN-MHP (Queuing Network-Model Human Processor). At the front end of the software a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed that allows designers to create digital mockups of the designs and simulate drivers performing secondary tasks while steering a vehicle. To validate the software outputs, an experiment using human drivers was conducted on a fix-based driving simulator with a radio-tuning task as a test case. Three typical in-vehicle infotainment systems that have the function of radio tuning were investigated (a touch screen, physical buttons, and a knob). The results show that the software was able to generate task completion time, total eyes-off-road time, and mental workload estimates that were similar to the empirical data. The software toolkit has the potential to be a supplemental tool for designers to explore a larger design space and address usability issues at the early design stages with lower cost in time and manpower.	benchmark (computing);cognition;cognitive architecture;control knob;digital mockup;driving simulator;graphical user interface;human processor model;limited-memory bfgs;off road challenge;simulation;test automation;test case;touchscreen;usability testing	Fred Feng;Yili Liu;Yifan Chen	2017	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2017.05.019	workload;simulation;software;usability;component-based usability testing;front and back ends;computer-aided engineering;mockup;driving simulator;computer science	SE	-47.259147825985444	-47.65681886509032	129383

In particular, we investigate how thumbnail number, si ze, and motion influence the performance of humans in common recognition tas ks.

We present Instant User Interfaces, an interaction paradigm that loosens this dependency and allows operating a system even when its dedicated controller is unavailable. We implemented a reliable, marker-free object tracking system that enables users to assign semantic meaning to different poses or to touches in different areas. With this system, users can repurpose everyday objects and program them in an ad-hoc manner, using a GUI or by demonstration, as input devices. Users tested and ranked these methods alongside a Wizard-of-Oz speech interface.

We propose the vision-based unicursal gesture interface (VUGI) as an extension of our unicursal gesture interface (UGI) for TV remotes with touchpads. Since UGI allows users to select an item on a hierarchical menu comfortably, it is expected that VUGI will yield easy-to-use hierarchical menu selection. Moreover, gestures in the air such as VUGI offer an interface area that is larger than that provided by touchpads. Unfortunately, since the user loses track of his/her finger position, it is not easy to input commands continuously using VUGI. To solve this problem, we propose the dynamic detection zone and the detection axes. An experiment confirms that subjects can input VUGI commands continuously.	apache axis	Ryosuke Aoki;Yutaka Karatsu;Masayuki Ihara;Atsuhiko Maeda;Minoru Kobayashi;Shingo Kagami	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21605-3_22	embedded system;simulation;artificial intelligence;operating system	HCI	-44.619865639102294	-43.77287043626229	129779

We focus on which of these modalities can elicit the fastest reaction time on the user. An experiment was devised in which subjects were asked to slowly insert a virtual tool by means of a haptic interface, and retract it as soon as they hit an obstacle; such event triggered an alert signal. We evaluated different signals: auditory, vibrotactile, and visual, with two amplitude levels for audio and vibration. Lower reaction times were observed on the strong vibrotactile modality, followed by the weak vibrations and the loud auditory tone, although the latter was described as uncomfortable by the subjects. The vibrotactile feedback was described as pleasant by most subjects and appears promising for future developments.	active set method;beep;experiment;fastest;feedback;haptic technology;interaction;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);robotics	Adrian Ramos Peon;Domenico Prattichizzo	2013	2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC)	10.1109/WHC.2013.6548486	telerobotics;mental chronometry;computer vision;teleoperation;simulation;visualization;visual perception;computer science;artificial intelligence;vibration;haptic technology;stimulus modality	HCI	-46.0334254174049	-49.647517803040266	129933
bb89fd760bca73e9c8ca086121cf58afe9f8d8f4	user-centered robot head design: a sensing computing interaction platform for robotics research (sciprr)		We developed and evaluated a novel humanoid head, SCIPRR (Sensing, Computing, Interacting Platform for Robotics Research). SCIPRR is a head shell that was iteratively created with additive manufactur- ing. SCIPRR contains internal sca olding that allows sensors, small form computers, and a back-projection system to display an ani- mated face on a front-facing screen. SCIPRR was developed using User Centered Design principles and evaluated using three di erent methods. First, we created multiple, small-scale prototypes through additive manufacturing and performed polling and re nement of the overall head shape. Second, we performed usability evaluations of expert HRI mechanics as they swapped sensors and computers within the the SCIPRR head. Finally, we ran and analyzed an ex- periment to evaluate how much novices would like a robot with our head design to perform di erent social and traditional robot tasks. We made both major and minor changes a er each evalu- ation and iteration. Overall, expert users liked the SCIPRR head and novices wanted a robot with the SCIPRR head to perform more tasks (including social tasks) than a more traditional robot.	3d printing;computer;humanârobot interaction;iteration;robot;robotics;sensor;usability;user-centered design;utility functions on indivisible goods	Anthony M.

Also, we use the experimental paradigm named âCooperative Turn-taking Game in Non-verbal Situationâ, which is a simplified multi-party conversation environment. We investigated whether designing eye-gazes for such robots can coordinate turn-taking and talking in multi-party conversations, and we found the robot's gaze could coordinate turn-taking and talking in multi-party conversations. Our study is expected to effectively encourage desirable talking in such multi-party conversations as collaborative learning scenes.	programming paradigm;robot;tree accumulation	Ryo Sato;Yugo Takeuchi	2014	The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926266	robot learning;games;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;glass;robot kinematics	Robotics	-37.392462440503714	-39.17250758089714	130448

The first scaling type used uniform scaling where increasing the display size also increased the size of all in-game elements by the same factor. The second employed non-uniform scaling where all in-game elements remained fixed in size, but the game environment increased (or decreased) in size. As expected, gameplay becomes much easier at larger scales with non-uniform scaling. Our results quantify this expectation: different difficulty attributes are very well modeled using either linear or power models. We discuss the implications this has on maintaining constant game difficulty and user experience.	display size;image scaling;mathematical model;user experience;virtual world	Robert J.

Current solutions include hierarchical menus and multi-functional control devices, which increase complexity and visual demand. Another option is speech control, which is not widely accepted, as it does not support visibility of actions, fine-grained feedback, and easy undo of actions. Our approach combines speech and gestures. By using speech for identification of functions, we exploit the visibility of objects in the car (e.g., mirror) and simple access to a wide range of functions equaling a very broad menu. Using gestures for manipulation (e.g., left/right), we provide fine-grained control with immediate feedback and easy undo of actions. In a user-centered process, we determined a set of user-defined gestures as well as common voice commands. For a prototype, we linked this to a car interior and driving simulator. In a study with 16 participants, we explored the impact of this form of multimodal interaction on the driving performance against a baseline using physical buttons. The results indicate that the use of speech and gesture is slower than using buttons but results in a similar driving performance. Users comment in a DALI questionnaire that the visual demand is lower when using speech and gestures.	baseline (configuration management);driving simulator;multimodal interaction;prototype;scalability;simulation;steering wheel;undo;user-centered design	Bastian Pfleging;Stefan SchneegaÃ;Albrecht Schmidt	2012		10.1145/2390256.2390282	simulation;speech recognition;engineering;communication	HCI	-47.22429161247118	-46.60639142828956	130490

From 2014 to mid-2015, the disease is the first cause of death in Indonesia. This is of particular concern to the Ministry of Health so that the prevention, treatment, and prevention of stroke is further enhanced. The condition of stroke patients whose movements are limited is exacerbated by the psychic condition of patients who are unable to communicate pressure will cause obstacles to the healing process of the patient. This research proposes a stroke patient communication media by applying the technology of Mobile Finger Communication Board and user center design approach (UCD). This communication board is operated using the patient's fingers so that it is comfortable for everyday activities. Mobile Finger Communication Board Design based on five planes of user experience. The result of Mobile Finger Communication Board implementation shows that application usability level seen from perception and ergonomic point of view shows satisfaction index of the user at the satisfactory level so that it can be said that the system works with the satisfactory result of the users. It is expected that with a convenient Mobile Finger Communication Board can support the healing process of stroke so that the healing rate of stroke is increasing.

b614a26cca7698e7ce5a2d4fd995bb79a0196a05	dopgest: dual-frequency based ultrasonic gesture recognition		In-air gesture recognition is becoming a popular means of interacting with terminal devices, such as smart phones, tablets and laptops. To implement in-air gesture recognition, many methods have been researched, such as computer visionbased, RF-based, WiFi-based and ultrasonic-based. Compared to other approaches, the ultrasonic-based method shows superiorities in low-cost, robustness and so on. In this paper, we construct a dual-frequency based ultrasonic gesture recognition system called DopGest, which utilizes the Doppler Effect to recognize gestures. Our system is implemented completely on a laptop without any additional equipments, and we use two speakers and one microphone already embedded in laptop as sensors. Most of ultrasonic-based methods exploit single tone, which limit the type of gestures. For instance, they can not recognize horizontal swipe gestures. On the contrary, our system can recognize swipe left and swipe right gestures by using two high tones (18 kHz). In our system, DopGest generates two different high frequency tones from two speakers and detects Doppler Effect caused by hand movements, then it extracts features from Doppler shifts of these two high tones, since laptops generally contain at least two speakers. Compared to computervision based method, our system can work under any light conditions without extra hardware devices and with low power consumption. Experiments show that our system can achieve an average classification accuracy of 88.9%.

Existing IR multi-touch devices either use complex custom electronic sensor arrays, or a camera that must be placed relatively distant from the display. FiberBoard is an easily constructed compact IR-sensing multi-touch display. Using an array of optical fibers, reflected IR light is channeled to a camera. As the fibers are flexible the camera is free to be positioned so as to minimize the depth of the device. The resulting display is around one tenth of the depth of a conventional camera-based multi-touch display. We present our prototype, its novel calibration process, and virtual camera software based on existing multi-touch image processing tools.	image processing;multi-touch;optical fiber;prototype;virtual camera system	Daniel Jackson;Tom Bartindale;Patrick Olivier	2009		10.1145/1731903.1731954	smart camera;telecommunications;engineering;optics;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.823156406207836	-41.07840503606891	130840

As displays become larger, the scalability limit may shift away from the number of pixels and toward human perceptual abilities. This work explores the effect of using large, high resolution displays to scale up information visualizations beyond potential visual acuity limitations. Displays that are beyond visual acuity require physical navigation to see all of the pixels. Participants performed various information visualization tasks using display sizes with a sufficient number of pixels to be within, equal to, or beyond visual acuity. Results showed that performance on most tasks was more efficient and sometimes more accurate because of the additional data that could be displayed, despite the physical navigation that was required. Visualization design issues on large displays are also discussed.	image resolution;information visualization;pixel;scalability	Beth Yost;Yonca Haciahmetoglu;Chris North	2007		10.1145/1240624.1240639	computer vision;information visualization;image resolution;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.53238122276121	-48.64056543810419	131093

The paper presents a method for interpreting on-line freehand sketch and describes a human-computer interface prototype system of freehand sketch recognition (FSR) that is designed to infer designers' intention and interprets the input sketch into more exact 2D geometric primitives: straight lines, polylines, circles, circular arcs, ellipses, elliptical arcs, hyperbolas and parabolas. According to whether the stroke needs to be segmented or not, it is divided into single primitives and composite primitives correspondingly. Based on open/closed characteristic and semi-invariant, conic type and category of freehand sketch were defined for subdividing conic curve. Recognition approach for composite-primitive consists of three stages. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated preliminarily by experiments.	adobe freehand;sketch recognition	Shu-xia Wang;Man-Tun Gao;Le-hua Qi	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73107-8_18	computer vision;stroke;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;segmentation;sketch recognition;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-42.358815374863184	-39.361797568708255	131129

The immersive system has been developed as part of a multimodal interface for product design. The haptic interface consists of a strip that can be used by product designers to evaluate the quality of a 3D virtual shape by using touch, vision and hearing and, also, to interactively change the shape of the virtual object. Specifically, the user interacts with the FSH to move the virtual object and to appropriately position the haptic interface for retrieving the six degrees of freedom required for both manipulation and modification modalities. The FCTS allows the system to track the movement and position of the user's fingers on the strip, which is used for rendering visual and sound feedback. Two evaluation experiments are described, which involve both the evaluation and the modification of a 3D shape. Results show that the use of the haptic strip for the evaluation of aesthetic shapes is effective and supports product designers in the appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of the shape.	experiment;fasttrack scripting host;fingers, unit of measurement;haptic device component;haptic technology;hereditary angioedema type iii;interactivity;interface device component;multimodal interaction;norm (social);six degrees of separation	Mario Covarrubias;Monica Bordegoni;Umberto Cugini	2013		10.3390/s131013487	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;transducer;computer science;engineering;haptic technology;physics;conductometry	HCI	-43.40954575312024	-41.155791359817854	131566
79334e0dd8f4f45440be21e5709a6fa87dbe09af	learning gestures for customizable human-computer interaction in the operating room		Interaction with computer-based medical devices in the operating room is often challenging for surgeons due to sterility requirements and the complexity of interventional procedures. Typical solutions, such as delegating the interaction task to an assistant, can be inefficient. We propose a method for gesture-based interaction in the operating room that surgeons can customize to personal requirements and interventional workflow. Given training examples for each desired gesture, our system learns low-dimensional manifold models that enable recognizing gestures and tracking particular poses for fine-grained control. By capturing the surgeon's movements with a few wireless body-worn inertial sensors, we avoid issues of camera-based systems, such as sensitivity to illumination and occlusions. Using a component-based framework implementation, our method can easily be connected to different medical devices. Our experiments show that the approach is able to robustly recognize learned gestures and to distinguish these from other movements.	component-based software engineering;experiment;humanâcomputer interaction;medical devices;medical records systems, computerized;movement;obstruction;operating room;operating tables;requirement;solutions;manifold;sensor (device)	Loren Arthur Schwarz;Ali Bigdelou;Nassir Navab	2011	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

We conducted an experiment to investigate what characteristics of eye-wearable technology impact user performance in machine maintenance, which included a representative set of car maintenance tasks involving Locate, Manipulate, and Compare actions. Participants were asked to follow instructions displayed on one of four technologies: a peripheral eye-wearable display, a central eye-wearable display, a tablet, or a paper manual. We found a significant effect of display position: the peripheral eye-wearable display resulted in longer completion time than the central display; but no effect for hands-free operation. The technology effects were also modulated by different Tasks and Action types.

Estimating absolute travel distance from the visual flow induced in the optic array of a moving observer is problematic because optic flow speeds co-vary with the dimensions of the environment and are thus subject to an environment specific scale factor. Discrimination of the distances of two simulated self-motions of different speed and duration is reliably possible from optic flow, however, if the visual environment is the same for both motions, because the scale factors cancel in this case. 2 Here, we ask whether a distance estimate obtained from optic flow can be transformed into a spatial interval in the same visual environment. Subjects viewed a simulated self-motion sequence on a large (90 by 90 deg) projection screen or in a computer animated virtual environment (CAVE) with completely immersive, stereographic, head-yoked projection, that extended 180deg horizontally and included the floor space in front of the observer. The sequence depicted selfmotion over a ground plane covered with random dots. Simulated distances ranged from 1.5 to 13 meters with variable speed and duration of the movement. After the movement stopped, the screen depicted a stationary view of the scene and two horizontal lines appeared on the ground in front of the observer. The subject had to adjust one of these lines such that the spatial interval between the lines matched the distance traveled during the movement simulation. Adjusted interval size was linearly related to simulated travel distance, suggesting that observers could obtain a measure of distance from the optic flow. The slope of the regression was 0.7. Thus, subjects underestimated distance by 30%. This result was similar for stereoscopic and monoscopic conditions. We conclude that optic flow can be used to derive an estimate of travel distance, but this estimate is subject to scaling when compared to static intervals in the environment, irrespective of steroscopic depth cues.	binocular disparity;computer animation;depth perception;image scaling;motion simulator;odometry;optical flow;projection screen;simulation;stationary process;stereoscopy;virtual reality	Markus Lappe;Harald Frenz;Thomas BÃ¼hrmann;Marina Kolesnik	2005		10.1117/12.610863	computer vision;simulation;geography;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-43.449512924895735	-49.86162601373105	132237

Our study intends to ensure the simpler and more efficient GUI design of multi-remote controls that can operate two or more AV devices. These multi-remote controls require a touch panel display, with a GUI arranged with on-screen buttons that resemble the physical buttons of ordinary remote controls. Accordingly, we are working on a GUI whose icons are effectively arranged based on a GA. In the GA, various icons of different sizes and shapes are regarded as genes, and the order of arranging icons on the screen is regarded as an array of genes, or an individual. First, genes in the GA are taken as the buttons, and an individual is taken as the order in which the buttons are arranged. Next, PC simulation was used to determine the GA evaluation, the technique of a selection, a crossover and a mutation, the terminate check, and parameters so that the processing time would be shorter. Finally, a prototype was generated and utilized to verification experiments. However, it was found that the processing of the GA needed a maximum of five minutes and we tried to improve the system. This effort was effective and we could end the process within a minute. As a result, we could achieve the automatic arrangement of buttons that minimized the number of pages and gaps.	crossover (genetic algorithm);experiment;formal verification;genetic algorithm;graphical user interface;prototype;remote control;simulation;software release life cycle;terminate (software);touchscreen	Takanori Mori;Takako Nonaka;Tomohiro Hase	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642282	embedded system;genetic algorithm;computer hardware;computer science;artificial intelligence;graphical user interface;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-44.69532973090585	-42.83626983466385	132391

More and more touch devices appear in various domains. To keep up with this technology change, we have introduced touch sensing technologies to electrical and computer engineering technology students by using the project-based learning (PBL) approach. Our experiences indicate that the PBL approach is efficient and practical for teaching touch sensing techniques. Two different sets of courseware including hardware kits and software packages have been utilized in design projects to teach touch in two existing courses respectively. Students have shown the great interest and the capability in adopting touch devices into their senior embedded systems design projects to improve user interactions with the computing systems.	computer engineering;embedded system;game controller;input device;interaction;mouse systems;systems design	Nannan He;Han-way Huang;Ying Qian	2016	2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2016.7757625	humanâcomputer interaction;engineering;multimedia;computer engineering	HCI	-45.5554714696035	-38.460744938767206	133008

This paper describes one novel service, called LiveMail that explores the potential of existing face animation technologies for innovative and attractive services intended for the mobile market. This prototype service allows mobile subscribers to communicate using personalized 3D face models created from images taken by their phone cameras. The user can take a snapshot of someone's face Â a friend, famous person, themselves, even a pet Â using the mobile phone's camera. After a quick manipulation on the phone, a 3D model of that face is created and can be animated simply by typing in some text. Speech and appropriate animation of the face are created automatically by speech synthesis. Furthermore, these highly personalized animations can be sent to others as real 3D animated messages or as short videos in MMS. The clients were implemented on different platforms, and different network and face animation techniques, and connected into one complex system. This paper presents the architecture and experience gained in building such a system.	avatar (computing)	Tomislav Kosutic;Miran Mosmondor;Ivan Andrisek;Mario Weber;Maja Matijasevic;Igor S.

Forgoing hand or finger interaction is especially beneficial when the user is engaged in real world tasks. In virtual environments as moving through safety training applications is often conducted via finger input, which is not very suitable. To enable a more intuitive interaction, alternative control concepts utilize gesture control, which is usually tracked by statically installed cameras in CAVE-like-installations. Since tracking coverage is limited, problems may also occur. The introduced prototype provides a novel control concept for virtual reality as well as real life applications. Demonstrated functions include movement control in a virtual reality installation such as moving straight, turning and jumping. Furthermore the prototype provides additional feedback by heating up the feet and vibrating in dedicated areas on the surface of the insole.	natural user interface;prototype;real life;virtual reality;wearable computer	Denys J.

Methods to implement our system, including methods to search for a place to project the virtual touch buttons, to extract finger and shadow regions on the virtual button area and determine their ratio, and to detect touch operations, are described. We evaluated the precisions of the foreground extraction (finger or its shadow) and the segmentation of the finger and its shadow under three different brightness conditions (dim, semi-bright, and bright). The foreground extraction showed an F value of more than 0.97, and the finger/shadow segmentation showed an F value of about 0.8 in all tested brightness conditions.	color;control function (econometrics);remote control;semiconductor industry;sensor;video projector	Akira Nozaki;Katsuto Nakajima	2015		10.5220/0005307601150122		HCI	-41.66973742310817	-41.01177084259195	134085

Our studies underline that node-link and matrix views are suited to different analysis tasks. For the combined view, our studies show that there is a perceptually complementary effect in terms of improved accuracy for some tasks, but that there is a cost in terms of longer completion time than the faster of the two techniques alone. Eye-movement data shows that for many tasks participants strongly favour one of the two views, after trying both in the training phase.	eb-eye;sankey diagram;weighted network	Chunlei Chang;Benjamin Bach;Tim Dwyer;Kim Marriott	2017		10.1145/3025453.3026024	visualization;underline;encoding (memory);eye tracking;matrix (mathematics);sankey diagram;machine learning;artificial intelligence;graph drawing;computer vision;computer science	HCI	-45.547532136397955	-47.67025217388466	134121

In this paper we present a technique for users to seamlessly switch between interacting on the tabletop surface to above it. Our aim is to leverage the space above the surface in combination with the regular tabletop display to allow more intuitive manipulation of digital content in three-dimensions. Our goal is to design a technique that closely resembles the ways we manipulate physical objects in the real-world; conceptually, allowing virtual objects to be 'picked up' off the tabletop surface in order to manipulate their three dimensional position or orientation. We chart the evolution of this technique, implemented on two rear projection-vision tabletops. Both use special projection screen materials to allow sensing at significant depths beyond the display. Existing and new computer vision techniques are used to sense hand gestures and postures above the tabletop, which can be used alongside more familiar multi-touch interactions. Interacting above the surface in this way opens up many interesting challenges. In particular it breaks the direct interaction metaphor that most tabletops afford. We present a novel shadow-based technique to help alleviate this issue. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our technique based on our own observations and initial user feedback, and provide various insights from comparing, and contrasting, our tabletop implementations	computer vision;digital recording;feedback;interaction;interactive media;multi-touch;projection screen	Otmar Hilliges;Shahram Izadi;Andrew D.

While we are already seeing some successful video-based augmented reality (AR) auxiliary displays (e.g., center-mounted backup aid systems), the application opportunities of optical see-through AR as presented on a drivers' windshield are yet to be fully tapped; nor are the visual perceptual and attention challenges fully understood. As we race to field AR applications in transportation, we should first consider the perceptual and distraction issues that are known in both the AR and transportation communities, with a focus on the unique and intersecting aspects for driving applications. This paper describes the some opportunities and driver challenges associated with AR applications in the automotive domain. We first present a basic research space to assist in these inquiries, which delineates head-mounted from heads-up and center-mounted displays; video from optical see-through displays; and world-fixed from screen-fixed AR graphics. We then address benefits of AR related to primary, secondary, and tertiary driver tasks as well as driver perception and cognition challenges inherent in automotive AR systems.	augmented reality;backup;cognition;glass;graphics	Joseph L.

From pilot study, we have found that the motion recognition for dance performance needed the synchronism to back ground music (BGM). Therefore, we propose a new motion recognition method specialized to dance performances. The key techniques of the proposed method are (1) adaptive decision of the size of recognition window to recognize a motion in sync with BGM, and (2) motion recognition in two-phase (rough and detailed) to fulfill the accuracy in high speed recognition. Data was recorded using a 3-axis wireless accelerometers mounted on both shoes. We evaluated the method on a dataset of 5 different dance steps (each repeated 100 times).The results show that this method is capable of improving recognition for all steps (in one case improving recognition from 62% to 99%) while retaining a feeling of seamless connection between movement and sound.	bayesian network;performance;seamless3d;shoes;two-phase locking	Minoru Fujimoto;Naotaka Fujita;Yoshinari Takegawa;Tsutomu Terada;Masahiko Tsukamoto	2009	2009 International Symposium on Wearable Computers	10.1109/ISWC.2009.22	simulation;computer science;operating system;music;multimedia	Robotics	-42.63430965296485	-43.449758601751654	134662

The main purpose of this dataset is to explore patterns in the focus of visual attention of humans under three different conditions two humans involved in task-based interaction with a robot; same two humans involved in task-based interaction where the robot is replaced by a third human, and a free three-party human interaction. The dataset contains two parts 6 sessions with duration of approximately 3 hours and 9 sessions with duration of approximately 4.5 hours. Both parts of the dataset are rich in modalities and recorded data streams they include the streams of three Kinect v2 devices (color, depth, infrared, body and face data), three high quality audio streams, three high resolution GoPro video streams, touch data for the task-based interactions and the system state of the robot.

Motion editing is usually also required to adjust captured motions. Because character poses which include joint rotations, body positions, and orientations are high-dimensional data, it is difficult to manipulate character poses through a conventional mouse-based interface. We propose a motion editing system that uses a motion capture device. Our system can capture a motion and edit the captured motion using the same motion capture device. Our motion-capture-based interface can specify motion editing parameters such as time period, body part selection, end-effector position, pose, and motion segment. We conducted a user study to compare our system and conventional mouse-based motion editing system. The results showed that our interface is more efficient than the conventional interface.	motion capture;robot end effector;usability testing	Masaki Oshita;Hiroyuki Muranaka	2014		10.1145/2670473.2670481	computer vision;facial motion capture;match moving;structure from motion;motion capture;simulation;computer science;motion interpolation;operating system;motion estimation;computer animation;motion field;user interface;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-39.92680492862813	-38.267251689932806	134951

According to it, number of the wheelchair user would become larger. The government has being improved to lessen the barriers for these people. But depending on the physical power of wheel chair users, it was pointed out that there could be the places where they could not move by their physical power. This is a reason that many wheelchair users do not move by their alone. Therefore we tried to develop the navigation system to eliminate the problem. At the beginning we have developed the system to measure the required force to move the wheelchair, the width of the space of aisle where they could turn back the direction, and the position information. By the data base, we planned to develop the navigation system for wheelchair users who could move alone to working places or other places where they want to go. In this paper, we report the system developed to collect data for navigation of wheelchair users.

Therefore, fish tank VR systems provide only a limited virtual workspace. As a result, such systems are less suited for displaying virtual worlds that extend beyond the available workspace and depth perception problems arise when displaying objects (virtually) located on the edge of the workspace in between the viewer and the display screen. In this paper we present two techniques to reduce this disadvantage: cadre viewing andamplified head rotations . The first aims to eliminate the problems in depth perception for objects with negative parallax touching the screen surround. Subjective observations from an informal user study indicate a reduction of confusion in depth perception. The second provides a transparent navigation technique to allow users to view larger portions of the virtual world without the need for an additional input device to navigate. A user study shows it performs equally well when compared to a technique based on the use of an additional spatial input device.	depth perception;display device;head-coupled perspective;head-mounted display;input device;interaction technique;parallax;usability testing;viewing frustum;virtual world;workspace	Jurriaan D.

Several factors influence recognition rates including the nature of the gesture set and the suitability of the gesture recognition algorithm. This work explores how seamfulness in gesture stroke visualization affects recognition rates. We present the results of a user evaluation of a gesture recognition system that shows that raw (seamful) visualization of low-delity gesture stroke data has recognition rates comparable to no feedback. Providing filtered (seamless) stroke visualization to the user, while retaining the un-filtered input data for recognition, resulted in a 34.9% improvement in gesture recognition rate over raw stroke data. The results provide insights into the broader design space of seamful design, and identifies areas where seamlessness is advantageous.	algorithm;gesture recognition;interaction technique;kripke semantics;seamless3d	Sven G.

Two experiments were conducted to investigate alternative display designs in which contours (angled vs. straight) and borders (explicit vs. implicit) were varied. In Experiment 1, contours, borders, and temporal frequency interacted. At 5 Hz angled contours improved accuracy significantly. At 10 Hz explicit borders improved accuracy significantly with angled contours but degraded accuracy significantly with straight contours. In Experiment 2, the design of the angled contours was changed to convey less information and an additional border condition was added. Once again, borders and contours interacted: The widest explicit border degraded accuracy with straight contours. Angled contours also improved latency performance. The results suggest that angled contours can reduce ambiguity and improve the effectiveness of animated mimic...		Kevin B. Bennett;Ed Madigan	1994	Int. J. Hum. Comput.

The task will consist of mentally moving a cursor on the screen. The visitors will be invited to wear an EEG net (EGI system) and will be asked to put their finger on two Braille cells. They will be then asked to move the cursor based on the tactile stimulation. If the left cell is activated, the participants should think about moving the cursor to the left. If the right cell is activated, the participant would think about moving the cursor to the right. The BCI can predict the usersâ intentions and move the cursor into the desired direction.	brainâcomputer interface;cursor (databases);egi;electroencephalography	Patrick Brewster;Cody Hock;Larry Flint;Alex Lanthier;Mounia Ziat;Darren Dow;Mike Hartman	2014		10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775563	footmouse;computer vision;computer hardware;computer science;communication	HCI	-45.38211043250982	-44.32339781964133	135135

This article presents a finger-writing system that recognizes characters written in the air without the need for an extra handheld device. This application adaptively merges depth, skin, and background models for the hand segmentation to overcome the limitations of the individual models, such as hand-face overlapping problems and the depth-color nonsynchronization. The writing fingertip is detected by a new real-time dual-mode switching method. The recognition accuracy rate is greater than 90 percent for the first five candidates of Chinese characters, English characters, and numbers.	algorithm;experiment;kinect;mobile device;optical character recognition;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription	Xin Zhang;Zhichao Ye;Lianwen Jin;Ziyong Feng;Shaojie Xu	2013	IEEE MultiMedia	10.1109/MMUL.2013.50	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;image sensor;multimedia;handwriting recognition;image segmentation;fingerprint recognition;kinetics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-37.55113959931895	-43.89991085219947	135177

We present Touch Projector, a system that enables users to interact with remote screens through a live video image on their mobile device. The handheld device tracks itself with respect to the surrounding displays. Touch on the video image is """"projected"""" onto the target display in view, as if it had occurred there. This literal adaptation of Tani's idea, however, fails because handheld video does not offer enough stability and control to enable precise manipulation.

When a thin magnetic sensor grid is attached to the back of the display, the 3D position and partial 3D orientation of the GaussBits can be resolved by the proposed bi-polar magnetic field tracking technique. This portable platform can therefore enrich tangible interactions by extending the design space to the near-surface space. Since non-ferrous materials, such as the user's hand, do not occlude the magnetic field, interaction designers can freely incorporate a magnetic unit into an appropriately shaped non-ferrous object to exploit the metaphors of the real-world tasks, and users can freely manipulate the GaussBits by hands or using other non-ferrous tools without causing interference. The presented example applications and the collected feedback from an explorative workshop revealed that this new approach is widely applicable.	interaction design;interference (communication);norm (social)	Rong-Hao Liang;Kai-Yin Cheng;Li-Wei Chan;Chuan-Xhyuan Peng;Mike Y.

Whether it is to deliver desired objects for the elderly living in their homes or hand tools to a worker in a factory, the process of robot hand-overs is one worthy study within the human robot interaction community. While the study of object hand-overs have been studied in previous works, these works have mainly considered anthropomorphic robots, that is, robots that appear and move similar to humans. However, recent trends within robotics, and in particular domestic robotics have witnessed an increase in non-anthropomorphic robotic platforms such as moving tables, teleconferencing robots and vacuum cleaners. The study of robot hand-over for non-anthropomorphic robots and in particular the study of what constitute a successful hand-over is at focus in this paper.

Such an interface allows the eye continuously to move and it is not necessary to dwell upon a specific position to trigger a command. We classify writing into three categories (typing, gesturing, and continuous writing) and explain why continuous writing comes closest to the nature of human eye gaze. We propose Quikwriting, which was originally designed for handhelds, as a method for text input that meets the requirements of eye gaze controlled input best. We adapt its design for the usage with eye gaze. Based on the results of a first study, we formulate some guidelines for the design of future Quikwriting-based eye gaze controlled applications.	humanâcomputer interaction;input device;mobile device;prototype;quikwriting;requirement;stylus (computing);usability;usability testing	Nikolaus Bee;Elisabeth AndrÃ©	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69369-7_13	computer vision;simulation;eye tracking;computer science;communication	HCI	-46.68350882186401	-43.89084403831113	135632

Two major problems are focused on this paper. One is how to distinct the user intuitive gestures, another is how to make the correspondence between the gestures and the control commands. Users want to use their own gestures which are not known a priori. These gestures must be classified by the systems by themselves. After the classification, the system must interpret the user intention to the control command which the user want to input. For instance, one may use waving hand gesture as the shutdown command, and another may assign the same gesture to the different command such as turning around. The primitive systems are implemented on the entertainment robot named AIBO. AIBO recognizes the gestures which are classified using Self-creating and organizing neural network. AIBO also learns how to interpret them into its command using Q-Learning technique. Some experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach.	aibo;artificial neural network;entertainment robot;organizing (structure);q-learning;shutdown (computing)	Tomonori Hashiyama;Keiichiro Sada;Mitsuru Iwata;Shun'ichi Tano	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385009	computer vision;contextual image classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;aibo;machine learning;artificial neural network;q-learning	Robotics	-38.31544144733762	-43.907908099568445	136185

This paper presents an alternative approach to mobile labeling of sensor data called VoiceLabel. VoiceLabel consists of two components: (1) a speech-based data collection tool for mobile devices, and (2) a desktop tool for offline segmentation of recorded data and recognition of spoken labels. The desktop tool automatically analyzes the audio stream to find and recognize spoken labels, and then presents a multimodal interface for reviewing and correcting data labels using a combination of the audio stream, the system's analysis of that audio, and the corresponding mobile sensor data. A study with ten participants showed that VoiceLabel is a viable method for labeling mobile sensor data. VoiceLabel also illustrates several key features that inform the design of other data labeling tools.	activity recognition;desktop computer;effective method;graphical user interface;ground truth;machine learning;mobile computing;mobile device;multimodal interaction;online and offline;prototype;sensor;streaming media;taint checking	Susumu Harada;Jonathan Lester;Kayur Patel;T.

0854ebace1fb36eb23cf06cf491954b6235eb8bd	long term goal oriented recommender systems		The main goal of recommender systems is to assist users in finding items of their interest in very large collections. The use of good automatic recommendation promotes customer loyalty and user satisfaction because it helps users to attain their goals. Current methods focus on the immediate value of recommendations and are evaluated as such. This is insufficient for long term goals, either defined by users or by platform managers. This is of interest in recommending learning resources to learn a target concept, and also when a company is organizing a campaign to lead users to buy certain products or moving to a different customer segment. Therefore, we believe that it would be useful to develop recommendation algorithms that promote the goals of users and platform managers (e.g. e-shop manager, e-learning tutor, ministry of culture promotor). Accordingly, we must define appropriate evaluation methodologies and demonstrate the concept on practical cases.	algorithm;computer user satisfaction;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;online and offline;online shopping;organizing (structure);persuasive technology;precision and recall;recommender system;scalability;sparse matrix;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;usability testing;value (computer science)	Amir Hossein Nabizadeh;AlÃ­pio MÃ¡rio Jorge;JosÃ© Paulo Leal	2015		10.5220/0005493505520557	computer science;data mining;recommender system;goal orientation	ML	-38.211742759883926	-52.07187230583373	136321

4b3f0fa6153b5b0284a9ed44c35653440a683377	comparative performance analysis of m-imu/emg and voice user interfaces for assistive robots		People with a high level of disability experience great difficulties to perform activities of daily living and resort to their residual motor functions in order to operate assistive devices. The commercially available interfaces used to control assistive manipulators are typically based on joysticks and can be used only by subjects with upper-limb residual mobilities. Many other solutions can be found in the literature, based on the use of multiple sensory systems for detecting the human motion intention and state. Some of them require a high cognitive workload for the user. Some others are more intuitive and easy to use but have not been widely investigated in terms of usability and user acceptance. The objective of this work is to propose an intuitive and robust user interface for assistive robots, not obtrusive for the user and easily adaptable for subjects with different levels of disability. The proposed user interface is based on the combination of M-IMU and EMG for the continuous control of an arm-hand robotic system by means of M-IMUs. The system has been experimentally validated and compared to a standard voice interface. Sixteen healthy subjects volunteered to participate in the study: 8 subjects used the combined M-IMU/EMG robot control, and 8 subjects used the voice control. The arm-hand robotic system made of the KUKA LWR 4+ and the IH2 Azzurra hand was controlled to accomplish the daily living task of drinking. Performance indices and evaluation scales were adopted to assess performance of the two interfaces.	assistive technology;electromyography;entity name part qualifier - adopted;evaluation function;experiment;extraction;finite-state machine;high-level programming language;joystick;kinesiology;patients;profiling (computer programming);randomized algorithm;robot (device);robot control;self-help devices;sensor;speaker recognition;usability;user interface device component;voice command device;voice user interface	Clemente Lauretti;Francesca Cordella;Francesco Scotto di Luzio;Stefano Saccucci;Angelo Davalli;Rinaldo Sacchetti;Loredana Zollo	2017	2017 International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)	10.1109/ICORR.2017.8009380	activities of daily living;workload;inertial measurement unit;usability;joystick;robot control;simulation;speaker recognition;user interface;engineering	Robotics	-40.9308477962348	-45.55608694381968	136498
ab7bce392d180fa8c65a746b7e85a797d743af48	supporting responsive cohabitation between virtual interfaces and physical objects on everyday surfaces		Systems for providing mixed physical-virtual interaction on desktop surfaces have been proposed for decades, though no such systems have achieved widespread use. One major factor contributing to this lack of acceptance may be that these systems are not designed for the variety and complexity of actual work surfaces, which are often in flux and cluttered with physical objects. In this paper, we use an elicitation study and interviews to synthesize a list of ten interactive behaviors that desk-bound, digital interfaces should implement to support responsive cohabitation with physical objects. As a proof of concept, we implemented these interactive behaviors in a working augmented desk system, demonstrating their imminent feasibility.	desktop computer	Robert Xiao;Scott E.

By combining data received from real robots together with the perception and abilities of a human operator innovative applications are imaginable. Visualizing not only the current robot state but also the robots environment captured with different sensors and processed with both machine and human vision can lead to a rising percentage of robot assisted workplaces or robot installations. Since the visualization of and the interaction with the robotic application is not locally restricted new or improved use cases like remote maintenance or faster startup of industrial robots can be realized. Therefore, an architecture split into three functional units and an overview of our implementation is presented.	augmented reality;humanârobot interaction;industrial robot;microsoft hololens;mixed reality;mobile device;mobile phone;sensor;tablet computer	Jan Guhl;Son Tung;JÃ¶rg KrÃ¼ger	2017	2017 22nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247749	real-time computing;visualization;mixed reality;robot;architecture;engineering;humanâcomputer interaction;augmented reality;mobile device;use case;humanârobot interaction	Robotics	-43.94118760772857	-41.817824354615446	136742

A haptic device uses mechanical actuators to physically push a userâs finger or hand to give the sensation that he or she would have when interacting with a real physical environment. These force feedback systems have many applications, from training a surgeon to perform an operation, to assisting a child in understanding the behavior of a lever or pulley. In this paper we discuss methods and techniques to allow realistic and robust haptic interactions between a human and a complex dynamic virtual environment. Beyond modeling object penetration constraints, this work demonstrates how shading, friction, texture, and dynamics can be generated to create compelling and realistic virtual worlds.

However, the roles of the computer interface and studentsâ cognitive abilities in moderating learning and performance with virtual models are not yet well understood. In two experiments students solved spatial organic chemistry problems using a virtual model system. Two aspects of the virtual model interface were manipulated: display dimensionality (stereoscopic vs. monoscopic displays) and the location of the hand-held device used to manipulate the virtual molecules (co-located with the visual display vs. displaced). The experimental task required participants to interpret the spatial structure of organic molecules and to manipulate the models to align them with orientations and configurations depicted by diagrams in Experiment 1 and three-dimensional models in Experiment 2. Co-locating the interaction device with the virtual image led to better performance in both experiments and stereoscopic viewing led to better performance in Experiment 2. The effect of co-location on performance was moderated by spatial ability in Experiment 1, and the effect of providing stereo viewing was moderated by spatial ability in Experiment 2. The results are in line with the ability-as-compensator hypothesis: participants with lower ability uniquely benefited from the treatment, while those with higher ability were not affected by stereo or co-location. The findings suggest that increased fidelity in a virtual model system may be one way of alleviating difficulties of low-spatial participants in learning spatially demanding content in STEM domains.

It provides acoustic signals via a set of stereo earphones that guides the user around obstacles or """"displays"""" a virtual acoustic panoramic image of the traveler's surroundings. One limitation of the NavBelt is that it is exceedingly difficult for the user to comprehend the guidance signals in time to allow fast walking. A newer device, called GuideCane, effectively overcomes this problem. The GuideCane uses the same mobile robotics technology as the NavBelt but is a wheeled device pushed ahead of the user via an attached cane. When the GuideCane detects an obstacle, it steers around it. The user immediately feels this steering action and can follow the GuideCane's new path easily without any conscious effort.

00022da3f9ebf5ca3d69da31019216d7fe5fdfbe	first international harting open source prize winner: the igus humanoid open platform		The use of standard platforms in the field of humanoid robotics can lower the entry barrier for new research groups, and accelerate research by the facilitation of code sharing. Numerous humanoid standard platforms exist in the lower size ranges of up to 60 cm, but beyond that humanoid robots scale up quickly in weight and price, becoming less affordable and more difficult to operate, maintain and modify. The igus Humanoid Open Platform is an affordable, fully open-source platform for humanoid research. At 92 cm, the robot is capable of acting in an environment meant for humans, and is equipped with enough sensors, actuators and computing power to support researchers in many fields. The structure of the robot is entirely 3D printed, leading to a lightweight and visually appealing design. This paper covers the mechanical and electrical aspects of the robot, as well as the main features of the corresponding open-source ROS software. At RoboCup 2016, the platform was awarded the first International HARTING Open Source Prize.	computer-aided design;humanoid robot;martin kay;open platform;open-source software;personalization;printing;robot operating system;robotics;sensor	Philipp Allgeuer;Grzegorz Ficht;Hafez Farazi;Michael Schreiber;Sven Behnke	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-68792-6_52	simulation;humanoid robot;scale-up;open platform;robot;software;computer science	Robotics	-37.87433506446216	-40.08219499491215	137646

This paper investigates problems related particularly to the haptic interaction between the human operator and a virtual environment. The work presented here focuses on two issues: 1) the synthesis of whole-hand kinesthetic feedback, based on the application of forces (torques) on individual phalanges (joints) of the human hand, and 2) the experimental evaluation of this haptic feedback system, in terms of human haptic perception of virtual physical properties (such as the weight of a virtual manipulated object), using psychophysical methods. The proposed kinesthetic feedback methodology is based on the solution of a generalized force distribution problem for the human hand during virtual manipulation tasks. The solution is computationally efficient and has been experimentally implemented using an exoskeleton force-feedback glove. A series of experiments is reported concerning the perception of weight of manipulated virtual objects and the obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. Issues related to the use of sensory substitution techniques for the application of haptic feedback on the human hand are also discussed.	algorithmic efficiency;computer simulation;experiment;haptic technology;multimodal interaction;real-time clock;requirement;sensory substitution;virtual reality	Costas S.

0c7a14ee933d969af5bb58cf9ca5b48a008f9630	ontology-based human-robot interaction: an approach and case study on adaptive remote control interface		The paper presents an approach to human-robot interaction in socio-cyberphysical systems. The paper propose a socio-cyberphysical system ontology that is aimed at describing the knowledge of the system resources. Humans are interacted with robots using personal smartphones. Every robot and mobile application for smartphone are designed based on the ontology that allows to support their semantic interoperability in socio-cyberphysical system. A case study considered in the paper is aimed at controlling the robots by group of humans. Group of robot consists of several robot types. Every type of robot has competencies that are described in the robot competency profile. Human experts also have own competencies that are described in the human profile. To control a robot a human should be available and have an appropriate competency for such type of robot. The paper describes the developed prototype for Android-based smartphone. The prototype implements the proposed approach and based on the developed ontology and Smart-M3 information sharing platform.	humanârobot interaction;remote control	Alexey Kashevnik;Darya Kalyazina;Vladimir Parfenov;Anton I.

In the present study, the 4-key text entry was augmented with the color blinking feedback provided through a single 2-color light emitting diode coupled with eyeglasses to facilitate learning visually handicapped users to type. The implemented approach resulted in significantly greater text entry rate of about 18 wpm under 2.5 hours of practice vs. 14 wpm and 4 hours of practice without the use of the visual feedback. The color blinking feedback could improve the learning process of text entry techniques if this kind of feedback is still possible to apply.	diode;event (computing);feedback;lateral thinking;words per minute	Tatiana Evreinova;Grigori E.

In the study, the main aim is the visualization of the planta. A plantar image is reflected at the reflecting surface and captured by a camera embedded in a clog. The obtained visual information differs from the pressure and IMU data obtained from conventional sensors as it provides detailed information on the plantar surface. This is used to investigate the relationship between the activity in the toe area and stumbling experiences. The results indicate that high toe activity is associated with the group with no stumbling experiences and low toe activity is associated with the group with stumbling experiences.	embedded system;sensor;stumbleupon	Yingjie Jin;Miho Shogenji;Tetsuyou Watanabe	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014126	visualization;simulation;plantar surface;pressure sensor;inertial measurement unit;computer graphics (images);computer science	Robotics	-45.53253678066227	-48.76828418633818	138822

However, commercially-available wearable devices still provide very limited haptic feedback, mainly focusing on vibrotactile sensations. Towards a more realistic feeling of interacting with virtual and remote objects, we propose a novel wearable cutaneous device for the proximal finger phalanx, called """"hRing"""". It consists of two servo motors that move a belt placed in contact with the user's finger skin. When the motors spin in opposite directions, the belt presses into the user's finger, while when the motors spin in the same direction, the belt applies a shear force to the skin. Its positioning on the proximal finger phalanx improves the capability of this device to be used together with unobtrusive hand tracking systems, such as the LeapMotion controller and the Kinect sensor. The viability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a pick-and-place experiment involving seven human subjects. Providing cutaneous feedback through the proposed device improved the performance and perceived effectiveness of the considered task of 20% and 47% with respect to not providing any force feedback, respectively. All subjects found no difference in the quality of the tracking when carrying out the task wearing the device versus barehanded."""	haptic technology;human factors and ergonomics;information;interaction;kinect;motion controller;smt placement equipment;servo;tracking system;wearable computer;wearable technology	Claudio Pacchierotti;Gionata Salvietti;Irfan Hussain;Leonardo Meli;Domenico Prattichizzo	2016	2016 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)	10.1109/HAPTICS.2016.7463167	control engineering;embedded system;simulation;engineering	HCI	-41.40861330560361	-44.39295496440872	139175

Muscle fatigue is recognized as the reduction in a muscleâs capacity to generate force or power output and was measured objectively and subjectively before and after a puzzle-solving task. While subjective measures showed a significant level of overall arm muscle fatigue after the task for both configurations, objective measures showed a significant level of muscle fatigue on the middle deltoids and the non-dominant extensor digitorum for the vertical configuration only. We discuss the design implications of these findings and suggest relevant future areas of investigation.	multi-touch;usability testing	Shiroq Al-Megren;Ahmed Kharrufa;Jonathan Hook;Amey Holden;Selina Sutton;Patrick Olivier	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22723-8_13	psychology;artificial intelligence;operations research	HCI	-46.275091480265374	-47.7669506074026	139607
5a7e308b924d7f4a5384a8bd1f45f76856f1f22a	too many pixels to perceive: subpixel shutoff for display energy reduction on oled smartphones		Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) has been widely recognized as the next-generation mobile display. Recently, smartphone manufacturers have been pushing up the pixel density of OLED display. Unfortunately, such an effort does not necessarily improve the everyday viewing because of the limitation in human visual acuity. Instead, high pixel density OLED can drain the battery power even more quickly since the power dissipation of OLED is determined by the number of displayed pixels and their RGB values, or subpixels. This paper presents a new design dimension to remedy this prevailing issue by leveraging the intuition that shutting off redundant subpixels of the display content on OLED can reduce power consumption without impacting viewing perception. We introduce ShutPix, a power-saving display system for OLED smartphones that can optimally shut off the redundant subpixels before the content is displayed. Inspired by the motivational studies, ShutPix is empowered by a suite of designs based on visual acuity, human perception, and content redundancy. Experimental results show that ShutPix can, on average, reduce 21% of display power and 15% of system power without degrading user viewing experience.	color management;diode;experiment;ibm notes;mobile phone;oled;pixel density;shutdown (computing);smartphone;subpixel rendering	Zhisheng Yan;Chang Wen Chen	2017		10.1145/3123266.3123344	pixel;artificial intelligence;computer vision;redundancy (engineering);rgb color model;subpixel rendering;computer science;pixel density;oled;intuition	HCI	-37.8122638158581	-48.36466072183378	139715

In this paper, we present a robot that manipulates objects on a tabletop in response to verbal interaction. Reactivity is maintained by using concurrent interaction processes, such as visual trackers and collision detection processes. The interaction processes and their associated data are organized into object schemas, each representing a physical object in the environment, based on the target of each process. The object schemas then serve as discrete structures of coordination between reactivity, planning, and language use, permitting rapid integration of information from multiple sources.	collision detection;discrete mathematics;natural language;responsiveness;robot	Kai-yuh Hsiao;Soroush Vosoughi;Stefanie Tellex;Rony Kubat;Deb Roy	2008	2008 3rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)	10.1145/1349822.1349853	natural language processing;humanârobot interaction;robot;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;affordance;natural language;collision detection	Robotics	-34.41958908131583	-41.09280192856313	139724

However, the efficiency and effectiveness of this interaction is severely limited by the inherent characteristics of mobile devices, including small screen size and the lack of a viable keyboard or mouse. This paper concerns the use of multimodal language processing techniques to enable interfaces combining speech and gesture input that overcome these limitations. Specifically we focus on robust processing of pen gesture inputs in a local search application and demonstrate that edit-based techniques that have proven effective in spoken language processing can also be used to overcome unexpected or errorful gesture input. We also examine the use of a bottom-up gesture aggregation technique to improve the coverage of multimodal understanding.	display size;gesture recognition;local search (optimization);mobile computing;mobile device;multimodal interaction;television	Srinivas Bangalore;Michael Johnston	2008		10.1145/1452392.1452439	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;local search;operating system;mobile technology;multimodal interaction;top-down and bottom-up design;gesture recognition;mobile device;mobile computing;robustness	HCI	-47.787423910262405	-43.997295605312736	139808

Eleven types of user actions were identified from the log content. The study is novel in its combined analytical techniques and use of clickstream data from an image-based digital library. Three analytical techniques were used to analyse the data: a network analysis to better understand the relationship between sequential actions; b sequential pattern mining to identify frequent action sequences; and c k-means cluster analysis to identify groups of session patterns. The analysis revealed strong ties between several pairs of actions, relatively short pattern sequences that frequently duplicate previous actions and largely uniform session behaviour with little individual item browsing within sessions, indicating users are primarily engaged in purposeful and directed searching. Developers of image-based digital libraries should consider design features that support rapid browsing.	digital library;session (web analytics)	Hye Jung Han;Dietmar Wolfram	2016	J.

dff5dea784749b92767428cef40afed161c1f2de	visual fixation for 3d video stabilization		Visual fixation is employed by humans and some animals to keep a specific 3D location at the center of the visual gaze. Inspired by this phenomenon in nature, this paper explores the idea to transfer this mechanism to the context of video stabilization for a handheld video camera. A novel approach is presented that stabilizes a video by fixating on automatically extracted 3D target points. This approach is different from existing automatic solutions that stabilize the video by smoothing. To determine the 3D target points, the recorded scene is analyzed with a stateof-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm, which estimates camera motion and reconstructs a 3D point cloud of the static scene objects. Special algorithms are presented that search either virtual or real 3D target points, which back-project close to the center of the image for as long a period of time as possible.

Furthermore, different methods of additional user interaction are investigated. It is shown that the stabilization process can easily be controlled and that it can be combined with state-of-theart tracking techniques in order to obtain a powerful image stabilization tool.

Key accessibility features for vision related impairment includes assistive screen reading applications like Voiceover in iOS or Talkback in Android which supports a variety of touch gestures for performing basic functions and commands. Our preliminary interactions with users from this community revealed that some of these existing gestures are ambiguous, difficult to perform, non-intuitive and have accuracy and detection issues. Moreover there is lack of understanding regarding usage of these accessibility features and existing gestures. In this paper, we address these challenges through set of three experimental exercises-task based comparative evaluation, gesture elicitation and gesture performance done with a group of 12 visually impaired users. Based on experimental evidences we pinpoint the exact problems with few existing gestures. Additionally, this work contributes in identifying some characteristics of effective and easy gestures for the target segment. We also propose design solutions to resolve users pain points and discuss some touch screen accessibility design guidelines keeping in mind different type of visually impaired users fully blind, extremely low vision and low vision.	accessibility;ambiguous grammar;android;experiment;feedback;gesture recognition;interaction;mobile phone;screen reading;smartphone;touchscreen;user interface;ios	Vikas Luthra;Sanjay Ghosh	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20681-3_3	humanâcomputer interaction;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-47.262693327537136	-43.88754085847291	140037

None of these systems work seamlessly both indoors and outdoors. Drishti uses a precise position measurement system, a wireless connection, a wearable computer, and a vocal communication interface to guide blind users and help them travel in familiar and unfamiliar environments independently and safely. Outdoors, it uses DGPS as its location system to keep the user as close as possible to the central line of sidewalks of campus and downtown areas; it provides the user with an optimal route by means of its dynamic routing and rerouting ability. The user can switch the system from an outdoor to an indoor environment with a simple vocal command. An OEM ultrasound positioning system is used to provide precise indoor location measurements. Experiments show an in-door accuracy of 22 cm. The user can get vocal prompts to avoid possible obstacles and step-by-step walking guidance to move about in an indoor environment. This paper describes the Drishti system and focuses on the indoor navigation design and lessons learned in integrating the indoor with the outdoor system.	differential gps;interaction;positioning system;routing;system of measurement;wearable computer	Lisa Ran;Abdelsalam Helal;Steve Moore	2004	Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, 2004.

However, our environmentally-based perceptual capacity is often challenged under crowded conditions, even more so in critical circumstances like emergency evacuations. In those situations, we often fail to pay attention to important signs. In order to achieve more effective direction guidance, we considered the use of unconscious reflexes in human walking. In this study, we experimented with vision-guided walking direction control by inducing subjects to shift their gaze direction using a vection stimulus combined with body sway. We confirmed that a shift in a subjectâs walking direction and body sway could be induced by a combination of vection and vibratory stimulus. We propose a possible mechanism for this effect.

876cd20f86d205fe11306e38638717ade4fa232d	evaluation of mono/binocular depth perception using virtual image display		Augmented reality (AR) is a very popular technology in various applications. It allows the user to see the real world, with virtual objects composited with or superimposed upon the real world. The usability of interactive user interface based on AR relies heavily on visibility and depth perception of content, virtual image display particularly. In this paper, we performed several basic evaluations for a commercial see-through head mounted display based on those factors that can change depth perception: binocular or monocular, viewing distance, eye dominance, content changed in shape or size, indicated by hand or reference object. The experiment results reveal many interesting and fascinating features. The features will be user interface design guidelines for every similar see-through near-eye display systems.

The concept of this method is adapted by inspecting and carefully considering the nature of Myanmar language word formations or hand writing orders. According to the initial user study with our software keyboard prototype, users were able to type at ~41.57 characters per minute with mouse, ~41.84 characters per minute with stylus pen, ~14.76 characters per minute with Logitech dual thumbstick game pad and ~20.52 characters per minute with Nintendo Wii remote controller. These numbers are sure to improve as further refinements on program interface are made. The merits of the proposed predictive text input method is that even first time users can type Myanmar sentences with appropriate typing speed, and that this approach is applicable for various kinds of mobile devices (see Figure.1) and extendable for other similar syllabic languages such as Khmer (language of Cambodia), Nepali (language of Nepal), Thai (language of Thailand) and Hindi (one of the languages of India) etc.	analog stick;extensibility;gamepad;input method;mobile device;predictive text;prototype;remote control;stylus (computing);usability testing;virtual keyboard;wii remote plus;words per minute	Ye Kyaw Thu	2008		10.1145/1358628.1358930	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;operating system;mobile device	NLP	-47.46936406860156	-44.731552003013796	141055

Unlike traditional robot-like scenarios dedicated to industrial applications with repetitive tasks, the current focus of attention is on applications that require close human interactions. One of the main fields of such applications concerns assisting and rehabilitating of dependent/elderly persons. In this study, the state-of-the-art of the main research advances in lower-limbs human assistance is presented. This includes a review on research covering mainly lower-limb actuated exoskeletons. Some case studies related to full-limb exoskeletons are presented as well. Lower-limb movement restoration using functional electrical stimulation and treadmillbased rehabilitation devices is also investigated. In addition, the seamless integration of wearable robots in ambient intelligence spaces appears as one of the major challenges for ubiquitous environments and ambient assisted living. Some open issues related to this integration are discussed in this paper.

5eec6d699dc3639a190975649c184785ec013f31	evaluation of gesture-command input method for pen-based group kj system		The processes involved in carrying out collaborative creative work and the ability to record and circulate the results are important. Previously, we proposed a label-capturing system for the group KJ method that uses anoto-based pens. The system instantly digitizes the positions and contents of labels containing ideas and thoughts, and then generates KJ diagrams for distribution. We also proposed a method for editing the visual properties of KJ diagrams using pen-writing gestures with physical transparent sheets on target labels. However, when the number of functions increases, the management of the physical transparent sheet becomes difficult. In this study, we verified the suitability of the system by introducing a user-defined gesture command framework. This framework increases the flexibility of user operation as well as the number of functions acceptable by the system. We confirmed the suitability through preliminary evaluation of the system with respect to recognition.	diagram;handwriting recognition;input method	Takahiro Nyu;Motoki Miura	2012			creative work;input method;gesture;computer science;computer hardware	HCI	-39.26787823388713	-41.27512526210058	141457

An experiment was designed to evaluate the functional benefit of wheel navigation key by using performance test. A questionnaire was also used to examine the personal preference. Eighteen subjects were recruited. In results, a significant difference was found in performance time between wheel-type and button-type product. In general, the difference was more significant as subject's skill level was higher. In questionnaire, different preference depending on the skill level and key type was reported. In conclusion, it was shown that the wheel-type navigation key improved the performance better as the skill level and search requirement became higher. Therefore, the wheel navigation key would be helpful device for users if we could use them selectively in order to speed up the searching task and replacing simple push button task.

ac8d2de567aea1fe228b88f3bd43137cf3354a24	3d-hudd - developing a prototyping tool for 3d head-up displays		The ability of head-up displays (HUDs) to present information within the usual viewpoint of the user has led to a quick adoption in domains where attention is crucial, such as in the car. As HUDs employ 3D technology, further opportunities emerge: information can be structured and positioned in 3D space thus allowing important information to be perceived more easily and information can be registered with objects in the visual scene to communicate a relationship. This allows novel user interfaces to be built. As of today, however, no prototyping tools exist, that allow 3D UIs for HUDs to be sketched and tested prior to development. To close this gap, we report on the design and development of the 3D Head-Up Display Designer (3D-HUDD). In addition, we present an evaluation of the tool with 24 participants, comparing different input modalities and depth management modes.	head-up display;prototype;usability	Nora Broy;Matthias Nefzger;Florian Alt;Mariam Hassib;Albrecht Schmidt	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22723-8_24	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;multimedia	HCI	-47.181647586600874	-41.24549692423178	142340

Instead, the device stays at the location of a virtual object and waits for the user to encounter it. In this paper, we extend this concept to fingertip contacts and design an encountered-type haptic display for multiple fingertip contacts to simulate tasks of grasping an object with any shape and size. Before designing the device, we intensively observed human grasping behaviors. This observation was very helpful to determine the mechanism of the device. An encountered-type device for three-fingered grasping was actually prototyped based on our design.	haptic technology;simulation;waits	Yasuyoshi Yokokohji;Nobuhiko Muramori;Yuji Sato;Tsuneo Yoshikawa	2003	12th International Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems, 2004.

Searching in videos is often a two-step process: first some sort of pre-filtering is done, where, for example, users query an indexed archive of files, followed by a human-based browsing, where users skim the returned result set in search for the relevant file or portion of it. The VBS aims at this whole search process, focusing in particular on its interactive aspects. Encouraged by previous years' results, we created a system that purely addresses the latter issue, i.e., interface and interaction design. By eliminating all kind of video indexing and query processing, we were aiming to demonstrate the importance of good interface design for video search and that its relevance is often underestimated by today's systems. This claim is clearly proven by the results our system achieved in the VBS 2015 competition, where our approach was on a par with the top performing ones. In this paper, we will describe our system along with related design decisions, present our results from the VBS event, and discuss them in further detail.	archive;browsing;database;interaction design;relevance;result set;smart common input method;vbscript	Wolfgang HÃ¼rst;Rob van de Werken	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)	10.1109/ISM.2015.104	computer science;interaction design;video tracking;database;multimedia;smacker video;world wide web;information retrieval	Visualization	-35.65464965698499	-50.41871627180349	142442

To prevent the user from colliding with the physical boundaries of the tracking space, so-called redirection techniques are used. These techniques introduce a subtle mismatch between the user's real and virtual movement and therefore keep him inside the tracking space while at the same time they allow him to explore an unlimited virtual environment. In most cases, there is more than one redirection technique available, and steering algorithms are used to select the best one at any given time. These algorithms use an optimal control scheme to select the optimal redirection action based on a prediction of the user's future path. In this paper, we present a novel approach for predicting a person's locomotion target. Using a set of known possible targets and models of human locomotion, this approach creates a set of expected paths and compares them to the path already traveled by the user in order to estimate the probability of the user heading for a certain target. We present a new approach for comparing two paths and evaluate its performance against three other approaches. We also compare four different ways of modeling a human's path to a target. To gather data for the comparison, a user study is conducted and the prediction performance of the different proposed approaches is discussed.	algorithm;course (navigation);dynamic time warping;eye tracking;graph (discrete mathematics);loss function;optimal control;redirected walking;redirection (computing);usability testing;virtual reality;waypoint	Markus Zank;Andreas M.

The hovering function effectively acts as the finger tracking sensor thereby allowing the user to type in the virtual space. When added with the additional phase to correct the initial touch input and having the final key entered upon the finger release, the proposed method showed competitive performance to that of the conventional âaim-and-shootâ method and also exhibited much higher usability. HoVR-Type also showed a significantly faster speed of input for the individual character. However, it remains to improve the interface with regards to reducing the error. Overall, the use of the smartphone leverages on the already established mobile user experience and can be further extended to other VR interaction techniques so that one can use the common smartphone as an all-purpose VR interaction device.	smartphone	Youngwon R.

We present Pursuits, an innovative interaction technique that enables truly spontaneous interaction with eye-based interfaces. A user can simply walk up to the screen and readily interact with moving targets. Instead of being based on gaze location, Pursuits correlates eye pursuit movements with objects dynamically moving on the interface. We evaluate the influence of target speed, number and trajectory and develop guidelines for designing Pursuits-based interfaces. We then describe six realistic usage scenarios and implement three of them to evaluate the method in a usability study and a field study. Our results show that Pursuits is a versatile and robust technique and that users can interact with Pursuits-based interfaces without prior knowledge or preparation phase.	field research;interaction technique;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);pervasive informatics;spontaneous order;usability testing	MÃ©lodie Vidal;Andreas Bulling;Hans-Werner Gellersen	2013		10.1145/2493432.2493477	computer vision;simulation;smooth pursuit;correlation;eye movement	HCI	-46.024432144382764	-43.42509503067071	142840

In these playful ecosystems, animals could be either alone or accompanied by human beings, but in both cases the system should react properly to the interactions of all the players, creating more engaging and natural games. Technologically-mediated playful scenarios for animals will therefore require contextual information about the game participants, such as their location or body posture, in order to suitably adapt the system reactions. This paper presents a depth-based tracking system for cats capable of detecting their location, body posture and field of view. The proposed system could also be extended to locate and detect human gestures and track small robots, becoming a promising component in the creation of intelligent interspecies playful environments.	algorithm;bittorrent tracker;computer vision;ecosystem;experience;humans;kinect;multimodal interaction;point of view (computer hardware company);poor posture;robot;sensor;top-down and bottom-up design;tracking system;unmanned aerial vehicle	Patricia Pons;Javier JaÃ©n MartÃ­nez;Alejandro CatalÃ¡	2015		10.1145/2832932.2837007	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-38.078521880068436	-39.16246126735752	142933

Metamaterial textures are integrated into 3D printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. Inspired by foldable paper sheets (""""origami"""") and surface wrinkling, our 3D printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. Unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. This allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. Metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. This allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. We present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation."""	3d printing;interactivity;rapid prototyping;texture mapping	Alexandra Ion;Robert Kovacs;Oliver S.

Qualitative and quantitative measurements of feasibility, usability and acceptance were applied.High acceptance of Google Glass but performance difficulties and moderate usability issues.Older adults with cognitive impairment have more difficulties using Google Glasses.Need for a combination of initial training and long-term support.An integration in their own glasses is absolutely essential for long-term usage. Cognitive, perceptual and motor skill changes may prevent older adults from successfully using modern technology. Google Glass possesses only a few buttons and seems to be overall intuitive. The present study aimed to assess the usability and acceptance of Google Glass with 30 older adults aged 65 years and over. The participants were asked to perform several standardized tasks and rate the usability. They experienced severe problems solving the tasks. Although Google Glass received only a marginal usability rating with an SUS score of 64.2 points, 60% of the participants rated the design as attractive, the handling as rather good and the complexity of the system as low. With a short training, even older adults with sensory and cognitive disabilities are able to use Google Glass. Recommendations for developers were derived from the study and are presented at the end of the article. They should be taken into account for the development of mobile applications for older adults using Google Glass.	glass	Marten Haesner;Sebastian Wolf;Anika Steinert;Elisabeth Steinhagen-Thiessen	2018	Int.

b059858feb39dbdf44c2d02150e27453330c88db	moca: a low-power, low-cost motion capture system based on integrated accelerometers	motion capture;low power	Human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual reality applications pose the challenge of enabling real-time interfaces for natural interaction. Gesture recognition based on body-mounted accelerometers has been proposed as a viable solution to translate patterns of movements that are associated with user commands, thus substituting point-and-click methods or other cumbersome input devices. On the other hand, cost and power constraints make the implementation of a natural and efficient interface suitable for consumer applications a critical task. Even though several gesture recognition solutions exist, their use in HCI context has been poorly characterized. For this reason, in this paper, we consider a low-cost/low-power wearable motion tracking system based on integrated accelerometers called motion capture with accelerometers (MOCA) that we evaluated for navigation in virtual spaces. Recognition is based on a geometric algorithm that enables efficient and robust detection of rotational movements. Our objective is to demonstrate that such a low-cost and a low-power implementation is suitable for HCI applications. To this purpose, we characterized the system from both a quantitative point of view and a qualitative point of view. First, we performed static and dynamic assessment of movement recognition accuracy. Second, we evaluated the effectiveness of user experience using a 3D game application as a test bed.	algorithm;cpu power dissipation;embedded system;foremost;gesture recognition;humanâcomputer interaction;input device;low-power broadcasting;motion capture;point and click;point of view (computer hardware company);real-time locating system;testbed;tracking system;user experience;virtual reality;wearable computer	Elisabetta Farella;Luca Benini;Bruno RiccÃ²;Andrea Acquaviva	2007	Adv. in MM	10.1155/2007/82638	embedded system;computer vision;motion capture;simulation;computer science;operating system	HCI	-43.64147215716917	-43.38263703819234	143287

However, the interaction among humans is characterized by a highly interactive process of analyzing and responding to incoming stimuli from the partner. Even that flutist robot has successfully imitated the flute playing quite similar to human performance; the way of processing and analyzing the music as human does still requires further improvements. In this paper, we would describe how we implemented a human like sound processing system to enable robot to interact with humans at the same level of perception. An experimental setup was done to verify the validity of the developed system.	audio signal processing;experiment;fast fourier transform;human reliability;humans;humanârobot interaction;psychoacoustics;robot;sound quality	Jorge Solis;Keisuke Chida;Kei Suefuji;Atsuo Takanishi	2005	ROMAN 2005.

Monitoring this view can often be difficult for others to watch due to unwanted camera motions that appear unnatural and unmotivated. We present a novel method for reducing the unnaturalness of these camera motions by minimizing camera movement while maintaining the context of the participant's observations. For each time-step, we compare the parts of the scene viewed by the virtual participant to the parts of the scene viewed by the camera. Based on the similarity of these two viewpoints we next determine how the camera should be adjusted. We present two means of adjustment, one which continuously adjusts the camera and a second which attempts to stop camera movement when possible. Empirical evaluation shows that our method can produce paths that have substantially shorter travel distances, are easier to watch and maintain the original observations of the participant's virtual experience.	distance;experience;image viewer;motion;published comment;real-time transcription;virtual reality	Kevin Ponto;Hyun Joon Shin;Joe Kohlmann;Michael Gleicher	2012	Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology.

What they fail to do is to provide a comprehensive text entry solution for interacting with the various app notifications they display. In this paper we present ETAO keyboard, a full-fledged keyboard for smartwatches, where a user can input the most frequent English alphabets with a single tap. Other keys which include numbers and symbols are entered by a double tap. We conducted a user study that involved sitting and walking scenarios for our experiments and after a very short training session, we achieved an average words per minute (WPM) of 12.46 and 9.36 respectively. We expect that our proposed keyboard will be a viable option for text entry on smartwatches.	smartwatch	Rajkumar Darbar;Punyashlok Dash;Debasis Samanta	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.078	simulation;operating system;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-47.152317466955374	-45.15307274482201	144074

A microcontroller samples and transmits the measured pressure information. Conductive fabric attached to the finger contact area translates the touch to the bottom of the ball which allows the touchscreen to detect the position and orientation. The addition of a tangible, pressuresensitive input to a portable multimedia device opens up new possibilities for expressive musical interfaces and Squeezy is used as a controller for real-time gesture controlled voice synthesis research.	articulatory synthesis;haptic technology;input device;microcontroller;multi-touch;real-time transcription;speech synthesis;tablet computer;touchscreen	Johnty Wang;Nicolas D'Alessandro;Sidney S.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel, remotely controlled for the purposes of edutainment and instructor-student interaction, three-dimensional full body avatar gamification framework. The main innovation introduced focuses on multi-presence gamified educational scenarios in multiple desktop computers and mobile devices. Thus the remotely-controlled avatar can act as a guide, assistant or information presenter for novel, cross-platform Ambient Intelligence (AmI) edutainment scenarios. In detail, the avatar's role depends on the requirements of the AmI client applications as these are propagated remotely (using remote procedure calls). Examples of remote function invocations include real-time 3D biped skinned animations, text-to-speech, producing facial expressions and presenting multimedia content.	ambient intelligence;anytime algorithm;desktop computer;digital recording;educational entertainment;gamification;mobile device;real-time transcription;remote control;remote procedure call;requirement;simulation;speech synthesis;virtual desktop	Emmanouil Zidianakis;George Papagiannakis;Constantine Stephanidis	2014		10.1145/2669062.2669083	computer vision;design;real-time computing;simulation;ambient intelligence;performance;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;multimedia;speech synthesis;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-47.52159429395658	-38.27179882741855	144194

The principle of employing an LED as a wavelength-sensitive light sensor is employed in designing an RGB (red green blue) LED lamp. A design prototype of such an LED lamp is presented, along with an associated driver protocol, such that it can sense color and illuminate at the picked up color without perceivable flicker. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the dual function of the RGB lamp in color sensing and illumination at primary RGB colors.	color;diode;duality (optimization);flicker (screen);illumination (image);led lamp;oled;prototype	Shuai Li;Ashish Pandharipande	2014	2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Consumer Electronics Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)	10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2014.7034294	color temperature;optoelectronics;optics;seachanger color engine	Robotics	-40.709372224233704	-41.55273753613897	144283

Pointing over time and with varying direction is often referred to as scanning , which is an emerging interaction technique and increasingly applied in the eld of mobile navigation and orientation. Because there is no need to look at the screen while scanning, often haptic or audio feedback is used. In fact there exist several di erent scanning-based interaction concepts. However, until now it is impossible to analyse and compare these techniques systematically to identify the best concept for a certain scenario. In this paper we investigated how our own Tactile Compass scanning technique has been used in a eld study. Based on our observations we identi ed a set of measures, which we propose to become a standard set for the analysis and comparison of scan-based interaction techniques. We further argue that our contribution may be bene cial for the creation of guidelines and support designers in selecting a proper scan-based interaction technique.	audio feedback;existential quantification;haptic technology;interaction technique;mobile phone	Benjamin Poppinga;Martin Pielot;Wilko Heuten;Susanne Boll	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32796-4_12	computer vision;simulation;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-46.775529202769164	-43.48732960914588	144493

CS replicates information in each context. The user can freely explore one context without worrying about the Midas touch problem, and a saccade to the other context triggers the selection of the item under focus. Because CS has to display two contexts simultaneously, the amount of useful screen space is limited. DCS dynamically adjusts the context sizes, where the context that has the focus is displayed in full size, while the other is minimized, thus improving useful screen space. A saccade to the minimized context triggers selection, and properly readjusts the sizes of the contexts. Results from a pilot user experiment show that DCS improves user performance and do not cause disorientation due to the dynamic context resizing.	context switch;glossary of computer graphics;programming paradigm	Antonio Diaz Tula;Filipe Morgado Simoes de Campos;Carlos Hitoshi Morimoto	2012		10.1145/2168556.2168635	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-45.6481718644633	-46.22270958975786	144603

Because of the limited storage capacity and small size of the PDA, a more compact and more convenient design is needed in an embedded user interface, like the on-line character recognition system. To make a convenient interface, the character recognition system has to recognize the cursive type of Korean characters. We define a cursive type of Korean characters as the connection of primitive strokes. We use the path discriminant HMM (PDHMM). The initial structure of the PDHMM is designed from the hand-printed characters and then it is expanded to the cursive case. When new strokes for the cursive type are defined, we can easily extend the PDHMM by inserting proper edges. To save the storage space of the PDA, character recognition is done simply with traversing a single PDHMM. We make smaller states for the PDHMM than the ones for other HMMs. We implemented it on a handheld PC (HPC) and got a good recognition rate.	personal digital assistant	Hyun Uk Kang;Hang Joon Kim	2000	IEEE Trans.

07c763cd86b59b82761029158b3ef7e3dd8b1287	this study of hand anthropometry and touchscreen size of smartphones		With the development of communication technology, smartphone becomes an important personnel device that everyone must have. As the introduction of 3 rd Generation mobile telecommunication, the technology of touch screen was started to be applied on the mobile phones and an indis- pensable component on a 3G smartphone that is built in advanced computing capability like digital cameras, GPS and web-browser. Most of modern smart- phones include high-resolution touchscreens for display and control and the size of touchscreen becomes larger and larger. However, the question is that a larger screen is convenient to every user? The aim of this study is to realize the relationship between touchscreen sizes of smartphones and user's relative hand dimensions based on the operation time, operation error rate and subjective thumb fatigue. One hundred subjects, including 50 males and 50 females were invited to attend the experiment. The experiment design includes 4 touchscreen sizes. The hand length and hand width were both divided into 4 categories respectively. The results indicated there is a rapid increasing trend from 3.5 in. screen to 5.7 in. screen for smaller hand length/width and the trend decreases firstly slight and then increases for large hand length/width. Touchscreen size from 4.6 in. to 5.0 in. is suggested for most people because this interval of screen size is relatively suitable based on the analysis of hand dimensions and 3 performance evaluation indices. Too large touchscreen (5.7 in.) is hard to use for any hand length or width.	anthropometry;smartphone;touchscreen	Yu-Cheng Lin;Ming-Hung Lin	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20612-7_58	embedded system;simulation;computer hardware;engineering	HCI	-47.58687960505555	-45.59170121054287	144681

This paper presents several of the challenges that emerged during the development of a functioning prototype that is able to sense interaction data for several days. We focus in particular on RFID tag reading range optimization, efficient data logging methods, meaningful evaluation techniques, and long-term deployments.	algorithm;data logger;embedded system;interaction;mathematical optimization;prototype;radio-frequency identification;sensor	Eugen Berlin;Jun Liu;Kristof Van Laerhoven;Bernt Schiele	2010		10.1145/1709886.1709898	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;communication	Mobile	-43.42604324370315	-43.01617747949406	144752

The devices tested were a touchscreen, a touchscreen with stabilization (stabilization software filters and smooths raw data from hardware), and a mouse. The task was the selection of rectangular targets 1, 4, 16, and 32 pixels per side (0.4x0.6, 1.7x2.2, 6.9x9.0, 13.8x17.9 mm respectively). T ouchscreen users were able to point at single pixel targets, thereby countering widespread expectations of poor touchscreen resolution. The results show no difference in performance between the mouse and touchscreen for targets ranging from 32 to 4 pixels per side. In addition, stabilization significantly reduced the error rates for the touchscreen when selecting small targets. These results imply that touchscreens, when properly used, have attractive advantages in selecting targets as small as 4 pixels per size (approximately onequarter of the size of a single character). A variant of Fitts' Law is proposed to predict touchscreen pointing times. Ideas for future research are also presented.	fitts's law;pixel;touchscreen	Andrew Sears;Ben Shneiderman	1991	International Journal of Man-Machine Studies	10.1016/0020-7373(91)90037-8	attitude;simulation;performance;computer science;artificial intelligence;technical report;user interface	HCI	-46.96895813895514	-46.24639301590346	145299

43ef6bfb5bbffdf0c2a9141f0cff132c39656b0c	wearable rgbd indoor navigation system for the blind		In this paper, we present a novel wearable RGBD camera based navigation system for the visually impaired. The system is composed of a smartphone user interface, a glass-mounted RGBD camera device, a real-time navigation algorithm, and haptic feedback system. A smartphone interface provides an effective way to communicate to the system using audio and haptic feedback. In order to extract orientational information of the blind users, the navigation algorithm performs real-time 6-DOF feature based visual odometry using a glass-mounted RGBD camera as an input device. The navigation algorithm also builds a 3D voxel map of the environment and analyzes 3D traversability. A path planner of the navigation algorithm integrates information from the egomotion estimation and mapping and generates a safe and an efficient path to a waypoint delivered to the haptic feedback system. The haptic feedback system consisting of four micro-vibration motors is designed to guide the visually impaired user along the computed path and to minimize cognitive loads. The proposed system achieves real-time performance faster than 30Hz in average on a laptop, and helps the visually impaired extends the range of their activities and improve the mobility performance in a cluttered environment. The experiment results show that navigation in indoor environments with the proposed system avoids collisions successfully and improves mobility performance of the user compared to conventional and state-of-the-art mobility aid devices.	algorithm;cinii;computer performance;experiment;haptic technology;in the beginning... was the command line;input device;laptop;mobile app;real-time clock;real-time locating system;ric weiland;sensor web;smartphone;tree accumulation;user interface;visual odometry;voxel;waypoint	Young Hoon Lee;GÃ©rard G.

For convenience, it is desired to perform a direct pointing operation on the screen without requiring to grip or mount any device and control the pointer intuitively. Therefore, this study proposes a new touch-operated large-screen projection system using acoustic vibration sensing and a projector-camera system. We apply a continuous signal in the inaudible range of an actuator to a surface and acquire its elastic compliance change as a resonance of sounds. We perform touch detection, position estimation, and pressure estimation by using machine learning techniques. Our actuator and sensor units are small and easy to install on a surface. Furthermore, our system can detect """"true"""" touch without requiring any devices such as pens or pointers.

Typically, this adjustment occurs within approximately 100 ms. Here, we investigated the effect of anticipatory vibrotactile cues prior to a perturbative force, which the central nervous system may use for rapid grip re-stabilization. We asked participants to grip and hold an instrumented, actuated handle between the thumb and index finger. Under computer control, the handle could suddenly be pulled away from a static grip and could independently provide vibration to the gripping fingers. The mean latency of corrective motor action was 139 ms. When vibrotactile stimulation was applied 50 ms before application of tractive force, the latency was reduced to 117 ms, whereas the mean latency of the conscious response to vibrotactile stimuli alone was 229 ms. This suggests that vibrotactile stimulation can influence reflex-like actions. We also examined the effects of anticipatory cues using a set of perturbative loads with different rising rates. As expected, facilitation of grip force adjustment was observed for moderate loads. In contrast, anticipatory cues had an insignificant effect on rapid loads that evoked an adjustment within 60-80 ms, which approaches the minimum latency of human grip adjustment. Understanding the facilitative effects of anticipatory cues on human reactive grip can aid the development of human-machine interfaces to enhance human behavior.	computer control company;eighty;emdebian grip;fingers, unit of measurement;index finger;influenza;nervous system structure;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);reflex action;sacral nerve stimulation;user interface;facilitation	Shogo Okamoto;Michael Wiertlewski;Vincent Hayward	2016	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2016.2526613	control engineering;database index;simulation;engineering;vibration;dc motor;force;physics;quantum mechanics	HCI	-45.02933859240059	-50.78044374434245	145801
438dde4d06c6a5aff9d4a43145240510ec04b9d2	tele-robots with shared autonomy: tele-presence for high level operability		The aim is to improve the operability of an advanced demonstration platform incorporating reflexive teleoperated control concepts developed on a mobile robot system. The robot is capable of autonomously navigating in semi-structured environments. Reflexive tele-operation mode employs the robot extensive onboard sensor suite to prevent collisions with obstacles when the human operator assumes control and remotely drives the robot to investigate a situation of interest. For the shared autonomy aspect, four levels of autonomy have been implemented: tele-operation, safe mode, shared autonomy and autonomous mode. The operability level is enhanced by improving significantly the situational awareness of the operator by using an inertial tracker in combination with a head mounted display creating a certain feeling of presence. As such, the system permits precision observation and pinpoint data collection without subjecting the user to a possibly hazardous remote environment.	autonomous robot;autonomy;head-mounted display;high-level programming language;mobile robot;operability;semiconductor industry;television	Thomas Geerinck;Valentin Enescu;Ioan Alexandru Salomie;Sid Ahmed Berrabah;Kenny Cauwerts;Hichem Sahli	2005			operability;systems engineering;control engineering;robot;engineering;autonomy	Robotics	-36.9306622768085	-41.57991830740173	145909

Our method uses a new RFID technology to recognize book page location. A thin flexible transponder tag with a unique ID is embedded in the paper of each page, and a tag reader is affixed to the binding of the back of the book. As the pages turn, the tag reader notices which tags are within its read range and which have moved out of its range (which is about four inches). The human interacts with the book naturally, and is not required to perform any actions for page detection that are not usual in book interaction. The page-detection data can be used to enhance the experience of the book, or to enable the book as a controller for another system.

1b6133b2036c57f4c6388cc3e684fe0d5763297e	blind path obstacle detector using smartphone camera and line laser emitter		Visually impaired people find navigating within unfamiliar environments challenging. Many smart systems have been proposed to help blind people in these difficult, often dangerous, situations. However, some of them are uncomfortable, difficult to obtain or simply too expensive. In this paper, a low-cost wearable system for visually impaired people was implemented which allows them to detect and locate obstacles in their locality. The proposed system consists of two main hardware components, a laser pointer ($12) and an android smart phone, making our system relatively cheap and accessible. The collision avoidance algorithm uses image processing to measure distances to objects in the environment. This is based on laser light triangulation. This obstacle detection is enhanced by edge detection within the captured image. An additional feature of the system is to recognize and warn the user when stairs are present in the camera's field of view. Obstacles are brought to the user's attention using an acoustic signal. Our system was shown to be robust, with only 5 % false alarm rate and a sensitivity of 90 % for 1 cm wide obstacles.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;android;ccir system a;depth map;edge detection;global positioning system;image processing;lambert's cosine law;locality of reference;microsoft outlook for mac;pointer (computer programming);robustness (computer science);smart system;smartphone;template matching;wearable computer	Rimon Saffoury;Peter Blank;Julian Sessner;Benjamin H.

4eba292f1a71294571f3881c62e5d05be020f44d	human factors of stereoscopic 3d displays		Human Factors of Stereoscopic Displays provides an overview of all vision-relevant topics and issues that inform stereo display design from a user-centric or human factor, perspective. Although both the basic vision science literature and the applied literature will be reviewed, the strength and originality of this book comes from the emphasis on the basic science literature on human stereo vision and its implications for stereo display design. The reader will learn how to design stereo displays from a human vision/human factors perspective. Over the past several years, there has been a growing interest in the development of high-quality displays that present binocular parallax information to the human visual system for inducing the perception of three-dimensional depth. The methods for presenting binocular parallax to an observer vary widely and include three broad categories of display: stereoscopic, holographic and volumetric displays. Because the technology for stereoscopic displays is more developed and more widely used, than those based on holography or volumetric methods, the proposed book addresses those human factors issues involved in the viewing of stereoscopic displays. Despite the diverse methods for creating stereoscopic displays, which includes stereo spatial multiplexing as well as temporal multiplexing (i.e., field sequential) techniques, there remain common human factor issues that arise when viewing such displays. Human Factors of Stereoscopic Displays will provide a detailed review of these important issues so that they can be considered when designing and using 3D displays. In doing so, the following topics will be covered: interocular cross talk; interocular differences in luminance and contrast; accommodation-vergence mismatch; stereoanomaly; spatio-temporal frequency effects; distance scaling of disparity and high-level cue conflict.body	human factors and ergonomics;stereo display;stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy	Robert Earl Patterson	2015		10.1007/978-1-4471-6651-1	stereoscopy;holography;computer vision;multimedia;stereo display;vision science;human visual system model;parallax;active shutter 3d system;artificial intelligence;geography;stereopsis	HCI	-40.15369589341986	-40.73300217260641	146150

Furthermore, the combined use of the framework with WebIB, which is a software development system for Web 3D contents, it also becomes possible to develop more attractive educational contents using 3D graphics that run on Web and Digital TV.

Speech interfaces have suffered from issues similar to those of visual displays, as they often rely on a complex menu structure that corresponds to that of visual systems. Recent advances in speech technology allow the use of natural language, eliminating the need for menu structures and offering a tighter coupling between the intention to act and the completion of the action. Modern speech technology may not only make already existing types of interaction safer, but also opens up for new applications, which may enhance safety. One such application is a speech-based hazard reporting system. A small fixed-base simulator study showed that drivers adapt the timing of the hazard reports to the situation at hand, such that an increase in reported workload was avoided.	natural language;requirement;simulation;speech technology	Alexander Eriksson;Anders LindstrÃ¶m;Albert Seward;Alexander Seward;Katja Kircher	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07230-2_38	simulation;speech recognition;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;information and computer science	HCI	-48.093497129600095	-46.73655689850088	146423

The technology-enabled gadgets not only facilitate and enrich our daily lives but also are interesting tools to challenge human imagination to design and implement new ubiquitous applications. Pervasive gaming, in which human interaction and game/scenario-dependent designs are often common practices, has proved to be one of the areas to successfully combine technology and the human fantasy. By moving away from games being played by humans and by focusing instead on games played by robots and giving humans the leading role of defining game strategies and playersâ roles, this paper aims at bridging the two fields of robotics and wireless sensor/actuator networks and exploring their potentials in the field of pervasive gaming. A generic game development framework is introduced that accommodates different types of robots and various kinds of sensors and actuators. Being extensible and modular, the proposed framework can be used for a wide range of pervasive applications built upon sensors and actuators. To enable game development, a Wiimotebased robot identification and localization technique is presented.

35bca39cce4ec433ca41337e2c3bf84a66e5cfe7	precise pointing techniques for handheld augmented reality		We propose two techniques that improve accuracy of pointing at physical objects for handheld Augmented Reality (AR). In handheld AR, pointing accuracy is limited by both touch input and camera viewpoint instability due to hand jitter. The design of our techniques is based on the relationship between the touch input space and two visual reference frames for on-screen content, namely the screen and the physical object that one is pointing at. The first technique is based on Shift, a touch-based pointing technique, and video freeze, in order to combine the two reference frames for precise pointing. Contrastingly -without freezing the video-, the second technique offers a precise mode with a cursor that is stabilized on the physical object and controlled with relative touch inputs on the screen. Our experimental results show that our techniques are more accurate than the baseline techniques, namely direct touch on the video and screen-centered crosshair pointing.	ambiguous name resolution;augmented reality;baseline (configuration management);cursor (databases);experiment;handheld game console;instability;interaction technique;tablet computer;tracking system;transfer function	Thomas Vincent;Laurence Nigay;Takeshi Kurata	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40483-2_9	embedded system;computer vision;computer science;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.14508197611283	-45.90350210020873	146886

This paper reports our second study on this functionality, with stiffness as a goal modulation property. Our first study explored the potential of haptic AR by presenting an effective stiffness modulation system for simple 1D interaction. This paper extends the system so that a user can interact with a real object in any 3D exploratory pattern while perceiving its augmented stiffness. We develop a complete set of algorithms for contact detection, deformation estimation, force rendering, and force control. The core part is the deformation estimation where the magnitude and direction of real object deformation are estimated using a contact dynamics model identified in a preprocessing step. All algorithms are designed in a way that maximizes the efficiency and usability of the system while maintaining convincing perceptual quality. In particular, the need for a large amount of preprocessing such as geometry modeling is avoided to improve the usability. The physical performance of each algorithm is thoroughly evaluated with real samples. Each algorithm is experimentally verified to satisfy the physical performance requirements that need to be satisfied to achieve convincing rendering quality. The final perceptual quality of stiffness rendering is assessed in a psychophysical experiment where the difference in the perceived stiffness between augmented and virtual objects is measured. The error is less than the human discriminability of stiffness, demonstrating that our system can provide accurate stiffness modulation with perceptually insignificant errors. The limitations of our AR system are also discussed along with a plan for future work.	algorithm;augmented reality;bmc remedy action request system;computer-generated holography;direct stiffness method;embedded system;experiment;geometric modeling;haptic technology;interaction;multipoint ground;preprocessor;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;requirement;sensor;simulation;usability testing;virtual reality	Seokhee Jeon;Seungmoon Choi	2011	PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments	10.1162/PRES_a_00051	computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;computer science;satisfiability	Visualization	-43.61604602521635	-46.4877110358503	146924

The presented work is important, because no current literature investigates how sensor gloves can be used to assist children in the process of learning sign language. The research presented in this paper has been conducted by assembling hardware into sensor gloves, and by designing software capable of (i) filtering out sensor noise, (ii) detecting intentionally posed signs, and (iii) correctly evaluating signals in signs posed by different children. Findings show that the devised technology can form the basis of a tool that teaches children sign language, and that there is a potential for further research in this area.

In our previous study, we constructed neural-network-based Kansei estimation models to evaluate content presence. Herein we aim to incorporate system presence into the Kansei models. We initially examined five audio reproduction methods, which simulate different systems, and conducted subjective evaluation experiments using 12 audio-visual content items. The experiments indicate the audio reproduction method influences both the audio-only and audio-visual conditions, but the effect is larger in the audio-only condition. Thus, we introduced four features related to the spatial impression of sound as new inputs into the previous Kansei estimation models. The expanded models successfully estimated both the content presence and system presence regardless of the condition. Hence, these models can quantitatively estimate the sense of presence in both audio-visual content and systems.	anomalous experiences;artificial neural network;audio signal processing;experiment;performance;presence information;simulation	Kenji Ozawa;Masashi Obinata;Yuichiro Kinoshita	2012	2012 13th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	10.1109/SNPD.2012.106	computer vision;calibration;visualization;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;software testing;estimation theory;artificial neural network	SE	-39.568289246485115	-50.56268982863363	147140

We propose a calibration method to identify parameters which relates the EMG to joint torque by using HAL-3.

We show how visual 3D-feedback based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) is technically and conceptually feasible. Our wearable-app connects to our custom designed IMU-pods for measuring the legs' orientation. The App then shows an animated kinematic model in 3D. Our study with ten runners further contributes by providing first insights into how to apply natural, live-feedback with wearables for supporting run-training. Our prototype for the smartphone and head-up display demonstrates great potential for personal- and everyday use.	feedback;head-up display;prototype;sensor;smartphone;symposium on principles of database systems;visualization (graphics);wearable computer	Matthias Seuter;Lucien Opitz;Gernot Bauer;David Hochmann	2016		10.1145/2968219.2968576	embedded system;inertial measurement unit;simulation;wearable computer;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.93138591827537	-41.83046830134045	147740
05aaeafd520ff2d8fd785e68874df90f0cd9c758	consistent left-right reversals for visual path integration in virtual reality: more than a failure to update one's heading?	path integral;virtual reality;left right	Even in state-of-the-art virtual reality (VR) setups, participants often feel lost when navigating through virtual environments. In VR applications and psychological experiments, such disorientation is often compensated for by extensive training. Here, two experimental series investigated participants' sense of direction by means of a rapid point-to-origin paradigm without any performance feedback or training. This paradigm allowed us to study participants' intuitive spatial orientation in VR while minimizing the influence of higher cognitive abilities and compensatory strategies. After visually displayed passive excursions along one- or two-segment trajectories, participants were asked to point back to the origin of locomotion as accurately and quickly as possible. Despite using an immersive, high-quality video projection with a 84 63 field of view, participants' overall performance was rather poor. Moreover, about 40 of the participants exhibited striking qualitative errors, namely left-right reversalsdespite not misinterpreting the visually simulated turning direction. Even when turning angles were announced in advance to obviate encoding errors due to misperceived turning angles, many participants still produced surprisingly large systematic and random errors, and perceived task difficulty and response times were unexpectedly high. Careful analysis suggests that some, but not all, of the left-right inversions can be explained by a failure to update visually displayed heading changes. Taken together, this study shows that even an immersive, high-quality video projection system is not necessarily sufficient for enabling natural and intuitive spatial orientation or automatic spatial updating in VR, even when advance information about turning angles was provided. We posit that investigating qualitative errors for basic spatial orientation tasks using, for example, rapid point-to-origin paradigms can be a powerful tool for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of VR setups in terms of enabling natural and unencumbered spatial orientation and performance. We provide some guidelines for VR system designers.	cognition;course (navigation);experiment;immersion (virtual reality);inversion (discrete mathematics);programming paradigm;video projector;virtual reality	Bernhard E.

This paper proposes a smart privacy-preserving screen system that can detect someone else see the consumer's screen and then protect the screen automatically and adaptively. It depends on multiple sensors, i.e., video camera module, ultrasonic distance module, light sensor module, to detect screen peeping, user distance and environmental lightness, and decide whether to adjust the screen's lightness. With limited lightness or contrast, the screen can only be seen by the consumer, while others cannot watch the screen clearly. Especially, the screen peeping detection scheme is composed of several algorithms, i.e., eye detection, eye pair decision and person counting. Based on the video frames captured by the video camera module, the scheme will detect eyes in the video frame, decide the number of persons peeping at the private screen, and inform the smart screen to protect the screen by adjusting the light or contrast. With the smart phone as an example, various experiments are done and comparative results show that the proposed scheme obtains better performance than existing works and is a good solution for automatic screen privacy protection.	algorithm;camera module;computational complexity theory;experiment;laptop;mobile phone;performance;privacy;sensor;smartphone	Shiguo Lian;Wei Hu;Xingguang Song;Zhaoxiang Liu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2013.6490252	computer vision;information privacy;computer science;engineering;sensor fusion;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-34.71424131873605	-44.76870146717758	148065

The present study used a dual task paradigm to evaluate a plausible scenario in which users navigated a song list. We applied enhanced auditory menu navigation cues, including spearcons (i.e., compressed speech) and a spindex (i.e., a speech index that used brief audio cues to communicate the user's position in a long menu list). Twenty-four undergraduates navigated through an alphabetized song list of 150 song titles---rendered as an auditory menu---while they concurrently played a simple, perceptual-motor, ball-catching game. The menu was presented with text-to-speech (TTS) alone, TTS plus one of three types of enhanced auditory cues, or no sound at all. Both performance of the primary task (success rate of the game) and the secondary task (menu search time) were better with the auditory menus than with no sound. Subjective workload scores (NASA TLX) and user preferences favored the enhanced auditory cue types. Results are discussed in terms of multiple resources theory and practical IVT design applications.	auditory display;mobile phone;netware file system;programming paradigm;speech coding;speech synthesis;time-compressed speech;user (computing)	Myounghoon Jeon;Benjamin K.

However these printed materials only provide readers with static information. Readers may want to know more detail information about some product in an article or to watch video clips related to an event mentioned in a news right at the moment when they read that article or news. The authors propose a system with mobile devices that can provide extra information and multimedia for readers by applying augmented reality to traditional magazines. A user can enjoy extra rich multimedia information on a product or news on his/her mobile device just by looking at an article in a traditional magazine through his/her mobile device. The system detects which article in which page of a magazine that is being displayed in a mobile device and provides a reader with related information and multimedia objects. The important feature of our proposed system is using lightweight filter to efficiently filter out candidate covers or articles that do not visually match an image captured by a mobile device. The experiment shows that our proposed system achieves the average accuracy of more than 90% and can process in the real-time manner.	augmented reality;chi;mobile device;parallel computing;printing;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;social media;social network;video clip	Vinh-Tiep Nguyen;Minh-Triet Tran;Trung-Nghia Le;Quoc-Minh Bui;Anh Duc Duong	2012		10.1145/2350716.2350733	mobile search;computer science;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	HCI	-40.0548876831641	-40.07400075672283	148749

The procedure used a non-ISO Fittsâ law task since targets were randomly positioned from trial to trial. Due to a non-constant amplitude within each sequence of trials, throughput was calculated using two methods of data aggregation: by sequence of trials using the mean amplitude and by common A-W conditions. For each data set, we used four methods for calculating throughput. The grand mean for throughput calculated using the division of means and the adjustment for accuracy was 0.74 bps, which is 45% lower than the value obtained using an ISO task. We recommend calculating throughput using the division of means (and not the slope reciprocal from the regression model) and with the adjustment for accuracy. We present design recommendation for non-ISO tasks: Keep amplitude and target width constant within each sequence of trials and use strategies to avoid or remove reaction time.	data aggregation;fitts's law;ibm basic programming support;input method;mobile device;randomness;spatial variability;throughput	Maria Francesca Roig-MaimÃ³;I.

Currently, the predominant methods for accessing large photos on small devices are down-sampling or manual browsing by zooming and scrolling. Image down-sampling or thumbnail view results in significant information loss due to the excessive resolution reduction. Manual browsing can avoid information loss but it is often time-consuming for users to catch the most crucial information of an image. Employing the concept of information asymmetry, the thesis investigates an image attention model and its extensions under different application scenarios. The image attention model can successfully solve the small screen browsing problem. First of all, different parts of an image contain different information, computer vision technology can analysis image and extract the attention objects to build the image attention model. Secondly, browsing large photo on small display can be formulated as a problem of optimized manipulating of attention objects to improve viewer's browsing experience, which brings about new functions such as automatic browsing and interactive browsing. Thirdly, the screen limitations of the mobile devices will force users to scroll and zoom while browsing images, which can be regarded as direct indications for users' attention, therefore new attention objects can be discovered by analyzing the past browsing log. Lastly, since psycho-physiological research tells us that the importance of an attention object may vary with the users' preferences and tasks, so attention model should also be adaptive to the users' interest. #R##N#The thesis also investigates the problem on how to improve the usability of the current image search engines, that is, how to explore the image search results on desktop PCs and mobile devices in a more effective way. The research results show that unsupervised learning technology can help improve the browsing efficiency. The similarity-based presentation method and clustering-base method are better for desktop PC platform and mobile platform respectively. The navigation operations are re-designed to make the new interface easy to use. Based on these results, the thesis also tries to investigate the problem on how to incorporate users' interaction in content-based image retrieval relevance feedback process. The new approach employs the parameter embedding visualization, multi-classifier learning and fusion methods to provide a seamless integrated browsing, user feedback and classifier learning process.

As mobile devices become more affordable, it becomes more common that users own more than one mobile device and use them together. In this research, we investigate Hybrid AR systems that use both HMD and HHD for AR visualization and interaction. In addition to a simple approach of using HMD as a display and HHD as an input device (e.g. a touch pad or a pointer), we further explore novel interaction techniques that can take advantage of having both HMD and HHD closely integrated into one AR system, such as cross-device information sharing, situation adaptive visualization management, and multi-layered visualization.	augmented reality;bmc remedy action request system;handheld game console;head-mounted display;input device;interaction technique;mobile device;pointer (computer programming);touchpad	Rahul Budhiraja;Gun A.

9f64c94dab46441cc6f709c4572398fef416118f	intersectionexplorer, a multi-perspective approach for exploring recommendations		Abstract In this paper, we advent a novel approach to foster exploration of recommendations: IntersectionExplorer, a scalable visualization that interleaves the output of several recommender engines with human-generated data, such as user bookmarks and tags, as a basis to increase exploration and thereby enhance the potential to find relevant items. We evaluated the viability of IntersectionExplorer in the context of conference paper recommendation, through three user studies performed in different settings to understand the usefulness of the tool for diverse audiences and scenarios. We analyzed several dimensions of user experience and other, more objective, measures of performance. Results indicate that users found IntersectionExplorer to be a relatively fast and effortless tool to navigate through conference papers. Objective measures of performance linked to interaction showed that users were not only interested in exploring combinations of machine-produced recommendations with bookmarks of users and tags, but also that this âaugmentationâ actually resulted in increased likelihood of finding relevant papers in explorations. Overall, the findings suggest the viability of IntersectionExplorer as an effective tool, and indicate that its multi-perspective approach to exploring recommendations has great promise as a way of addressing the complex human-recommender system interaction problem.

While being a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks: it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms like 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors, such as Microsoft's Kinect, aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known to be e.g. tiring. In this paper, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we explore the conceptual design space in an exploratory study. (2) Based upon these results, we investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of such an interface in a controlled experiment. And (3), we contribute PalmRC: an eyes-free, palm-surface-based TV remote control, which in turn is evaluated in an early user feedback session. Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less and eyes-free TV remote interaction without any third-party mediator device.	handheld game console;imaginary time;interaction technique;kinect;mobile device;programming paradigm;remote control;sensor;television;touchscreen	Niloofar Dezfuli;Mohammadreza Khalilbeigi;Jochen Huber;Florian MÃ¼ller;Max MÃ¼hlhÃ¤user	2012		10.1145/2325616.2325623	simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;conceptual design;mobile device;multimedia;memory;world wide web;exploratory research;remote control;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-46.587420631084875	-43.0589642954168	149797

Combination displays we consider are: orientation icon (i.e., side-by-side), in-place methods (e.g., clip planes), and a new method called ExoVis. We specifically analyze performance differences (i.e., time and accuracy) for 3D orientation and relative position tasks. Empirical results show that 3D displays are effective for approximate navigation and relative positioning whereas 2D/3D combination displays (orientation icon and ExoVis) are useful for precise orientation and position tasks. Combination 2D/3D displays had as good or better performance as 2D displays. Clip planes were not effective for a 3D orientation task, but may be useful when only one slice is needed.	approximation algorithm;in-place algorithm	Melanie Tory;Torsten MÃ¶ller;M.

e9c00d73571f61afe2abeff375da6b4a054266e6	semanticpaint: interactive segmentation and learning of 3d worlds		We present a real-time, interactive system for the geometric reconstruction, object-class segmentation and learning of 3D scenes [Valentin et al. 2015]. Using our system, a user can walk into a room wearing a depth camera and a virtual reality headset, and both densely reconstruct the 3D scene [Newcombe et al. 2011; NieÃner et al. 2013; Prisacariu et al. 2014]) and interactively segment the environment into object classes such as 'chair', 'floor' and 'table'. The user interacts physically with the real-world scene, touching objects and using voice commands to assign them appropriate labels. These user-generated labels are leveraged by an online random forest-based machine learning algorithm, which is used to predict labels for previously unseen parts of the scene. The predicted labels, together with those provided directly by the user, are incorporated into a dense 3D conditional random field model, over which we perform mean-field inference to filter out label inconsistencies.

Specifically, we resolve the location of finger taps on the arm and hand using a novel sensor array, worn as an armband. This approach provides an on-body finger input system that is always available, naturally portable, and minimally invasive. When coupled with a pico-projector, a fully interactive graphical interface can be rendered directly on the body.

As a concept of a future audio player, we propose a framework of """"music staging artificial intelligence (AI)"""". In that framework, audio object signals, e.g. vocal, guitar, bass, drums and keyboards, are assumed to be extracted from stereo music signals. To visualize music as if live performance is virtually conducted, playing motion sequence is estimated by using separated signals. After adjusting the spatial arrangement of audio objects so as to each user prefers it, audio/visual rendering is conducted. We constructed two types of demonstration systems for music staging AI. In the smartphone-based implementation, each user enables to change the spatial arrangement through sliderbar dragging. Since information of user preferable spatial arrangement can be sent from each smartphone to server, it would enable to predict/recommend the user preferable spatial arrangement. In another implementation, head mount display (HMD) was utilized to dive into virtual music live performance. Each user enables to walk/teleport anywhere and audio is then changing corresponding to the user view."""	anytime algorithm;artificial intelligence;beneath a steel sky;computer keyboard;disk staging;download;drag and drop;head-mounted display;quantum teleportation;server (computing);smartphone	Yusuke Hioka;Kento Ohtani;Kazuya Takeda	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.8005294	visualization;rendering (computer graphics);computer science;multiple signal classification;mount;guitar;download;stage (cooking);multimedia	AI	-43.88946895818767	-40.310247124956796	150347
caee160eb2d1f2779de20f31b9cdc57797e81f68	utilizing sequences of touch gestures for user verification on mobile devices		Smartphones have become ubiquitous in our daily lives; they are used for a wide range of tasks and store increasing amounts of personal data. To minimize risk and prevent misuse of this data by unauthorized users, access must be restricted to verified users. Current classification-based methods for gesture-based user verification only consider single gestures, and not sequences. In this paper, we present a method which utilizes information from sequences of touchscreen gestures, and the context in which the gestures were made using only basic touch features. To evaluate our approach, we built an application which records all the necessary data from the device (touch and contextual sensors which do not consume significant battery life). Using XGBoost on the collected data, we were able to classify between a legitimate user and the population of illegitimate users (imposters) with an average equal error rate (EER) of 4.78% and an average area under the curve (AUC) of 98.15%. Our method demonstrates that by considering only basic touch features and utilizing sequences of gestures, as opposed to individual gestures, the accuracy of the verification process improves significantly.

Even with the advent of digital photography, the photographic process still continues to focus on creating a single, final still image suitable for printing. This implicit association between a display pixel and a static RGB value can constrain a photographer's creative agency. We present dynamic image stacks, an interactive image viewer exploring what photography can become when this constraint is relaxed. Our system first captures a burst of images with varying capture parameters, then, in response to simple touch gestures on the image, our interactive viewer displays the best available image at the user's focus of attention. Exposure, focus, or white balance may be slightly compromised in the periphery, but the image parameters are optimal at the selected location. Dynamic image stacks turn photograph viewing into an interactive, exploratory experience that is engaging, evocative, and fun.	burst transmission;color balance;digital photography;ecosystem;image quality;image viewer;pixel;printing;programming paradigm	David E.

The system concept consists of a smartphone, a smartphone accessory, and a smartphone software application. The smartphone accessory concept is a multi-microphone audiovisual array in a form factor that allows attachment to the back of the smartphone. The accessory will also contain a lower power radio by which it can transmit audio signals to compatible hearing aids. The smartphone software application concept will use the smartphone's built in camera to acquire images and perform real-time face detection using the built-in face detection support of the smartphone. The audiovisual beamforming algorithm uses the location of talking targets to improve the signal to noise ratio and consequently improve the user's speech intelligibility. Since the proposed array system leverages a handheld consumer electronic device, it will be portable and low cost.

Traditional light sensing pens do not work effectively on a TFT screen, as the TFT screen does not generate a scan-line. A novel prototype computer system has been created that depicts where a user is pointing. The new sensor may replace the need for a touch-screen, mouse or keyboard. The system flashes a kaleidoscope of colours onto a TFT screen. A tri-colour photodiode detects these colours. A problem with this solution was the limited number of colours that could reliably be detected by the photodiodes and the time that the colours needed to remain on the screen. This paper describes a new system that includes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the future position of the colour sensor on a computer screen. This information was used to place the optimum colours closest to the sensor in order to increase the accuracy of the reported position.	artificial neural network;color;pointer (computer programming);sensor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	David A.

The reason can be considered that fingerprint can achieve the best balance among authentication performance, cost, size of device, and ease of use. However, most of fingerprint authentication devices have some problems to be solved. One is that captured images are easily affected by the condition of finger surface and it can degrade authentication performance. The other is that the problem of impersonation by artificial gummy fingers has been pointed out. To solve those problems, we developed a new fingerprint authentication device that has a novel sensing principle. This device forms a image of fingerprint pattern based on optical characteristics of a fingerâs interior by scattered transmission light. The images so obtained are unaffected by the condition of finger surface such as dry or moist fingers or operating environment, and enable stable authentication processes. And it can differentiate between real fingers and fake gummy fingers made from gelatin or other material using optical characteristics. Because this device utilizes the optical characteristics inside a finger, it has possibility to achieve higher authentication performance by combining multiple characteristics of a fingerâs interior as a modality. In this paper, we describe the sensing principle and process algorithm of this device.	algorithm;authentication;control system;fingerprint recognition;modal logic;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);operating environment;usability	Emiko Sano;Takuji Maeda;Takahiro Nakamura;Masahiro Shikai;Koji Sakata;Masahito Matsushita;Koichi Sasakawa	2006	2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)	10.1109/CVPRW.2006.83	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;light scattering;computer security;fingerprint recognition	Vision	-40.717992473325445	-41.6967431365199	151494

Preliminary results from seven participants indicate that depth cues included in the design of the POI reduces the underestimation of the distances of the POI. The interfaces that facilitate distance estimation are those that rely both on the use of height in the visual field and relative size but not on occlusion.	augmented reality;depth perception;hidden surface determination;linear algebra	Thomas Dazeniere;J.

1f71d562ff3641e1e8b3e210caf38e9e6ad60bfa	usability analysis in gesture operation of interactive e-books on mobile devices		This paper analyses usability of interface including gesture operation and interaction in HCI (human-computer interaction). We explore the common gestures which are used to read e-books, and summarize the mode of operation of these gestures. This analysis bases on the five indicators that are proposed by Nielsen in 1993 to assess user interface of the interaction e-book. It discusses the interface of e-books that experts read and places emphasis on key points for visibility, button design and operation mode of multimedia button. Heuristic evaluation was adopted to study the gestures operation in reading e-book modes based on mobile devices. The study concludes that operation mode, perception & feedback design, and user's behavior are important interactions mode for interface design on mobile devices. The paper offers interaction design principles for development and improvement of the interactive e-book.

Instead of moving the barrier itself to compensate for a misplacement of the viewing zones in relation to the user, we employ dynamic pixel column shifts to provide a similar compensation in software. This requires a parallax barrier where each section covers two pixel columns at a time instead of one. The proposed method has been implemented using OpenGL shaders and a parallax barrier that was designed for a display of exactly half the resolution of the employed display. Technical tests showed a good separation of the left and right images for viewing angles of up to Â± 30Â°. Preliminary user tests indicate that an improvement in the stereoscopic experience can be achieved.	autostereoscopy;column (database);graphics;mobile device;mobile phone;opengl;parallax barrier;pixel;rollover (key);shader;stereoscopy	Martin Paprocki;Kim Krog;Morten Bak Kristoffersen;Martin Kraus	2012		10.1145/2254556.2254612	autostereoscopy;parallax mapping;parallax barrier;computer vision;simulation;parallax occlusion mapping;computer science;operating system;mobile device;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-43.927195317223415	-46.83075417709811	151986

Behind the scenes, however, there is a complex and error-prone choreography of multiple people controlling separate motion axes and camera attributes. This strict separation of tasks has mostly historical reasons, which we believe could be overcome with today's technology. We revisit interface design for camera motion starting with ethnographic observations and interviews with nine camera operators. We identified seven influencing factors for camera work and found that automation needs to be combined with human interaction: Operators want to be able to spontaneously take over in unforeseen situations. We characterize a class of user interfaces supporting (semi-)automated camera motion that take both human and machine capabilities into account by offering seamless transitions between automation and control.	cognitive dimensions of notations;integral theory (ken wilber);seamless3d;user interface;viewport	Axel Hoesl;Julie Wagner;Andreas Butz	2015		10.1145/2702613.2732904	motion control;smart camera;computer vision;match moving;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;multimedia;cinematography;user interface	HCI	-44.308290569801514	-38.733313679397156	152041

01620532cca7bbd005f8d26ebb3d01a505fd8dd9	error augmented robotic rehabilitation of the upper limb - a review		Objective: To collect and assess the available evidence for the efficacy of error augmentation in upper limb robotic rehabilitation. Methods: A systematic literature search up to May 2013 was conducted in one citation index, the Web of Knowledge, and in two individual databases: PubMed and Scopus, for publications that utilized error augmented feedback as practice modality in robotic rehabilitation of the upper limb. Results: The systematic search returned 12 studies that utilized error augmented feedback in trials to unimpaired and impaired individuals suffering from stroke, multiple sclerosis and primary dystonia. One additional study utilizing viscous force fields was included as the authors paid special merit to the effects of the field in directions where the error was amplified. In the studies that met the inclusion criteria two different types of error augmented feedback was used that is, haptic and visual feedback which were used either separately as rehabilitation modalities or in conjunction with each other. All studies but one report positive outcome regardless of the type(s) of feedback utilized. Conclusions: Error augmentation in upper limb robotic rehabilitation is a relatively new area of study, counting almost nine years after the first relevant publication and rather understudied. Error augmentation in upper limb robotic rehabilitation should be further researched in more practice-intensive studies and with larger trial groups. The potential of error augmented upper limb rehabilitation should also be explored with conditions other than the ones described in this review.	database;feedback;force field (chemistry);haptic technology;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);pubmed;rehabilitation robotics;scopus;web of science;world wide web	Aris C.

But the small screen size of these devices requires adapting web page contents to be browsed more conveniently. A fundamental step in a successful automatic adaptation process of a web page is perception its visual layout and mining its Document Object Model (DOM) structure. In this paper, we present a new web-adapted supervised segmentation algorithm dedicated to vibro-tactile access on touch-screen devices. This suggested algorithm is fundamental in our framework whose aim is enhancing the ability of Visually Impaired Persons (VIP) to understand the 2-dimension web page layout by converting web pages into vibrating pages using a graphical vibro-tactile language. A comparison between automatic and manual segmented pages is presented. The objectives of this comparison are, on the one hand, to know how users understand web page layout structure based on their visual perception, and on the other hand, to explore the main differences between automatic and manual segmentation.

The taste of food arises from a combination of chemical, auditory, olfactory and haptic sensation. Haptic sensation while eating has been an ongoing problem in taste display. The food simulator generates a force on the user's teeth as an indication of food texture. The device is composed of four linkages. The mechanical configuration of the device is designed such that it will fit into the mouth, with a force sensor attached to the end effector. The food simulator generates a force representing the force profile captured from the mouth of a person biting real food. The device has been integrated with auditory and chemical display for multi-modal sensations in a taste the food simulator has been tested on a large number of participants. The results indicate that the device has succeeded in presenting food texture as well as chemical taste.	haptic technology;modal logic;robot end effector;simulation	Hiroo Iwata;Hiroaki Yano;Takahiro Uemura;Tetsuro Moriya	2004	IEEE Virtual Reality 2004	10.1109/VR.2004.40	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;gesture recognition;virtual reality;haptic technology	HCI	-41.29568301064585	-42.2196529374853	152891

We use colla borative feedback mined from the interactions of earlier use rs of a video search system to help users in their current search tasks. Our objective is to improve the quality of the results that users find, and in doing so also assist users to explore a larg e nd complex information space. It is hoped that this will lead to them considering search options that they may not have c onsidered otherwise. We performed a user centred evaluation. The results of our evaluation indicate that we achieved our goals, the performance of the users in finding relevant video clips was enhanced with our system; users were able to explor e the collection of video clips more and users demonstrat ed a preference for our system that provided recommendat ions.	baseline (configuration management);bridging (networking);feedback;interaction;mined;overhead (computing);recommender system;video clip	Frank Hopfgartner;David Vallet;Martin Halvey;Joemon M.

b4ffe1ade4c50d27d2d4cd4c90fcb1d9108f1ed6	engagement-based user attention distribution on web article pages	ads positioning;user attention	The main monetization vehicle of many Web media sites are display ads located on article pages. Those ads are typically displayed either as banners on top of the page, or on the page's side bar. Advertiser ROI depends on the quality of ad targeting, as well as on how noticeable those ads are to users reading the article. Focusing on the latter issue, previous work has studied which ad positions are, on aggregate, more noticed by users.  This work takes the first step toward the personalized positioning of ads on article pages. We demonstrate a correlation between the level of attention that users devote to a story, and the position of the most noticeable graphic element on the side bar. In particular, we find that the graphic element most noticed by a user is roughly to the side of the point in the article where the user's attention waned. We argue that this finding lays the foundation for increasing display advertising effectiveness by tailoring ad positions on each article page impression to the user viewing it.	aggregate data;display advertising;monetization;page view;personalization;region of interest;widget (gui)	Oleg Rokhlenko;Nadav Golbandi;Ronny Lempel;Limor Leibovich	2013		10.1145/2481492.2481516	computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-35.72241866750059	-49.43263081472714	153345

Unfortunately, there are evidently still problems for some deaf and hard of hearing people trying to use certain web pages. These people require the translation of existing written information into their first language, which can be one of many sign languages. In previous technological solutions, the video window dominates the screen, interfering with the presentation and thereby distracting the general public, who have no need of a bilingual web site. One solution to this problem is the development of transparent sign language videos which appear on the screen on request. Therefore, we have designed and developed a system to enable the embedding of selective interactive elements into the original text in appropriate locations, which act as triggers for the video translation into sign language. When the short video clip terminates, the video window is automatically closed and the original web page is shown. In this way, the system significantly simplifies the expansion and availability of additional accessibility functions to web developers, as it preserves the original web page with the addition of a web layer of sign language video. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation has demonstrated that information presented through a transparent sign language video increases the usersâ interest in the content of the material by interpreting terms, phrases or sentences, and therefore facilitates the understanding of the material and increases its usefulness for deaf people.	database trigger;e-material;goto;javascript;maxima and minima;multimodal interaction;petra mutzel;prototype;quality of service;requirement;scalable link interface;video clip;web content accessibility guidelines;web accessibility;web developer;web page;world wide web	Matjaz Debevc;Primoz Kosec;Andreas Holzinger	2010	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-010-0529-8	web service;web development;framing;video;html;usability;web design;sign language;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;accessibility;web navigation;web accessibility;web page;multimedia;programming language;web 2.0;world wide web	Web+IR	-35.177744993716516	-47.63558428786286	153386

We address these challenges by providing an interface with a focus plus context (F+C) view of the robot location, and where the user can navigate simply by looking where they want to go, and clicking or drawing a path on the view to indicate the desired trajectory or destination. The F+C view provides an undistorted, perspectively correct central region surrounded by a wide field of view peripheral portion, and avoids the need for separate views. The navigation method is direct and intuitive in comparison to keyboard or joystick based navigation, which require the user to be in a control loop as the robot moves. Both the F+C views and the direct click navigation were evaluated in a preliminary user study.	colour banding;computer keyboard;control system;fisheye;futures studies;item unique identification;joystick;mobile robot;motion planning;netware file system;obstacle avoidance;peripheral vision;robot;spatialâtemporal reasoning;uniform resource identifier;usability testing;user interface	Jim Vaughan;Sven G.

Subjects performed a pointing task. For this task, we used two kind of input devices : a 3D mouse and an isotonic device. The target was a cube presented in a 3D room. The 3D context is configured by three factors which are texture, shadow or no shadow to the pointer and shadow or no shadow to the target. The results have shown the superiority of using isotonic input device and the usefulness of the shadow for a guidance in a 3D computer environment.

Keypad and touch-screen interaction have traditionally been used to interact with maps on mobile phones, but both these interaction techniques have several shortcomings. Tilt interaction offers an alternative approach with several advantages. Tilt interaction is intuitive and can be performed one-handed. Previous research has shown that tilt interaction offers equivalent or inferior results in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and preference. Similar studies have offered limited insight into the comparative performance of tilt and keypad interaction. This paper discusses the development and comparative evaluation of a prototype mobile map-based application supporting both keypad and tilt interaction. The results of this evaluation showed that keypad interaction was more efficient for tasks requiring precise selection, but that tilt interaction offered greater perceived controllability, efficiency and ease of use for navigation tasks.	interaction technique;mobile phone;prototype;smartphone;touchscreen;usability	Bradley van Tonder;Janet Wesson	2010		10.1145/1899503.1899539	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;engineering	HCI	-46.666626846674	-44.02285518614836	154285

However, low cost BCI and EMG have not matured yet. Moreover, these technologies present relative low signal-to-noise ratio and classification accuracy. In case of employing BCI or EMG to manually control a mobile robot, a shared control must be inserted in the loop control to compensate misinterpreted commands. This paper presents a novel shared control approach based on vector fields for the manual navigation of assistive mobile robots. Unlike other approaches which take full control of the robot in certain situations, this technique allows full control to the user. Also, this approach reduces interventions to correct the navigation route caused by wrong classification of commands issued by the user. Results show that it is a simple, fast and effective technique.	algorithm;autonomous robot;brainâcomputer interface;computer;control theory;course (navigation);electromyography;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;signal-to-noise ratio	Leonardo Olivi;Ricardo Silva Souza;Eric Rohmer;Eleri Cardozo	2013	2013 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2013.6677482	humanârobot interaction;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;motion planning;robot control;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	-40.378488932421355	-44.9437310731835	154305

The motion context can be gross or fine and the interaction context can be free or guided. We describe basic principles relevant to modeling safe and intuitive behavior for robots.

To test the ideas in practice, a prototype calendar application was implemented. We arranged a one week field trial to validate the design ideas.

The first task was to identify the differences between printed pictures and 3D virtual models. The second task was to point out ergonomic or design problems in a single piece of furniture or pairs of chairs and tables. Based on the analysis, discomfort caused by model rotation did contribute to the degree of overall discomfort. Even all participants had the background of using 3D modeling systems, some still experienced different levels of symptoms. Their comments indicated that adaptive adjustments of disparity and control response ratio were necessary in the highly interactive situations.	interactivity;stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy	Li-Chieh Chen;Yun-Maw Cheng;Po-Ying Chu;Frode Eika Sandnes	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20684-4_3	humanâcomputer interaction;engineering;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-44.36431861924921	-47.787983526529224	154798

While haptics is finding inroads in specialized areas such as surgery, gaming, and robotics, there has been little work to bring haptics to the computer desktop, which is largely dominated today by the GUI/mouse relationship. The mouse as an input device, however, poses many challenges for users with physical disabilities, and it is believed that a haptically enhanced interface could have significant impact assisting in target selection. This paper presents a study intended to evaluate haptic effects used with a force feedback mouse on a computer desktop and a prediction algorithm designed to focus those effects on the desired target.

The aim of this work is to demonstrate a multimodal system which gives users the ability to interact with desktop applications using face, objects, voice and gestures. These human behaviors constitute the input qualifiers to the system. Microsoft Kinect multi-sensor was utilized as input device in order to succeed the natural user interaction, mainly due to the multimodal capabilities offered by this device. We demonstrate scenarios which contain all the functions and capabilities of our system from the perspective of natural user interaction.	algorithm;database;desktop computer;emoticon;face detection;human computer;humanâcomputer interaction;input device;kinect;login;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);multimodal interaction;natural user interface;object detection;operating system;robotic mapping;robotics;sensor	Nikolas Vidakis;Anastasios Vlasopoulos;Tsampikos Kounalakis;Petros Varchalamas;Michalis Dimitriou;Grigorios Kalliatakis;Efthimios Syntychakis;John Christofakis;George A.

16ff942c6bc6d16cc7b2eea768e55462c3f88d65	virtual locomotion: walking in place through virtual environments	virtual environment	This paper presents both an analysis of requirements for user control over simulated locomotion and a new control technique designed to meet these requirements. The goal is to allow the user to move through virtual environments in as similar a manner as possible to walking through the real world. We approach this problem by examining the interrelationships between motion control and the other actions people use to act, sense, and react to their environment. If the interactions between control actions and sensory feedback can be made comparable to those of actions in the real world, then there is hope for constructing an effective new technique. Candidate solutions are reviewed once the analysis is developed. This analysis leads to a promising new design for a sensor-based virtual locomotion called Gaiter. The new control allows users to direct their movement through virtual environments by stepping in place. The movement of a person's legs is sensed, and in-place walking is treated as a gesture indicating the user intends to take a virtual step. More specifically, the movement of the user's legs determines the direction, extent, and timing of their movement through virtual environments. Tying virtual locomotion to leg motion allows a person to step in any direction and control the stride length and cadence of his virtual steps. The user can walk straight, turn in place, and turn while advancing. Motion is expressed in a body-centric coordinate system similar to that of actual stepping. The system can discriminate between gestural and actual steps, so both types of steps can be intermixed.	control theory;feedback;gesture recognition;in-place algorithm;interaction;pointing device gesture;requirement;sensor;simulation;stepping level;user interface;virtual reality	James N.

1820f10245d1cf53f9ec02879fa2ada0e0f893b4	kinematic analysis of remote target pointing hand movements in a 3d environment		The study investigates kinematics of target pointing hand movements in a free-hand, touchless, 3D environment. Consistent with Fittsâ original information processing model, target pointing hand movement time in a 3D space increased with an increase of distance, and increased with a decrease of target size. The relative primary submovement movement time (% of total movement time) for target with depth (67.24%) was higher than that for targets without depth (64.49%). Pointing targets in the upper half of the reference framework required a lifting up of the arm to work against the gravity, and thus cost more than those in the lower half. For targets with depth, they required an even elevated upper-arm, thus result a longer âprimary submovement timeâ, a decreased âpeak velocityâ, and a decreased relative time to peak velocity.

The framework is thus a first step towards the design of an effective and efficient interface. This paper reports on an experimental study of two proposed frameworks: the ecological interface design framework and the function behaviour-state framework. In order to provide an unbiased comparative evaluation for both interfaces, the same application problem is used. The interfaces, based on each of the two frameworks, are implemented with as similar look-and-feel forms as possible in the presentation of information contents. Only the normal control operation and fault detection situations are considered at this stage of the study. In addition, in this study three categories of measures are used, namely: the performance measure; the physiological measure (the eye movement measure: the eye fixation and the pupil diameter change, in particular); and the subjective (or the user-rated) measure. The major results obtained from the study includes the following: (1) the information called the abstract function in the ecological interface design framework may not positively correlate to the performance improvement yet may increase the mental workload, (2) the function-behaviour-state framework seems more agreeable with the operator's mental model, and (3) operators may perform equally well with a function-behaviour-state interface but with a reduced mental workload. It is also found that the eye fixation measure is highly consistent with the performance measure and the subjective measure. The pupil diameter measure is found not to be significantly sensitive to the mental workload information; however, it appears sensitive to the mental workload information among individual participants and shows a consistent result with the other measures used.	fault detection and isolation;user interface	Yaping Lin;W.

058d94646429f384b12dfbeda5a7797a77a514fe	gaze typing through foot-operated wearable device	foot operated devices;gaze typing;wearable devices	Gaze Typing, a gaze-assisted text entry method, allows individuals with motor (arm, spine) impairments to enter text on a computer using a virtual keyboard and their gaze. Though gaze typing is widely accepted, this method is limited by its lower typing speed, higher error rate, and the resulting visual fatigue, since dwell-based key selection is used. In this research, we present a gaze-assisted, wearable-supplemented, foot interaction framework for dwell-free gaze typing. The framework consists of a custom-built virtual keyboard, an eye tracker, and a wearable device attached to the user's foot. To enter a character, the user looks at the character and selects it by pressing the pressure pad, attached to the wearable device, with the foot. Results from a preliminary user study involving two participants with motor impairments show that the participants achieved a mean gaze typing speed of 6.23 Words Per Minute (WPM). In addition, the mean value of Key Strokes Per Character (KPSC) was 1.07 (ideal 1.0), and the mean value of Rate of Backspace Activation (RBA) was 0.07 (ideal 0.0). Furthermore, we present our findings from multiple usability studies and design iterations, through which we created appropriate affordances and experience design of our gaze typing system.	entry sequenced data set;experience design;eye tracking;iteration;typing;usability testing;virtual keyboard;wearable computer;wearable technology;words per minute	Vijay Rajanna	2016		10.1145/2982142.2982145	computer vision;simulation;computer science;wearable technology	HCI	-46.89878779204973	-45.29947844389519	155350

8efd21104900e9114244270ee91254f33a50a53c	assessment of a user centered interface for teleoperation and 3d environments	human computer interaction;virtual reality;teleoperation	The efficient, natural and precise selection and manipulation of nearby objects in 3D environments is yet a challenge in the area of 3D interaction. Robot teleoperation is a potential application field for this kind of interaction and a difficult task. In part due to the low quality of the information delivered to the operator, but also because of the non-natural interfaces used to operate the robot. This paper presents a direct 3D user interface based on visual and haptic feedback that can be correctly operated by untrained users. The interface offers a higher level of presence than the average existing solutions, and involves the use of the operator's primary hand to control a robotic arm using a Phantom device. Spatial awareness, in turn, is obtained from stereoscopic vision and motion parallax effect. The main contribution though is an assessment study to investigate which interface elements maximize user performance and if any interface elements is counter-effective. Surprising results show that parallax is the most effective feature while stereoscopy is often detrimental and force feedback requires training.	3d interaction;3d user interaction;haptic technology;parallax;robot;robotic arm;stereopsis;stereoscopy;user interface;user-centered design	Juliano Franz;Anderson Maciel;Luciana Porcher Nedel	2013		10.1145/2480362.2480546	computer vision;teleoperation;simulation;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;natural user interface;user interface	HCI	-44.86333021227978	-47.43896007280635	155880

Based on the parameters of the patient body and surgical procedure, an optimized set of port locations is provided to the surgeon as colored icons projected onto the abdomen. The surgeon can adjust the suggested locations by direct manipulation with the gloved hand and fingers in real-time. This interactive decision-aid is expected to shorten the planning phase, and enhance performance of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery.	algorithm;augmented reality;computer;direct manipulation interface;humanâcomputer interaction;interaction technique;leonardo (robot);mathematical optimization;prototype;real-time computing;real-time locating system;robot;tracking system;video projector	Manuel SimÃµes;Caroline G.

However, often users report discomfort even after brief exposures to stereo content. One of the main reasons is the conflict between vergence and accommodation that is caused by 3D displays. We investigate dynamic adjustment of stereo parameters in a scene using gaze data in order to reduce discomfort. In a user study, we measured stereo fusion times after abrupt manipulation of disparities using gaze data. We found that gaze-controlled manipulation of disparities can lower fusion times for large disparities. In addition we found that gaze-controlled disparity adjustment should be applied in a personalized manner and ideally performed only at the extremities or outside the comfort zone of subjects. These results provide important insight on the problems associated with fast disparity manipulation and are essential for developing appealing gaze-contingent and gaze-controlled applications.	binocular disparity;contingency (philosophy);emergence;personalization;stereoscopy;usability testing;vergence	Matthias Bernhard;Camillo Dell'mour;Michael Hecher;Efstathios Stavrakis;Michael Wimmer	2014		10.1145/2578153.2578169	computer vision;simulation;geography;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.48592059761017	-48.91832208565744	156776

The high price of existing devices is a barrier to their diffusion. The paper reports on the first design produced in the Cheap Arm Project (CHAP). It costs less than Â£2000, uses easily available parts and can be assembled by anybody with basic technical skills. The manipulator can reach objects from floor-level up to shelves at a height of 170 cm using a new low-cost arm design. Teleoperation is be done using a tablet, smartphone or browser. The cost could be further reduced by using different servo motors. The design and assembly instructions are made available on the open-source repository GitHub, with the hope that the community will build and improve the design.

Moreover, the process of fixing errors and its effects on text entry performance has not been studied. Here, we first analyze real-life text entry error correction behaviors. We then use our findings to develop a new model to predict the cost of error correction for character-based text entry technologies. We validate our model against quantities derived from the literature, as well as with a user study. Our study shows that the predicted and observed cost of error correction correspond well. At the end, we discuss potential applications of our new model.	error detection and correction;human factors and ergonomics;human reliability;real life;text-based (computing);usability testing	Ahmed Sabbir Arif;Wolfgang Stuerzlinger	2010		10.1145/1753326.1753329	cognitive model;human performance technology;simulation;error detection and correction;speech recognition;prediction;word error rate;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;data mining;world wide web;data collection	HCI	-47.488303070514625	-45.90929750496779	156903
f79580c213b2d4c2c3c4d9eea3f89c42a74ab190	handsfree omnidirectional vr navigation using head tilt		Navigating mobile virtual reality (VR) is a challenge due to limited input options and/or a requirement for handsfree interaction. Walking-in-place (WIP) is considered to offer a higher presence than controller input but only allows unidirectional navigation in the direction of the user's gaze--which impedes navigation efficiency. Leaning input enables omnidirectional navigation but currently relies on bulky controllers, which aren't feasible in mobile VR contexts. This note evaluates the use of head-tilt - implemented using inertial sensing - to allow for handsfree omnidirectional VR navigation on mobile VR platforms. A user study with 24 subjects compared three input methods using an obstacle avoidance navigation task: (1) head-tilt alone (TILT) (2) a hybrid method (WIP-TILT) that uses head tilting for direction and WIP to control speed; and (3) traditional controller input. TILT was significantly faster than WIP-TILT and joystick input, while WIP-TILT and TILT offered the highest presence. There was no difference in cybersickness between input methods.	gps navigation device;in-place algorithm;input method;joystick;obstacle avoidance;usability testing;virtual reality sickness	Sam Tregillus;Majed Al Zayer;Eelke Folmer	2017		10.1145/3025453.3025521	handsfree;simulator sickness;control theory;joystick;simulation;omnidirectional antenna;inertial frame of reference;computer science;obstacle avoidance;computer vision;virtual reality;artificial intelligence	HCI	-45.27254533425034	-46.48518440271386	157069

SAK, for """"scanning ambiguous keyboard"""", combines one-key physical input (including error correction) with three virtual letter keys and a SPACE key. The virtual letter keys are highlighted in sequence (""""scanned"""") and selected when the key bearing the desired letter receives focus. There is only one selection per letter. Selecting SPACE transfers scanning to a word-selection region, which presents a list of candidate words. A novel feature of SAK is multiple-letter-selection in a single scanning interval.

It extends the traditional desktop interface with interaction technology and visualization techniques that enable seamless transitions between 2D and 3D manipulations. SpaceTop allows users to type, click, draw in 2D, and directly manipulate interface elements that float in the 3D space above the keyboard. It makes it possible to easily switch from one modality to another, or to simultaneously use two modalities with different hands. We introduce hardware and software configurations for co-locating these various interaction modalities in a unified workspace using depth cameras and a transparent display. We describe new interaction and visualization techniques that allow users to interact with 2D elements floating in 3D space. We present the results from a preliminary user study that indicates the benefit of such hybrid workspaces.	desktop computer;interaction;modality (humanâcomputer interaction);oled;seamless3d;usability testing;workspace	Jinha Lee;Alex Olwal;Hiroshi Ishii;Cati N.

We believe that the illusion in the contact area can be caused by the sense of ownership derived from the close relationship of the motion between the fingers and the avatarâs legs. The objective of this study was to prove the possibility that fingers can be substituted in the place of legs in locomotion interfaces in terms of tactile sensation.

0333ad2a4cac3d343259c3d47f1097fffbc7d1a4	synchrowatch: one-handed synchronous smartwatch gestures using correlation and magnetic sensing		SynchroWatch is a one-handed interaction technique for smartwatches that uses rhythmic correlation between a user's thumb movement and on-screen blinking controls. Our technique uses magnetic sensing to track the synchronous extension and reposition of the thumb, augmented with a passive magnetic ring. The system measures the relative changes in the magnetic field induced by the required thumb movement and uses a time-shifted correlation approach with a reference waveform for detection of synchrony. We evaluated the technique during three distraction tasks with varying degrees of hand and finger movement: active walking, browsing on a computer, and relaxing while watching online videos. Our initial offline results suggest that intentional synchronous gestures can be distinguished from other movement. A second evaluation using a live implementation of the system running on a smartwatch suggests that this technique is viable for gestures used to respond to notifications or issue commands. Finally, we present three demonstration applications that highlight the technique running in real-time on the smartwatch.	computer;interaction technique;online and offline;real-time clock;smartwatch;synchronization (computer science);video clip;waveform	Gabriel Reyes;Jason Wu;Nikita Juneja;Maxim Goldshtein;W.

It addresses the acute problem of detecting design errors in human-machine interaction and focuses on verifying the correctness of the interaction in complex and automated control systems. The paper describes a systematic methodology for evaluating whether the interface provides the necessary information about the machine to enable the operator to perform a specified task successfully and unambiguously. It also addresses the adequacy of information provided to the user via training material (e.g., user manual) about the machine's behavior. The essentials of the methodology, which can be automated and applied to the verification of large systems, are illustrated by several examples and through a case study of pilot interaction with an autopilot aboard a modern commercial aircraft. The expected application of this methodology is an augmentation and enhancement, by formal verification, of human-automation interfaces.	addresses (publication format);automatic control;automation;autopilot;control system;correctness (computer science);formal verification;humanâcomputer interaction;laboratory sample manual;sensor;verification and validation;verification of theories;verifying specimen	Asaf Degani;Michael Heymann	2002	Human factors	10.1518/0018720024494838	human performance technology;machine;simulation;formal verification;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operator;automatic control;methodology;flight;user interface;aviation	SE	-38.86380029915335	-48.10645144681155	157442
77051db62164edc2e51d0a0a9976970daa292e47	virtual, augmented and mixed reality. designing and developing virtual and augmented environments		3D Virtual Environments (3DVE) are more and more used in different applications such as CAD, games, or teleoperation. Due to the improvement of smartphones hardware performance, 3D applications were also introduced to mobile devices. In addition, smartphones provide new computing capabilities far beyond the traditional voice communication. They are permitted by the variety of built-in sensors and the internet connectivity. In consequence, interesting 3D applications can be designed by enabling the device capabilities to interact in a 3DVE. Due to the fact that smartphones have small and flat screens and that a 3DVE is wide and dense, mobile devices present some constraints: the environment density, the depth of targets and the occlusion. The pointing task faces these three problems to select a target. We propose a new classification of the existing interaction techniques, according to three axis of classification: a) the three discussed problems (density, depth and occlusion); b) the first two subtasks of the pointing task (navigation, selection); and c) the number of targets selected by the pointing technique (1 or N). In this paper we will begin by presenting a state of the art of the different pointing techniques in existing 3DVE, structured around three selection techniques: a) Ray casting, b) Curve and c) Point cursor. Then we will present our classification, and we will illustrate the classification of the main pointing techniques for 3DVE. From this classification, we will discuss the type of interaction that seems the most appropriate to perform this subtask optimally.	apache axis;augmented reality;computer-aided design;cursor (databases);emoticon;interaction technique;internet access;mixed reality;mobile device;ray casting;sensor;smartphone;virtual reality	Esubalew Bekele;Joshua W.

The result is a fully self-contained system that we call GlaciAR (Glass-enabled Contextual Interactions for Augmented Reality). It operates by extracting contextual interactions from observing users performing actions. GlaciAR is able to i) automatically determine moments of relevance based on a head motion attention model, ii) automatically produce video guidance information, iii) trigger these guides based on an object detection method, iv) learn without supervision from observing multiple users and v) operate fully on-board a current eyewear computer (Google Glass). We describe the components of GlaciAR together with user evaluations on three tasks. We see this work as a first step toward scaling up the notoriously difficult authoring problem in guidance systems and an exploration of enhancing user natural abilities via minimally invasive visual cues.	augmented reality;emoticon;glass;guidance system;image scaling;interaction;mixed reality;multi-user;object detection;on-board data handling;relevance	Teesid Leelasawassuk;Dima Damen;Walterio W.

We propose an interactive system for designing 3D objects with the same geometric characteristics as a sphericon. For high system efficiency, we used a conical voxel representation for defining these objects. The system allows the user to concentrate on the design itself while the system ensuring that the geometrical constraints of a sphericon are satisfied. The user can also preview the rolling motion of the object. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we fabricated the designed models using a 3D printer, and confirmed that they rolled as smoothly as a standard sphericon.	3d printing;interactive design;interactivity;printer (computing);smoothing;toys;voxel	Masaki Hirose;Jun Mitani;Yoshihiro Kanamori;Yukio Fukui	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22571-0_4	computer vision;simulation;computer science;geometric modeling;operating system;user interface;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-42.407332547151995	-39.61149282280115	157981

Unlike previous works that mostly use audio-visual cues derived from the video, we propose an approach that additionally leverages contextual cues derived from the environment that the game is being played in. The contextual cues provide information about the excitement levels in the game, which can be ranked and selected to automatically produce high-quality basketball highlights. We introduce a new dataset of 25 NCAA games along with their play-by-play stats and the ground-truth excitement data for each basket. We explore the informativeness of five different cues derived from the video and from the environment through user studies. Our experiments show that for our study participants, the highlights produced by our system are comparable to the ones produced by ESPN for the same games.	experiment;ground truth;inter-rater reliability;usability testing	Vinay Bettadapura;Caroline Pantofaru;Irfan A.

Users specify which area of the room is to be well-lit and which is to be dark by painting a target illumination distribution on a tablet device displaying the image obtained by a camera mounted in the room. The painting result is overlaid on the camera image as contour lines of the target illumination intensity. The system then runs an optimization to calculate light parameters to deliver the requested illumination condition. We implemented a GPU-based parallel search to achieve real-time processing. In our system, we used actuated lights that can change the lighting direction to generate the requested illumination condition more faithfully than static lights. We built a miniature-scale experimental environment and ran a user study to compare our method with a standard direct manipulation method using sliders. The results showed that the users preferred our method for informal light control.	contour line;direct manipulation interface;graphics processing unit;mathematical optimization;natural language;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot;tablet computer;usability testing	Seung-tak Noh;Sunao Hashimoto;Daiki Yamanaka;Yoichi Kamiyama;Masahiko Inami;Takeo Igarashi	2013	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-013-0872-7	computer vision;computer science;image-based lighting;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-43.00357092094085	-40.07334648216914	158258

Even when a mobile device does not have the projecting functionality, it is possible to attach a pico-projector to it. By having this technology available for everybody with a smartphone, new forms of interaction will emerge.

In this system, by using augmented reality, it is possible to display as if the helper's hand model actually exist in front of the worker. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted comparative experiments on remote work support by instruction annotations using conventional method of drawn lines, and the proposed method of by using hand gesture instructions. As a result, no significant difference was found between two methods in terms of ease of understanding in the instructions. However, regarding working time, the hand gesture instructions were shorter by 20 seconds (shortened by 19%) on average than the other.	augmented reality;experiment;telecommuting	Shohei Yamada;Naiwala P.

We built two different (full and fisheye) zooming capabilities into our system, and empirically compared their success with each other as well as with the traditional non-visual presentation method through an experiment. We hypothesize that the visual systems will lead to higher success than the text-based system, and that the fisheye zooming system will lead to higher success than the full zoom system. The results of our exploratory test provide partial support for our hypotheses. This empirical support and the comments made by the participants in the experiments suggest that our design ideas are promising, and it is worthwhile to further investigate the use of clustering and visualization mechanisms for reducing information overload.	cluster analysis;experiment;exploratory testing;fisheye;information overload;preprocessor;text-based (computing);user interface design;web search engine;web search query;world wide web;zooming user interface	Ozgur Turetken;Ramesh Sharda	2001			visual analytics;information visualization;visual system;humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;information overload;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-34.85752516535563	-51.11060312051031	159321

One challenge of humanoid robots is its capability of communication with people via audio-visual speech. Certainly, the integration of audio module and visual module improve the robot performance. In this paper, we present a novel system combines these two modules in one environment to be utilized alone or in humanoid robots. The proposed system adapts the user facial movements that cannot be avoided in reality. The experimental results show how these two modules enhance each other and yield an effective speech recognizer.	robot;speech recognition	Alaa El.

As a consequence, small objects are difficult to point by gaze alone. We suggest using a combination of eye pointing and subtle head movements to achieve accurate hands-free pointing in a conventional desktop computing environment. For tracking the head movements, we exploited information of the eye position in the eye tracker's camera view. We conducted a series of three experiments to study the potential caveats and benefits of using head movements to adjust gaze cursor position. Results showed that head-assisted eye pointing significantly improves the pointing accuracy without a negative impact on the pointing time. In some cases participants were able to point almost 3 times closer to the target's center, compared to the eye pointing alone (7 vs. 19 pixels). We conclude that head assisted eye pointing is a comfortable and potentially very efficient alternative for other assisting methods in the eye pointing, such as zooming.	cursor (databases);desktop computer;experiment;eye tracking;pixel	Oleg Spakov;Poika Isokoski;PÃ¤ivi Majaranta	2014		10.1145/2578153.2578157	computer vision;simulation;eye tracking;eye tracking on the iss;optics	HCI	-45.438003030663346	-46.4162664483049	159367

The device is intended for wearable and standalone use: It can store data locally for long-term recordings or stream processed EOG signals to a remote device over Bluetooth. We describe how eye gestures can be efficiently recognised from EOG signals for HCI purposes. In an experiment conducted with 11 subjects playing a computer game we show that 8 eye gestures of varying complexity can be continuously recognised with equal performance to a state-of-the-art video-based system. Physical activity leads to artefacts in the EOG signal. We describe how these artefacts can be removed using an adaptive filtering scheme and characterise this approach on a 5-subject dataset. In addition to explicit eye movements for HCI, we discuss how the analysis of unconscious eye movements may eventually allow to deduce information on user activity and context not available with current sensing modalities.	adaptive filter;bluetooth;context awareness;electrooculography;eye tracking;goggles;humanâcomputer interaction;mobilehci;pc game;real-time clock;signal processing;wearable computer	Andreas Bulling;Daniel Roggen;Gerhard TrÃ¶ster	2008		10.1145/1409635.1409647	computer vision;wearable computer;humanâcomputer interaction;computer hardware;computer science;signal processing	HCI	-47.46297026504455	-41.719595883273215	159637

Finger-drawn gestures offer a viable alternative to desktop and keyboard shortcuts as shortcuts for common tasks such as launching of applications and navigation of large media collections. In order to be truly effective, the interface for definition, management and invocation of gestures should be highly intuitive, and optimized for the device. In particular, the process of invoking gestures should be seamless and natural. Further, the recognition of gestures needs to be robust for the specific user. In this paper, we describe GeCCo (Gesture Command and Control), a system for personalized finger gesture shortcuts for touch-enabled desktops and trackpad-enabled notebook PCs. One of the key issues addressed in the design of GeCCo is that of mode switching in the context of notebook PCs. We describe a user study to decide between different interactions for mode switching. The interactions are designed such that mode switch and gesture can be simultaneously indicated. Since new gestures may be defined by the user at any time, statistical pattern classification techniques which require large numbers of training samples for each gesture are not useful. Instead we use nearest-neighbor classification with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and a writer adaptation scheme for improving accuracy to desired levels. We conclude the paper with experimental results and some thoughts on next steps.	cursor (databases);desktop computer;dynamic time warping;genetic and evolutionary computation conference;gesture recognition;interaction;keyboard shortcut;mobile phone;personal computer;personalization;plover;point of sale;prototype;seamless3d;statistical classification;touchpad;touchscreen;usability testing	Sriganesh Madhvanath;Dinesh Mandalapu;Tarun Madan;Naznin Rao;Ramesh Kozhissery	2012	2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent Human Computer Interaction (IHCI)	10.1109/IHCI.2012.6481796	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;gesture recognition;multimedia;statistics	HCI	-44.9847179843944	-43.843883117468124	159680

Enhancements were added to the man-machine control interface to improve the efficiency and productivity of operations. Although this system was a prototype for laboratory research and development and was not intended for operation in a nuclear environment, the work demonstrated the feasibility of sophisticated walking robots in nuclear service. The Savannah River system has served as a valuable prototype forerunner to a production model telerobot that is now under development by Odetics Incorporated for the Electric Power Research Institute.	telerobotics	Joseph S.
