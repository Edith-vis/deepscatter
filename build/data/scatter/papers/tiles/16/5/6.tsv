To support cooperative work in medical care, computer technology should therefore either augment the capabilities of individual specialists and enhance their ability of interacting with each other and with computational resources. However, despite the efforts spent in the Artificial Intelligence research field in the past years for developing innovative tools, there are still very few cases of systems which are proficiently used on a routinary basis for providing health care related services. One way to overcome those limitations is to redesign the set of software tools in order that they be more appropriated for an interoperable environment, and perhaps the most promising approach nowadays is based on the so called distributed computing paradigm applied to Artificial Intelligence. In this paper we describe a methodology for implementing a network of cooperating software agents aimed at improving the health care delivery process. Moreover, we will also illustrate some examples from a set of tools we are developing for evaluating that methodology.

e302c5faea4ea292a52e06231aa3edbe55b0dc1d	assessing user preferences in programming language design		The design of new programming languages has primarily been guided by the preferences of a few (the authors of the language), rather than systematic study of the various options available. This is in part due to the fact that user studies to effectively test usability or understandability hypotheses are cumbersome and expensive. An interesting question is whether crowdsourcing techniques can be leveraged to improve this situation.   We explore this idea using a specific example. While the streaming data paradigm is a popular one for expressing parallelism within applications, there has been little consensus on the methods used to express streaming topologies. Here, we explore the use of Mechanical Turk to recruit self-described programmers as a community to assess user preferences and code readability for two techniques currently in use for the expression of streaming application topology.   The positive results of this study point to the idea that crowdsourcing techniques can be an effective technique that can inexpensively assist language developers in making good design choices.	amazon mechanical turk;computer programming;crowdsourcing;parallel computing;programmer;programming language;programming paradigm;stream (computing);the turk;usability testing;user (computing)	Roger D.

In this paper, we present a methodological approach to assist this decision making process, which is based on a clear separation of the important attributes that characterise the adaptation strategy, namely the adaptation determinants, constituents, goals and rules. Based on this separation, we also present a methodological approach for the formulation of adaptation rules, which utili ses techniques from the domain of multiple criteria decision making. It is argued that, following the proposed approach, the adaptation strategy can be easily customised to the requirements of different application domains and user groups, and can be re-used with minor modifications in different applications. As a result, developers of intelli gent user interfaces can be significantly assisted, and users can be empowered to exploit the benefits of intelli gent interfaces. Keywords run-time adaptation, adaptation strategy, decision making INTRODUCTION Intelli gent user interfaces are expected to play a catalytic role towards the provision of accessible and high-quality interfaces for a wide range of users. Although several approaches have been reported in the related literature, e.g. [1], [2], currently there is no consensus about the characteristics, behaviour and essential components of intelli gent user interfaces [3], [4]. In this paper we take the view proposed in [5], that the user interface has to make several communication decisions about the concepts it communicates. A user interface, in this context, is called intelli gent in the measure to which it adapts itself, and makes these communication decisions dynamically, at runtime, conditioned on an analysis of information regarding the current context of the interaction, which is defined by the state of several fundamental aspects, such as the user profile, the task being performed, the application nature, etc. Thus, run-time adaptation, henceforth called adaptivity, is considered as a major aspect of intelligent user interfaces. Adaptivity can be addressed from different perspectives [6], [7], [8]. At the highest level, two independent phases can be identified (Figure 1): • deciding on the need for adaptations, based on some sort of assessment of user-computer interaction; • performing adaptations through a certain ‘adaptation strategy’. Decision for Adaptations Adaptation Strategy User Interface Application User Figure 1. Adaptation at the highest level In the context of this paper, we focus on the adaptation strategy as a decision making process, which can be characterised by the following attributes: • what to adapt: the aspects of the user-computer interface that are subject to adaptations, henceforth called adaptation constituents; they may refer to either semantic (i.e. content of information), syntactic (i.e. sequencing of the interaction) or lexical aspects of interaction (i.e. interface objects, interaction techniques, media and modalities); • when to adapt: run-time adaptation implies some sort of monitoring of the user-computer interface, in order to assess the state of certain aspects of the interaction, called adaptation determinants (e.g. user’s sensory load, task’s requirements), on which the adaptation decisions are conditioned; • why to adapt: there may be several goals underlying the adaptation process (adaptation goals); certain goals may be conflicting with each other, thus trade-offs between them have to be decided by the designer; • how to adapt: adaptations are driven by a set of rules (adaptation rules), that essentially assign certain adaptation constituents to specific adaptation determinants, for given adaptation goals. In this paper, we provide a methodological approach to this decision making process, which is based on a clear separation of the previously identified attributes. Based on this framework, we also present a methodology for the formulation of adaptation rules, utili sing techniques from the domain of multiple criteria decision making. It is argued that, following this approach, the adaptation strategy can be easily customised to the requirements of different application domains and user groups, and can be reused with minor modifications to different applications. As a result, developers of intelli gent user interfaces can be significantly assisted, by the provision of a design space that allows the expression of userand application-related aspects, such as user needs, abiliti es, and preferences, nature of the application, context of use, etc. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Despite their significance to the adaptivity process, the attributes identified above are not suff iciently addressed in existing systems. The adaptation determinants, constituents and goals, can substantially differ in existing systems, while, on the other hand, they are usually only implicitly taken into account in the formulation of adaptation rules. Moreover, they are often hard-coded into the system. This approach is inflexible, as the attributes of the adaptation strategy cannot be easily modified, customised to the requirements of different application domains and user groups, and re-used to different applications [9]. The set of Adaptation Determinants adopted in existing systems usually includes the user’s characteristics (preferences, experience, etc), the tasks being performed (nature, urgency, etc), the information characteristics (nature, purpose, etc), and the state of discourse. These characteristics are captured in several models, such as task, user model, dialogue model, application model, etc. Additionally, depending on the requirements of the particular application, other adaptation determinants may be found, such as dialogue acts [10], expressiveness and effectiveness criteria [11], graphics design aspects, [12], etc. Even when researchers agree on the set of adaptation determinants, the characteristics of these determinants that are considered significant may differ substantially. For example, information content is characterised or classified as linguistic or non-linguistic, analogue or non-analogue, arbitrary or non-arbitrary, static or dynamic, etc [13], by the data types, properties of relational structure, arity, user information seeking goal, etc [14], by the intrinsic property, class property, set property, etc [9], etc. Also, the modelli ng of the knowledge regarding adaptation determinants may vary significantly; user models, for example, may be classified according to granularity, temporal extent and representation, etc [7]. The adaptation constituents, i.e. the aspects of the interaction that are adapted, also differ substantially in existing systems, and may address the semantic, syntactic or lexical level of interaction. In [7], a list of adaptation constituents that are usually employed in existing systems is provided. This set includes generic functions, e.g. error correction or active help, and interaction level functions, e.g. user presentation of input to the system, system presentation of information to the user, access to capabiliti es, task simpli fication. Other adaptation constituents can also be found in the related literature. For example, MMI adapts the layout of network diagrams [12], UIDE focuses on the provision of context-sensitive help [15], AIMI adapts the presentation of text, maps and tables [16], etc. The goals that the adaptivity process attempts to fulfil vary substantially in existing systems, according to the requirements of the application and the user groups. In [7], for example, a list of adaptation goals is provided, which includes easy, eff icient, and effective use, make complex systems usable, present what the user wants to see, speed up use, simpli fy use, etc. Additionally, several other goals might be found, such as minimisation of user errors, maximisation of user satisfaction, reduction of computational resources, etc [6]. In several application domains, there is a major goal that the system has to reach. For example, in the case of an air-traff ic control system, the overall goal is the error-free use; for a computer game, the overall goal might be the user’s satisfaction. In several other cases, however, more than one (sometimes conflicting) goals may be significant. Finally, the rules that guide the adaptations vary in existing systems, and address different levels (i.e. lexical, syntactic, semantic level) of user-computer interaction. Some indicative examples include: “ If information is urgent, then choose a medium with low default detectabilit y and a channel with no temporal variance” [9]; “ If the task subgoal requires spatial information prefer visual media resource” [10]; “ If what has to be displayed is a structural analysis of a complex abstract domain, then use network charts” [17]; “ If the number of secondary values is strictly positive, then the selected abstract interaction object is listbox” [18]. These rules are usually ‘hardcoded’ in the user interface, and cannot be easily modified, or reused across several applications. Also, these rules only implicitly take into account the adaptation goals. This approach does not allow the easy incorporation of design decisions, i.e. trade-offs between different interface goals-’qualiti es’ , in the design procedure. As it is evident from the above discussion, the critical attributes of the adaptivity process, namely determinants, constituents, goals and rules, differ substantially in existing systems. That is, existing systems adapt certain predetermined constituents, based on a set of certain predetermined determinants, through the use of specific rules, in order to meet pre-specified goals. This approach has several drawbacks.

The entities to be clustered can be described in different ways (e.g., by their structure, by their connectivity, or by their content), different similarity measures are possible, and alternative procedures can be used to form the clusters. The problem is how to evaluate the competing clustering techniques in order to select the best for program understanding purposes. In this paper, two methods for clustering evaluation are considered, the gold standard and the task oriented approach. The advantages and disadvantages of both of them are analyzed in detail. Definition of a gold standard (reference clustering) is difficult and prone to subjectivity. On the other side, an evaluation based on the level of support given to task execution is expensive and requires careful experimental design.

Only a small percentage of these are suitable for general use in robotics. In particular, they trivially interface with a large variety of sensors and effectors, have a well constructed software IDE that works with a standard programming language, are self contained and are easy to use. The CBC2 is a new robot controller that meets these conditions. The CBC2 includes an ARM 7 based DAQ/Motor control system, an ARM 9-based CPU/Vision processor running LINUX, an integrated color display and touch screen. The CBC2 is both a USB host (allowing the use of standard cameras, mass storage and network interfaces) and a USB device for software downloads. This paper describes the CBC2, its capabilities and the KISS-C IDE and associated libraries which include functionality ranging from color tracking to PID motor control. The CBC/KISS-C system was adopted by the Botball Robotics Education program in 2009, and was used in about three hundred schools. Based on feedback from that experience, design improvements were made and the CBC2 is being used in the 2010 Botball program and is also being made available for other uses.	arm architecture;blood+;central processing unit;chumby;control system;data logger;embedded system;experience design;fits;firmware;gnu compiler collection;human factors and ergonomics;irobot create;integrated development environment;kiss principle;library (computing);linux;linux on embedded systems;live usb;mary tsingou;mass storage;mobile robot;offset binary;pid;programming language;robot control;robotics;sensor;serial port;swarm;technical support;touchscreen;usability	David P.

Between 1961 and 1967, he studied chemistry at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), and also at the University of Zurich (Switzerland). Johann graduated in Organic Chemistry under Professor Rolf Huisgen from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich and then in 1971 received his doctorate, specializing in “Mechanism of Reactions of Cyclo-octatetraene”. After a postdoctoral fellowship in quantum chemistry between 1971 and 1972 with Prof. Andrew Streitwieser, Jr. at the University of California in Berkeley (U.S.A.), investigating “ab initio Calculations on Carbanions“, Johnny returned to Germany and taught at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) until 1993. During this time, he worked together with Prof. I. Ugi as a scientific assistant and completed his habilitation in 1979, specializing in the area of “Chemical Reactions and Reactivity Models and Algorithms”. Johnny was appointed a Professor at the TUM in 1988.	algorithm;cheminformatics;doctorate degree;ibm i;prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase;short circuit;switzerland;wdfy2 wt allele;quantum chemistry	Thomas Engel	2006	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci600240w		ML	-46.14234898446293	-11.173980546734802	53409

These user preferences can be fulfilled by performing semantic adaptations, which are typically guided by semantic metadata. In this paper, we discuss how high-level semantic adaptations along the temporal axis can be performed using format-independent adaptation engines. Further, the impact of semantic adaptations applied to synchronized multimedia streams (e.g., synchronized audio and video streams) is investigated. H.264/AVC and AAC are used to evaluate our proposed approach, which relies on a format-independent adaptation framework based on MPEG-B BSDL and STX.	advanced audio coding;apache axis;boundary scan description language;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;high- and low-level;moving picture experts group;personalization;streaming media;user (computing)	Davy Van Deursen;Wesley De Neve;Wim Van Lancker;Rik Van de Walle	2009	2009 Picture Coding Symposium	10.1109/PCS.2009.5167437	data compression;layout;synchronization;semantic computing;xml;transform coding;semantic grid;advanced audio coding;computer science;database;semantics;multimedia;boundary scan description language;metadata;world wide web;information system;statistics	OS	-40.23766232247751	-21.00159876514794	53869

Institutional libraries are coming under increasing pressure to support the storage, access and retrieval of such mixed-media complex digital objects in their institutional repositories. Although systems have been developed to record access grid sessions, they don’t provide simple mechanisms for repository ingestion, search and retrieval; and they require the installation and understanding of complex Access Grid tools to record and replay the virtual meetings. Our system has been specifically designed to enable both: the easy construction and maintenance of an archive of Access Grid sessions by managers; and easy search and retrieval of recorded sessions by users. This paper describes the underlying architecture, tools and Web interface we developed to enable the recording, storage, search, retrieval and replay of collaborative Access Grid sessions within a Fedora repository.	access grid;archive;library (computing);next-generation network;streaming media;the australian;upload;xml	Ron Chernich;Jane Hunter;Alex Davies	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74851-9_15	computer science;database;videoconferencing;user interface;world wide web;information retrieval	HPC	-45.41201006031037	-19.778397965281908	55287

However, previous studies of terrorist network structure have generated little actionable results. This is due to the difficulty in collecting and accessing reliable data and the lack of advanced network analysis methodologies in the field. To address these problems, we introduced the Web structural mining technique into the terrorist network analysis field which, to the best our knowledge, has never been done before. We employed the proposed technique on a Global Salafi Jihad network dataset collected through a large scale empirical study. Results from our analysis not only provide insights for terrorism research community but also support decision making in law-reinforcement, intelligence, and security domains to make our nation safer.	algorithm;network science;organizational behavior;social network analysis;time series;world wide web	Jialun Qin;Jennifer Jie Xu;Yilu Zhou;Hsinchun Chen	2005			social network analysis;social science;visualization;network analysis;computer science;data science;data mining;terrorism;empirical research;world wide web;computer security	Metrics	-34.33749205150612	-15.995482909648254	58993

The target applications are the analysis of remotely sensed satellite images for the monitoring of forestry, and the analysis of medical images of the human head. A key element has been the development of data fusion techniques for combining multi-sensor and multi-temporal images. The system architecture is generic and modular, and the system control allows automatic planning and algorithm scheduling. The system includes a spatial database manager capable of handling very large quantities of raster and vector data within a tiled-image environment a sophisticated facility for database interrogation a window-based user interface, and a large set of image processing algorithms. The latter include algorithms for low level processing, image interpretation, automatic image registration, data fusion, and change detection. The system has been implemented on a Sun workstation with selected low level algorithms accelerated by a transputer array.	image processing	G. Sawyer;David C. Mason;N. Hindley;D. G. Johnson;I. H.

Thanks to advances in the """"geosensing"""" technologies, the geospatial community is """"almost"""" ready for their next revolutionary jump. But not quite ready yet! Until we understand how we can process, mine, and analyze the massive amount of data being streamed from geo-sensors every second, the challenge is still there.  However, the horizon looks bright. There have been several success stories to continuously monitor and manage spatiotemporal stream data, each of which has its own position and promise. They ranged from leveraging a geographic information system with streaming capabilities (call it, spatial-data streaming) to leveraging a full-fledged data streaming system with spatial libraries (streaming spatial data, with the emphasis on the word streaming coming first). The spectrum in between these two extremes has been investigated as well.  This talk covers the """"Today of Geospatial"""" and introduces to the audience several geospatial directions at Microsoft, e.g., SQL Server Spatial, Bing Maps, SQL Server BI, SQL Spatial Library, and then, goes into the """"Future of Geospatial"""": geostreaming and, more specifically, geostreaming in the cloud. The talk is divided into two parts: The first part provides a 10,000 foot view of various geospatial efforts at Microsoft and, then, zooms-in through selected angles to highlight key milestones that have advanced the geostreaming state of the art. The second part of the talk introduces the Microsoft SQL Server StreamInsight approach to geostreaming and highlights its impact on the future of the geo-world. This talk provides the unique lessons that have been taken over the last few years, an industrial perspective of the problem, and definitely a vision of how the """".geo"""" term will be one of the hottest terms over the coming decades (if not over the coming years)."""	bing maps;breadbox ensemble (pc/geos);cloud computing;geographic information system;library (computing);microsoft sql server;real-time data;real-time locating system;sensor;streaming media	Balan Sethu Raman;Mohamed H.

RSFDGrC is the series of international scientific conferences spanning over last 15 years. It investigates the meeting points among the four major areas outlined in its title, with respect to foundations and applications. Five papers included in this special issue are devoted to various aspects of roughsets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing, with a special emphasis on hybrid methodologies for solving theoretical problems and dealing with practical challenges of representing and mining compound data. The first paper, “Facilitating Efficient Mars Terrain Image Classification with Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection” by Changjing Shang, Dave Barnes and Qiang Shen, presents an application study of exploiting fuzzyrough feature selection (FRFS) techniques in aid of efficient and accurate Mars terrain image classification. The employment of FRFS allows for the induction of low-dimensionality feature sets from sample descriptions of feature vectors of a much higher dimensionality. Supported with comparative studies, the work demonstrates that FRFS helps to enhance both the ef-	computer vision;data mining;feature selection;file spanning;fuzzy set;granular computing;integrated information theory;rough set	Aboul Ella Hassanien;Hiroshi Sakai;Dominik Slezak;Mihir K.

Then they can find appropriate coefficients and balance chemical equations without involving to mathematical aspects of balancing and remembering a lot of information. The goal of this research was the development of an application which assists vision impaired students enrolled in chemistry course to be able to read chemistry literature containing formulae, chemistry representations of elements and other aspects of chemistry that has been difficult in the past to present in a way for vision impaired people to understand. Developed application by this research is an open source command line Bash Script application under Linux which accepts an unbalanced chemical equation as an input, processes, classifies information and represents it as Mark-up format or Alternative Audio Descriptive using Text to Speech.

In a degree of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), teaching of this subject has been redesigned using a project-based learning approach. Along the course, the students make a complete project of a highway using professional software and procedures. The highway design software chosen includes a simulator that makes a virtual journey along the highway from the point of view of a driver traveling on it. A detailed description of the course program and the software used is provided. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Local, state, and federal partners must collaborate to strategically plan initiatives, allocate resources, and evaluate emergency response activities. These collaborative decision-making processes can be improved by using web-based mapping applications for visualization and analysis. We developed a web-based GIS framework which is applied to public health data for North Carolina’s (NC) Department of Health and Human Services. The application visualizes all state-regulated food service facilities and supports query and analysis tools crucial for food recalls or radiation contamination tracking. Built with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoServer, and a customized GeoExplorer map viewer, the framework delivers a web-based mapping tool that is flexible and Open Source. The flexibility of the framework is an important dimension of its scalability, allowing it Address for correspondence: Stacy Supak, Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management, North Carolina State University, Box 8004 Raleigh, NC 27695-8004, USA.

For a comprehensive picture of brain morphology and function, it is important to discover and bring together various images, segmentations and markup, generated within different projects, and juxtapose them within a single federated atlas interface. This paper describes strategies and tools for integrating distributed sources of brain data spatially. We focus on the organization of Web-enabled spatial data sources, which include ArcIMS feature and image services and distributed grid sources, and on the Smart Atlas, a GIS-based atlas environment enabling users to discover, access, visualize and query heterogeneous images and image markup. We demonstrate construction of spatial databases from unorganized vector and raster brain data based on ontological relationships between anatomical features from the unified medical language system, spatial registration mechanisms, and tools and user interfaces for federated brain data visualization and analysis.	arcims;data infrastructure;data visualization;geographic information system;image markup;markup language;mathematical morphology;spatial database;user interface	Ilya Zaslavsky;Haiyun He;Joshua Tran;Maryann E.

1f209ddd6d01fb1225a2711f9dd325a5778cae96	eliciting the ancient geography from a digital library of latin texts		Geolat – Geography for Latin Literature is a research project, aimed at making accessible a digital library containing the works of Latin literature (from its origins in 240 BCE to the end of the Roman Empire in 476 CE) through a query interface of geographic/cartographic type representing the geographic knowledge expressed in the Latin texts themselves. A core activity of the project has been the development of the ontology GO!, which describes the geographical knowledge contained in the texts of the library. The ontologically annotated texts will allow for a variety of scientifically relevant uses, apart from the geo-based browsing: for example the production of digital and printed critical editions. The project is under development at Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici of Universita del Piemonte Orientale, and financially supported by Fondazione Compagnia di San Paolo.	digital library	Maurizio Lana;Timothy Tambassi	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-73165-0_19	ontology;library science;world wide web;digital library;latin literature;geography;roman empire	NLP	-46.50497411507357	-20.84549884286852	62694

It is released when the greatest media event on Earth has just taken place: the Olympic Games of London 2012. The experience of The Games has been made more pervasive, in-depth, and personalized as never before with fans being able to follow their favorite sports on a multitude of hand-held devices, either live or asynchronously. An unprecedented computing infrastructure has been set up to produce and deliver, via Internet, content (schedules, news, records and result history, athlete profiles) and live feeds of most events, even those that are not to be broadcasted by any TV station. Cloud computing and cloud-enabled technologies were used for capturing, storing, editing, and enhancing content, such as projected flags on tracks and swimming pools, lines highlighting record marks in pools and sandboxes for track and field events. Encoding and streaming live and on-demand has required massive computation, storage, and network deployment. But, besides the sheer scale of equipment and deployment, there are also challenges and opportunities related to data handling and processing, as well as application integration.

The effective use of modern software engineering principles, system environments, and development approaches is demonstrated. Straightforward yet powerful document characterization strategies are illustrated, helpful visualization for effective knowledge transfer is shown, and current user interface methodologies are applied. A specific success of note is the collaboration of disparately skilled specialists to deliver a flexible integrated prototype in a rapid manner that meets user acceptance and performance goals. The domain chosen for the demonstration is breast cancer, using a corpus of abstracts from publications obtained online from Medline. The terms in the abstracts are extracted by word stemming and a stop list, and are encoded in vectors. A TF-IDF technique is implemented to calculate similarity scores between a set of documents and a query. Polysemy and synonyms are explicitly addressed. Groups of related and useful documents are identified using interactive visual displays such as a spiral graph that represents of the overall similarity of documents. K-means clustering of the similarities among a document set is used to display a 3-D relationship map. User identities are established and updated by observing the patterns of terms used in their queries, and from login site locations. Explicit considerations of changing user category profiles, site stakeholders, information modeling, and networked technologies are pointed out.	cluster analysis;information model;interactive visualization;k-means clustering;login;medline;prototype;software engineering;stemming;text corpus;tf–idf;user interface	Min Hong;Anis Kairmpour-fard;Steve Russell;Lawrence Hunter	2004		10.1007/11382393_71	visualization;interactive visualization;information model;computer science;artificial intelligence;breast cancer;data mining;multimedia;user interface;world wide web;k-means clustering	HCI	-35.284263844930955	-23.926829887283525	63648

In spite of the ubiquity of RS on the Web 2.0 this research field still lacks a unique way of representing collective intelligence. To solve this problem, this article adopts a generic event-driven approach providing a unique RBox data schema. Thus, it is possible to achieve the abstraction of collaborative events that occur on Web 2.0 such as ranking, tagging and voting. A comparison with other tools illustrates the contribution of RBox to the RS field. For instance, this tool enables reusing algorithms and executing experiments that were originally intended for a specific application domain, for other ones. Finally, considering RS tools’ limitations, the next versions of RBox will integrate ubiquitous computing and context-aware recommender systems.	event-driven programming;recommender system;web 2.0	Edmundo P.

MNTG enables its users to generate traffic data at any arbitrary road networks with different traffic generators. Unlike existing traffic generators that require a lot of time/effort to install, configure, and run, MNTG is a web service with a user-friendly interface where users can specify an arbitrary spatial region, select a traffic generator, and submit their traffic generation request. Once the traffic data is generated by MNTG, users can then download and/or visualize the generated data. MNTG can be extended to support: (1) various traffic generators.

A system of stighs displays interesting emergent behaviors, of some complexity, but a stigh alone is very simple: it has a life attribute, only reinforced when users click it, and methods to provide meta-information about its destination. We reason that stigmergic hyperlinks could support a more decentralized approach to the Web search problem, particularly for addressing the “Deep Web”, which we consider all the WWW that is uncharted by search engines. We discuss vertical and horizontal solutions for the “Deep Web” and present a specialized system that makes searchable the publications hiding at the biggest Portuguese digital magazines site. The index that the system builds, feeds the search related methods of a stigmergic hyperlink linking to that destination. Our contributions are, to make the case for a broader “Deep Web” concept, that goes beyond databases hiding behind HTML forms; describe an approach that could decentralized Web search, based on stigmergic hyperlinks and a supporting business model; and to exemplify one specialized system that enables searching the biggest Portuguese digital magazines website.	database;deep web;emergence;exemplification;form (html);html;hyperlink;search problem;server (computing);server-side;stigmergy;www;web search engine;world wide web	Artur Sancho Marques;José Figueiredo	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16402-6_31	delegation;business model;hypertext;computer science;knowledge management;web navigation;database;hyperlink;world wide web;decentralization;deep web	Web+IR	-42.99555147748913	-22.774897751536464	64653

Although we live in times where 'Open Data' and 'Big Data' have become buzzwords, getting hold of a reasonable size and quality dataset is often hard. When it comes to user data such as mobility data, this becomes even tougher due to privacy-related concerns. This paper briefly explains our research in the area of multi-user context modeling and presents some criteria that we believe are important while selecting a dataset for testing different approaches in this domain. To find the right dataset, some relevant publicly available human mobility datasets are examined using these criteria. The following are the datasets that have been analyzed: Microsoft Research GeoLife Trajectory Dataset, Tracking Delft I Pedestrian Trajectory Dataset, MIT Media Lab Reality Mining Dataset and LifeMap Dataset.

A number of the licenses were based on concurrent usage, so around budget time, people started to ask if we had an appropriate number of licenses. By adapting some previously developed software for tracking workstation use, we were able to determine who was using which applications, and concurrent usage information for these products and to reduce the number of concurrent users allowed to reflect actual use (plus some headroom). By applying these figures to just four applications, we were able to obtain a savings of $43,000 without cutting any service to our users. This paper discusses the methods we used to collect, process, and display this information, as well as some of the problems we encountered.	autocad;headroom (audio signal processing);maple;unix;workstation	Jon Finke	1997			database;internet privacy;world wide web	OS	-41.349204898904446	-10.537964200830752	69407

We utilize this infrastructure in building an IoT system for data-intensive smart city services; by collecting data from real city environment and developing analysis methods for these data. We are building Smart City Traffic Pilot on top of the infrastructure to provide the functionality to collect the data and perform the analysis. Based on this experience, we present in this article requirements for data-intensive smart city services. Moreover, we describe four implemented use cases for utilizing rich data sources available in the smart city: situational picture, driving coach, real time reasoning, and mobile code. A lively collaboration between a large number of different actors is essential in realizing these use cases. Finally, we discuss how the use cases fulfill the requirements and the lessons we have learnt.	3d modeling;algorithm;code mobility;data pre-processing;data-intensive computing;lively kernel;machine learning;map matching;plasma cleaning;requirement;smart city;streaming media;visual effects	Susanna Pirttikangas;Ekaterina Gilman;Xiang Su;Teemu Leppänen;Anja Keskinarkaus;Mika Rautiainen;Mikko Pyykkönen;Jukka Riekki	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	10.1109/BigData.2016.7840741	simulation;engineering;world wide web;computer security;internet of things	Robotics	-37.773907367255006	-23.23175629087797	69490

Rather than viewing annotations as collections of (abstract) meta-informa-tion for use in indexing, retrieval or semantic processing, we view annotations as a set of peer-level content with temporal and spatial relationships that are important in presenting a coherent story to a user. The composite nature of the collection of media is essential to the nature of peer-level annotations: you would typically annotate a single media item much differently than that same media item in the context of a total presentation.This paper focuses on the document engineering aspects of the annotation system. We do not consider any particular user interface for creating the annotations or any back-end storage architecture to save/search the annotations. Instead, we focus on how annotations can be represented within a common document architecture and we consider means of providing docu-ment facilities that meet the requirements of our user model. We present our work in the context of a medical patient dossier example.	co-ment;coherence (physics);document engineering;encode;requirement;synchronized multimedia integration language;user interface	Dick C.

They consider the use of National Instruments' LabVIEWTM with the associated Datalogging and Supervisory Control Toolset (DSC) to develop the SCADA/HMI section (operator's interface and datalogging) of a software simulated industrial plant consisting of a vessel with charge and discharge proportional valves, a heating/cooling element, a level sensor and two flow rate sensors. The control of this plant can be done in two different ways, according to the difficulty level of the practice: by way of a LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI, the common name identifying LabVIEW programs) or by way of a ladder program written with RSLogix 500 and emulated by RSLogix Emulate 500 (both are Rockwell Software's products, the first being the ladder code development environment for SLC500 family of industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) from Allen Bradley and the second being the related software emulator)	automation;computer cooling;data acquisition;discharger;emulator;high-level programming language;human–computer interaction;labview;open platform communications;physical plant;programmable logic device;sensor;server (computing);simulation;user interface	Francesco Adamo;Filippo Attivissimo;Giuseppe Cavone;Nicola Giaquinto	2007	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2006.887216	control engineering;embedded system;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;programmable logic controller;process control;control theory;development environment;computer engineering;scada	Embedded	-35.11461160886262	-21.627582572177403	71188

565e707d2124b6834145ecfff842e60b9a0cbc74	design and implementation of digital libraries	digital library;world wide web	As the Internet and the World Wide Web expanded so fast, digital libraries has become a very hot topic. Since 1992 a lot of studies have been done and some achievements have been made. This chapter is a survey of these studies. We first discuss designing digital libraries, including definition of digital libraries, infrastructure requirements for digital libraries, research issues related to digital libraries, and the architecture of digital libraries. Then a project, Digital Library Initiative, is introduced as an example of implementing digital libraries.	digital library;internet;library (computing);requirement;world wide web	Xiuqi Li;Borko Furht	1999			world wide web;architecture;digital library;the internet;computer science	PL	-46.60711971207731	-21.29030095687179	72023

The Agency for Integration, Diffusion and Archive of Medical Information (AIDA) is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) specifically developed to guarantee interoperability in health organizations. This paper presents the Biomedical Multi-agent Platform for Interoperability (BMaPI) integrated in AIDA and it is used by all hospital services which communicates with AIDA, one of the examples is the Intensive Care Unit. The BMaPI main objective is to facilitate the communication among the agents of a MAS. It also assists the interaction between humans and agents through an interface that allows the administrators to create new agents easily and to monitor their activities in real time. Due to the BMaPI characteristics it is possible ensure the continuous work of the AIDA agents associated to INTCare system. The BMaPI was installed in Centro Hospitalar do Porto successfully, increasing the functionality and overall usability of AIDA platform.	agent-oriented programming;archive;ccir system a;information systems;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;interoperability;multi-agent system;oe-cake!;usability	Luciana Cardoso;Fernando Marins;Filipe Portela;Manuel Filipe Santos;António Abelha;José Machado	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07596-9_14	computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;data mining;world wide web;computer security	AI	-35.15205732621678	-10.815067245705885	72735

1fc5ab2c49c4b674c5678ed2b9f7bd32dd07ef7e	towards a cross-canadian digital library platform		OurDigitalWorld has offered a province-wide digital heritage search portal at OurOntario.ca since 2007, and currently indexes digital objects from over 250 GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) organizations from across Ontario. The British Columbia Library Association's Provincial Digital Library initiative is laying the foundation for a new provincial digital library in British Columbia. As a collaborative effort between the two organizations we have been exploring Supplejack--a metadata ingestion tool created by Digital New Zealand. Using this tool, we have created a prototype for a metadata discovery layer that can easily ingest metadata from a diverse range of institutions, and provide access to that information through search portal that can potentially be deployed at a national, provincial/territorial, or regional level, allowing for fast and efficient collaboration. Our demonstration will walk users through our functional search engine prototype backed by Supplejack, which has been loaded with sample metadata from a variety of organizations in Ontario and British Columbia with diverse metadata schema.

In less than three years, mapping platforms such as Google Maps have sparked an exponential growth in user-generated geographically referenced content. However, the “serious” applications of Web 2.0 are sparse and this paper assesses its use in the context of collaborative spatial decision-making. We present an online map-based discussion forum that enables Internet users to submit place-based comments and respond to contributions from other participants. We further use the geographic references in a thread-based master plan debate for a university campus to simulate this debate in the map-based forum. This allows us to demonstrate how the online map provides an overview of the status and spatial foci of the debate, and how it can help us understand the spatial thought processes of the participants.	automated planning and scheduling;emoticon;geographic coordinate system;internet;microsoft outlook for mac;simulation;sparse matrix;time complexity;user-generated content;web 2.0;web mapping;world wide web	Claus Rinner;Carsten Keßler;Stephen Andrulis	2008	Computers, Environment and Urban Systems	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2008.08.004	exponential growth;decision support system;geography;computer science;artificial intelligence;participatory gis;data mining;spatial analysis;geographic information system;web 2.0;cartography	Web+IR	-44.0067899446736	-20.180556285410265	76638

Furthermore, to deal with the growing amount of coding formats for multimedia content, format-independent adaptation systems are desired. These systems support the exploitation of scalability to meet the usage environment, as well as semantic adaptations to meet the user preferences. In this demonstration, we present NinSuna, a fully integrated multimedia content adaptation platform based on semantic web technologies. It aims at being deployable in streaming environments and relies on format-independent semantic-aware adaptation engines.	content adaptation;content format;scalability;semantic web;user (computing)	Davy Van Deursen;Wim Van Lancker;Tom Paridaens;Wesley De Neve;Erik Mannens;Rik Van de Walle	2008	2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia	10.1109/ISM.2008.42	xml;content management;computer science;adaptive system;semantic web;multimedia;metadata;world wide web;information retrieval;encoding	HPC	-40.31824715585679	-20.97861663043683	78007

However, we need beforehand to evaluate these systems in real situations. In this paper, we point out the insufficiencies in the evaluation of the PIS. Then, we propose a new evaluation method for PIS. Finally, we describe the evaluation results of a demonstrator developed during a project called MouverPerso. This demonstrator was tested among a group of subjects in the University of Valenciennes.	emergence;information system;lazy evaluation;relevance	Makram Soui;Christophe Kolski;Mourad Abed;Guillaume Uster	2008			systems engineering;shipping container;information system;computer science;mechanical engineering	AI	-34.700555343491494	-10.780497471378649	78555

The Community of Multimedia Agents project (COMMA) is devoted to creating an open environment for developing, testing, learning and prototyping multimedia content analysis and annotation methods. It serves as a medium for researchers to contribute and share their achievements while protecting their proprietary techniques. Each method is represented as an agent that can communicate with the other agents registered in the environment using templates that are based on the Descriptors and Description Schemes in the emerging MPEG-7 standard. This allows agents developed by different organizations to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly regardless of their programming languages and internal architecture. A Development Environment is provided to facilitate the construction of media analysis methods. The tool contains a Workbench using which the user can integrate the agents to build more sophisticated systems, and a Blackboard Browser that visualizes the processing results. It enables researchers to compare the performance of different agents and combine them to build more powerful and robust system prototypes. The COMMA can also serve as a learning environment for researchers and students to acquire and test cutting edge multimedia analysis algorithms. Thus the efficiency of research in this area can be improved by sharing of media agents.	accessibility;algorithm;data mining;dataflow;high- and low-level;mpeg-7;one-way function;programming language;web service;workbench	Gang Wei;Valery A.

0069d62d30b906deb74e86472bf543212defded1	a handbook for building an approximate query engine		There has been much research on various aspects of Approximate Query Processing (AQP), such as different sampling strategies, error estimation mechanisms, and various types of data synopses. However, many subtle challenges arise when building an actual AQP engine that can be deployed and used by real world applications. These subtleties are often ignored (or at least not elaborated) by the theoretical literature and academic prototypes alike. For the first time to the best of our knowledge, in this article, we focus on these subtle challenges that one must address when designing an AQP system. Our intention for this article is to serve as a handbook listing critical design choices that database practitioners must be aware of when building or using an AQP system, not to prescribe a specific solution to each challenge.	amazon simple storage service;amazon web services;approximation algorithm;big data;cheat sheet;database;high- and low-level;high-availability cluster;ibm notes;microsoft azure;sampling (signal processing)	Barzan Mozafari;Ning Niu	2015	IEEE Data Eng.

88dd6f7bad35a57f5739d1e09ab2b342f1943eeb	the financial crimes enforcement network ai system (fais) identifying potential money laundering from reports of large cash transactions		CEN) AI system (FAIS) links and evaluates reports of large cash transactions to identify potential money laundering. The objective of FAIS is to discover previously unknown, potentially high-value leads for possible investigation. FAIS integrates intelligent human and software agents in a cooperative discovery task on a very large data space. It is a complex system incorporating several aspects of AI technology, including rule-based reasoning and a blackboard. FAIS consists of an underlying database (that functions as a blackboard), a graphic user interface, and several preprocessing and analysis modules. FAIS has been in operation at FINCEN since March 1993; a dedicated group of analysts process approximately 200,000 transactions a week, during which time over 400 investigative support reports corresponding to over $1 billion in potential laundered funds were developed. FAIS’s unique analytic power arises primarily from a change in view of the underlying data from a transaction-oriented perspective to a subject-oriented (that is, person or organization) perspective. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) is a relatively new agency (founded in 1990) of the U.S. Treasury Department whose mission is to establish, oversee, and implement policies to prevent and detect money laundering in support of federal, state, and local law enforcement. A key data source available to FINCEN is reports of large cash transactions made to the Treasury according to terms of the Bank Secrecy Act.2 FINCEN has developed a system, called the FINCEN AI System (FAIS), which links and evaluates all reported transactions for indications of suspicious activity characteristic of money laundering, with the objective of identifying previously unknown, potentially highvalue leads for follow-up investigation and, if warranted, prosecution (Wall Street Journal 1993). FAIS integrates intelligent software and human agents in a cooperative discovery task on a very large data space. It is a complex system incorporating several aspects of AI technology, including rule-based reasoning and a blackboard. FAIS consists of an underlying database, a graphic user interface, and several preprocessing and analysis modules. The database functions as a blackboard and is implemented in SYBASE. The graphic user interface is implemented in Neuron Data’s OPEN INTERFACE.

Five technical challenges for application sharing are identified: multiple views, multi-user access, feedback about other users activities, conference management facilities and sustainable performance. A system is presented which re-uses an existing single-user GIS and encompasses a User Interface Management System (UIMS), knowledge-based techniques and agent support for group-work. This novel approach offers a solution to the technical challenges, while enhancing the usability of such systems.	geographic information system	Rachel M. Jones;Conn V. Copas;Ernest A.

Even if there is such a component, laboratory access is often limited, and thus there is a need to increase students' laboratory experience. This paper addresses the development and testing of instructional material in the form of take-home hardware kits and software that can be used to perform control system experiments at home. The students are given a compact, low-cost hardware kit and software with which they can perform an experiment at home using only their PC/laptop. The kit consists of three components. These are: a hardware interface board which interfaces with the student's PC and with the experiment hardware, a Windows-based user interface program that the students download to their computer, and the experimental setup. Five experiments have been developed. Here we report on two of these experiments that involve control systems: a DC motor/tachometer system and a heater/temperature sensor system. Administration of the kits in several mechanical engineering courses has shown that the kits were effective in improving student understanding of key concepts.	control system;download;experiment;hardware interface design;laptop;mathematical model;mechatronics;microsoft windows;scalability;system dynamics;tachometer;uniform resource identifier;user interface	Musa K.

TüNDRA was originally designed to provide access via the Internet to constituency treebanks and to tools for searching and visualizing them, as well as tabulating statistics about their contents. TüNDRA has now been extended to also provide full support for dependency treebanks with non-projective dependencies, in order to integrate the IT-TB and future treebanks with similar properties. These treebanks are queried using an adapted form of the TIGERSearch query language, which can search both hierarchical and sequential information in treebanks in a single query. As a web application, making the IT-TB accessible via TüNDRA makes the treebank and the tools to use of it available to a large community without having to distribute software and show users how to install it.	data retrieval;query language;terabyte;treebank;web application	Scott Martens;Marco Passarotti	2014				Web+IR	-41.857347370790535	-21.3022106200177	83954

They are not efficient for the queries where geographical location is important, such as finding hotels within an area or close to a place of interest. A natural interface for spatial searching is a map, which can be used not only to display locations of search results but also to assist forming search conditions. A map-based search engine requires a welldesigned visual interface that is intuitive to use yet flexible and expressive enough to support various types of spatial queries as well as aspatial queries. Similar to hyperlinks for text and images in an HTML page, spatial objects in a map should support hyperlinks. Such an interface needs to be scalable with the size of the geographical regions and the number of websites it covers. In spite of handling typically a very large amount of spatial data, a map-based search interface should meet the expectation of fast response time for interactive applications. In this paper we discuss general requirements and the design for a new map-based web search interface, and present a prototype for the University	cartography;html;hyperlink;internet;linkage (software);location (geography);point of interest;prototype;query language;requirement;response time (technology);scalability;spatial database;spatial query;web search engine;world wide web	Joseph D.

In developing a research prototype of an Automated Dental Identification System (ADIS), research teams from multiple institutions collaborated with forensic experts from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice Information Services division to identify the functional requirements of ADIS. A multitude of digital image processing and pattern recognition techniques were developed to meet the requirements of the constituent components of ADIS. In this demo, we present a web-based environment called webADIS that integrates ADIS components and provides a unified web-based interface. webADIS provides support for configuring the system into multiple possible realizations for some components as well as alternative identification strategies.	digital image processing;functional requirement;pattern recognition;prototype;web application	Satyasrinivas Chekuri;Diaa Eldin M.

The aim of this project is to add value to a legacy localised corpus. Unified models are proposed to define spatial entities in a formal way. These models allow to build a specific information retrieval system based on the semantic contents of various kinds of documents. Moreover, a reflection on computable interpretation of these spatial entities is performed, in order to be used in an information retrieval process. A prototype implementing this kind of information extraction and information retrieval process has been developped to validate our assumptions.

These project reviews are mostly recorded in plain text. This makes it difficult to derive useful overall findings from a set of such post-mortem reviews, for example to monitor and guide a software process improvement program. We have developed a five-step method to transform the qualitative, natural language type information present in those reports into quantitative information. This quantitative information can be analyzed statistically and related to other types of quantitative projectspecific information. In this paper we discuss the method, and show the results of applying it in the setting of a large industrustrial software process improvement initiative.	causality;experiment;natural language;software development process	Joost J.

Radiology Departments are now also taking advantage of these facilities in order to decrease the cost of producing and archiving radiological images. Today a typical medium scale hospital consumes large quantities of silver oxide film which, along with attendant labor costs, is expensive compared with costs for digital image processing technology now available. Using this technology large image files can be stored and retrieved through local area networks that can also support the transaction traffic essential in a hospital environment. The evolving systems are called Picture Archiving and Control Systems (PACS). PACS will include radiology imaging equipment, distributed and central image archiving facilities, and significant numbers of user work-stations and graphics display nodes. The devices will be inter-connected by high speed local area networks capable of distributing information ranging from simple control messages to large image files of several megabytes in a fashion offering most users a response time of several seconds. This paper illustrates the PACS system concept, present a queuing model approach to analyzing PACS performance. and discuss results acquired for a variety of parametric samples. The IBM Research Queuing Package (RESD) has been used for the exercise and will-be-discussed sufficiently for the reader to appreciate its capability. RESQ simulation results indicate that system response times will be more dependent on the internal architecture and programs of the workstation than on the speed of the transmission media.	archive;control system;digital image processing;distributed computing;emergence;file archiver;graphics;ibm research;megabyte;physics and astronomy classification scheme;picture archiving and communication system;queueing theory;radiology;response time (technology);simulation;workstation	G.

5d9fad187c3d2812dcacbaf8fc3f10eb4f281344	waves 2007 conference		This special volume contains a selection of papers, based on talks presented at the Eighth International Conference on Mathematical and Numerical Aspects of Waves (Waves 2007), which took place at the University of Reading, UK, organised jointly with INRIA, from 23rd to 27th July 2007. Wave phenomena are hugely important in many areas of science and engineering and at a whole variety of length scales, from the atomic to terrestrial and beyond. Applications include acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, seismicwave motions, the coupling of wind and ocean waves, refraction and imaging with photonic crystals, probing atomic structure with attosecond pulses, the design of low-loss optical wave guides, and travelling waves in the occurrence of epidemics. This conference is one of the main venues where significant advances in the analysis and computational modeling of wave phenomena and exciting new applications are presented, and this meeting was the eighth in a sequence which started in Strasbourg in 1991. Conference themes included forward and inverse scattering, nonlinearwave phenomena, fast computational techniques, numerical analysis, absorbing layers and approximate boundary conditions, analytic and semi-analytic techniques for wave problems, domain decomposition, guided waves and random media. The invited speakers were Mark Ablowitz (Colorado, USA), Annalisa Buffa (Pavia, Italy), Weng Cho Chew (Illinois, USA), Tom Hagstrom (NewMexico, USA), Andreas Kirsch (Karlsruhe, Germany), Ross McPhedran (Sydney, Australia) and John Toland (Bath, UK). In addition, there were approximately 180 varied and interesting contributed talks, with speakers travelling from all over the world to attend the meeting. The conference featured an embeddedWorkshop on High Frequency Propagation and Scattering, supported by the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK, as a satellite meeting of the INI Programme on Highly Oscillatory Problems: Computation, Theory and Application. Waves 2007 was also a satellite conference of ICIAM 07, the 6th International Congress on Industrial andAppliedMathematics. In addition to theworkshop, therewere sevenminisymposia: brainwaves and cognitive neurodynamics; inverse problems; nonlinear waves; periodic and random media; photonic crystals and metamaterials; resonances and trappedmodes; time domainmethods.

M-CREAM suggests creative insights on new emergency situations to users, in the form of ontology-based conceptual models named mini-stories. Search and ranking techniques allow users to explore the mini-stories’ space, by leveraging semantic and computational creativity methods. A demonstration scenario focused on an Italian city illustrates the main features of the tool.	computational creativity;ontology (information science);smart city	Antonio De Nicola;Michele Melchiori;Maria Luisa Villani	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-98192-5_16	conceptual model;emergency management;data mining;ontology;design pattern;computer science;computational creativity	HCI	-37.40369899088388	-23.315289248003154	88907

In developing countries, proper tools, techniques, and resources must be widely used in healthcare operational planning. Considering the necessity of effective resource planning, this study focuses on the rural healthcare system of Bangladesh and concentrates on the sub-district government hospital laboratory. The authorsâ€™ determine possible ways to improve operations of laboratory facilities. To analyze existing system efficiency, sample laboratory data is fed into a simulation model. This paper identifies several possible ways for future expansion and suggests using simulation for better planning and analysis.	profiling (computer programming)	Kamrul Ahsan;Abdullahil Azeem	2010	IJISSS	10.4018/jisss.2010100102	economics;developing country;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;simulation modeling;management science;laboratory;service system	Vision	-34.18166502898187	-14.913107231071974	89649

In our current context, the knowledge base covers selected topics in physics, chemistry, and biology, and our question set consists of AP (advanced high-school) level examination questions. The task is challenging because the questions are linguistically complex and are often incomplete (assume unstated knowledge), and because the users do not have prior knowledge of the system's contents. Our solution involves two parts: a controlled language interface, in which users reformulate the original natural language questions in a simplified version of English, and a novel problem solver that can elaborate initially inadequate logical interpretations of a question by selecting relevant pieces of knowledge in the knowledge base. An evaluation of the work in 2006 showed that this approach is feasible and that complex, multisentence questions can be posed and answered, thus illustrating novel ways of dealing with the knowledge capture impedance between users and a formal knowledge base, while also revealing challenges that still remain.	characteristic impedance;controlled natural language;knowledge base;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;solver	Peter Clark;Shaw Yi Chaw;Ken Barker;Vinay K.

We expect a Quasi-zenith satellite with nationwide coverage. In near future, the data transmission of image of pharygoscopy, motion picture of light reflex, 12-leads ECG, automated ultrasonic echo and vital signs from ambulances shall be performed to assist medical control. For example, Thrombolytic agents are reportedly effective even when injected into a vein, if injected in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction, which will reduce medical costs, resulting in high-quality services available uniformly across the nation. This paper describes Japanese aspects of mobile eHealth to support ambulatory applications.	mobile phone;network congestion;software propagation	Isao Nakajima;Yasumitsu Tomioka	2010	IJEHMC	10.4018/jehmc.2010010102	information and communications technology;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security	HCI	-40.064500928347364	-15.402063968577632	89996

793435367deb637dfdfb6c3f1197a7d4ad5da97c	transparent fault tolerance for real-time automation systems		Developing software is hard. Developing software that is resilient and does not crash at the occurrence of unexpected inputs or events is even harder, especially with IoT devices and real-time requirements, e.g., due to interactions with human beings. Therefore, there is a need for a software architecture that helps software developers to build fault-tolerant software with as little pain and effort as possible. To this end, we have designed a fault tolerance framework for automation systems that lets developers be mostly oblivious to fault tolerance issues. Thus they can focus on the application logic encapsulated in (micro)services. That is, the developer only needs to specify the required fault tolerance level by description, not implementation. The fault tolerance aspects are transparent to the developer, as the framework takes care of them. This approach is particularly suited for the development for mixed-criticality systems, where different parts have very different and demanding functional and non-functional requirements. For such systems highly specialized developers are needed and removing the burden of fault tolerance results in faster time to market and safer and more dependable systems.	automation;business logic;care-of address;criticality matrix;dependability;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant software;functional requirement;interaction;mixed criticality;non-functional requirement;real-time clock;real-time transcription;software architecture;software developer	Burak Hasircioglu;Yvonne Anne Pignolet;Thanikesavan Sivanthi	2018		10.1145/3215525.3215538	safer;automation;real-time computing;fault tolerance;time to market;software architecture;software;computer science;crash;dependability	SE	-40.054597262120566	-15.40862663120374	89998

Catastrophe models are probabilistic models based upon sets of events representing the hazard and weights their likelihood with the impact of such an event happening which is then used to estimate future financial losses. These probabilistic loss estimates often underpin re-insurance transactions. Modelled loss estimates can vary significantly, because of the assumptions used within the models. A rudimentary insurance-style catastrophe model for groundwater flooding has been created by linking seven individual components together. Each component is linked to the next using an open modelling framework (i.e. an implementation of OpenMI). Finally, we discuss how a flexible model integration methodology, such as described in this paper, facilitates a better understanding of the assumptions used within the catastrophe model by enabling the interchange of model components created using different, yet appropriate, assumptions.

We exploit existing parallel and monolingual corpora to extract multilingual correspondents via triangulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two publicly available resources: Tharwa, a three-way lexicon comprising Dialectal Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and English lemmas among other information (Diab et al., 2014); and BabelNet, a multilingual thesaurus comprising over 276 languages including Arabic variant entries (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). Our automated approach yields an F1-score of 71.71% in generating correct multilingual correspondents against gold Tharwa, and 54.46% against gold BabelNet without any human intervention.	babelnet;character encoding;converge;f1 score;lexicon;text corpus;thesaurus	Maryam Aminian;Mohamed Al-Badrashiny;Mona T.

The IWPP is common in several image processing operations. In the IWPP, data elements in the wavefront propagate waves to their neighboring elements on a grid if a propagation condition is satisfied. Elements receiving the propagated waves become part of the wavefront. This pattern results in irregular data accesses and computations. We develop and evaluate strategies for efficient computation and propagation of wavefronts using a multi-level queue structure. This queue structure improves the utilization of fast memories in a GPU and reduces synchronization overheads. We also develop a tile-based parallelization strategy to support execution on multiple CPUs and GPUs. We evaluate our approaches on a state-of-the-art GPU accelerated machine (equipped with 3 GPUs and 2 multicore CPUs) using the IWPP implementations of two widely used image processing operations: morphological reconstruction and euclidean distance transform. Our results show significant performance improvements on GPUs. The use of multiple CPUs and GPUs cooperatively attains speedups of 50× and 85× with respect to single core CPU executions for morphological reconstruction and euclidean distance transform, respectively.	algorithm;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);cpu cache;central processing unit;computation;computation (action);data access;data structure;distance transform;euclidean distance measurement;graphics processing unit;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hybrid system;image analysis;image processing;image resolution;medical imaging;memory hierarchy;multi-core processor;multiprocessing;node - plant part;numerous;parallel computing;personnameuse - assigned;prefix sum;scalability;shared memory;software propagation;thread block;tiling window manager;version;wavefront .obj file;orders - hl7publishingdomain	George Teodoro;Tony Pan;Tahsin M.

One useful approach, demonstrated by the Coverage Set Algorithm (CSA), exploits structured interaction to produce significant computational gains. Empirically, CSA exhibits very good anytime performance, but an error bound on the results has not been established. We reformulate the algorithm and derive both online and offline error bounds for approximate solutions. Moreover, we propose an effective way to automatically reduce the complexity of the interaction. Our experiments show that this is a promising approach to solve a broad class of decentralized decision problems. The general formulation used by the algorithm makes it both easy to implement and widely applicable to a variety of other AI problems.	anytime algorithm;approximation algorithm;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;computation;convex function;decision problem;dimensionality reduction;donald becker;event-driven programming;experiment;frequency response;linear programming;multi-agent system;online and offline;overlap (term rewriting);scalability	Marek Petrik;Shlomo Zilberstein	2007			mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;decision problem;multi-agent system;distributed computing	AI	-40.05952609102892	-15.420371231364225	90004
912e61e38bcbd00aba0cb9bd4b976b3d26a06edf	it-enabled digital service design principles - lessons learned from digital cities		With the rapid expansion of emerging digital technologies, digital service creation and delivery demand new and more structured ways to design, develop and manage the service sustainability. Although, there are various views and strategic aspects from different stakeholders for designing the digital services, the clear answer specifying how to design the digital service within IT architectures or how to re-use design processes learned from service design used in previous Digital City projects is still unknown. In order to derive the digital service design principles, we study the IT architectures that are related to digital services and revisit one typical Digital City - Barcelona. Based on the lessons learned from the Digital City project, we propose a set of design principles that can guide researchers and practitioners to design the digital services in a Digital City.

Instead of algebraic connectivity, a quadratic criterion is used which is shown to depend on the whole spectrum of the consensus dynamics matrix. The influence of new links to this cost is investigated and a first-order approximation is given. This approximation can be used to compare the effect that different links will have and this is exploited to propose a simple algorithm that starts from a regular lattice and adds links until all nodes have a specific number of neighbours. The resulting graph is compared with random graphs known to have high connectivity because of the small-world effect. Numerical experimentation showed that, for specific parameters, this algorithm provides a graph outperforming a large number of realizations of random graphs both in terms of algebraic connectivity and of the proposed quadratic criterion; for these random graphs it was also shown that this quadratic criterion correlates better with the characteristic path length than algebraic connectivity does.	algebraic connectivity;algorithm;complex network;computation;consensus dynamics;graph (discrete mathematics);higher-order function;mathematical optimization;order of approximation;random graph;rate of convergence;small-world experiment;topology optimization	Alexandros C.

1e97d91343e78f8200fdf0b990529c75cb7154ce	how the nature of web services drives vocabulary creation in social tagging		The social tagging system allows users to add arbitrary strings, namely ‘tags’, on a shared resource to organise and manage information. The Yule–Simon process, which is known to capture the population dynamics of social tagging behaviour, does not handle the mechanism of new vocabulary creation because this model assumes that new vocabulary creation is a Poisson-like random process. In this research, we focus on the mechanism of vocabulary creation from the microscopic perspective, and we discuss whether it also follows the random process assumed in the Yule–Simon process. To capture the microscopic mechanism of the vocabulary creation, we focus on the relationship between a number of tags used in the same entry and the local vocabulary creation rate. We find that it does not follow the simple random process, and differs between different services. Furthermore, these differences stem from whether the user’s tagging attitudes are private or open. These results provide the potential for a new model that captures the multiple tagging dynamics with different new vocabulary creation rates.	folksonomy;population dynamics;stochastic process;tag (metadata);vocabulary;web service	Koya Sato;Mizuki Oka;Yasuhiro Hashimoto;Takashi Ikegami;Kazuhiko Kato	2016	CoRR		computer science;multimedia;world wide web	ML	-35.121109296047564	-19.076145748667095	90050

05ef43e59cbe67feb4542845ad07e13cbe0bd12b	domain bridging associations support creativity	inproceedings	This paper proposes a new approach to support creativity through assisting the discovery of unexpected associations across different domains. This is achieved by integrating information from heterogeneous domains into a single network, enabling the interactive discovery of links across the corresponding information resources. We discuss three different pattern of domain crossing associations in this context. 1 Data-driven Creativity Support The amount of available data scientists have access to (and should consider when making decisions) continues to grow at a breath-taking pace. To make things worse, scientists work increasingly in interdisciplinary teams where information needs to be considered not only from one research field but from a wide variety of different domains. Finding the relevant piece of information in such environments is difficult since no single person knows all of the necessary details. In addition, individuals do not know exactly where to look or what to look for. Classical information retrieval systems enforce the formulation of questions or queries which, for unfamiliar domains or domains that are completely unknown, is difficult if not impossible. Methods that suggest unknown and interesting pieces of information, potentially relevant to an already-known domain can help to find a focus or encourage new ideas and spark new insights. Such methods do not necessarily answer given queries in the way traditional information retrieval systems do, but instead suggest interesting and new information, ultimately supporting creativity and outside-the-box thinking. In [1] Weisberg stipulates that a creative process is based on the ripeness of an idea and the depth of knowledge. According to Weisberg this means that the more one knows, the more likely it is that innovation is produced. According to Arthur Koestler [2] a creative act, such as producing innovation, is performed by operating on several planes, or domains of information. In order to support creativity and help trigger new innovations, we propose the integration of data from various different domains into one single network, thus enabling to model the concept of domain-crossing associations. These domain-bridging associations do not generate new hypotheses or ideas automatically, but aim to support creative thinking by discovering interesting relations	bridging (networking);data science;information needs;information retrieval	Tobias Kötter;Kilian Thiel;Michael R.

The particular domain is civil engineering design, and the prototype is designed specifically to support design reuse in building construction projects. However, the underlying visualization and interaction principals behind CoMem are generalizable to the ubiquitous task of finding and understanding useful information in large hierarchical repositories. To support the finding, the entire hierarchy is visualized using a squarified treemap. Once an item from the treemap is selected, CoMem supports the understanding of that item by identifying related items in the hierarchy and visualizing the selected item in the context of these related items in a node-link diagram. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of a usability evaluation of CoMem that supports the claim that finding and understanding improve the process of reuse, and that the described visualizations assist with finding and understanding.

Briefly introduces two MJU digital library projects, then describes the first project where a KORMARC/encoded archival description (EAD) metadata system that allows users to conduct integrated searches is to be designed, implemented and evaluated. The KORMARC/EAD metadata system consists of two modules: a retrieval module and an input module. While in the retrieve mode, one can retrieve KORMARC records of all library materials such as books and course materials, with links to EAD files for both archival items and course materials or to full‐text image files for precious books. In the input mode, users can input two types of data such as catalog data and inventory data. Finally, evaluates the proposed system via mail questionnaires, and proposes three suggestions to make this system a much more comprehensive and effective system.	digital library;ead socket	Hyun-Hee Kim	2003	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640470310491595	integrable system;digital library;project;computer science;user interface;implementation;metadata;world wide web;information system	DB	-42.8872044904241	-20.769569850363894	92523

caf8557a370d046b1499467f768d0811fc0edf85	special issue on multimedia document management systems	document management system	Emerging multimedia technologies are providing enormous opportunities for developing large-scale information infrastructures to support a variety of applications in diverse areas such as education, medicine, manufacturing, industrial control and management, e-commerce, GIS, tourism, and entertainment. These applications are intended to allow geographically distributed users to access large repositories of multimedia documents containing multiple monomedia data including text, audio, image, and video data. We face several technical challenges in developing viable multimedia tools to support such applications. These challenges, which encompass the complete life cycle of multimedia documents, including authoring, management (indexing and retrieval), delivery, and presentation, need to be addressed in a unified framework. We believe that the shear volume of multimedia documents and the diversity of media components of these documents can drastically increase the complexity of managing large-scale multimedia databases. To this end, several research initiatives by federal and commercial funding agencies have been launched. While a collection of frequently appearing keywords in a pure text-oriented document has been used to abstractly represent and index the document in a database, content-based modeling of multimedia documents containing images, audio, and video is still in its infancy. Simple multimedia-oriented queries such as “find all documents containing a given image, an audio clip, and certain keywords” are difficult to realize with high precision and recall ratios in a relatively large database. Research prototypes such as NEC AMORE and WebMARS are directed at achieving such goals.

302a0fd4fc104376b980b9fada600d0127dc8f6d	revisiting web data extraction using in-browser structural analysis and visual cues in modern web designs		Recent trends in website design have an impact on methods used for web data extraction. Many existing methods rely on structural analysis of web pages and, with the introduction of CSS, table-based layouts are no longer used, while responsive design means that layout and presentation are dependent on browsing context which also makes the use of visual clues more complex. We present DeepDesign, a system that semi-automatically extracts data records from web pages based on a combination of structural and visual features. It runs in a generalpurpose browser, taking advantage of direct access to the complete CSS3 spectrum and the capability to trigger and execute JavaScript in the page. The user sees record matching in real-time and dynamically adapts the process if required. We present the details of the matching algorithms and provide an evaluation of them based on the top ten Alexa websites.	approximation;cascading style sheets;code;dark web;deep web;digital mockup;document object model;genetic algorithm;grams;greedy algorithm;html;hierarchical database model;hoc (programming language);independent set (graph theory);information extraction;information retrieval;javascript;knowledge management;lu decomposition;maximal set;random access;real-time clock;responsive web design;sakai project;search engine results page;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;spatial variability;structural analysis;tree (data structure);vldb;www;web page;web search engine;world wide web	Alfonso Murolo;Moira C.

This includes digitizing, encoding and merging different types of data and information obtained from different sources of the system. Date and time is used as the key reference for merging the data from different sources. Techniques that are developed to encode information from photographs and area calculations are discussed. Interactive JAVA application software is developed to play video clippings (dynamic images), displaying photographs (static images), plotting simple graphs, searching and retrieving information from the database and finally saving the searched information into separate files. The software is the first of its kind in deep-sea applications and it also attempts to educate the user about deep-sea photography. The application software is developed by modifying established routines and by creating new routines to save the retrieved information. The information retrieval from the database with newly developed routines to create graphs and to display images are some of the outputs of the application. Finally, further modifications needed for the application are briefed in this paper.	database;end-user development	S.

359dc728029bb11d7107cc190a9d02ca7a0cbf80	storing text retrieval systems on cd-rom: compression and encryption considerations	text retrieval	Until a few years ago, large full-text information retrieval systems could only be operated on powerful mainframes. Then the personal microcomputer became more popular and information retrieval. software was adapted to this smaller device, which, however, had only a relatively small memory and therefore could not be used for very large systems. Recently, the CD-ROM (compact disc read only memory) optical disc medium has become widespread, permitting access by a PC to very large amounts of storage at very low cost. It is thus possible to transfer large databases from the mainframes, where they used to be kept, to the cheaper PC’s. This creates new challenges of efficient data handling (see Christodoulakis & Ford [7]). On one hand, retrieval algorithms have to be improved since computation power is usually reduced; on the other hand, even though the storage capacity of a CD is huge (550 to 725 MB),	algorithm;cd-rom;computation;database;document retrieval;encryption;information retrieval;mainframe computer;microcomputer;read-only memory	Shmuel Tomi Klein;Abraham Bookstein;Scott C.

4a281fbbaa4c402278798c48807092dd0b640f29	swiftlatex: exploring web-based true wysiwyg editing for digital publishing		The text processing tool LATEX has prevailed as a standard in many fields of exact sciences; it is evident that LATEX is likely to be here to stay. From that perspective, it is important to explore what are the best possible ways to support the author in efficiently editing documents. There have been several approaches that provide graphical editing support for LATEX. We argue that a true WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) approach is a justified requirement for future systems and we present here the first cloud-based true WYSIWYG editor. This allows the author to edit the document in its print form directly in a web-based PDF viewer. Building such a system creates unique challenges compared to existing approaches. We identify these challenges and name workable solutions. We also provide a usability evaluation of the new system. In short our finding is that editing LATEX directly in the PDF view is possible for a wide range of edits and valuable for many major user groups and use cases; hence it is a fair requirement for future top-of-the-line LATEX editors.	cloud computing;floor and ceiling functions;graphical user interface;latex;portable document format;positive feedback;usability testing;wysiwyg;web application	Elliott Wen;Gerald Weber	2018		10.1145/3209280.3209522	information retrieval;web application;computer science;cloud computing;use case;electronic publishing;html5;wysiwyg;usability;text processing	HCI	-41.69252283367521	-22.698845509647473	96878

These personal computers can be used to automate many of the office tasks which currently use paper forms, telephone communication, and filing cabinets and thereby improve office worker productivity. Unfortunately, existing programming languages and application development tools are not well-matched to the full-screen interactive user interfaces and the multiuser form-flow applications that these office systems require. As a result, application programs to automate offices are complex, unreliable, expensive, and time-consuming to produce. Examples of these systems are keeping track of papers submitted to a journal, bug reports sent to a software organization, and purchase orders sent to a company.  We have developed an interactive, Form-flow Application Development System (FADS) which will make it easier to build these applications. The system has built-in forms (e.g. data entry and report forms), tools for combining many forms into an application (e.g. using data entered into a data entry form as arguments to a database query that produces data for a report form), facilities to send data (i.e. forms) to another user, and triggering mechanisms to allow a user's attention to be directed to important information (e.g. that a bug fix is overdue). Moreover, applications are developed interactively using the same form-based user interface as the applications being created.	distributed database;graphical user interface;interactivity;microcomputer;multi-user;patch (computing);personal computer;programming language;programming tool;raster graphics	Lawrence A.

We argue that a major obstacle that keeps stakeholders from keeping models up-todate is inadequate user interfaces for specific stakeholders. In this demo paper we present a novel modeling tool that provides adequate stakeholder views and describe the implementational challenges. The tool motivates users to contribute documentation by allowing textual modeling for technical users and web-based modeling via forms for business users at the same time.

Specifically, we discuss the need for digital annotation of printed materials and describe how various technologies for digitally augmented paper can be used in support of work practices. The state of the art in terms of both commercial and research solutions is described in some detail, with an analysis of the extent to which they can support both the writing and reading activities associated with annotation. Our framework is based on an extension of the information server that was developed within the Paper ++  project to support enhanced reading. It is capable of handling both formal and informal annotation across printed and digital media, exploiting a range of technologies for information capture and display. A prototype demonstrator application for mammography is presented to illustrate both the functionality of the framework and the status of existing technologies.	gloss (annotation)	Corsin Decurtins;Moira C.

11f8a2754bd324041bd73092fb3d1afaeb89a03a	building process control simulations with easy java simulations elements		The use of remote labs for teaching control systems and robotics is gaining increasing attention in the control community. One of the key advantages of remote labs is the possibility to easily include new real experiments within the existing setup and share them with students through the Internet. In this paper, a new feature of the mobile robot setup embedded in the Automatic Control Telelab is presented. A pursuer-evader setting has been developed, involving two mobile robots based on the LEGO Mindstorms NXT Technology. Students can choose which role to play (pursuer or evader) and design the best control strategy to achieve the desired objective. Several experiments are reported to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed environment.	as-interface;algorithm;automatic control;computer simulation;control system;control theory;embedded system;experiment;game theory;internet;java;lego mindstorms;mobile robot;nxt;optimal control;robotics;workspace	Jesús Chacon;José Sánchez Moreno;Antonio Visioli;Sebastián Dormido	2013		10.3182/20130828-3-UK-2039.00020	control engineering;simulation;engineering;multimedia	Robotics	-34.15542053502661	-22.128903712976484	101409

3e0b3f09a3e0746defe522b7a6d39f0c24b70aae	information management between academic and internet communities		The concept 'digital archive' can be approached either from the con- cept 'digital' (represented by the Internet) or from the concept 'archive' (repre- sented by traditional collections as libraries). In our days these two approaches and the techniques used by them seem to be merged. This chapter describes the work-in-progress for a project of the National Audiovisual Archive (NAVA), Hungary. The project intents to use the software and social techniques developed for Internet applications to handle large number of very different kind of docu- ments. The project also adopts and develops techniques to combine conventional content management systems using relational database and file-based systems. The primary collection of NAVA is the legal deposit of the programs of six televi- sion and three radio channels. However, several other valuable audiovisual contents are offered by content owners and embedded as special collections for long-term preservation. The applied research project was initiated by the data management problems that we met while integrating the special collections with very different quantity and quality of metadata, however, usability issues were also included. At the moment there are more questions than solutions, however, requirements of a new archive architecture using semantic web 2.0 techniques are outlined. Besides internal resources the work is also funded by the P2P Fusion FP6 EU project.	information management;virtual community	Gábor Knapp;Tamás Rév	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-78578-3_33	computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	DB	-47.261914693573495	-22.168908683273298	101927

It is part of a larger project whose end product will be a graph theoretic expert system. Four tasks will be supported: graph construction, graphical property definition and computation, conjecture analysis, and conjecture formulation. We describe the current status of Grapple, present a typical session, and discuss requirements for automating the more creative aspects of graph theory investigation. l . I n t r o d u c t i o n In this paper we report on some initial developments in an expert system for graph theory investigation. Our goal is to create an intelligent assistant for the graph theory researcher, with emphasis on aiding the conjecturing process. Our initial efforts have concentrated on building a system, called Grapple, which addresses graph construction and graphical computation. The mathematical conjecturing process can be defined as everything that a mathematician does up to the instant he is ready to write """"Theorem: .... proof: .... """" Consider the process specialized to graph theory research. This includes library work, considering results known for a class of graphs on different classes of graphs, specializing general results in order to obtain strengthened conclusions, violating the hypothesis of a result and searching for counterexamples, and other tasks that involve """"tampering"""" with current knowledge. In all of this work, the graph theorist must create and examine useful examples of graphs. Examples serve two functions: Exploratory and evidenciary. To help formulate a conjecture it is necessary to explore the reserach area under consideration. Once a conjecture has been formulated, examples from the full spectrum of pertinent graphs should be checked as evidence of the truth of the conjecture.

Several software tools have been constructed which support a portion of graph theory investigation. """"Graph"""" [Cvet84] supports the graph theorist by providing a data management system for the storage and retrieval of the graph theory literature, a theorem prover, and a library of algorithms which can perform a wide variety of computations on graphs. INGRID [Dutt83] is oriented toward extremal graph theory and manlpulates known theorems in order to produce bounds on specified graph theoretic invariants given restrictions on other chosen invariants. In addition to the tasks which these systems support, the graph theorist must construct and manipulate particular graphs as well as families of graphs, compute graphical properties and the relationships among them, discover patterns in the computed data, and formulate conjectures based on these patterns. It is this set of tasks on which we focus our efforts. As such we are not interested in supporting literature search or automatic theorem proving. 2 . O v e r v i e w o f G r a p p l e Grapple is an interactive, menu-drlven software tool which supports the creation, manipulation and examination of graphs under the direction of the user. Grapple is implemented in Pascal on an IBM-PC with color graphics board and 512K of memory. Hard-copy output is provided by a HP 7475A color plotter. Figure 1 contains a block diagram of the functional capabilities of Grapple. The system consists of an editor, a librarian, a graphical properties subsystem, and a screen manager. © 1986 A C M 0 8 9 7 9 1 177 -6 /86 /0002 /0327 $00 .75"""	algorithm;apple ii graphics;automated theorem proving;computation;d-grid;database;diagram;expert system;exploratory testing;extremal graph theory;graph (discrete mathematics);graphical user interface;grapple;ibm personal computer;librarian;pascal;plotter;programming tool;relevance;requirement;video card	Marc J.

1ce9082f85078865ced2a8b298df9dd8c7f3a023	a portal to support rigorous experimental methodology in networking research		Whilst dealing with topics that are more and more influenced by physical properties of the underlying media, the networking community still lacks a culture of rigorous result verification. Indeed, as opposed to most of the science and engineering fields there are very few benchmarks to test protocols against. Furthermore, in most publications the authors do not give the community access to the raw results or details of the performed experimental procedures. Therefore it is impossible to accurately reproduce their experiments. We propose to solve this problem by extending the state of the art experiment tool OMF with a public portal. This portal, while providing the experimenter with access to experimental resources, also provides the community with a system for comprehensive experiment description and result verification. The collection of both the measurement set and the experiment’s description is done in a transparent manner for the experimenter, who can decide to publish them via the portal once the research is mature enough.	benchmark (computing);computer science;display resolution;experiment;oml;oracle database;portals;scheduling (computing);software suite;testbed;while	Guillaume Jourjon;Thierry Rakotoarivelo;Maximilian Ott	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29273-6_18	computer science;management science;world wide web	SE	-38.27650721616265	-10.808955360124983	102615

This new expectation has forced libraries to think about how to design a system that will allow diverse geographical information to be available over the Internet. Some libraries have built a site to distribute localized data, others have developed a system to make only maps accessible online. Princeton University Library’s Digital Map and Geospatial Information Center started a pilot map scanning project in early 2004 to build a system, to develop specifi cations for scanning maps and compressing TIFF images to JPEG2000 fi le format, and to establish workfl ows. The system was built using many off-the-shelf commercial software packages. This article discusses challenges of building a system and explains how Princeton developed a scanning process and standards, workfl ows, and what lessons were learned in building such a system. Introduction Libraries purchase and receive geospatial data and paper maps free of charge through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). One of the requirements of the FDLP is to make all the materials distributed through it freely accessible to the public. Because of this requirement and demands from library users to make all the materials accessible on their desktops, many libraries scan their paper maps and make them accessible online. However, one major problem libraries face is how to design a system that will allow the user to search, view, and download diverse geospatial data LIBRARY TRENDS, Vol. 55, No. 2, Fall 2006 (“Geographic Information Systems and Libraries,” edited by Jaime Stoltenberg and Abraham Parrish), pp. 254–263. © 2006 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois and digital maps. This article examines the challenges of creating such a system and explains how Princeton University Library’s Digital Map and Geospatial Information Center has designed a system that will allow the library to integrate various forms of geographic information and make them accessible online from one interface. Challenges There are numerous challenges in making geospatial data and digital maps accessible over the Internet. Many libraries have used ESRI’s ArcIMS and ArcSDE, and relational databases such as Micosoft’s SQL Server, Oracle, etc., but they were not very successful in making diverse collections of digital maps and geospatial data accessible online from one interface. This was due to the following reasons: • Disseminating digital maps and geospatial data via ArcIMS technology is not practical for libraries when they have a great quantity of material covering different parts of the world at different scales and in different formats. • There is no simple way to view and download vector geospatial data stored in ArcSDE without creating ArcIMS image or feature services. Using ArcIMS to build image and feature services to view and download vector data is not only time consuming but also uses a lot of processing power on a server. • Many libraries are scanning large historical maps and aerial photographs. Some of them are georeferenced but many are not. Disseminating these types of materials with vector geospatial data is a real challenge. • The fi le sizes of scanned maps and geospatial data could vary from a few megabytes to a gigabyte. Making a large fi le accessible over the Internet is a challenge. • Designing a system that has easy workfl ows and ease of maintenance is diffi cult. Because of these reasons, I spent a few years testing different server side technologies to build a system that will not only allow our library to organize and manage digital maps and geospatial data with easy workfl ows but will also allow users to search, browse, view, and download different formats of geographic information. Some of these formats include scanned historical/present maps, aerial photographs, satellite images, and vector geospatial data. The advantage to building such a system is that all kinds of geographic information can be integrated, managed, searched, and accessed from one interface. Geographic information can range from maps and geospatial data to photographs of places, etc. Many libraries have designed systems to disseminate maps and geographic data online, but the focus is either regional or item specifi c. In order to build an integrated system to disseminate diverse geographic information, I started a pilot map 255 shawa/digital map and geospatial data online	aerial photography;arcims;arcsde;browsing;commercial software;download;geographic information system;gigabyte;information systems;internet;jpeg 2000;library (computing);map;megabyte;microsoft sql server;relational database;requirement;search algorithm;server (computing);server-side;tiff	Tsering Wangyal Shawa	2006	Library Trends	10.1353/lib.2006.0062	local information systems;library science;digital mapping;geographic information system;world wide web	Graphics	-42.432505546097595	-20.339339240063698	102696

We describe the development of the tripzoom system developed as part of the SUNSET-SUstainable social Network SErvices for Transport-project to research and develop a mobile and fixed traffic sensor system to help facilitate individual mobility shifts. Its main novelty was its ability to use mobile sensors to classify common multiple urban transportation modes, to generate information-rich individual and group mobility profiles and to couple this with the use of a targeted incentivised marketplace to gamify travel. This helps to promote mobility shifts towards achieving sustainability goals. This system was trialled in three European country cities operated as Living Labs over six months. Our main findings were that we were able to accomplish a level of behavioural shifts in travel behaviour. Hence, we have provided a proof-of-concept system that uses positive incentives to change individual travel behaviour.	big data;chimeric antigen receptor;cloud computing;context awareness;event condition action;event-driven programming;experiment;fuse device component;gamification;geographic information systems;geographic information system;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;hl7 2.5 event type;individual mobility;information exchange;information source;ll parser;logic programming;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile device;mobile phone;modal logic;modality (human–computer interaction);network congestion;numerous;onset (audio);paclitaxel vitamin e-based emulsion;real-time clock;real-time transcription;rule (guideline);rule-based system;seamless3d;situated;smart city;social network;solutions;support system;vendor information documentation;warez;while;window of opportunity;accelerometers;sensor (device)	Stefan Poslad;Athen Ma;Zhenchen Wang;Haibo Mei	2015		10.3390/s150613069	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;incentive;engineering;transport engineering	HCI	-35.62514291362149	-18.53453749405401	103397

However, with the huge success and growing market share of online shopping, retailers face the need to provided detailed and structured information about perceptual product features to their customers. In this paper, we analyze why dealing with perceptual product features in databases is difficult and summarize our current efforts on tackling this problem.	database;online shopping	Joachim Selke	2011			simulation;computer science;data mining;multimedia	AI	-36.70750585436092	-11.53062874892086	104023

In general the system is targeting on two different user groups, the tourism boards as service providers and the tourists as end-users. The concept covers an efficient data management for the service providers and state of the art visualization techniques for online, offline and mobile solutions. These cover the 2D as well as the 3D visualization of geo related tourism information and also interfaces to third party platforms.

The methodology requires the development of quantitative models that project the state's future investment in medical education, as well as the effects of potential policy proposals on the costs of medical education, on state costs, and on physician manpower supply. To build these models, we collected and analyzed extensive data from one statewide medical education system. We discuss the development of our methodology, its application in the strategic planning by the state's educational leaders, its significance in the policy formulation process, and we offer guidelines for future research.

2fcfaf993589f7cfcb52e79b49a022ea568e09c8	the with platform: where culture meets creativity.		The cooperative content sourcing and publication platform WITH targets the creative and cultural industries, aiming to increase the use and re-use of digital cultural content that is available through a variety of sources. The platform addresses all the stakeholders of these industries, from content holders and producers, to application and service developers, scholars and normal users. WITH offers services that facilitate the discovery of cultural resources that meet users' criteria in order to be collected and re-used for artistic creation, promotion of innovation and showcasing of the social and economic value of cultural material. It has evolved through a series of hackathons, workshops and seminars in the framework of EC-funded projects such as Europeana Space , which aimed to produce new applications and services based on published resources through the use of the platform's programmatic interfaces (APIs). These interactions led to the intuitive integration of linked data principles and related services that can enhance and enrich available web resources, as well as to the development of a complete annotation and crowdsourcing infrastructure that is aligned with the efforts of W3C’s Open Annotation Community Group.	crowdsourcing;europeana;hackathon;interaction;linked data;the open group;web resource	Michalis Giazitzoglou;Vassilis Tzouvaras;Alexandros Chortaras;Enrique Matos Alfonso;Nasos Drosopoulos	2017			knowledge management;creativity;computer science	Web+IR	-46.999995925602235	-21.144682262419575	105160

However, creation and editorial control of their content is still largely centralized. The Composable Virtual Earth project's goal is to allow seamless interoperability of geographic data from arbitrary, distributed sources.  MapCruncher is a first step in this direction. It lets users easily create new interactive map data that can be layered on top of existing imagery such as road maps and aerial photography. MapCruncher geographically registers and reprojects the user's map into a standard coordinate system. It then emits metadata that makes it easy for anyone on the Internet to find the published map data and import it. Interactive maps them become distributed, seamlessly composable building blocks -- similar to images in the early days of the Web.	aerial photography;bing maps platform;centralized computing;distributed computing;interoperability;map;seamless3d;web mapping;world wide web	Jeremy E.

The system consists of several components, including a web‐crawler that detects changes, an archive of past versions of pages, a tool called HtmlDiff to highlight changes between versions of a page, and a graphical interface to view the relationship between pages over time. This paper describes AIDE, with an emphasis on the evolution of the system and experiences with it. It also raises some sociological and legal issues.	advanced intrusion detection environment;archive;difference engine;experience;graphical user interface;internet;web crawler;world wide web	Fred Douglis;Thomas Ball;Yih-Farn Robin Chen;Eleftherios Koutsofios	1998	World Wide Web	10.1023/A:1019243126596	static web page;web search engine;computer science;web crawler;web navigation;web page;graphical user interface;database;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;web server	Networks	-44.39350157621114	-23.8357933722047	105807

f451b314e4f04b4638adcd8cf91618fdde905c3f	a software tool dedicated to the modelling of landscape networks	network analysis;field observations;connectivity metrics;least cost distance;landscape graph	Since landscape connectivity reflects a basic form of interaction between species and their environment, the modelling of landscape networks is currently an important issue for researchers in ecology and practitioners of landscape management alike. Graph-based modelling has recently been shown to be a powerful way of representing and analysing landscape networks. Graphab 1.0 is designed as a package integrating a complete set of connectivity analysis functions. The application can build graphs from a given landscape map by exploring several possibilities for link topology, types of distances and graph definitions. A wide range of connectivity metrics can be computed from these graphs at the global, component or local levels. By extrapolating patch-based metrics outside of the graph using a distancedependent function, the relationship between the graph and any set of point data can be established in order to compare the connectivity properties of the landscape network and field observations of a given species. In conclusion, Graphab 1.0 provides a full set of coherent modelling functions for analysing and exploring landscape graphs with a single application. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We use an intelligent agent crawler designed to collect user-generated content without relying on access to private internal server databases. The agents navigate autonomously through the world and interact with content to discover regions, parcels of land within regions, user-created objects, other avatars, and user associations. The experiments we performed are the first which focus on the content within a large virtual world. Our results show that virtual worlds can be effectively crawled using autonomous agent crawlers that emulate normal user behavior. Additionally, we find that the collection of interactive content enhances our ability to identify dynamic, immersive environments within the world.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;avatar (computing);bing maps platform;database;dynamic web page;emulator;experiment;google earth;immersion (virtual reality);intelligent agent;interaction;metaverse;multi-user;sampling (signal processing);server (computing);user (computing);user-generated content;virtual world;web crawler;web search engine	Joshua Eno;Susan Gauch;Craig W.

In this process, historians employ their scientific knowledge, experience, and intuition to formulate queries (who was involved in an event, when did an event occur etc.), and subsequently try to locate the pertinent information from their sources. In this article, the authors investigate how historians formulate queries, which query terms are chosen, and how historians proceed in searching for related information in sources. The insight gained from this investigation can be subsequently used for organizing documents within historical source repositories and building tools that will enable historians to access the needed information more rapidly and fully.	archive;organizing (structure);relevance;secondary source	Elena Torou;Akrivi Katifori;Costas Vassilakis;Giorgos Lepouras;Constantin Halatsis	2010	International Journal on Digital Libraries	10.1007/s00799-010-0062-4	computer science;data science;ontology;methodology;data mining;world wide web	DB	-34.314123834897046	-13.87218831657223	108211

64892209d49081d637c2b4cd416c47254bd24caa	alcide: extracting and visualising content from large document collections to support humanities studies		The application of research practices and methodologies from the Information and Communication Technologies to Humanities studies is having a great impact on the way humanities research is being conducted. However, although many applications have been developed to automatically analyse document collections from the historical or the literary domain, they often fail to provide a real support to scholars because of their inherent complexity: technical skills are often required to use them and to inspect their output. On the other hand, some systems are more user-friendly, but present basic analyses and are limited to the needs of a specific research community. In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations, we developed ALCIDE ( Analysis of Language and Content In a Digital Environment ), a web-based platform designed to assist humanities scholars in navigating and analysing large quantities of textual data such as historical sources and literary works. This suite of tools combines advanced text processing techniques with intuitive visualisations of the output to serve a broad range of research questions, which no other comparable tool can address in a single platform. Textual corpora can be inspected and compared along five semantic dimensions: who, where, when, what and how. Such dimensions in different combinations allow targeting many key questions of different humanities disciplines, as shown in the five use cases presented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A model-based approach is used to develop disease and behavior models from multi-modal heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, a model-based indexing technique has been developed to speed up the data access and retrieval. This system has been successfully applied to various genuine and simulated diseases outbreaks scenarios.	data access;health insurance portability and accountability act;modal logic;prototype	Chung-Sheng Li;Charu C.

While they are able to support heterogeneity of technical components, their ability to support complex business interactions has yet to mature. This paper summarizes research in progress which asks how might the Web services model be mapped to other kinds of IT services and extended to account for services of greater human and organizational complexity through their lifecycle. The research proposes the construction of a generic IT service model and a taxonomy IT services to provide a frame of reference for analysis and evaluation for the extension of the Web services model and for a transition to a service oriented view of IT.	complexity theory and organizations;interaction;interoperability;service-oriented architecture;web service;world wide web	Andrea Stern;Joseph G.

In a hostile application environment the network may be attacked. Since the base-station plays a critical role and acts as a sink for all data traffic, it may be subject of pointed attack from an adversary that opts to inflict the most impact on the network. Despite of all physical precautionary measures for hiding the base-station, traffic analysis techniques can uncover its location since it is the end point of all data routes. This paper presents a novel distributed algorithm that boosts the anonymity of the base-station. A local sniffer adversary model is assumed where the source of a transmission is determined and used to search for the next hop until reaching the base-station. To counter such an attack, sensors in the vicinity of the adversary will transmit deceptive packets in order to divert the sniffer away from the base-station. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the approach.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;distributed algorithm;sensor web;simulation;traffic analysis	Yousef Ebrahimi;Mohamed F.

ff205ed9b0ab04d15e6a3f442cd6090fd48b4794	an improved three-phase five-level inverter topology with reduced number of switching power devices		This paper presents an optimized topology of 3-$\phi$ , multilevel inverter (MLI) configuration for five or higher level operation with reduced switch count. The proposed solution consists of two basic units (BUs) of multilevel converter and a T-structured 3-level inverter (3-LI). Both BUs are equally shared by the three phases maintaining symmetry among the phases. Moreover, for a higher level operation of the proposed MLI, the modifications required are at two BUs only and not at three legs of the inverter. It further helps in reducing the requirement of extra components for higher level operation compared to the conventional solutions. Furthermore, the topology also has the benefits of reduced switching and conduction loss. An algorithm is also devised to generate the switching pulses for the BUs and the 3-LI, using a carrier-based space vector modulation technique. Presented topology is compared with other existing topologies to prove its advantage. All the details regarding the operating modes and pulse width modulation techniques employed for the proposed system are given and supported by the simulation and experimental results.	algorithm;power inverter;power semiconductor device;pulse-width modulation;simulation	Arpan Hota;Sachin Jain;Vivek Agarwal	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2758722	control theory;mosfet;control engineering;modulation;three-phase;engineering;network topology;power semiconductor device;inverter;space vector modulation;electronic engineering;topology;pulse-width modulation	EDA	-40.07959174320501	-15.41649766163775	109908
da1f76d012593f229858bcbeb6792de37ad33c24	maximum a posteriori estimation of noise from non-acoustic reference signals in very low signal-to-noise ratio environments		This paper examines whether non-acoustic noise reference signals can provide accurate estimates of noise at very low signalto-noise ratios (SNRs) where conventional estimation methods are less effective. The environment chosen for the investigation is Formula 1 motor racing where SNRs are as low as -15dB and the non-acoustic reference signals are engine speed, road speed and throttle measurements. Noise is found to relate closely to these reference signals and a maximum a posteriori method (MAP) is proposed to estimate airflow and tyre noise from these parameters. Objective tests show MAP estimation to be more accurate than a range of conventional noise estimation methods. Subjective listening tests then compare speech enhancement using the proposed MAP estimation to conventional methods with the former found to give significantly higher speech quality.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement	Ben P.

Recent research mainly focused on bridging larger physical distances in large-scale events such as car racing, where participants are unable to spectate from a certain location in the event. In this paper, we advocate using live video streams not only over larger distances, but also in-situ in closed events such as soccer matches or concerts. We present CoStream, a mobile live video sharing system and present its iterative design process. We used CoStream as an instrument in a field study to investigate the in-situ co-construction of shared experiences during live events. We contribute our findings and outline future work.	bridging (networking);field research;interaction;iterative design;iterative method;social media;streaming media	Niloofar Dezfuli;Jochen Huber;Simon Olberding;Max Mühlhäuser	2012		10.1145/2212776.2223822	iterative design;simulation;social media;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;field research	HCI	-40.0505520614104	-15.408096049001246	109910

This paper aims to examine real-time map labelling methods suitable for the small screen on mobile devices. A slider method with a continuous search space was proposed to sequentially label both line and point features. The method starts with defining a range box for possible locations of the label. Then a search is performed, and the range box is reduced, if there are any cartographic objects that overlap the range box. Finally, the label is placed, at the best possible position in the reduced range box according to normal cartographic preferences, where it does not obscure any cartographic object. We implemented this method in a Java environment using the open source library JTS Topology Suite. A case study showed sound cartographic results of the labelling and acceptable computational efficiency. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The efficient utilization of ICU capacity impacts on both the welfare of patients and the hospital's cost effectiveness. Decisions made in the ICU affect the operations of other departments. Yet, decision making in an ICU tends to be mainly subjective and lacking in clear criteria upon which to base any given decision. This study analyzes the admission-and-discharge processes of one particular ICU, that of a public hospital in Hong Kong, by using queuing and computer simulation models built with actual data from the ICU. The results provide insights into the operations management issues of an ICU facility to help improve both the unit's capacity utilization and the quality of care provided to its patients.

Our application domain is art-historical research that is particularly dominated by the use of image material. Today the use of digital libraries in arts, history and humanities is still exceptional. Though images are essential in almost all historic sciences, their use in heraldry is outstanding. In heraldic research large image databases with innovative retrieval methods are needed. Besides complex conventional fulltext retrieval, the capability of querying image databases by visual content is highly desirable. Recent approaches attempt an automatic content-based image retrieval based on generic features like color, texture, shape or spatial layout. But the main problem in content-based querying is to determine the exact set of appropriate attributes or features that describes the content of an heraldic image in the database adequately. Our objectives are that the experiences gained will supply guidelines for next generation image retrieval systems. To distribute heraldic images the integration into the internet together with efficient online access is crucial. From an art historian’s viewpoint the WWW can be characterized as a world wide compound of multimedia document servers delivering historical documents relevant to his/her work. However, the art historian’s requirements dramatically influence the profile of online multimedia databases: The intensive use of multimedia documents in a variety of formats and at different levels of quality demands an optimized storage of multimedia documents, together with the integration of knowledge on multimedia formats into web servers and clients. 1 HERON Getting the picture right Finding images in digital libraries or large image archives without detailed knowledge about domain, iconography or the specific kind of objects depicted, is the aim of the interdisciplinary HERON project. HERON is an acronym for ’heraldry online’, indicating that the project’s first practical application area is about heraldry, the science of coats of arms. Though heraldry represents an important branch of art-historical research, the project’s vision is not restricted to the field of art-history, but may serve various applications with need of image databases, as for example medical imaging or collections of trademark and designs. The HERON framework merges leading-edge database technology with professional handling of historical images from the humanities. Since 1998 HERON is funded by the German Research Foundation Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the strategic research program Distributed Processing and Exchange of Digital Documents (V3D2).	application domain;archive;coat of arms;content-based image retrieval;database;digital library;german research centre for artificial intelligence;historical document;library (computing);medical imaging;requirement;texture mapping;www;web server	Jürgen Vogel;Wolf-Tilo Balke;Werner Kießling	2000		10.1109/ICPR.2000.905380	image texture;computer vision;digital library;image processing;feature extraction;content management;shape;computer science;digital image processing;multimedia;image segmentation;texture;scale-space segmentation;information retrieval	Vision	-41.68361223832198	-20.592346497838722	111143

This version of OWGIS generates mobile interfaces based on HTML5 technology and can be used to create mobile applications. The style of the generated websites is modified using COMPASS, a well known CSS Authoring Framework. In addition, OWGIS uses several Open Geospatial Consortium standards to request data from the most common map servers, such as GeoServer. It is also able to request data from ncWMS servers allowing the display of 4D data from NetCDF files. This application is configured by XML files that define which layers, geographic datasets, are displayed on the Web GIS sites. Among other features, OWGIS allows for animations; vertical profiles and vertical transects; different color palettes; dynamic maps; the ability to download data, and display text in multiple languages. OWGIS users are mainly scientists in the oceanography, meteorology and climate fields.	compass;cascading style sheets;consortium;desktop computer;download;geographic information system;html5;java;javascript;map;mobile app;mobile device;netcdf;open-source software;world wide web;xml	Olmo Zavala-Romero;Eric P.

d2cd42b0f56b76f2467a8e6671b0625b17b7bea1	heuristic search and computer game playing iv	heuristic search	Due to its difficult positional understanding by the machine and high branching factor of its game tree, the oriental game of Go has become an extremely challenging test bed for AI techniques. Computer Go is the main theme of this fourth special issue on heuristic search and computer game playing. The six papers in this special issue were selected from the two invited sessions on the subject at the 7th Joint Conference on Information Systems through rigorous reviews and they have been significantly expanded by the authors from the conference presentations. Four of the six papers are directly on the core of computer Go. The other two are on game tree search in general with important immediate applications to computer Go. Using Monte Carlo technique to handle intrinsic difficulty of positional evaluation in Go is a surprising new approach. Bruno Bouzy s paper ‘‘Associating Domain-dependent Knowledge and Monte Carlo Approaches within a Go Program’’ goes a step further to present a ‘‘domain knowledge guided Monte Carlo’’ method. The effectiveness of this method has been demonstrated by his Program Indigo s winning the Bronze medal of 19 · 19 Go at last year s Computer Olympiad, which surpassed the performances of all his previous versions of Indigo based on knowledge and search only. Erik van der Werf, Mark Winands, Jaap van den Herik and Jos Uiterwijk presented in their paper ‘‘Learning to Predict Life and Death from Go Game Records’’ another fundamentally new approach to evaluation in Go through machine learning from game records. Keh-Hsun Chen s paper ‘‘Maximizing the Chance of Winning in Searching Go Game Trees’’ provides an interesting new footing for the global search in Go via mini-maxing the chances of winning rather than the usual territory estimates. It is well known that the connectivity in Go is not transitive.

For this work it is not the game itself that is important, but the technologies involved in the construction of the game. Examples of each one of these technologies are presented here through the construction of three different versions of the same game. The first version is totally made in hardware using digital integrated circuits, the following is accomplished by programming using the Assembly language and finally a third version using a high-level language. The importance of these examples lies in the fact that each one of these versions allows one to exemplify techniques that can also be found in other types of computer programs. Besides capturing the attention and the students' interest immediately, the games are good examples to serve as support to the concepts’ exposition done by the teacher in the classroom.	algorithm;assembly language;computer hardware;computer program;data acquisition;embarcadero delphi;exemplification;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;information visualization;integrated circuit;samegame;symbolic stream generator;user interface	Pedro José Guerra de Araújo;João Vieira Baptista	2007			data mining;acoustics;computer architecture;body orifice;collar;cylinder;computer science;barrel (unit);piston	EDA	-36.977479527751726	-21.36638379462273	115225

146fee4cf2eeb35a2b2034588aca2c033b8f2671	towards quantifying data quality costs	data quality;quality of data	Today most organizations run their daily operations using data at their disposal. However, a vast majority of the organizations do not have adequate process and tools to maintain high quality operational data at all times. One of the key reasons for this is the lack of appreciation of the damages that low quality data can bring to an organization, and the cost of ensuring high quality of data. This article provides a basis for quantifying in monetary terms the costs of both low quality data and ensuring high quality data. A comparison of the costs of low quality data and ensuring high quality data can be a simple and compelling basis for an organization to determine the extent of the efforts it must expend to ensure high quality of its operational data. 1 TYPES OF OPERATIONAL DATA To provide a basis for understanding the costs of both low quality data and ensuring high quality data, we need to understand the types of data that organizations use in running their daily operations. There are at least five types: • “Front-office” data Front-office data is data that is used in running primary daily operations of an organization; for example, customer account data in a bank to support daily debitcredit transactions. • “Back-office” data Back-office data is data that is used for analyses in support of strategic and tactical decision-making by an organization; for example, monthly or quarterly customer transactions data to support profit-loss, inventory, and merchandizing analyses by a nationwide retail chain. Often, back-office data consists of data extracted and transformed from front-office data. As such, low quality front-office data propagate to back-office data; and when low quality data is detected in frontoffice data, the part of the back-office data that was derived from the front-office data must be repaired. Back-office data also includes web log data that captures website visitors’ navigation patterns. TOWARDS QUANTIFYING DATA QUALITY COSTS 70 JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY VOL. 2, NO. 4 • Archival data Archival data is data that has been transferred from hard disk to tertiary storage devices such as CDs, tapes, floppy disks, etc. for backup purposes and to support mobile users. Again, low quality data propagate from secondary storage to tertiary storage; and when low quality data is detected in secondary storage, the part of the archival data that originated from secondary storage must be repaired. • Metadata Metadata is data about data, and includes such data as the system catalogs in relational databases. It also includes data dictionary, which contains such information as versions of software that work together, etc. • Control data Control data is data that data-processing software uses for proper operation and control; for example, the access control list of ordinary users and their privileges, system access audit trail, etc. Control data is usually managed by privileged users such as system administrators and database administrators. Different types of operational data have different uses for an organization, and cause different types of damages. Some data, such as the web log data and system access audit trail, are automatically generated and maintained, and therefore are normally not susceptible to errors, while operational data entered by people are subject to input errors of various types. Further, errors in data, such as missing data, wrong data, etc., can propagate, thereby complicating the tasks of detecting and repairing errors. 2 COST OF LOW QUALITY DATA There have been limited efforts to systematically understand the effects of low quality data. The efforts have been directed to investigating the effects of data errors on computer-based models such as neural networks, linear regression models, rule-based systems, etc. [Ballou et al 1987] [Kauffman et al 1993]. In practice, low quality data can bring monetary damages to an organization in a variety of ways. As observed earlier in [Kim 2002], the types of damage it can cause depend on the nature of data, nature of the uses of the data, the types of responses (by the customers or citizens) to the damages, etc. For businesses they all boil down to financial losses, and for the government they boil down to loss of trust and waste of taxpayers’ money. The types of damages include at least the following. 1. Loss of revenue Organizations may actually lose money if they under-charge customers or citizens based on incorrect account information, such as the amount of charges patients incurred in hospital stays, the license fees and taxes citizens owed the government, etc. The shortfall on revenues can be determined manually on a periodic basis, and the historical amount of shortfall should be used as a guide to determine the level of efforts to prevent errors in data. In the case of a particular COST OF LOW QUALITY DATA VOL. 2, NO. 4 JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY 71 major hospital in the US, as much as 30 percent of the customer account information contained errors. 2. Waste of money Organizations that mail marketing materials to incorrect postal addresses clearly waste money. This problem arises when organizations use misspelled or incomplete addresses or outdated addresses to send materials via postal mail. The problem does not arise if organizations use such incorrect addresses for other purposes, such as customer segmentation based on cities within a state or sections within a city, etc. The amount of wasted money can be computed if undeliverable mails are returned. If the mails are not delivered but also not returned, the rate of undelivered mails should be estimated by other means. Organizations that make mistakes often have to take corrective actions. People resources and expenses incurred to correct the mistakes represent waste of money. For example, when organizations over-charge customers based on incorrect account information, they usually have to process refund requests at a later date. When organizations distribute reports, marketing materials, or product user manuals, etc. with important errors in them, they often have to re-print and redistribute such materials. 3. Lost opportunity Organizations that make inaccurate strategic and tactical decisions based on inaccurate analyses of customer segmentation, customers’ purchase behaviors, etc. suffer lost opportunity. For example, suppose that a manufacturer incorrectly decides, based on customer data that contains a disproportionate amount of low quality data, to target customers “in the 30s and 40s age groups and $60K to 70K income groups” to market a new product, rather than “40s and 50s age groups and $70K to 80K income groups, and with no children”. Then the manufacturer’s marketing campaign will be partially misdirected, and if the effective time window for the marketing campaign closed before the mistake is discovered, the customer group that the manufacturer did not pursue represents a lost opportunity, and a loss of potential additional revenue. The wrong customer group the manufacturer pursued represents waste of money (at least a less-than-optimal use of money). Lost opportunity often comes in conjunction with waste of money. When organizations take corrective actions upon discovering mistakes, they end up doing the same work twice or more. The people resource and the time they spend to correct the mistakes could have been used for productive work, and thus represent a lost opportunity. For example, customers of software products, when given user manuals that contain errors, will call help desk (customer technical support line). Customer support engineers then must spend time answering such calls, rather than helping customers who call with other types of request for help. 4. Tarnished image (or loss of goodwill) Repeated mistakes due to persistence of low quality data, like repeated mistakes from other reasons, can lead to desertion of customers, since after a while TOWARDS QUANTIFYING DATA QUALITY COSTS 72 JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY VOL. 2, NO. 4 disappointed and frustrated customers will switch to competitors for goods and services. This is somewhat difficult to quantitatively assess, since customers switch vendors and brands for a variety of reasons. However, the customer churn rate and the consequent decline in revenue and increase in the cost of acquiring new customers can be fairly easily determined, and a certain fraction of the figures may be assigned to persistent uses of low quality data. 5. Invasion of privacy and civil liberties Invasion of privacy and civil liberties occurs largely due to unauthorized dissemination of private data about individual customers and citizens. However, they can also occur as a result of a proper use and dissemination of low quality data maintained by organizations. Incorrect, as well as correct, information about the diagnosis and treatment of patients in doctors’ offices and hospitals, memberships in certain organizations, subscriptions for certain publications, purchase records of certain types of product, etc. can all potentially place individuals in bad situations. Such information can lead to discrimination in employment, a police investigation, detainment at airports and customs when traveling, etc. Incorrect or outdated control data can also lead to invasion of privacy. If system administrators or database administrators do not properly manage the access control list, for example, by not updating it after certain employees have been terminated, unauthorized employees may access the computer systems or the databases, and damage the computer systems and databases, and/or disseminate certain private information about certain individuals found in the databases. It is difficult to quantify monetary damages caused by invasion or privacy and violation of civil liberties, unless they result in lawsuits.

We motivate and present new requirements stemming from advanced multimedia applications and the resulting consequences for multimedia document models. Along these requirements, we discuss HTML, HyTime, MHEG, SMIL, and ZyX, a new model that has been developed with special focus on reusability and adaptation. The analysis and comparison of the models show the limitations of existing models, point the way to the need for new flexible multimedia document models, and throw light on the many implications on authoring systems, multimedia content management and presentation.

In this paper, we introduce Mr. DLib's recommendations-as-a-service, which allows third parties to easily integrate a recommender system into their products. We explain the recommender approaches implemented in Mr. DLib (content-based filtering among others), and present details on 57 million recommendations, which Mr. DLib delivered to its partner GESIS Sowiport. Finally, we outline our plans for future development, including integration into JabRef, establishing a living lab, and providing personalized recommendations.	digital library;dlib;information overload;library (computing);living lab;personalization;recommender system	Jöran Beel;Akiko Aizawa;Corinna Breitinger;Bela Gipp	2017	2017 ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL)	10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991606	reference management software;living lab;world wide web;multimedia;information retrieval;recommender system;computer science;bibliometrics;digital library;web service;information overload	HCI	-46.03962695894783	-21.75470509077573	117562

While the user interface design is usually guided by principles, guidelines, and heuristics, there are not mechanisms for systematically selecting RUI components. Moreover, there is a lack of homogeneous classification criteria that hinders the selection of components and increases the relevance of experience designing web applications. To ease the search and the choosing of components by web-developers, this paper presents a taxonomy for classifying RUI components. The development of such a taxonomy has been based on both the study of relevant resources from the UI domain and the opinions of experts.	evolutionary taxonomy;rich internet application	Rosa Romero Gómez;David Díez Cebollero;Susana Moreno;Paloma Díaz;Ignacio Aedo	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22233-7_38	rich internet application;computer science;data mining;world wide web;taxonomy	Robotics	-42.770142693292826	-19.29889663352099	118363
cad1b5e30d69566d77f044dc9160bdb74f75ea1f	unleashing the sensor deep web: next-generation sensor data services		"""1 Motivation """" Google Earth """" – and enough is said for both experts and home Internet users when it comes to fast and user-friendly access to satellite imagery. An open standard allowing such map navigation is the Web Map Service (WMS) [6] of the Open GeoSpatial Consortium (OGC, www.opengeospatial.org) which develops, publishes, and maintains interface specifications for interoperable geo services. Yet, still in 2002 a technical expert from a state mapping agency told the author: """" Airborne images? Why should we serve them to the public? Nobody understands them anyways! """" Then Google Earth and similar services popped up. Said another expert, """" Google offers all we need; I cannot imagine anything beyond """". So what is beyond Google Earth that communities might need? Actually, 2-D remote sensing imagery is only the most well-known species-the general concept of multi-dimensional spatio-temporal raster data covers 1-D sensor time series, 2-D imagery, 3-D CAT scans (x/y/t) and exploration data (x/y/z), 4-D climate, ocean, and cosmological simulation results as well as life science microarray data (x/y/z/t), and many more. Sizes frequently range well into multi-Terabyte object sizes, in future: multi-Petabyte, resulting in a """" Deep Web """" of raster data waiting to be surfaced. The term """" coverage """" denotes some """" space-varying phenomenon """" [4,7], in practice today: raster data. WCS, hence, defines an open access protocol for multi-dimensional raster data. Among the extensions that WCS offers beyond its basic service level is the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) [2]. WCPS defines a raster expression language allowing clients to phrase requests of arbitrary complexity for evaluation by the server. This allows for manifold ad-hoc processing of raster data, such as deriving the vegetation index, determining statistical evaluations, and generating different kinds of plots, such as classification, histograms, etc. A hands-on demonstration website with real-life 1-D to 4-D data is being established at www.earthlook.org. Use cases for WCPS are manifold: For sensor and streaming data it allows subsett-ing, on-demand processing and summarisation, as well as standing queries for alerting. Hyperspectral satellite imagery will not just be served as is, but derived products like vegetation index or snow index are be computed on the fly and without redundant storage. Human brain imaging benefits from analyzing thousands of brain activity maps simultaneously. Multi-Petabyte datacubes can be leveraged for online analysis.

However, computer vision has reached a level of maturity that allows not only to perform research on individual methods and system components but also to build fully integrated computer vision systems of significant complexity. This opens a number of new problems related to system architecture and integration, methods for system synthesis and verification, validating of systems using benchmarking techniques, active vision systems, control of perception and action, knowledge and system representation, context modeling, cue integration, etc. This lack of computer vision system research and scientific papers has motivated the initiation of a new series of conferences, ICVS – International Conference on Computer Vision Systems.

975bf86985781cccc861e5c6040d0408352c438e	epub3 for integrated and customizable representation of a scientific publication and its associated resources	technology and engineering	Scientific publications point to many associated resources, including videos, prototypes, slides, and datasets. However, discovering and accessing these resources is not always straightforward: links could be broken, readers may be offline, or the number of associated resources might make it difficult to keep track of the viewing order. In this paper, we explore potential integration of such resources into the digital version of a scientific publication. Specifically, we evaluate the most common scientific publication formats in terms of their capability to implement the desirable attributes of an enhanced publication and to meet the functional goals of an enhanced publication information system: PDF, HTML, EPUB2, and EPUB3. In addition, we present an EPUB3 version of an exemplary publication in the field of computer science, integrating and interlinking an explanatory video and an interactive prototype. Finally, we introduce a demonstrator that is capable of outputting customized scientific publications in EPUB3. By making use of EPUB3 to create an integrated and customizable representation of a scientific publication and its associated resources, we believe that we are able to augment the reading experience of scholarly publications, and thus the effectiveness of scientific communication.	computer science;discoverability;epub;enhanced publication;html;information system;online and offline;portable document format;prototype;scientific communication;scientific literature;usability	Hajar Ghaem Sigarchian;Ben De Meester;Tom De Nies;Ruben Verborgh;Wesley De Neve;Erik Mannens;Rik Van de Walle	2014			computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval	HPC	-42.170775661906326	-22.627764189307335	121553

It could handle thousands of sensor inputs and produce thousands of diagnostic messages with confidence factors based on complex logic designed to mimic the thinking of human experts. PDS went into commercial operation in 1985 to monitor seven power plant generators from a centralized diagnostic center at Westinghouse Power Generation headquarters. In the 1990's the popularity of advanced technology gas turbines provided a renaissance in PDS utilization. The software has undergone rewrites and improvements since its inception, and the current PCPDS now supports the Siemens Power Diagnostics® Center with centralized rule based monitoring of over 1200 gas turbines, steam turbines, and generators.

Researchers find it difficult to locate and access data relating to the structure and function of such networks in order to study this extreme social phenomenon. In addition, information collected by intelligence agencies and government organisations is inaccessible to researchers. To counter the information scarcity, we designed and built a database of terrorist-related data and information by harvesting such data from publicly available authenticated websites. The database was incorporated in the iMiner prototype tool, which makes use of investigative data mining techniques to analyse data. This paper will present the developed framework along with the form and structure of the terrorist data in the database. Selected cases will be referenced to highlight the effectiveness of the iMiner tool and its applicability to real-life situations.	authentication;covert channel;data mining;prototype;real life	Nasrullah Memon;Uffe Kock Wiil;Reda Alhajj;Claus Atzenbeck;Nicholas Harkiolakis	2011	IJNVO	10.1504/IJNVO.2011.037161	functional decomposition;web mining;social network analysis;the internet;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;data mining;terrorism;data analysis;management;social psychology;world wide web;computer security;social network	DB	-34.34052724665063	-15.941846505071652	123061

The antiquity and fragility of such documents makes their access very restricted. Considering that nowadays the Internet is one of the most interesting places to publish any kind of information, it seems logical to use it to both preserve our cultural heritage and provide a broader access to these documents. This work presents a virtual library that stores data, transcribed texts and digitalized pages of historic Spanish documents from the 16th–18th centuries. This virtual library has two main objectives: first, by offering a set of services, including a powerful user interface to search and browse the documents, a bulletin board, a chat, or mail boxes, the virtual library is transformed into a meeting place for researchers that use emblem books as sources of information for their studies. Second, the virtual library contributes to the preservation of emblem books. We shall describe in this work the project that led to the development of the Virtual Library of Emblem Books, showing its evolution from the beginning (simple search forms and answer pages) to its current state as a virtual library, focusing on the techniques used to build an intuitive and powerful user interface.

One of the methods to preserve privacy in such statistical databases is to introduce uncertainty, i.e., to replace the exact values with intervals of possible values. In this paper, we show that while the introduction of uncertainty can often enhance privacy, sometimes, the opposite effect occurs: adding uncertainty can decrease privacy. Keywords— Fuzzy uncertainty, interval uncertainty, privacy, statistical databases 1 Statistical Databases – Need to Preserve Privacy 1.1 Need for Collecting Data In many practical situations, it is very useful to collect large amounts of data. For example, from the data that we collect during a census, we can extract a lot of information about health, mortality, employment in different regions – for different age ranges, and for people from different genders and of different ethnic groups. By analyzing these statistics, we can reveal troubling spots and allocate (usually limited) resources so that the help goes first to social groups that need it most. Similarly, by gathering data about people’s health in a large medical database, we can extract a lot of useful information on how the geographic location, age, and gender affect a person’s health. Then, we can improve the public health by appropriate appropriate public health measures to different portions of the population. Finally, a large database of purchases can help find out what people are looking for, make shopping easier for customers and at the same time, decrease the stores’ expenses related to storing unnecessary items. 1.2 Need for Privacy Privacy is an important issue in the statistical analysis of human-related data. For example, to check whether in a certain geographic area, there is a gender-based discrimination, one can use the census data to check, e.g., whether for all people from this area who have the same level of education, there is a correlation between salary and gender. One can think of numerous possible questions of this type related to different sociological, political, medical, economic, and other questions. From this viewpoint, it is desirable to give researchers ability to perform whatever statistical analysis of this data that is reasonable for their specific research. On the other hand, we may not want to give the researchers direct access to the raw census data, because a large part of the census data is confidential. For example, for most people (those who work in the private sector) salary information is confidential. Suppose that a corporation is deciding where to built a new plant and has not yet decided between two possible areas. This corporation would benefit from knowing the average salary of people of needed education level in these two areas, because this information would help them estimate how much it will cost to bring local people on board. However, since salary information is confidential, the company should not be able to know the exact salaries of different potential workers. The need for privacy is also extremely important for medical experiments, where we should be able to make statistical conclusions about, e.g., the efficiency of a new medicine without disclosing any potentially embarrassing details from the individual medical records. Such databases in which the outside users cannot access individual records but can solicit statistical information are often called statistical databases. 1.3 Maintaining Privacy is Not Easy Maintaining privacy in statistical databases is not easy. Clerks who set up policies on access to statistical databases sometimes erroneously assume that once the records are made anonymous, we have achieved perfect privacy. Alas, the situation is not so easy: even when we keep all the records anonymous, we can still extract confidential information by asking appropriate questions. Many examples of such extraction can be found in a book by D. Denning [1]. For example, suppose that we are interested in the salary of Dr. X who works for a local company. Dr. X’s mailing address can be usually taken from the phone book; from the company’s webpage, we can often get his photo and thus find out his race and approximate age. Then, to determine Dr. X’s salary, all we need is to ask what is the average salary of all people with a Ph.D. of certain age brackets who live in a small geographical area around his actual home address – if the area is small enough, then Dr. X will be the only person falling under all these categories. Even if we only allow statistical information about salaries s1, . . . , sq when there are at least a certain amount n0 people within a requested range, we will still be able to reconstruct the exact salaries of all these people. Indeed, for example, we can ask for the number and average salary of all the people who live on Robinson street at houses 1 through 1001, and then we can ask the same question about all the people who live in houses from 1 to 1002. By comparing the two numbers, we get the average salary of the family living at 1002 Robinson – in other words, we gain the private information that we tried to protect. In general, we can ask for the average	approximation algorithm;confidentiality;dorothy e. denning;experiment;geographic coordinate system;information-theoretic security;personally identifiable information;privacy;random access;statistical database;web page	Karen Villaverde;Olga Kosheleva	2009			computer science;data mining;internet privacy;statistics	HCI	-37.19435387768636	-10.598933081014474	124225

Dirty data have been a longstanding issue, and the prevalent use of Internet has been increasing the risks, in an unprecedented scale, of creating and propagating dirty data. Dirty data are reported to cost US industry billions of dollars each year. There is no reason to believe that the scale of the problem is any different in any other society that depends on information technology. With these comes the need for improving data quality, a topic as important as traditional data management tasks for coping with the quantity of the data. We aim to provide an overview of recent advances in the area of data quality, from theory to practical techniques. We promote a conditional dependency theory for capturing data inconsistencies, a new form of dynamic constraints for data deduplication, a theory of relative information completeness for characterizing incomplete data, and a data currency model for answering queries with current values from possibly stale data in the absence of reliable timestamps. We also discuss techniques for automatically discovering data quality rules, detecting errors in real-life data, and for correcting errors with performance guarantees. 1 Data Quality: An Overview Traditional database systems typically focus on the quantity of data, to support the creation, maintenance and use of large volumes of data. But such a database system may not find correct answers to our queries if the data in the database are “dirty”, i.e., when the data do not properly represent the real world entities to which they refer. To illustrate this, let us consider an employee relation residing in a database of a company, specified by the following schema: employee (FN, LN, CC, AC, phn, street, city, zip, salary, status) Here each tuple specifies an employee’s name (first name FN and last name LN), office phone (country code CC, area code AC, phone phn), office address (street, city, zip code), salary and marital status. An instance D0 of the employee schema is shown in Figure 1.

Billions of documents including text, pictures, sound, and video are readily available for both scholarly and every-day uses. Even libraries and information centers with sizable budgets are having difficulties in coping with this increase. More developed tools and methods are needed to find, filter, organize and summarize electronic information sources. This paper is an overview of a wide variety of electronic information management issues ranging from infrastructure to the integration of information technology and content, from personalization of information services to “disintermediation”. It discusses the issues of description, organization, collection management, preservation and archiving of electronic information.	archive;disintermediation;ecosystem model;image;information management;internet;library (computing);personalization;video	Yasar Tonta	2005	Inf.

Pottery classification is of fundamental importance for the comprehension and dating of the archaeological contexts, and for understanding production, trade flows and social interactions, but it requires complex skills and it is a very time consuming activity, both for researchers and professionals. The aim of ArchAIDE is to support the work of archaeologists, in order to meet real user needs and generate economic benefits, reducing time and costs. This would create societal benefits from cultural heritage, improving access, re-use and exploitation of the digital cultural heritage in a sustainable way. These objectives will be achieved through the development of: • an as-automatic-as-possible procedure to transform the paper catalogues in a digital description, to be used as a data pool for search and retrieval process; • a tool (mainly designed for mobile devices) that will support archaeologists in recognizing and classifying potsherds during excavation and post-excavation analysis, through an easy-to-use interface and efficient algorithms for characterisation, search and retrieval of the visual/geometrical correspondences; • an automatic procedure to derive a complete potsherds identity card by transforming the data collected into a formatted electronic document, printable or visual; • a web-based real-time data visualisation to improve access to archaeological heritage and generate new understanding; • an open archive to allow the archival and re-use of archaeological data, transforming them into common heritage and permitting economic sustainability. Those tools will be tested and assessed on real-cases scenarios, paving the way to future exploitation."""	algorithm;archive;data visualization;documentation;interaction;mobile device;printer-friendly;real-time data;real-time locating system;semiconductor industry;web application	Maria Letizia Gualandi;Roberto Scopigno;Lior Wolf;Julian Richards;Jaume Buxeda i Garrigos;Michael Heinzelmann;Miguel Angel Hervas;Llorenc Vila;Massimo Zallocco	2016		10.2312/gch.20161408	computational science;geovisualization;scientific visualization;information visualization;visualization;human–computer interaction;computer science;biological data visualization;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-48.20881698987417	-23.80404343283575	125163

f1e884e4b6b9d26b060c5193c70aa61853624ee8	implementation of quaternion based lifting scheme for motion data editor software		Motion analysis is rapidly developing area of research. Due to availability of cheaper hardware with reasonable accuracy for motion acquisition in form of various motion controllers, dedicated mainly for gaming, there are rising new research groups interested in this topic. Proposed solutions for motion analysis have a wide range of application in medicine, sport, entertainment and security. Although motion analysis is one of the most important domains of our everyday life, there are still no good tools supporting knowledge exchange and experiments in this field. In this paper we want to introduce a possibility of implementing specialised wavelet analysis in form of the lifting scheme for motion data in quaternion representation in a data flow processing framework available in Motion Data Editor (MDE) software developed at Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology (PJWSTK) in Bytom (Poland). We want to show how easily custom solutions can be introduced to this general purpose data processing software. Usage of this software saves time by concentrating on rapid prototyping of new algorithms and performing experiments, skipping creation of similar solutions for various data types and algorithms.	algorithm;computation;computational resource;data compression;dataflow;experiment;lifting scheme;model-driven engineering;motion controller;noise reduction;plug-in (computing);rapid prototyping;wavelet	Mateusz Janiak;Agnieszka Szczesna;Janusz Slupik	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-05458-2_53	computer vision;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-36.738040308093275	-23.31125034556158	125984

Many application programs could profit from processors that are able to speed up the execution of sequential applications beyond the performance of current super scalar processors. The Grid Alu Processor (GAP) is a runtime reconfigurable processor designed for the acceleration of a conventional sequential instruction stream without the need of recompilation. It comprises a super scalar processor front-end, a configuration unit, and an array of reconfigurable functional units (FUs), which is fully integrated into the pipeline. The configuration unit maps data dependent and independent instructions simultaneously at runtime into the array of FUs. This paper evaluates the GAP architecture and optimizes the architecture, the number of FUs, and the configuration layers implemented in the array. The simulations show a significant speed-up for sequential applications on GAP in comparison to an out-of-order super scalar simulator (Simple Scalar). The GAP simulator outperforms Simple Scalar on average by about 50% on the basic architecture and about 100% with an extended version including configuration layers.	central processing unit;design space exploration;execution unit;map;reconfigurable computing;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalar processor;simulation;speedup;transistor	Basher Shehan;Ralf Jahr;Sascha Uhrig;Theo Ungerer	2010	2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools	10.1109/DSD.2010.28	embedded system;synchronization;computer architecture;supercomputer;parallel computing;logic synthesis;real-time computing;computer science;out-of-order execution;front and back ends;operating system;instruction set;processor register;scalar processor;profitability index	Arch	-40.058093309125255	-15.405274592880453	129962

This paper proposes a transfer function model to predict electricity prices based on both past electricity prices and demands, and discuss the rationale to build it. The importance of electricity demand information is assessed. Appropriate metrics to appraise prediction quality are identified and used. Realistic and extensive simulations based on data from the PJM Interconnection for year 2003 are conducted. The proposed model is compared with naı̈ve and other techniques.

Eine Unterstützung der Krisenakteure durch interaktive Systeme stellt in Krisenszenarien eine ganz besondere Herausforderung dar. Bereits kleine Schwachpunkte in der Mensch-Computer-Interaktion (MCI) können zu einer vollständigen Unnutzbarkeit der Krisenmanagementsysteme führen. Die regelmäßige Durchführung von Usability-Tests mit den Krisenakteuren ist essentiell. Die Betrachtung der MCI ist eine wichtige Grundlage für die erfolgreiche Einführung von interaktiven Systemen für das Krisenmanagement. Das Testen von interaktiven Systemen für Krisenszenarien ist jedoch besonders komplex: Der Usability-Test muss auf geeignete Weise in das Krisenszenario integriert werden. Usability-Tests in realistischen Krisenszenarien führen zu einem überproportional hohen Ressourcenbedarf. Testmethoden müssen auf geeignete Weise mit dem Krisenprozess verknüpft werden. Diese Publikation gibt einen Überblick über die verschiedenen Ansätze für das Usability-Testing von interaktiven Krisenmanagementsystemen. Diese Ansätze ermöglichen eine iterative Verbesserung der interaktiven Systeme. Dazu gehen diese Ansätze über eine rein methodische Betrachtung des Usability-Testing hinaus. Der Usability-Test wird aus der Perspektive der MCI und aus der Perspektive des Krisenmanagements betrachtet. Erst diese kombinierte Betrachtung führt zu einem systematischen Ansatz für die Durchführung von Usability-Tests in Krisenszenarien. Durch diesen Ansatz lässt sich die Häufigkeit der Usability-Tests bei gleichbleibendem Gesamtaufwand steigern.	citeseerx;eine and zwei;intentionally blank page;iterative method;mensch computer;usability testing	Simon Nestler	2014	i-com	10.1515/icom-2014-0008	geography;engineering;operations research	OS	-40.06664176849342	-15.405941069262859	129964

Courses involving a laboratory component are conspicuously missing from the recent upsurge in online courses, limiting student access to hands-on educational experiences. We present a low-cost, open-hardware haptic device, called Hapkit, designed to provide a hands-on laboratory experience in an introductory online haptics course. Hapkit is a one-degree-of-freedom kinesthetic haptic device that allows users to input motions and feel programmed forces. Based on previous haptic paddle designs, Hapkit consists of a motor, magneto-resistive sensor and rotating magnet, laser-cut acrylic structure, friction drive, force-sensitive resistor, and custom Arduino-based controller board. The CAD files, parts list and costs, assembly instructions, and sample software are posted at http://hapkit.stanford.edu so the public can both recreate Hapkit and modify its design. The corresponding online haptics course, piloted in Autumn 2013, will be available as a self-paced course at http://hapticsonline.stanford.edu. In this demonstration, conference attendees will be able to assemble and program Hapkits.	arduino;computer-aided design;experience;hands-on computing;haptic technology;open-source hardware	Tania K.

Has the population of the European otter declined? Whi ch alien species have most recently been discovered in Germa ny? The Biodiversity Atlas gives the answers. Since 2006, the Project Group AG Biodiversity has been developing t he Atlas at the Bremen University of Applied Scienc s in cooperation between the Fish Ecology Lab and the In stitute of Informatics and Automation (IIA). What s tarted as a rudimentary cartography service for fishes of Germa ny nd Austria has evolved to a comprehensive web-b ased tool for assessing and communicating biodiversity data. Today it is used in several projects to map species distribution and to depict specific biological information, e. g . about amphibians in Pernambuco (Brazil) or mammal s in the city of Bremen (Germany). The information is gathered th rough expert networks, literature or public authori ties. The aim is to offer a scientifically sophisticated instrume nt to display highly topical data to the interested public in an aggregated and easily understandable manner. By thi s means the Biodiversity Atlas provides a solution f r the sustainable protection of species and habitats.	automation;cartography;ecology;habitat;informatics;linux mint	Konstanze Steinhausen;Martin Winkler;Carl-Heinz Genzel;Heide-Rose Vatterrott;Heiko Brunken	2012				ECom	-44.27725057302422	-12.774681129831551	130890

935356622fe87c55d38954f719cb9372ddc6dea3	intuitive justifications of medical semantic search results	explanation;justification;understandability;computing;search;semantic	To some extent, explanations in computer science are answers to questions. Often an explanatory dialogue is necessary to satisfy needs of software users. In this paper, we introduce the concept of intuitive explanation representing the first explanations in an explanatory dialogue. This kind of explanation does not require a situational context to be established or that there is a user model. Depending on an abstract model of explanation generation we present the generic explanation component Kalliopeapplying Semantic Technologies to construct intuitive explanations. We illustrate our generation approach by means of the semantic search engine KOIOS++enabling keyword-based search on medical articles. Since semantic search results are often hard to understand Kalliopewas integrated into KOIOS++in order to justify search results. In this work we describe in detail the construction of intuitive explanations for inexperienced users in the medical domain building on the concepts of Semantic Frequency Classesand Semantic Cooccurrence Classes. Various user experiments illustrate that these concepts enable the explanation component to rate the understandability of labels and of label connections. We show how Kalliopeexploits these valuations to construct and select understandable explanations.	semantic search	Björn Forcher;Thomas Roth-Berghofer;Stefan Agne;Andreas Dengel	2014	Eng.

This provides a tremendous opportunity to explore algorithms which incorporate human computation as a function call. However, various systems challenges make this difficult in practice, and most uses of MTurk post large numbers of independent tasks. TurKit is a toolkit for prototyping and exploring algorithmic human computation, while maintaining a straight-forward imperative programming style. We present the crash-and-rerun programming model that makes TurKit possible, along with a variety of applications for human computation algorithms. We also present case studies of TurKit used for real experiments across different fields.	algorithm;amazon mechanical turk;application programming interface;experiment;fault tolerance;human-based computation;imperative programming;programming model;programming style;scripting language;the turk;user interface	Greg Little;Lydia B.

In a modern economy, large structures of cross-corporation, cross-border shareholder relationships exist, forming complex networks. These networks are often difficult to analyze with traditional approaches. An efficient visualization of the networks helps to reveal the interdependent shareholding formations and the controlling patterns. In this paper, we propose an effective visualization tool that supports the financial analyst in understanding complex shareholding networks. We develop an interactive visual analysis system by combining state-of-the-art visualization technologies with economic analysis methods. Our system is capable to reveal patterns in large corporate shareholder networks, allows the visual identification of the ultimate shareholders, and supports the visual analysis of integrated cash flow and control rights. We apply our system on an extensive real-world database of shareholder relationships, showing its usefulness for effective visual analysis.

For example, an ASP program encoding a planning scenario has as many models as valid plans. This schema is similar to that underlying the application of propositional satisfiability (SAT) algorithms. In fact, the ranges of applicability of these two techniques are similar. Several ASP systems are now available, among them DERES, DLV, SMODELS, and XSB; they support provably correct inferences and are about as fast and scalable as SAT checkers.

Built of brass and wood, with strings held taught by lead weights, it allowed students to create and examine a variety of hyperbolic paraboloids. We built a scale model with potentiometers mounted at key mechanical points. The change in resistance at those points is used to determine the state of the model as users modify it in real time. On the computer display, a synthetic model is shown along with dynamic equations which show how variables such as volume and surface area change in tandem with the model.	computer monitor;potentiometer;string (computer science);synthetic intelligence;time-scale calculus	David Small	1997		10.1145/259081.259225	computer graphics (images);computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	-37.54325743280248	-21.436605286198585	134232

The paper presents the concept of a Hybrid Decision Support System for Crisis Management HDSSCM which is an intelligent platform providing direct support for crisis decision makers. The idea has been developed with a view to, firstly, demonstrating the potential inherent in systems that would be able to address a wide range of emergency response operations, and secondly, to outlining a system architecture proposal. The discussion is placed in the context of Poland's crisis management system. Specific parameters of polish system represents both an inspiration and an underpinning for the proposed intelligent platform. The authors also describe some recent applications and current trends in the area of crisis/disaster management systems.	technical support	Stanislaw Stanek;Stanislaw Drosio	2014	Intelligent Decision Technologies	10.3233/IDT-130177	disaster;decision support system;intelligent decision support system;emergency;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;crisis;operations research	Robotics	-33.69650329362375	-11.37579518626567	135318

However, only an extremely limited range of preferences can be specified for user models and multimedia content metadata created by other parts of the standard cannot be fully exploited. This results in a very incomplete mapping of user models to content models. We present an approach to address the problem by representing user models by means of existing MPEG-7 content description tools.	mpeg-7;user experience;xml	Harry W. Agius;Marios C.

We are dealing with several sources of musical information (audio, notation, performance, video, images, etc.). On one hand, these sources are similar to those of usual multimedia databases. On the other hand, some specific feature of legacy musical archives call for ad-hoc solutions. In legacy musical databases many relations are implied by the framework (for instance recordings of parts of the same piece), but not made explicit in the content. To address this specific feature, we propose a three-level database schema where the bottom level(source level) describes the source material; the mid level (logical level) describes explicit and implied relationships among bottom-level data; and finally, the top level (catalog level) represents the common catalog data attached to pieces (composer, conductor, data of recording). To support this methodology, we need a language to describe musical content. We survey several mark-up languages (such as SMDL and XML derived languages) and discuss their features w.r.t. our proposed layered database schema.	web application	Goffredo Haus;Maurizio Longari	2001		10.1109/WDM.2001.990160	computer science;database;world wide web;information retrieval	NLP	-40.265877047581284	-21.252200128471255	136359

f253b70d28e0d482bd9d5bf6775ad5239f9c5827	on synthesizing behavior that is aware of semantical constraints		Without taking care of the semantics of messages, every message is an isolated entity that can be created and sent at will. This leads to anomalies like a synthesized service that sends a filled form before having received the empty form. In this paper we pick up ideas from adapter synthesis for taking care of semantical constraints and develop them into two directions. First, we show that the approach taken for adapter synthesis can be applied to synthesis of services in general. Second, we argue that the taken approach is in a certain sense complete.	care-of address;entity;obedience (human behavior)	Karsten Wolf	2008			carboxylic acid;organic chemistry;slurry;coal;sulfur;chemistry	PL	-33.7160832538321	-18.885342110913	136537

In response to this, a workshop was held as part of SIGIR'98 on Hypertext Information Retrieval for the Web and this document presents a brief summary of the papers presented at that workshop, along with a set of themes identified as a result of group discussion and some conclusions on where to go next.	hypertext;information retrieval;world wide web	Eric W.

While it is desirable to enable visual explorations of large-scale raster geospatial data in a Web environment, improving the end-to-end performance between query backend and the client applications remains a challenging technical issue. Techniques for providing tiled map services that are adopted by major commercial Internet maps APIs have been successful in handling static geospatial data. Motivated by the practical needs of supporting query-based visual explorations in a Web environment, we have proposed a dynamic tiled map services approach that integrates and extends existing Web-based standards and best practices in serving tiled images for static raster geospatial data. The approach includes quadtree-based indexing and query processing at the server side and a middleware to efficiently convert quadrants of dynamic query results into tiled images. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Experimental results have showed that the prototype system achieves an end-to-end performance in the order of sub-second for 1024*1024 pixels display area consisting of multiple tiles.	best practice;database;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;geographic information system;middleware;pixel;prototype;quadtree;raster graphics;server (computing);server-side;tiled web map	Jianting Zhang;Simin You	2010		10.1145/1823854.1823877	query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;computer science;data mining;database;web search query;world wide web;web coverage service	Visualization	-39.56124869182733	-21.39745102206902	137675

The fuzzy linguistic modelling allows us to represent and manage the subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision that is intrinsic and characteristic of the processes of information searching, and, in such a way, the developed systems allow users the access to quality information in a flexible and user-adapted way.	e-commerce;fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy set;gloria gordon bolotsky;granada;information sciences institute;information access;information processing;information retrieval;library and information science;logical connective;programming paradigm;rss;recommender system;scientific literature;vagueness;web of science	Enrique Herrera-Viedma;Antonio Gabriel López-Herrera	2010	Int.

This demonstration paper describes the wordnet browser “Andre ord” which has been developed for the Danish wordnet, DanNet. The first version was released in autumn 2009, followed by the release of a refined version in late 2010. The browser applies the open source framework Ruby on Rails and the graphing toolkit Protovis, and is itself open source. In the paper we discuss what design compromises might be needed when accommodating professionals and non-specialists alike, although our main concern is giving the general public an intuitive impression of the resource. To this aim we adopt the familiar, dictionary-like word-in-synset as the basic unit of the browser idea, but at the same time try to convey the idea that every piece of information in the wordnet is located somewhere in a larger semantic network structure.	dictionary;glow;lexicography;object-relational database;open-source software;ruby on rails;security through obscurity;semantic network;synonym ring;wordnet	Anders Johannsen;Bolette S.

84ce11b3ac9e9320bbae75dbb7a39bb01d0330a3	democratization of computational chemistry and chem(o)informatics		It was the mid 1980s that saw the dawn of real growth in computational chemist. There was the convergence in theory, computational power and growth in funding, both pharmaceutical and government, that paved the way for fast improvements in methods, descriptors, expert software and employment opportunities. Over the next decade most pharmaceutical and biotech companies established computational chemistry group and the industry stated to better understand the role of these groups in the overall drug discovery process. Computational chemistry was paired with crystallography and other analytical methods which allowed the experts to predict and rationalize results. This could well be the golden years for computational chemistry. However, like most technologies, the methods reach a point where they matured with slow improvements. Most of the improvements came in software ease of use or computational efficiencies. In the mid 1990s there was real growth in chem(o)informatics[1] due to an explosion in data brought about by combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening. Many computational chemists expanded their skill into handling and modeling large datasets. These models proved useful in guiding projects along the lines of team based or global models. The ability to aggregate and model data was followed by various ways to deploy the models to the desktop of the non-experts. This practice of deploying individual models to the desktop was followed by workflow tools that made automating the practice much more efficient. Now it is routine to build 100 or 1000 s of models [2] and make these models available to the enterprise via any number of ways; i.e. web apps, Excel, and SharePoint. So, over the years discussed above software has progressive become easier to use which in turn broadened the reach and impact of the science, but where does this go from here? If you see the funding sources of both pharmaceutical companies and government agencies decreasing the way I do, then you will understand there must be a new approach to sustain this craft. The approach hinges’ on the concept that was sought for years, the ability to mix and match the best of breed methods on a single platform. There will be many app store(s) for computational methods in the near future that provides a new market place of methods and models. This market place will fill the gap in funding cause by the economic downturn by providing a way to sell information, methods, workflows and models. However, this market place will not only be to sell methods and services to experts, but rather the democratization of computational science to the non-expert experimentalist. The expert consulting approach of computational chemistry will give way to a broad adaption of more routine calculations guided by rigorous processes [2] and delivered via cloud based platforms. There are several starts to this already. In addition to these more academic approaches, there are also the commercial offerings. It is after all, commercial platforms, which lead the way in app stores, Apple, Google, etc. This more scientific app store will need to able to integrate both methods and data and then deliver this globally to a new generation of scientist that will participate in open innovation for solving complex problems. This is already underway in neglected diseases programs [3]. Cloud based software already enables these enterprises to manage projects. The next request will be for more public data related to the targets of interest to be added to F. K.

80aa9b6a065cb61d641372679aa927cc4ef43177	societal implications of big data		Modern societies have developed a variety of technologies and techniques to identify, measure and influence people and objects. Smart devices such as smartphones and wearables assist and track their users in every aspect of life. Large amounts of data are collected, evaluated and interconnected to analyse the behaviour of individuals, social groups and collectives. By discussing recent practices of self-tracking as well of real-time control of complex systems, we will show that real-time analysis and feedback loops increasingly foster a society of (self-)control. Data scientists and social scientists should work together to develop the concepts of regulation, which are needed to cope with the challenges and risks of big data.	big data;complex systems;data science;feedback;foremost;knowledge representation and reasoning;observable;real-time clock;real-time locating system;smart device;smart meter;smartphone;sociotechnical system;wearable computer	Karolin Kappler;Jan-Felix Schrape;Lena Ulbricht;Johannes Weyer	2017	KI - Künstliche Intelligenz	10.1007/s13218-017-0520-x	complex system;simulation;management science;wearable computer;computer science;big data;social group	HCI	-35.35201732650153	-16.998244965222856	138535

This does not make recruitment processes easier, especially when seeking candidates and skills. Most systems matching job offers to profiles build on one or more language resources. Developing and maintaining specific resources in each field is difficult. From millions of user profiles gathered on multiple social networks and tens of thousands of job offers collected on the internet, we describe an approach to generating a semi-automatic ontology. A manual evaluation of the results has shown excellent results.

It is a Java application which integrates a video replay window with vcr-type controls and metadata input forms generated from an hierarchical RDF schema. The schema definition is also used to validate the descriptions input by the user and control the format of the output. The generated metadata descriptions can be saved as RDF, HTML or to a database. They can be used to enable metadata interchange, searching across the Internet or dynamic generation of detailed visual summaries for video browsing. This prototype system has been developed for the State Library of Queensland's (SLQ) Audiovisual unit to enable quick, easy, cost-effective generation of standardized metadata which can be used to create online detailed visual summaries of the latest video acquisitions.	browsing;dublin core;html;internet;java;prototype;rdf schema;resource description framework;videocassette recorder;net	Jane Hunter;Jan Newmarch	1999		10.1007/3-540-48155-9_7	search engine indexing;digital library;the internet;cost-effectiveness analysis;video;library;computer science;rdf;database;multimedia;metadata;world wide web;information retrieval;metadata repository	HCI	-42.886055753147495	-21.437947167759805	138756

A widespread network of human-centric smartphone devices and PCs has been used as a valuable source of data collected and processed in order to trigger adequate actions upon problem resolving. In this way, humans acting as sensor operators and data sources become a powerful factor in improving their society. The Be Responsible platform enables the people to report the irregularities in various aspects of their social life (grey economy, misuse of government vehicles, ecology, traffic), and hence to take active part in resolving them. It also promotes positive and responsible social and institutional behavior, which has to be nurtured in any society seeking progress. The number of submitted reports as well as the money collected from the fine revenues and subsequently invested in projects of social good, undoubtedly prove that what could not be achieved through years of traditional government-led policy approach, was achieved in months of citizen engagement.

This study intends to report how Municipal Archives of mainland Portugal are ensuring access to their digitized cultural heritage content. For this purpose, an analysis was held to collect data about online catalogues with digital objects linked to the archival description in 278 Municipal Archives of mainland Portugal. The data revealed that the openness of the primary information sources preserved by the municipal archives, which can be reused by all those who need them and particularly by digital humanists, is still in infancy.	archive;digital humanities;freedom of information laws by country;openness	Cristiana Freitas;Maria Manuel Borges;Jorge Revez	2017		10.1145/3144826.3145383	information integration;engineering;digitization;information system;multimedia;digital humanities;cultural heritage;portuguese;digital heritage	HCI	-47.0203912993732	-22.23106451863547	139797

The transitions of service maturity phases pose continuous challenges to service providers in assessing the e-service quality of web-based services used in government. This study is conducted to propose a multi item scale for assessing the e-service quality of government portals involving transactions. Design/methodology/approach – Factors influencing the e-service quality of government portals were identified from an extensive review of research performed by academic scholars and practitioners. A questionnaire was designed based on a review and interviews with users of e-government applications and was used to conduct a survey of fully operational portals. Responses were obtained and quantitative analyses were performed on the data to develop a scale. This scale can help in evaluating citizen perceived quality of e-services. Findings – Seven constructs – i.e. citizen centricity, transaction transparency, technical adequacy, usability, complete information, privacy and security and usefulness of information – were identified from the analyses, which can be used to assess the demand side service quality of government portals. Practical implications – Despite a well-structured, national-level plan on e-government and adequate funding in India, most of the projects under the scheme are far below the expectation level of citizens. Technology-enabled applications have promised easy access to government services with economic gain in certain cases, but they have not ensured citizens’ satisfaction. Improved service quality based on citizens’ need and expectation can reduce the gap between design and reality and act as positive trigger for adoption of e-government. This study can help government portal developers get an insight into users’ needs to improve the design and implementation of online services. The issues are significant and cannot be overlooked in practice. Originality/value – The paper is original and a research study. It provides an understanding of citizens’ perceived quality of e-services and adoption behavior within the framework of the web-based environment of government services.	accessibility;capability maturity model;e-government;e-services;itil;iteration;occam's razor;portals;quality of service;usability;web application;web design;websphere portal	Debjani Bhattacharya;Umesh Gulla;M.

Compared to traditional desktop applications, requirements are different in the mobile world. Due to the massive amount of mobile applications it is important to bring a new idea to the market very quickly and concurrently target a large number of users all over the world. The aspect of localization is crucial if the product should be usable in different countries. The term localization in this context refers to the process of adapting a software to different regions by changing the language, image resources, reading direction or other regional requirements. The proposed solution covers the aspect of string translation, with a focus on devices where the screen area is limited. Translating a software poses a challenge since the text can have several meanings on the one hand and has to match the available screen space on the other hand.  Knowing the context and area where a string appears in the user interface can improve the quality and accuracy of the translation. Besides that it reduces efforts for layout implementation and testing. This paper refers to that feature as navigation context-aware. A Context-Aware Translation Tool (CATT) including this feature is presented. As an input for the tool a user interface description language (UIDL) is used which contributes platform independence to the tool. To increase the applicability of the tool to a number of description languages, a meta-model was created which specifies crucial compatibility requirements. An evaluation of existing languages regarding their compatibility to the proposed model and a discussion of limitations is included.	desktop computer;glossary of computer graphics;interface description language;internationalization and localization;metamodeling;mobile app;requirement;smartphone;software development;user interface	Michael Tschernuth;Michael Lettner;René Mayrhofer	2012		10.1145/2305484.2305514	user interface design;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;world wide web	SE	-40.07024200376058	-15.400600079964699	139910

The proposed method comprises three stages that are based on the continuous Tabu search (CTS) algorithm with different neighbor-search strategies, with each devoting to one task. The method searches for the global optimum thoroughly and efficiently over the space of solutions compared to a single process of CTS. The effectiveness of the proposed SCTS algorithm is evaluated using a set of benchmark multimodal functions whose global and local minima are known. The numerical test results obtained indicate that the proposed method is more efficient than an improved genetic algorithm published previously. The method is also applied to the optimization of fiber grating design for optical communication systems. Compared with two other well-known algorithms, namely, genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), the proposed method performs better in the optimization of the fiber grating design.	benchmark (computing);carpal tunnel syndrome;genetic algorithm;global optimization;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multimodal interaction;numerical analysis;search algorithm;simulated annealing;tabu search	R.

An ultimate goal of CBD is making plug-and-playable software development not only feasible, but also easy. In order to achieve this goal, techniques for clearly specifying functionality of components and for determining the degree to which two components can interoperate are needed. In this paper, we briefly review the ICM (Interoperable Component Model), and enhance the model by adding a formalism and providing a testing framework based on the formal specification. Each component is accompanied with an interface that describes the component's type and behavior. The component interactions are specified in message protocols. With the specification model, we will define the behavior type conformance rules on components.	common object request broker architecture;component-based software engineering;conformance testing;formal language;formal specification;formal system;interaction;interoperability;interoperation;iterated conditional modes;java;modular programming;pattern matching;software design;software development	Il-Hyung Cho;John D.

We call this the fifteen theorem for universal Hermitian lattices. Note that the difference between Conway-Schneeberger’s fifteen theorem and ours is the number 13. In addition, we determine the minimal rank of universal Hermitian lattices for all imaginary quadratic fields.	conway's game of life;eisenstein's criterion;imaginary time;universal turing machine	Byeong Moon Kim;Ji Young Kim;Poo-Sung Park	2010	Math.

The so-called self-dual distributions satisfying these symmetry conditions are completely characterized and their properties explored. It is also shown how to relate some multivariate asymmetric distributions to symmetric ones by a power transformation that is useful to adjust for carrying costs. Particular attention is devoted to the case of asset prices driven by Levy processes. Based on this, semistatic hedging techniques for multiasset barrier options are suggested.		Ilya S.

In this paper, focusing on dual-criticality systems, we explore the best achievable service guarantees for low-critical tasks in different running modes and investigate their trade-offs. Specifically, the Elastic Mixed-Criticality (E-MC) task model is first extended to allow each low-critical task to have a pair of small and large periods, which represent its service guarantees in the low and high running modes, respectively. To improve system schedulability under a mode-switch EDF scheduler, virtual deadlines for high-critical tasks are also incorporated. Then, we develop new demand bound functions (DBFs) following a unified approach and analyze the corresponding schedulability conditions. The service guarantees for low-critical tasks are explored via the adjustment of their paired periods. We show that, compared to the state-of-the-art solution, the proposed schedulability test derived from the refined DBFs can accommodate smaller periods and thus achieve better service guarantees for low-critical tasks. Moreover, there are some interesting trade-offs between the service guarantees and a few guidelines are attained for properly specifying them.	algorithm;criticality matrix;earliest deadline first scheduling;elegant degradation;emoticon;interrupt;maxima and minima;mixed criticality;mixed-signal integrated circuit;modulo operation;pdf/a;scheduling (computing);self-organized criticality	Hang Su;Nan Guan;Dakai Zhu	2014	2014 IEEE 20th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications	10.1109/RTCSA.2014.6910499	embedded system;real-time computing;distributed computing	Embedded	-40.03422841630512	-15.407430432463153	139915

0270c2056eb50b5d4597afa722c50abf21e67a82	latency-tolerant software distributed shared memory		We present Grappa, a modern take on software distributed shared memory (DSM) for in-memory data-intensive applications. Grappa enables users to program a cluster as if it were a single, large, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) machine. Performance scales up even for applications that have poor locality and input-dependent load distribution. Grappa addresses deficiencies of previous DSM systems by exploiting application parallelism, trading off latency for throughput. We evaluate Grappa with an in-memory MapReduce framework (10⇥ faster than Spark [74]); a vertex-centric framework inspired by GraphLab (1.33⇥ faster than native GraphLab [48]); and a relational query execution engine (12.5⇥ faster than Shark [31]).

b466782f6c394e96cf8c70deea5f5bcf91b8296e	nutritionally recommended food for semi- to strict vegetarian diets based on large-scale nutrient composition data		Diet design for vegetarian health is challenging due to the limited food repertoire of vegetarians. This challenge can be partially overcome by quantitative, data-driven approaches that utilise massive nutritional information collected for many different foods. Based on large-scale data of foods’ nutrient compositions, the recent concept of nutritional fitness helps quantify a nutrient balance within each food with regard to satisfying daily nutritional requirements. Nutritional fitness offers prioritisation of recommended foods using the foods’ occurrence in nutritionally adequate food combinations. Here, we systematically identify nutritionally recommendable foods for semi- to strict vegetarian diets through the computation of nutritional fitness. Along with commonly recommendable foods across different diets, our analysis reveals favourable foods specific to each diet, such as immature lima beans for a vegan diet as an amino acid and choline source, and mushrooms for ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets as a vitamin D source. Furthermore, we find that selenium and other essential micronutrients can be subject to deficiency in plant-based diets, and suggest nutritionally-desirable dietary patterns. We extend our analysis to two hypothetical scenarios of highly personalised, plant-based methionine-restricted diets. Our nutrient-profiling approach may provide a useful guide for designing different types of personalised vegetarian diets.	amino acids;angular defect;beans (food);choline;composition;computation (action);diet;food;methionine;mushroom - dietary;nutrition disorders;nutritional requirements;profiling (computer programming);requirement;selenium;vitamin a;vitamin d	Seunghyeon Kim;Michael F.

In this paper, we describe a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that jointly performs intent detection, slot filling, and language modeling. The neural network model keeps updating the intent prediction as word in the transcribed utterance arrives and uses it as contextual features in the joint model. Evaluation of the language model and online SLU model is made on the ATIS benchmarking data set. On language modeling task, our joint model achieves 11.8% relative reduction on perplexity comparing to the independent training language model.

A robust new paradigm for diagnosing such failure is presented in this paper. As compared to previous methods, the major advantage of ours is the ability to tolerate non-ideal conditions, e.g., under the presence of certain core logic faults or for those faults that manifest themselves intermittently. We first formulate the diagnosis problem as a delay insertion process. Then, two algorithms including a greedy algorithm and a so-called best-alignment based algorithm are proposed. Experimental results on a number of real designs are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness	greedy algorithm;programming paradigm	Chao-Wen Tzeng;J.-J.

In this paper, we evaluate performance of the power-saving mechanism based on sleep mode in IEEE 802.16e mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) system, which is based on time scheme to trigger transition from awake mode to sleep mode and a sleep window to next sleep window. After being idle for a period of time, a design time parameter to overcome the flaw of power efficiency drop with the short time sleep, mobile station switch to sleep mode for the first sleep interval defined by initial sleep window, which dynamically tune according to the statistical measurement of traffic load from physical layer . By analyzing the behaviors of a mobile station working in the sleep-mode operation with a Markov chain model and exploring the relationship among traffic, energy consumption and mean delay of power saving mechanism based on cross-layer design, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to adapt the parameters of sleep-mode mechanism to the mobile station traffic and the mean delay requirement. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional power saving mechanisms in both the power consumption and the mean delay.	algorithm;flaw hypothesis methodology;heuristic (computer science);ieee 1471;interoperability;markov chain;microwave;performance per watt;simulation;sleep mode;window function	Jianbin Xue;Zhanting Yuan	2010	JNW	10.4304/jnw.5.3.359-366	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	-40.074160917433744	-15.41781830130548	139923

The antenna was fabricated using 0.54 mm thick flexible photo paper and 0.03 mm copper strips as radiating elements. Design and performance analyses of the antenna were performed using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio software. The antenna performances were investigated based on the reflection coefficient in normal and bent conditions. The total dimensions of the proposed antenna are 40 × 35 × 0.6 mm³. The antenna operates at 2.33⁻2.53 GHz in the normal condition. More than an 8% fractional bandwidth is expressed by the antenna. Computational analysis was performed at different flexible curvatures by bending the antenna. The minimum fractional bandwidth deviation is 5.04% and the maximum is 24.97%. Moreover, it was mounted on a homogeneous phantom muscle and a four-layer human tissue phantom. Up to a 70% radiation efficiency with a 2 dB gain was achieved by the antenna. Finally, the performance of the antenna with a homogeneous phantom muscle was measured and found reliable for wearable telemedicine applications.

The traditional audio attention models are based on mono audio characters, such as energy, energy peak, or pitch. Their performance is limited by neglecting the spatial information. The spatial cues in audio stream provide additional information for attention analysis. And the dynamic updated background sound can help to reduce the environment effect. The preliminary experiment showed that the proposed model is an effective way to analyzing attention events, which is caused by rapid moving sound source, in stereo audio stream.

e4da43d043620989bcf8a6e4728abcb1ed310dfb	fast, energy efficient scan inside flash memory		Today, an SSD (Solid State Drive) is essentially a block device attached to a legacy host interface. As a result, the system I/O bus remains a bottleneck, and the abundant flash memory bandwidth as well as the computing capabilities inside SSD is largely untapped. In this paper, we motivate an efficient in-storage computing approach where (part of) data-intensive processing is moved from the host CPU to inside flash SSDs, close to the data source itself (“in-storage processing”). Especially, we focus on accelerating a key database operation, scan. To realize the idea in a cost-effective manner, we deploy special-purpose computing modules using the System-on-Chip technology. While data from flash memory are transferred, a target database operation is applied to the data stream on the fly without any delay. This reduces the amount of data to transfer to the host drastically, and in turn, ensures all components along the data path in an SSD are utilized in a balanced way. Our experimental results show that instorage processing outperforms conventional CPU based processing by over 13 times for scan operation. It also turns out that in-storage processing can offer sizable energy savings of up to 7×. This drastic performance improvement is mainly attributable to the parallelism inside single flash SSD, while the similar existing hard disk based approaches have not been such successful because of the limited I/O bandwidth provided by conventional hard disk.	central processing unit;data-intensive computing;flash memory;hard disk drive;ibm system i;input/output;mpsoc;memory bandwidth;on the fly;parallel computing;solid-state drive;system on a chip	Sungchan Kim;Hyunok Oh;Chanik Park;Sangyeun Cho;Sang-Won Lee	2011			solid-state drive;device file;database;on the fly;data stream;efficient energy use;flash memory;bottleneck;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing);computer hardware	OS	-40.06050961551675	-15.408921247384727	139927

Existing solutions mainly focus on exploiting the past and current traffic data, collected from various kinds of sensors, such as loop detectors, GPS devices, etc. In real-world road systems, only a small fraction of the road segments are deployed with sensors. For all the other road segments without sensors or historical traffic data, previous methods may no longer work. In this paper, we propose to use location-based social media, which captures a much larger area of the road systems than deployed sensors, to predict the traffic conditions. A simple but effective method called CTP is proposed to incorporate location-based social media semantics into the learning process. CTP also exploits complex dependencies among different regions to improve the prediction performances through collective inference. Empirical studies using traffic data and tweets collected in Los Angeles area demonstrate the effectiveness of CTP.	effective method;global positioning system;performance;sensor;social media;software release life cycle;sparse matrix	Xinyue Liu;Xiangnan Kong;Yanhua Li	2016		10.1145/2983323.2983662	simulation;social media;floating car data;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security	AI	-40.06134247823224	-15.399763596132606	139928

Errors in the attitude can cause a misuse of the limited energy sources of UAVs or accidents. For the estimation of the attitude, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are widely applied; they are, however, susceptible to inertial guidance error. With antenna arrays currently being incorporated to UAVs to improve their communication with ground stations, we can take advantage of such an antenna array structure in order to estimate the attitude. In this paper, we therefore propose an attitude estimation system based on an antenna array which could be used to improve the estimates of IMUs. We deliver iterative expressions to compute the attitude under usage of the estimated phase delays of the impinging signals over the antenna array. By means of simulations, we show the feasibility of our proposed solution for different SNR levels as well as for multipath scenarios.	aerial photography;displacement mapping;inertial navigation system;iterative method;multipath propagation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	João Paulo Carvalho Lustosa da Costa;Stefanie Schwarz;Luiz F. de A.

Map applications based upon Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) are seen as a key application area for mobile users, e.g., to enable travellers and mo- bile assets to be located and tracked, with respect to spatial views, or maps, of des- tinations and routes. However, current GIS map services tend to lack support for personalisation to: enable users to set preferences based on their context and user profiles; to customise searching and selecting content; to markup maps in-situ forming a personalised spatial memory. For example, current services can't store, spatial short-cuts, good parking spaces, etc, which have been discovered in-situ, in the physical world. These GIS map services also tend to lack a provision to enable such tagged personal spaces to be used within shared social spaces, i.e., to share spatial memories. An ongoing spatial-aware framework called USHER (U- commerce Services HEre for Roamers), has been extended, to semantically adapt and personalise maps, and tested. The contributions of this framework are: an on- tology-based representation of dynamic user preferences interlinked to a domain model that is able to detect shifts in user interests; the creation of sharable user markup data governed by an access control matrix; the generation of personalised annotated GIS maps.

The digital librarian acts as guardian of the information superhighway/the universal digital library or the global digital library and acts as a symbiotic human-machine guru. This article also highlights the roles and functions of a DL in information retrieval, content delivery, navigation, and browsing. It envisages the professional education and training for digital librarians in the management of digital information systems. It denotes the DL's interface functions, roles, skills and competencies for the management of digital information systems in the important areas of imaging technologies, optical character recognition, markup languages, cataloguing, metadata, multimedia indexing and database technology, user interface design, programming, and Web technology. This paper finally advocates and targets the task of creating a new job title ± digital librarian ± to take care of digital libraries and to manage the digital information system.	archive;care-of address;data mining;digital data;digital distribution;digital library;imaging technology;information retrieval;information superhighway;information system;librarian;library (computing);markup language;million book project;optical character recognition;user interface design	V.

6a0d697fa495303d489e0d65b37fef175471f819	more than wyshful thinking: austlii's legal inferencing via the world wide web	distributed development;wysh;austlii;knowelgebases;development tool;large scale;decision support system;inferencing;for profit;datalex;world wide web;information system;legal information institutes;possibility distribution;rule based reasoning	The World Wide Web presents new challenges for the development of legal inferencing systems. This project starts by implementing via the web the inferencing component of the previous ‘DataLex’ research, through the wysh interface. This provides one solution to the problem of maintaining state in web interactions, while only requiring standard HTML and CGI facilities. Wysh knowledgebases can interact with other wysh knowledgebases located anywhere on the web, creating opportunities for new forms of ‘cooperative’ knowledgebase development. Automated and customised means of linking knowledgebases and inferencing dialogues to a large dynamic ‘real world’ legal information system (the Australasian Legal Information Institute) are provided, giving one means of overcoming the ‘knowledgebase lag’. The project’s development tools are available to any legal knowledgebase developer via the web.1. New legal services via the web The development of the World Wide Web presents previously unavailable opportunities for research in and development of legal inferencing, with significant unresolved theoretical and technical challenges (see Part 4 of this paper). The existence of large-scale collections of primary and secondary legal materials on the web provides very large scale legal data which is highly interconnected, and is accessible to both distributed developers and distributed users through universal and developing protocols. These factors make possible distributed development of (and user access to) legal inferencing systems as part of decision support systems integrated with independently developing primary and secondary legal materials on which the inferencing content is largely based. Legal inferencing systems can be used to develop and deliver a wide range of innovative legal services over the world-wide-web. These will include services customised to the circumstances of the particular enquirer (or client), such as (i) advice on availability of government benefits, (ii) advice on requirements for licences, (iii) interactive ‘interviews’ to complete legally-oriented application forms; and (iv) interactive generation of customised legal documents. All of these services will depend on complex automated inferences being drawn from large underlying bodies of constantly changing law. krmission to make digital/&d copy of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that the copies are not made or distributed for profit or wmmercial advantage. the copyright notice, the dde of the publication and its data appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of ACM, Inc.

DANA provides a model for a generalized method for implementing digital archives. This federation of databases will link researchers, students, and the general public to distributed databases that include realistic, accurate, three-dimensional (3D), visual representations of artifacts, fossils, and other objects, along with 2D digitized documents (e.g., maps, plan views, excavation profiles, and photographs) and various associated data. DANA will have a strong data mining component which will allow users to find relationships in the data which correspond to facts about the actual artifacts and fossils. The data mining techniques involve a new spatial data mining structure called the Ptree. DANA is being created through development and implementation of cross-platform, open standards that will facilitate interoperability and exchange of information between remote systems. DANA enables dynamic use of digital models, virtual measurement tools, and an array of data supplied by contributing content providers (collaborators) for education and scholarly research.	3d computer graphics;3d modeling;archive;artifact (software development);biological anthropology;data mining;digital library;distributed database;internet;interoperability;map;population;pstree;simulation;virtual world;web page;web standards	Jeffrey T.

Gimpel in the SNOBOL4 programming language[1,2]. SNOBOL4[3] being an interpreter, requires significantly more execution time and memory than a compiler. To overcome this deficiency, Robert B. K. Dewar and Kenneth E. Belcher, at the Illinois Institute of Technology, designed a speedy implementation of SNOBOL4 known as SPITBOL[4]. SPITBOL is a compiler, it requires less time and memory than SNOBOL4. At the time SPITBOL was written, the block datatype was not included. This paper describes an external routine which was developed to add the block datatype to SPITBOL. The availability of blocks in SPITBOL opens many new paths for data structures in the field of non-numeric applications. Three dimensional data structures can be used in many areas of computer science. For example, l) Computer Graphics, displaying three dimensional geographic locations on a two dimensional surface; 2) Artificial Intelligence, scene analysis and mechanical theorem proving; and 3) Business Applications, displaying reports and statements (overprinting to highlight important items).	angular defect;artificial intelligence;automated theorem proving;compiler;computer graphics;computer science;data structure;interpreter (computing);run time (program lifecycle phase);snobol;spitbol	Mark Alan Darholt	1979		10.1145/503506.503510	computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm	PL	-36.850473133397315	-19.988782045887955	143611

The goal of this work is to define a set of document content description tags, or metadata encodings, that can be used to promote disciplined search access to Internet medical documents.   DESIGN The authors based their approach on a proposed metadata standard, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, which has recently been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force. Their model also incorporates the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabulary and MEDLINE-type content descriptions.   RESULTS The model defines a medical core metadata set that can be used to describe the metadata for a wide variety of Internet documents.

57ff47f8c88e01ed3eb3e8a2bc98da5c1ff028f2	a distributed anomaly detection system for in-vehicle network using htm		With the development of 5G and Internet of Vehicles technology, the possibility of remote wireless attack on an in-vehicle network has been proven by security researchers. Anomaly detection technology can effectively alleviate the security threat, as the first line of security defense. Based on this, this paper proposes a distributed anomaly detection system using hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) to enhance the security of a vehicular controller area network bus. The HTM model can predict the flow data in real time, which depends on the state of the previous learning. In addition, we improved the abnormal score mechanism to evaluate the prediction. We manually synthesized field modification and replay attack in data field. Compared with recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov model detection models, the results show that the distributed anomaly detection system based on HTM networks achieves better performance in the area under receiver operating characteristic curve score, precision, and recall.	anomaly detection;artificial neural network;can bus;html;hidden markov model;hierarchical temporal memory;markov chain;precision and recall;receiver operating characteristic;recurrent neural network;replay attack	Chundong Wang;Zhentang Zhao;Liangyi Gong;Likun Zhu;Zheli Liu;Xiaochun Cheng	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2799210	can bus;computer network;replay attack;receiver operating characteristic;anomaly detection;computer science;hidden markov model;intrusion detection system;recurrent neural network;hierarchical temporal memory	Security	-35.59126495437757	-14.080178449360636	145664

1efee7cd56f74552dba4ad134cfd0d6f173351a3	how to encourage the use of public transport? a multiservice approach based on mobile technologies		It is crucial to promote the use of cleaner transport modes, and new technologies are key to achieve this goal. Most mobile-based solutions are focused on services related with the journey itself (mobile ticketing, real-time traffic information and trip planners). Adopting a holistic point of view, and considering every trip has a purpose (work, school, shopping and entertainment), a new service approach is considered. This paper presents a multiservice approach that links city services and public transport to encourage the use of sustainable transport modes. This multiservice approach is based on mobile technologies, which are a unique channel of interaction between service providers and customers. The conceptual model of this approach is materialized in a concrete example. This multiservice approach may represent a step towards a sustainable mobility, while improving the image and efficiency of Public Transport Operators (PTOs), boosting local businesses loyalty and sales and bringing convenience, better service quality and monetary savings to customers.

7a31af652087aa355b7d5caaab98158df304571f	diffusion propagator estimation using radial basis functions		The average diffusion propagator (ADP) obtained from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data encapsulates important structural properties of the underlying tissue. Measures derived from the ADP can be potentially used as markers of tissue integrity in characterizing several mental disorders. Thus, accurate estimation of the ADP is imperative for its use in neuroimaging studies. In this work, we propose a simple method for estimating the ADP by representing the acquired diffusion signal in the entire q-space using radial basis functions (RBF). We demonstrate our technique using two different RBF’s (generalized inverse multiquadric and Gaussian) and derive analytical expressions for the corresponding ADP’s. We also derive expressions for computing the solid angle orientation distribution function (ODF) for each of the RBF’s.

c0f8b616f304b5e62308bc3a375447b5223cd58a	an urban ontology to generate collaborative virtual environments for municipal planning and management		The municipal planning and management tasks are generally performed based on text documents or through digital maps provided by geographic information systems (GIS). However, most municipal GIS follow different data models, leading to interoperability problems when there is a need to combine data from different sources. Furthermore, most of the time these tasks are performed in a collaborative way between the municipal technicians, emerging some difficulties in decision making due to the three-dimensional nature of urban space. Thus, this paper describes a methodology which can integrate multiple sources of real data from diverse municipal GIS, in a unified data model based on the CityGML specification. This model is mapped onto an urban ontology oriented for procedural modeling, which, in turn, produces the threedimensional models of the urban environments. The system developed operates in a client-server approach, where the server is responsible for mapping the urban information to the unified data model and the client represents the procedural modeling technology that generates the urban environment in three-dimensional format, allowing users to interact and amplify the existing urban information.	citygml;client–server model;collaborative virtual environment;data model;geographic information system;interoperability;map;procedural modeling;server (computing)	Tiago Martins;Pedro Brandão Silva;António Coelho;António Augusto de Sousa	2012			knowledge management	Visualization	-37.728280255373164	-22.645057915320944	147378

Motivation XML is becoming the standard for integrating and exchanging data over the Internet and within intranets, covering the complete spectrum from largely unstructured, ad hoe documents to highly structured, schematic data. For searching information in open environments such as the Web or intranets of large corporations, ranked retrieval is more appropriate: a query result is a rank list of XML elements in descending order of relevance. We have developed a core language, coined XXL for """"flexible X ML search language"""" [1], for ranked retrieval of XML data using regular element path expressions and search conditions over element contents. For similarity search we have introduced a new operator """"~"""", which can be used for both element content comparisons and approximate matching of element names. On the XML Shakespeare play collection, for example, we can search for scenes where a woman talks about leadership in the presence of Macbeth by the XXL query:"""	approximation algorithm;intranet;james hoe;ontology (information science);path expression;regular expression;relevance;schematic;similarity search;sorting;web search engine;world wide web;xml namespace	Anja Theobald;Gerhard Weikum	2002		10.1145/564691.564768	template;performance;computer science;dynamic web page;heuristics;personalization;database;consistency;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	DB	-44.306483321954225	-21.306511822302607	147557
c9ceb2c8b110a6198c155fd0de570bd29e545ee7	a wcs-based approach to integrate satellite imagery data in wildfire simulation.	satellite datasets;ogc standards;wildfire simulation;modis sensor	This paper describes the integration of multi-dimensional data from satellite sensors in a Civil Protection application that simulates fire spread. The approach uses standard Web Coverage Services from OGC to fetch and process land cover and recently burned areas, available in the form of satellite imagery data previously captured by the MODIS sensor, to automatically generate renovated fuel maps. The proposed architecture is based on rasdaman, a domain-independent database management system (DBMS) that offers a suite of WCS services on top of the DBMS. In the current work we extended rasdaman with facilities to: (i) insert and retrieve multi-layer coverages from WCS, (ii) support new formats, such as HDF, adequate for satellite imagery and multi-layer files, and (iii) support Coordinate Reference Systems. We also demonstrate that it is feasible to use MODIS datasets to automatically compute valuable and regularly updated fuel maps, used as input of fire spread simulations. The results also show that in spite of using inexpensive general and low resolution (500m) MODIS maps, we obtained quite acceptable results when compared with the static ones, which are tailored and higher resolution (80m).	database;hierarchical data format;image resolution;layer (electronics);sensor;simulation;web coverage service;web service;wildfire modeling;rasdaman	António Esteves;António Pina	2012			rasdaman;data mining;satellite imagery;computer science;architecture;land cover;satellite;spite;fetch	DB	-35.89688979878918	-10.102806524669463	147573

START was developed jointly by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) and the University of Geneva to support frequent workflows relating to mine action. START brings together a series of basic ArcGIS tools in one toolbar and provides new geoprocessing, geometry and database management functions. The toolbar operates as a bridge between non-spatial repositories (e.g. MySQL and Excel) and GIS. It also connects mine action professionals recording data in the field to GIS experts and improves data interoperability between GIS professionals working in different disciplines. Originally created to help humanitarian demining actors optimize GIS workflows and be more efficient in their everyday work, the toolbar might also benefit scientists operating in other fields.

6fc80ec262868ffb3896a458ad5f876f80038aff	detecting fraudulent advertisements on a large e-commerce platform		E-commerce platforms face the challenge of efficiently and accurately detecting fraudulent activity every day. Manually checking every advertisement for fraud does not scale and is financially unviable. By using automated learning algorithms, we can drastically reduce the number of advertisements that need to be checked by humans. In this paper, we present the results of a joint project with a large ecommerce company selling used goods. Using our partner’s advertisement data, we implemented several classification approaches to automatically recognize fraudulent activity. With the help of the proposed fraud detection, customer service agents only need to check about 8% of all advertisements manually for fraud. Simultaneously, we detect more than 93% of all fraudulent advertisements.	algorithm;e-commerce payment system;in-memory database;iteration;logistic regression;machine learning;preprocessor;random forest;sap hana;scalability;sensor;xgboost	Tim Zimmermann;Timo Djürken;Arne Mayer;Michael Janke;Martin Boissier;Christian Schwarz;Rainer Schlosser;Matthias Uflacker	2017			e-commerce;advertising;business	Security	-33.713632356728596	-17.842393810094368	148248

This genre of new media arts is created in a vast number of ways. Currently, digitized collection systems are commonly used by galleries and museums for traditional art [1]. The need for documentation and archiving complex new media artworks is now increasingly crucial for future preservation and representation. This study aims to establish criteria of aesthetic media representation for media archived in an interactive digital space and explores a generic solution for an interactive digital space. Based on the Interactive Art Taxonomy [2], visitors to the digital space can create, interact, and experience the new media art. This taxonomy demonstrates that archiving of the content can take place for documentation and future preservation in the strategic context for the creation. This digital archiving process proposed will be a useful model to be adopted or adapted by universities, museums, and other institutions in terms of archiving media arts practices.	archive;case preservation;documentation;interactive art;new media	Yan-Peng Lim;Kong Cheng Tan;Pei Shin Lim	2016	2016 22nd International Conference on Virtual System & Multimedia (VSMM)	10.1109/VSMM.2016.7863201	media;documentation;computer science;digital media;space exploration;multimedia;interactive media;world wide web;taxonomy;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-47.77978726840894	-23.624343890105006	148669

MOTIVATION Visualizing search histories and supplying the user with interaction methods such as zooming, brushing and linking, annotation and tagging, has attracted increasing attention in scientific literature (Liu, Hong, & Pedersen, 2010), (Pedersen, Gyllstrom, Gu, & Hong, 2010), (Cernea, Truderung, Kerren, & Ebert, 2013), and (Yu & Ingalls, 2011). The overall assumption is that the user’s information seeking process often is divided into separate sessions, and that search histories can help finding the point of discontinuation and ease resuming the interrupted process. The several search sessions that belong together are defined as trails.	brushing and linking;information seeking;interactivity;interrupt;scientific literature;zooming user interface	Wilko van Hoek	2013	CoRR		data mining;computer science;search analytics	HCI	-45.131998957039485	-23.522838248434418	148910

d702b471ae6350ed551f349b437ae3fe1b8d1f7f	reinforcing wildfire predictive services with timely weather information		To improve wildfire responses by making and implementing safe, effective and efficient management decision, predictive services has been created to better preparing and responding to wildfires. Recently, efforts had been made to strengthen the capabilities on collecting and integrating timely weather information for improving the predictive services products. Previously, the weather information source for generating fire danger risk adjective by the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) model were from Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) observation network. Recently, a cost-effective method has been proposed by integrating the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) timely observation into the weather information data source, GIS programs have been developed by feeding the National Fire Danger Rating System through the Weather Information Management System (WIMS) alternative gateway automatically with the ASOS weather stations. As a result, the map accuracy has been improved for the predictive service map products. Adopting the advanced technology from geographic information systems and information technologies, daily updated fire dangers maps for predictive services has been greatly enhanced thus better positioned wildfire managers and firefighters towards wildfires risks.	effective method;geographic information system;information management system (ims);information source;map;wildfire modeling	Ping Yang;Thomas Spencer;Curt Stripling;David Shoemate;Naga Raghuveer Modala	2017	2017 25th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2017.8090922	data mining;remote sensing;geographic information system;computer science;information technology;default gateway;management information systems	Robotics	-35.84849184758228	-10.146612027591384	149068

The traditional concept has been changed by using Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) on UAV maintenance support. The realization of PHM has changed the mode of UAV maintenance. The original maintenance mode base on existing incident (maintenance after fault happened) and time related mode (regular maintenance) will be replaced by the new mode based on the state (according to the state). In this paper, the PHM method used for UAV maintenance has been discussed. And by building a structure of PHM system for UAV system, the maintenance support hardware and software architecture is proposed and analyzed for further application.	aerial photography;complex system;maintenance mode;software architecture;software diagnosis;systems engineering;unmanned aerial vehicle	Xinwei Li;Wenjin Zhang	2011	2011 21st International Conference on Systems Engineering	10.1109/ICSEng.2011.11	remotely operated underwater vehicle;maintenance engineering;structural engineering;mobile robot;embedded system;software architecture;simulation;engineering;data acquisition;prognostics;systems design	Robotics	-37.384652943635736	-11.242340653602625	151742

Although individual datasets can be studied efficiently, many scientists are still largely limited to considering data collected by themselves, their students, or closely affiliated research groups. Increasingly widespread high-speed network connections and the existence of large, coordinated research programs suggest the potential for scientists to access and learn from data from outside their immediate research circle. We are developing a web-based application that facilitates the sharing of scientific data within a research network using the now-common “virtual globe” in combination with advanced visualization methods designed for geographically distributed scientific data. Two major components of the system enable the rapid assessment of geographically distributed scientific data: a database built from information submitted by network members, and a module featuring novel and sophisticated geographic data visualization techniques. By enabling scientists to share results with each other and view their shared data through a common virtual-globe interface, the system provides a new platform for important meta-analyses and the analysis of broad-scale patterns. Here we present the design and capabilities of the SFMN GeoSearch platform for the Sustainable Forest Management Network, a pan-Canadian network of forest researchers who have accumulated data for more than a decade. Through the development and dissemination of this new tool, we hope to help scientists, students, and the general public to understand the depth and breadth of scientific data across potentially large areas.	data visualization;virtual globe;web application	Rodolphe Gonzales;Jeffrey A.

In this paper, we propose an XML-based language to compose synchronized content from web and video content. The notable features of this language are as follows: (1) dynamic unit identification of content that is composed into synchronized content and (2) dynamic retrieval of content through pre-defined retrieval criteria. This dynamic identification and retrieval of composable units are based on the author’s intentions. Content authors can specify the units of their content that are to be integrated into new content by describing the conditions concerning this content and the conditions concerning the surrounding content. Although the proposed language looks like SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language), it differs in its dynamic identification and retrieval capabilities. Indeed, the proposed language works just like the meta-mechanism for conventional SMIL. That is, the script written by the proposed language can generate SMIL data as its output.	digital video;synchronized multimedia integration language;web content;xml	Takayuki Yumoto;Qiang Ma;Kazutoshi Sumiya;Katsumi Tanaka	2003		10.1109/WISE.2003.1254472	the internet;xml;synchronized multimedia integration language;content management;computer science;dynamic web page;database;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;satisfiability	Web+IR	-40.18542032986211	-21.144474509931452	154364

Covering II states in the Upper Midwest, the North Central Region FIA (NCFIA) program has three tasks: (1) core reporting function, which produces the annual and 5-year inventory reports; (2) forest health measurements; and (3) scientific analysis of questions and themes that arise from our data. Annual reports provide updated views of the extent, composition, and change of a state's forests. These reports have a standard format divided into three broad categories of area, volume, and change. These annual reports also provide important early trend alerts and error checking functions. Data stored in the FIA database provide the """"raw material"""" that analysts use to prepare the reports. The virtual analyst program at NCFIA is designed to serve these multiple needs. Incorporating our understanding of important trends and relationships, and """"redflags"""" to be aware of this program seeks to automate the more repetitive functions of producing reports while highlighting any anomalies that may require an analyst's investigation. This paper discusses the underlying program logic and design of the prototype. We work backwards from the Web-based application product (.Net Technology) to information-generating vehicles that connect to the forest inventory database. Finally, we discuss the opportunity to expand this report-writing function into a customized, user-defined data query and analysis function."""	data mining;inventory;prototype;the forest	W.

The goal is to improve the control-engineering education using new technologies, saving equipment and personnel for the institution and time and money for the remote students. The pilot plant was initially developed for the study of fouling detection and adapted in this work for the development of a laboratory, in which students and researchers can, over the Internet, perform experiments without any limitation of time and location. The LabVIEW software was used to implement the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) through a didactic interaction and the developed remote laboratory has been tested to be used in different disciplines.	algorithm;automation;control system;coupling (computer programming);experiment;internet;labview;mimo;pid;risk management;simulation interoperability standards organization;user interface	Danilo Pequeno;José Sérgio da Rocha Neto;Jaidilson Jó da Silva;Angelo Perkusich	2018		10.5220/0006666604730480	computer engineering;multimedia;computer science;remote laboratory	HCI	-35.09471054803651	-21.70205482084213	154643

Ubiquitous usage of such techniques can provide universal access to complex information. The main goal of our work is to provide such universal visual access to information through the proposed Multiplatform Universal Visualization Architecture (MUVA). MUVA is a collection of software modules that allow visualization of the same data across a wide range of platforms, from workstations to mobile phones, while automatically adapting the visualization and delivery modes to the particular platform. In the center of the architecture are the visualization tools, which represent various concepts of visualizing the data, such as 3D tree displays or simple 2D tables. The visualization tools are separated from actual client platforms by platform drivers, which adapt the output and delivery mode to each particular platform. On the input side, MUVA separates the data retrieval from the abstract visualization tools, so that any data source can be easily connected by implementing a thin application interface. In this way, MUVA can be used to provide ubiquitous information visualization for various services spanning a wide range of application domains. Implementation of the proposed architecture is demonstrated in two multiplatform visualization case studies; one for visualization of Grid monitoring data, and the other for weather data based on geographical location.	data retrieval;database;device driver;file spanning;freedom of information laws by country;information visualization;location (geography);mobile phone;workstation	Lea Skorin-Kapov;Hrvoje Komericki;Maja Matijasevic;Igor S.

By examining the ADIL’s mission and architecture, we will highlight some of the challenges arising from the development of a scientific data library. After an overview of the motivation and context surrounding the Library, we will present the two faces of its user interface: one for those looking for data, and one for those wishing to add to the Library’s collection. We will then outline the design of the Library’s back-end system, describing some of the technical choices made during its development. Finally, we will examine the role of the ADIL in the evolving life cycle of scientific data, highlighting two important issues: interoperability and data publishing. Today, the data life cycle is almost entirely electronic; thus, the scientific data library becomes a critical part of the solution to the ‘Data Crisis’ in astronomy: keeping up with the exploding growth of new data.

KeyGraph, which was presented as a document indexing algorithm, is applied here t o a history of files accessed b y the user, in stead of t o a document. This strategy of KGF is supported by analogies between a document and a history of one’s using files: The occurrences of words in a document and of files used in a sequence have common causal structures, and KeyGraph previously indexed documents taking advantage of the causal structure in a document. As an effect, timely files are obtained from the history of a user’s using files, in a similar manner as keywords were obtained from a document, by KeyGraph.	algorithm;causal filter	Y.

Once the task that they are facing is complete and the results of their effort are embedded into the source code this knowledge is very rarely shared with the software development community. As a consequence other software developers when faced with the same or similar problem have to solve it by themselves wasting a significant amount of time and resources every day. This paper proposes a Collaborative Information Recommender (CIR) system which intends to address the problem outlined above and facilitate the exchange of information between software developers. The proposed CIR system not only supports a direct reuse of the code related information found by other developers but also supports the creation and management of very problem focused social and knowledge networks.	committed information rate;embedded system;information exchange;information retrieval;recommender system;software developer;software development	Adam Grzywaczewski;Rahat Iqbal;Anne E.

369925e4d0f43c7c88c6d8c310863ea5e91a9f99	data structuring for launching web services triggered by media content		There are some efforts to inspire the viewers to buy something or visit somewhere when they are viewing such objects or places on the TV programs or web sites. It is required to link some specific services, which can be run on smart‐ phones or tablets, to content on TV or a web site. However, simple combination of content and possible services still requires some operations taken by the viewers such as typing search words in the applications or the pages of the serv‐ ices. Such required actions may decline their motivations to use the services. Therefore, the authors propose the data model that allows to seek matching of an entity within content with various services, and to generate service launch infor‐ mation dynamically changed by combination of an entity and a service. The data model is based on combination of ontology class structure and reasoning. In this paper, effectiveness of the data model is shown by the prototype applications which call various web services to inspire viewers for subsequent actions in accordance with media content.	data model;data structure;entity;ifttt;internet;non-monotonic logic;prototype;smartphone;tablet computer;transmitter;web service	Makoto Urakawa;Hiroshi Fujisawa	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-70682-5_2	rdf;world wide web;ontology;data model;linked data;semantic web rule language;structuring;web service;knowledge base;multimedia;computer science	Web+IR	-41.099672400733084	-22.079944330109743	161533

Such scenarios are unpredictable and require a prompt and coordinated reaction from the authorities. This paper presents an architectural approach for coordination and cooperation based on the Multi-Agent technology. In the following, we will show how agents are able to offer a distributed, context-aware, reactive and autonomous support.

In a wide definition 3D technologies can be classified into virtual and physical. The virtual ones can provide computational models for many types of representation, simulation, optimization and scientific visualization. The physical 3D technologies are responsible to realize virtual models into real objects. When using a layer-by-layer deposition of material to build objects it is known as 3D printing or more technically additive manufacturing. This article presents an overview of the 3D technologies and the new paradigm for open hardware and software as well design exchange as a new digital ecosystem that will strongly impact economy the next decades. It is also discussed three strategic programs and a community for medical imaging based on free software developed at CTI.	3d printing;computational model;digital ecosystem;mathematical optimization;medical imaging;new product development;open-source hardware;physical vapor deposition;programming paradigm;scientific visualization;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jorge Vicente Lopes da Silva	2013		10.1145/2536146.2536187	simulation;3d printing;computer science;database;world wide web;computer-aided technologies	Graphics	-36.92757519104184	-19.206965023616497	162237

65eac5aaf7caf07898e5fbb8885dbb408b569939	ipromotion: a cloud-based platform for virtual reality internet advertising		We present a large-scale platform for distributing Virtual Reality advertisements over the World Wide Web. The platform aims at receiving and transmitting large amounts of data over mobile and desktop devices in Smart City contexts, is based on a modular and distributed architecture to allow for scalability, and incorporates content-based search capabilities for Virtual Reality (VR) scenes to allow for content management. Data is stored on a cloud repository, to allow for a large amount of VR material to be kept and distributed, and follows a service-based approach of independent subsystems for the management, conversion and streaming of information. In order to function over a wide range of used end-devices, from mobile phones to high-end desktop PCs, the system is based on HTML5 technologies, and implements a remote rendering server to alleviate the computational burden on the end device. Furthermore, an extension of the MPEG-7 standard is used for the description and retrieval of 3D scenes from the cloud, and we have further ensured compliance of our system with a number of other structure and communication standards, to ensure extensibility and reusability of the sub-modules. The platform is a research work in progress: we present the subsystems already implemented, plan our next steps and describe our contributions to research.	online advertising;virtual reality	Markos Zampoglou;Athanasios G.

66b8f55c32f395028338c8d224a84d494d41dc98	pc-based image processing systems for laboratory use		Several PC-based image processing systems developed for experimental measurements in our laboretory are described in this paper. They are a motion measurement system, motion picture analysis systems and color image processing systems for robotics. High quality with low cost image digitizing boards become available to use, and a capacity of RAM boards grows rapidly. So, PC-based automatic measuring equip ments with image processing function for individual purpose can be constructed easily. Characteristics and probrems to use commercial image digitizing boards for PC are pointed out. The important factors to use image processing system comfortably are data processing speed and available memory size. High speed color image processing program for PC (CIP-PC) was developed to save execute time and memory size. A CIP-PC contains many fundamental image processing programs coded by an assembler, and each subroutine programs is optimized. It becomes easy to make an automatic measuring system by a personal computer (PC) with image processing functions for experiments in a laboratory, because high quality with low cost image digitizing boards and RAM boards for a PC system are recently available to use. A visual motion measurement system composed by mini-computer is expensive and too large to move comfortable. So, this system is used in a special experiment, in spite of its superior ability. A PC system becomes very compact, and has many interactive functions such as a video display terminal, a console, a mouse system, and many peripheral equipmenta controlled from I/O ports. A progress of computing ability of PC is also remarkable. A standard clock frequency is 10MHz; and maximum main memory size packaged in a PC is more than 1MB by using of a random acces memory (RAM) board. The highest capacity of a commercial RAM board for PC i~ 32Mb. High capacity disks as external data storages are also available. Therefore, an image processing system for laboratory use can be easily constructed by a PC with image digitizing boards and RAM boards. Several PC-based image processing systems developed for experimental measurements in our laboratory are described in this paper. PC: A personal computer of PC9801 series made by NEC are used as a host controller of image processing systems. A PC9801 is the most widely used 16bits PC in Japan. Peripheral equipments and commercial softwares are also the most abundant. The proper operating system (0s) of this PC is N88DISKBASIC. A memory map of this PC is shown in Fig.1111. The OS of MS-DOS is also availble, but the N88DISKBASIC system was mainly used to save memory size, because the system was stored in ROM as shown in Fig.1. A primitive assembler called MONITOR which is included in the N88DISKBASIC was used to develop CIP-PC. The clock frequency used is 10MHz. A CPU of this PC is a V30 which is almost the same as the 8086[2,31. Types of used PCs are E, VM2, VM21 and VX21. A main difference of these types are memory size. It is available to use four slots of interface card. Various kinds of interface card were used as necessary to meet the experimental requirement. They were image digitizing boards, RAM boards, DIO boards, AID converter boards, and GPIB interface cards.	apple ii peripheral cards;assembly language;central processing unit;clock rate;color image;computer data storage;computer monitor;computer terminal;dos;display device;display resolution;experiment;host adapter;ieee-488;image processing;input/output;ms-dos;memory map;memory-mapped i/o;minicomputer;operating system;personal computer;principle of good enough;random-access memory;robotics;subroutine;system of measurement	Yoji Ogawa;Yoshio Tanaka	1988			control theory;peripheral;image processing;computer vision;mathematics;spite;subroutine;computer hardware;artificial intelligence;color image;memory map;clock rate	Graphics	-34.440645793266796	-23.09950781314145	164128

Yet we are still inundated with spam emails everyday. This is not because the filters are not powerful enough, but because the filtering systems are not flexible enough to adapt the new development of spam techniques, such as HTML tagging, image based spam, and keyword obfuscating etc. In this paper, we propose to use dynamic multiple normalizers as the preprocessors for spam filters. The normalizers convert an email to its plain text format, called normalization. With the help of the normalizers, spam filters only need to deal with plain text format, which is what the filters are good at. The flexibility of the proposed architecture does not only make the adoption to the new creations of spammers easier but also makes the integration to the other spam fighting technologies easier.	database normalization;email filtering;extensibility;html;software architecture;spamming	Wanli Ma;Dat Tran;Dharmendra Sharma	2007			email filtering;world wide web;computer science;internet privacy;architecture;spambot;forum spam;spam and open relay blocking system;bag-of-words model;spamming;ranging	Web+IR	-35.34469212915818	-19.730855066137533	164263

Some have begun creating archives of web content for social science and humanities research. However, there is a growing gulf between policies shared between global and national institutions creating web archives and the practices of researchers making use of the archives. Each set of stakeholders finds the others’ web archiving contributions less applicable to their own field. Institutions find the contributions of researchers to be too narrow to meet the needs of the institution’s audience, and researchers find the contributions of institutions to be too broad to meet the needs of their research methods. Resources are extended to advance both institutional and researcher tools, but the gulf between the two is persistent. Institutions generally produce web archives that are broad in scope but with limited access and enrichment tools. The design of common access interfaces, such as the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, limit access points to archives to only URL and date. This narrow access limits the ways in which web archives can be valuable for exploring research questions in the humanities and social sciences. Individual scholars, in catering to their own disciplinary and methodological needs, produce web archives that are narrow in scope, and whose access and enrichment tools are personalized to work within the boundaries of the project for which the web archive was built. There is no way to explore a subset of an archive by topic, event, or idea. The current search paradigm in web archiving access tools is built primarily on retrieval, not discovery. We suggest that there is a need for extensible tools to enhance access to and enrichment of web archives to make them more readily reusable and so, more valuable for both institutions and researchers, and that annotation activities can serve as one potential guide for development of such tools to bridge the divide.	archive;gene ontology term enrichment;gulf of execution;information source;persistence (computer science);personalization;programming paradigm;semantic web;wayback machine;web archiving;web content;wireless access point;world wide web	Paul H.

A key issue for enabling audiovisual search is extracting indexable knowledge from opaque media. Such a process is heavily constrained by scalability and performance issues and must be able to flexibly incorporate specialized components for educing selected features from media elements. This paper shows how the use of a model-driven approach can help designers specify multimedia indexing processes, verify properties of interest in such processes, and generate the code that orchestrates the components, so as to enable rapid prototyping of content analysis processes in presence of evolving requirements.	business process;code generation (compiler);cost per action;information needs;model-driven architecture;model-driven engineering;model-driven integration;rapid prototyping;requirement;scalability;search engine indexing;search-based application;web application;world wide web	Piero Fraternali;Marco Brambilla;Alessandro Bozzon	2009	2009 Seventh International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing	10.1109/CBMI.2009.51	information needs;search engine indexing;content analysis;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	SE	-39.853302924469425	-20.958518353289524	166671

This need requires systems that can address complex models in real-time. The economics of creating and maintaining these systems must also be considered part of the problem. Often the domain experts (those that understand the problem) are different individuals than the programmers and engineers that are tasked with solving the problems. This requires significant dialog and trial-and-error to match the solution to the problem. There would be significant value in a solution that allowed the domain expert to create and test the executable models without passing the problem from person to person. There would also be significant value in a solution that simplifies the entire design. This paper suggests the use of KEEL (Knowledge Enhanced Electronic Logic) Technology as a key component in addressing these complex data fusion problems. KEEL is a new """" technology """" ; it is not just a new """" tool """". It is a fundamentally new way to process information. In one implementation it processes information on a digital computer as if it was executing on an analog computer. In this computer-based implementation the very small memory footprint may be a key advantage 1.

99f0e1b6925048dfc51bd6ad73b6adbd0ae270c1	people as sensors and collective sensing-contextual observations complementing geo-sensor network measurements		Ubiquitous sensor networks and Location-based Services can potentially assist in taking decisions in near real time in a variety of application areas such as public safety, traffic management, environmental monitoring or in public health. Yet, analysing our surroundings in real time is still a major challenge due to sparsely available data sources for real-time monitoring. The innovative concept of People as Sensors defines a measurement model, in which measurements are not only taken by calibrated hardware sensors, but in which also humans can contribute their individual ‘measurements’ such as their subjective sensations, current perceptions or personal observations. This chapter contains a disambiguation between the terms People as Sensors (people contributing subjective observations), Collective Sensing (analysing aggregated anonymised data coming from collective networks) and Citizen Science (exploiting and elevating expertise of citizens and their personal, local experiences). Then, the particular significance of integrating the People as Sensors concept with established LBS, data analysis and visualisation systems is elaborated. Finally, the paper discusses current challenges, points out possible solutions, and pin-points directions for future research areas.	apache forrest;citizen science;complement (complexity);experience;holism;humans;information extraction;location-based service;privacy;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor web;smartphone;word-sense disambiguation	Bernd Resch	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-34203-5_22	telecommunications;socioeconomics;sociology;social psychology	Mobile	-35.34908845574938	-17.096893441372618	167513

Most email-based customer care management systems provide a method to include template texts in order to reduce the handling time for a customer’s email. The text in a template is suitably modified into a response by a customer care agent. In this paper, we present two techniques to improve the effectiveness of a template by providing tools for the template authors. First, we present a tool to track and visualize the edits made by agents to a template which serves as a vital feedback to the template authors. Second, we present a novel method that automatically extracts potential templates from responses authored by agents. These methods are investigated in the context of an email customer care analysis tool that handles over a million emails a year.	email;graphical user interface	Srinivas Bangalore;David K Smith	2008			computer science;data mining;management system;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-35.26109464026553	-23.811442850962724	169153

Our application's camera and meta-data tagging functions facilitate easy data collection. Customizable groups are another unique feature of this system.  This paper introduces our initial design process, and some on-going field projects using KOKOPIN. KOKOPIN's development was motivated by the Dandelion Survey in West Japan, a participatory biodiversity research project. The system consists of an iPhone App and backend servers. The platform was designed to accept a variety of data types optimized by a project administrator. As examples of usage, biodiversity data from the Campus Flora Project and the Wooden Assets Management of the Kyushu University Museum were reported.  The application was designed as a versatile platform, and recently it started to be accepted not only for biogeography research but also for non-biological services.	field research;mobile operating system	Misako Mishima;Takashi Matsumoto;Shigeru Takano;Osamu Matsuda	2013		10.1145/2509896.2509901	simulation;geography;cartography	Mobile	-38.47239909270722	-22.78173096299785	169305

These efforts have been enriched through a formal approach, e.g., the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) framework, which is discussed in two earlier volumes in this series. This volume should help advance work not only in DLs, but also in the WWW and other information systems. Drawing upon four (Kozievitch, Murthy, Park, Yang) completed and three (Elsherbiny, Farag, Srinivasan) in-process dissertations, as well as the efforts of collaborating researchers and scores of related publications, presentations, tutorials, and reports, this book should advance the DL field with regard to at least six key technologies. By integrating surveys of the state-of-the-art, new research, connections with formalization, case studies, and exercises/projects, this book can serve as a computing or information science textbook. It can support studies in cyber-security, document management, hypertext/hypermedia, IR, knowledge management, LIS, multimedia, and machine learning. Chapter 1, with a case study on fingerprint collections, focuses on complex (composite, compound) objects, connecting DL and related work on buckets, DCC, and OAI-ORE. Chapter 2, discussing annotations, as in hypertext/hypermedia, emphasizes parts of documents, including images as well as text, managing superimposed information. The SuperIDR system, and prototype efforts with Flickr, should motivate further development and standardization related to annotation, which would benefit all DL and WWW users. Chapter 3, on ontologies, explains how they help with browsing, query expansion, focused crawling, and classification. This chapter connects DLs with the Semantic Web, and uses CTRnet as an example. Chapter 4, on (hierarchical) classification, leverages LIS theory, as well as machine learning, and is important for DLs as well as the WWW. Chapter 5, on extraction from text, covers document segmentation, as well as how to construct a database from heterogeneous collections of references (from ETDs); i.e., converting strings to canonical forms. Chapter 6 surveys the security approaches used in information systems, and explains how those approaches can apply to digital libraries which are not fully open. Given this rich content, those interested in DLs will be able to find solutions to key problems, using the right technologies and methods. We hope this book will help show how formal approaches can enhance the development of suitable technologies and how they can be better integrated with DLs and other information systems.	categorization;digital library;ontology (information science)	Edward A.

In a second step broader and narrower Main Headings are added to the query vector by the system. For this calculation an adapted version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for directed, azyclic graphs is used. The tool is part of the GIN Search Modul, which will ease gathering health information from different heterogenous internet datasources.	controlled vocabulary;disease management;floyd–warshall algorithm;graph - visual representation;health information exchange;health information systems;information system;nci thesaurus;patients;question (inquiry)	Georg Göbel;Stefan Andreatta;Joachim Masser;Karl Peter Pfeiffer	2001	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/S1386-5056(01)00217-9	health informatics;controlled vocabulary;the internet;relational database;computer science;artificial intelligence;methodology;data mining;operations research;information system	HCI	-34.61831281237516	-14.680007629992536	170049

56d20bee4536d15fd8ec42c986c31e46beaf86a1	enhancing tagging systems with a flexible, faceted organization structure		To keep pace with the increasing amount of digital information being produced and utilized by people in their everyday lives, tools are needed that allow to manage and access information resources efficiently. Traditional organization structures such as folder trees are often not flexible enough to accommodate the great diversity of information resources. In recent years, social tagging became popular as a means to collaboratively categorize masses of resources with regard to various different aspects. However, due to the uncontrolled nature of tags, the resulting organization structures, so-called folksonomies are rather suited for aimlessly browsing a collection of items than for accessing information resources in a systematic way. The objective of this thesis is to examine how the utility of tagging systems for the systematic and reliable access to information can be improved when being applied on a comparably small scale, i.e., when being used by an individual or a closed group of users to organize collections of a manageable size. Starting with an analysis of the particular properties of small-scale tagging systems, the thesis describes the development of a flexible organization structure that allows to define two kinds of relations between tags: between general and more specific tags, subsumption relations can be established, and tags can be grouped to facets. A facet covers one particular aspect of categorization in a specific subset of a resource collection. These basic constructs can be flexibly combined to create complex organization structures. A prototype system was developed that includes an integrated user interface for accessing information resources and for managing the tag-based organization structure. To assess the usability of the interface and the utility of the approach in general, interviews and user studies were conducted. Finally, performance measures for search and exploration tasks were quantitatively compared with those of normal tagging systems in an experiment.	categorization;digital data;faceted classification;folksonomy;freedom of information laws by country;prototype;subsumption architecture;tag (metadata);uncontrolled format string;usability testing;user interface	Alexander Sebastian Steinhoff	2013			organizational structure;data mining;engineering	HCI	-43.791253457718675	-19.477052846873498	170390

4720b1f62228c9a9c67017a4b502f20706d0cdc6	information theoretic approach to social networks		"""We propose an information theoretic model for sociological networks. The model is a microcanonical ensemble of states and particles. The states are the possible pairs of nodes (i.e. people, sites and alike) which exchange information. The particles are the energetic information bits. With analogy to bosons gas, we define for these networks' model: entropy, volume, pressure and temperature. We show that these definitions are consistent with Carnot efficiency (the second law) and ideal gas law. Therefore, if we have two large networks: hot and cold having temperatures T H and T C and we remove Q energetic bits from the hot network to the cold network we can save W profit bits. The profit will be calculated from W< Q (1-T H /T C), namely, Carnot formula. In addition it is shown that when two of these networks are merged the entropy increases. This explains the tendency of economic and social networks to merge. Introduction The word network, like information, is overly used. For example, in Shannon's theory there are confusions originated from the fact that some conceive stored data as information, while Shannon information theory deals with a file transmission from a sender to a receiver. Similarly, we conceive a network as a static graphical diagram of links connecting nodes while actually a network is characterized by a flow between nodes. For example, the electrical networks are conceived as a static net of electrical cables connected together; transportation networks as a static net of roads and irrigation networks as a static net of pipes, etc. However, the flow of electricity, traffic or water is the essence of the networks. Many scientific papers ware published about various aspects of networks from Erdős [1] to Barabashi [2, 3, 4]. Many techniques were applied in these researches, from graph theory of Erdős and Rényi to load distribution and statistics [5]. These diverse approaches apply to the many aspects of networks. However, here we discuss another kind of networks which we call """" social networks """" which are in fact communication networks. In these networks we overlook the physical wiring between the nodes and focus solely on the flow between them. An example to such nets is the data networks. Most of the people in the world are connected somehow by physical data networks. Eventually, everyone can communicate with almost everybody. However, the flow of the voice signals between the people is varying …"""	diagram;erdős number;graph theory;graphical user interface;information theory;load balancing (computing);scientific literature;shannon (unit);social network;telecommunications network;warez;wiring	Oded Kafri	2014	CoRR		information theory;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;statistics;social network	ML	-33.80326037844878	-18.968050038244918	171418

Our discipline revolves around three simple new concepts – verifiable computational result (VCR), VCR repository and Verifiable Result Identifier (VRI). These are weband cloud-computing oriented concepts, which exploit today’s web infrastructure to achieve standard, simple and automatic reproducibility in computational scientific research. The VCR discipline requires very slight modifications to the way researchers already conduct their computational research and authoring, and to the way publishers manage their content. In return, the discipline marks a significant step towards delivering on the long-anticipated promises of making scientific computation truly reproducible. A researcher practicing this discipline in everyday work produces computational scripts and word processor files that look very much like those they already produce today, but in which a few lines change very subtly and naturally. Those scripts produce a stream of verifiable results, which are the same tables, figures, charts and datasets the researcher traditionally would have produced, but which are watermarked for permanent identification by a VRI, and are automatically and permanently stored in a VCR repository. In a scientific community practicing Verifiable Computational Research, exchange of both ideas and data involves exchanging result identifiers – VRIs – rather than exchanging files. These identifiers are controlled, trusted and automatically generated strings that point to publicly available result as it was originally created by the computational process itself. When a verifiable result is included in a publication, its identifier can be used by any reader with a web browser to locate, browse and, where appropriate, re-execute the computation that produced the result. Journal readers can therefore scrutinize, dispute, understand and eventually trust these computational results, all to an extent impossible through textual explanations that constitute the core of scientific publications to date. In addition, the result identifier can be used by subsequent computations to locate and retrieve both the published result (in graphical or numerical form) and the original datasets used by its generating computation. Colleagues can thus cite and import data into their own computations, just as traditional publications allow them to cite and import ideas. We describe an existing software implementation of the Verifiable Computational Research discipline, and argue that it solves many of the crucial problems commonly facing computer-based and computeraided research in various scientific fields. Our system is secure, naturally adapted to large-scale and cloud computations and to modern massive data analysis, yet places effectively no additional workload on either the researcher or the publisher.	browsing;chart;cloud computing;computation;computational science;formal verification;graphical user interface;identifier;numerical analysis;scientific literature;string (computer science);videocassette recorder;watermark (data file)	Matan Gavish;David L.

However, available information systems offer very limited support for managing these kinds of data in an integrated fashion. Furthermore, such systems do not fully support image content (e.g., photos of landscapes or living organisms) management, a requirement of many BIS end-users. In order to meet their needs, these users—e.g., biologists, environmental experts—often have to alternate between separate biodiversity and image information systems to combine information extracted from them. This hampers the addition of new data sources, as well as cooperation among scientists. The approach provided in this paper to meet these issues is based on taking advantage of advances in digital library innovations to integrate networked collections of heterogeneous data. It focuses on creating the basis for a next-generation BIS, combining new techniques of content-based image retrieval and database query processing mechanisms. This paper shows the use of this component-based architecture to support the creation of two tailored BIS systems dealing with fish specimen identification using search techniques. Experimental results suggest that this new approach improves the effectiveness of the fish identification process, when compared to the traditional key-based method.	biodiversity informatics;biological specimen;component-based software engineering;data structure;database;digital library;experiment;feature vector;freshwater ecosystem;information system;interoperability;library (computing);power dividers and directional couplers;scalability;subject-matter expert;universal instantiation;visual descriptor;web search engine	Ricardo da Silva Torres;Claudia Bauzer Medeiros;Marcos André Gonçalves;Edward A.

The first big change, which took place quite a while ago, is related to the type of information is available and the amount that it is available in, the number of sources and the ease with which it can be obtained. What's more, information is playing an increasingly important role in our lives, as we are moving towards an information society. Information has become an instrument, a tool that can be used to solve many problems. Recent research trends show that these developments will carry on into the future through the agent technology. Software agents are a rapid developing area of research and they are largely used for web search tools. In this paper is presented an agent-based framework for local search tools and it has been applied to the case of VSEARCH a local search tool implemented in Java. In particular, it has shown how agent properties are strictly related to VSEARCH document filtering.	agent architecture;local search (optimization)	Michele Angelaccio;Berta Buttarazzi	2000			the internet;intelligent agent;autonomous agent;data mining;information society;software agent;local search (optimization);engineering;java;agent architecture	AI	-45.47675655030011	-17.466325956246138	172694

A new PIC18-based circuit board was developed by the authors to serve both as an evaluation board and as a robot controller. A series of five laboratories were developed using the new circuit board, named Trogdor, as an evaluation or test board. The initial series of laboratories had microcontroller interfacing and programming learning objectives related to developing student abilities in assembly language programming, higher-level language embedded systems programming, sensor interfacing, analog-to-digital conversion, and motor control. Following the lab series, this same board was plugged into a low-cost commercially available robot, and served as the robot's controller for a project to design a robot that would autonomously solve an unknown maze. Students were provided with a robot that had working sensors of two different types, and were encouraged to independently add new sensors and adapt the kit while developing their own solutions.	analog-to-digital converter;assembly language;electrical engineering;embedded system;microcomputer;microprocessor development board;pic microcontroller;printed circuit board;robot;sensor;system programming	Kathleen A.

Graphs also make explicit the links between the LOs (i.e. the graph semantics). This article proposes a conceptual model for taking advantage of this information. This model is based on an original diffusion process that copes with the problem of lesson graphs where some metadatas are missing. Two applications of the model are described and were implemented over a previously developed lesson authoring tool whose goal is to facilitate the lesson authoring process.	graph (discrete mathematics)	Olivier Motelet;Nelson Baloian;Benjamin Piwowarski;José A.

More and more researchers are turning to their computers for the latest results in their field. Not only is Web retrieval usually faster than a walk to the library, but the information obtained from the Web is generally more current than what appears in printed publications. The increasing proportion of on-line scholarly literature makes it possible to implement functionality desirable to all researchers – the ability to access cited documents immediately from the citing paper. Implementing this direct access is called “reference linking”. While many authors insert explicit hyperlinks into their papers to support reference linking, it is by no means a universal practice. The approach taken by the Digital Library Research Group at Cornell employs value-added surrogates as a generalizable mechanism for providing reference-linking behavior in Web documents. Given the URL of an on-line document, a surrogate object is constructed for that paper, which then processes document’s content to extract reference linking data. The surrogate then exposes the reference linking data through a well-defined API, permitting the construction of reference linking services by external clients. We present two examples of the many possible reference linking applications buildable on this API. We also describe a metric that measures the API’s performance; currently we are (automatically) extracting reference linking information from HTML papers with more than 80% accuracy.	application programming interface;automatic differentiation;batch processing;computation;computer;digital library;html;hyperlink;online and offline;principle of good enough;printing;random access;surrogates;web page;world wide web	Donna Bergmark;Carl Lagoze	2001		10.1007/3-540-44796-2_11	digital library;computer science;value added;linked data;database;hyperlink;world wide web;information extraction;information retrieval	Web+IR	-43.02598091569599	-22.04579492601074	174405

In order to be able to use the resulting distributed digital mathematical archive, researchers have to be equipped with freely available readers which enable them to view digital downloaded articles and follow links to reviews in “Zentralblatt für Mathematik” or “Mathematical Reviews” of the papers they cite. Using then the permanent links between the review articles and their digital full texts on remote servers the mathematicians can also retrieve the digital full text of the cited articles. Such readers can only work if the scientific documents in the digital libraries have been provided with links between them and the review articles. In this article the different steps to solve these technical problems will be discussed. Methods will be presented which allow one to construct a prototype of a distributed searchable, linked mathematical digital archive library.	archive;digital library;library (computing);prototype;springer (tank);zentralblatt math	Gerhard O.

We will present a framework for multimedia monitoring that uses a domain-data transformation model based approach to map domain-events to their equivalent data-events. We will motivate the new approach, present the architecture and highlight the information assimilation aspects. We will also present some open problems and issues arising from the novel way of looking at monitoring."""	computer vision;data assimilation;graph coloring;search problem;sensor	Mohan S.

The developed software, which can be tailored to simulate any dynamic systems in non-real-time, is designed to work in conjunction with a control hardware. In the paper, the specific application of the software to a graduate-level course is presented within the framework of a final term project involving the control of a satellite tracking antenna. The success of the software (along with the methodology) is rigorously evaluated through the information collected in three academic semesters including the course instructor's feedback and the questionnaires filled out by the students.	apache axis;communications protocol;computer animation;control engineering;dynamical system;embedded controller;embedded system;feedback;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;inverted pendulum;matlab;programming paradigm;real-time clock;robot;simulink;system identification	Serdar Usenmez;Ulas Yaman;Melik Dolen;A.

Traditionally, data from science experiments was collected manually by hand and graphs were produced using pen and paper. By the introduction of cheap and powerful microcontrollers, all data logging operations are currently carried out using microcontroller-based data logging devices. This article describes the design of an educational microcontroller-based data logger device, which can be used to collect and save data for both offline and online analysis. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

167ad8c4bab20f559b8b44b444ae3cffad709ef2	a promise for experimental evaluation	cross language evaluation forum;information retrieval;theoretical computer science;computer science all;information access;universiteitsbibliotheek;language resources;information systems evaluation;experimental evaluation;communication technology;network of excellence	Participative Research labOratory for Multimedia and Multilingual Information Systems Evaluation (PROMISE) is a Network of Excellence, starting in conjunction with this first independent CLEF 2010 conference, and designed to support and develop the evaluation of multilingual and multimedia information access systems, largely through the activities taking place in Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) today, and taking it forward in important new ways. PROMISE is coordinated by the University of Padua, and comprises 10 partners: the Swedish Institute for Computer Science, the University of Amsterdam, Sapienza University of Rome, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, the Information Retrieval Facility, the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the Humboldt University of Berlin, the Evaluation and Language Resources Distribution Agency, and the Centre for the Evaluation of Language Communication Technologies. The single most important step forward for multilingual and multimedia information access which PROMISE will work towards is to provide an open evaluation infrastructure in order to support automation and collaboration in the evaluation process. 1 Multilingual and Multimedia Information Access With a population of over 500 million in its 27 states, EU citizens and companies demand information access systems that allow them to interact with the culturally and politically diverse content that surrounds them in multiple media. Currently, about 10 million Europeans work in other member states of the Union, and alongside the Union’s 23 official languages and 3 alphabets, 60 additional regional or group languages are used, as well as approximately one hundred languages brought by immigrants [2]. Most of the Union’s inhabitants know more than a single language, and the stated political aim is for every citizen to be able to use their first language and two additional languages in their professional and everyday tasks. With the advance of broadband access and the evolution of both wired and wireless connectivity, today’s users are not only information consumers, but also information producers : they create their own content, augment existing material through annotations (e.g. adding tags and comments) and links, and mix and mash up different media and applications within a dynamic and collaborative information space. The expectations and habits of users are constantly changing, together with the ways in which they interact with content and services, often creating new and original ways of exploiting them. In this evolving scenario, language and media barriers are no longer necessarily seen as insurmountable obstacles: they are constantly being crossed and mixed to provide content that can be accessed on a global scale within a multicultural and multilingual setting. Users need to be able to co-operate and communicate in a way that crosses language and media boundaries and goes beyond separate search in diverse media and languages, but that exploits the interactions between languages and media. To build the tools of the future that we already see taking shape around us, experimental evaluation has been and will continue to be a key means for supporting and fostering the development of multilingual and multimedia information systems. However this evaluation cannot solely be based on laboratory benchmarking, but needs to involve aspects of usage to validate the basis on which systems are being designed, and needs to involve stakeholders beyond the technology producers: media producers, purveyors, and consumers. Participative Research labOratory for Multimedia and Multilingual Information Systems Evaluation (PROMISE) aims at advancing the experimental evaluation of complex multimedia and multilingual information systems in order to support individuals, commercial entities, and communities who design, develop, employ and improve such complex systems. The overall goal of PROMISE is to deliver a unified and open environment bringing together data, knowledge, tools, methodologies, and development and research communities, as measured by three criteria: 1 http://www.promise-noe.eu/ 1. Increase in the volume of evaluation data; 2. Increase in the rate of the utilization of the data by development and research sites; 3. Decrease in the amount of the effort needed for carrying out evaluation and tests. As a partial consequence of the lowered effort, we expect to find larger uptake and activities in each task. We expect to find a larger community of usage, with more sites participating in various scales of experimental participation. As a third and most important long-term effect we confidently expect to see new and sustainable results emerge from the evaluation process, being deployed fruitfully in research and engineering efforts across the world. 2 Open Evaluation Infrastructure Evaluation, while often done using high-end computational tools, has mostly been a manual process. This has been a bottleneck for scaling up in volume, but most of all in porting and sharing methodologies and tools. PROMISE aims to help, by providing an infrastructure for the effective automation of evaluation. PROMISE will develop and provide an open evaluation infrastructure for carrying out experimentation: it will support all the various steps involved in an evaluation activity; it will be used by the participants in the evaluation activities and by the targeted researcher and developer communities; it will collect experimental collections, experimental data, and their analyses in order to progressively create a knowledge-base that can be used to compare and assess new systems and techniques. This work will be partially based on previous efforts such as the Distributed Information Retrieval Evaluation Campaign Tool (DIRECT) system [1]. The proposed open evaluation infrastructure will make topic creation, creation of pools and relevance assessment more efficient and effective. PROMISE expects noticeable scale increases in each of these aspects. Moreover, it will provide the means to support increased collaboration among all the involved stakeholders, e.g. by allowing them to annotate and enrich the managed contents, as well as to apply information visualization techniques [4] for improving the representation and communication of the experimental results. 3 Use Cases as a Bridge between Benchmarking and Validation Benchmarking, mostly using test collections such as those provided by CLEF, has been a key instrument in the development of information access systems. Benchmarking provides a systematic view of differences between systems, but only if the basic premises of usage can be held constant. Moving from the taskand topic-based usage for which past information systems have been developed to multilingual and multimedia systems for a diverse user population, these premises are being contested. To better serve the development of future systems, future evaluation efforts need to be explicit about what aspects of usage the systems are expected to provide for, and evaluation needs to be tailored to meet these requirements. To move from abstract benchmarking to more user-sensitive evaluation schemes, PROMISE will, in its requirement analysis phase, formulate a set of use cases based on usage scenarios for multimedia and multilingual information access. This will allow future development and research efforts to identify similarities and differences between their project and any predecessors, and address these through choices not only with respect to technology but also with respect to projected usage. This will mean a more elaborate requirements analysis and some care in formulating target notions, evaluation metrics, and comparison statistics. PROMISE will begin by addressing three initial use cases, and more will be systematically added during the project: Unlocking culture will deal with information access to cultural heritage material held in large-scale digital libraries, based on the The European Library (TEL) Collection: a multilingual collection of about 3 million catalogue records. Search for innovation will deal with patent search and its requirements, based on MAREC (MAtrixware REsearch Collection): a collection of 19 million patent applications and granted patents in 5 languages. Visual clinical decision support will deal with visual information connected with text in the radiology domain, based on the ImageCLEF collection with currently 84 000 medical images. 4 Continuous Experimentation Today, evaluation in organised campaigns is mainly unidirectional and follows annual or less frequent cycles: system owners have to download experimental collections, upload their results, and wait for the performance measurements from the organisers. To overcome this, the open architecture provided by PROMISE will allow for two different modes of operation: 1. The open evaluation infrastructure can be remotely accessed: system owners will be able to operate continuously through standard interfaces, run tests, obtain performance indicators, and compare them to existing knowledge bases and state-of-the-art, without necessarily having to share their own results; 2. In the case of a system implementing a set of standard interfaces, the infrastructure will be able to directly operate the system and run a set of tests to assess its performances, thus speeding up the adoption of standard benchmarking practices. In this way, PROMISE will automate the evaluation process and transform it from periodic to continuous, radically increasing the number of experiments that can be conducted and making large-scale experimental evaluation part of the daily tools used by researchers and developers for designing and implementing their multilingual and multimedia information systems. The open architecture will also enable commercial developers to use the same evaluation methodologies as research projects do, without necessitating public disclosure of results.	block cipher mode of operation;clinical decision support system;complex systems;computation;customer support;digital library;download;entity;expect;experiment;exploit (computer security);image scaling;information retrieval facility;information systems;information access;information system;information visualization;interaction;internet access;library (computing);marec;mash-1;open architecture;performance;radiology;relevance;requirement;requirements analysis;swedish institute of computer science;switzerland;tag (metadata);the european library;upload	Martin Braschler;Khalid Choukri;Nicola Ferro;Allan Hanbury;Jussi Karlgren;Henning Müller;Vivien Petras;Emanuele Pianta;Maarten de Rijke;Giuseppe Santucci	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15998-5_16	information and communications technology;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;database;information retrieval	Web+IR	-45.723274010290275	-17.899912724494815	178123

8b154f154e2fbecdc81ae854a7dfff3f5fd6ddf9	simulation and visualization of plant growth using lindenmayer systems		Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) were introduced by Aristid Lindenmayer to generate the geometrical structures, i.e. plant, leaf, or root structures. During the last decade in L-systems prototype, the plant growth has been animated by composing images from all iterations. The problem is the development of plant model at each time step is nonsmooth and discontinuous. In this paper, we solve this problem by adding some mathematical time functions of logistic growth to each component and combine with an L-system prototype. The stochastic and bracketed L-systems are applied to generate the stochastic structure and branching structure, respectively. Our L-system prototype can generate both plant shoot and root parts. The results of simulation and visualization are presented. These show that the simulation and visualization of the development of the plant growth modeled by using the new proposed method is smoother and more natural. 1 Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing, University of Heidelberg Im Neuenheimer Feld 368, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany Somporn.ChuaiAree@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de Wjaeger@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de Bock@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de 2 Advance Virtual and Intelligent Computing Center (AVIC), Chulalongkorn University Phayathai road, Bangkok 10330, Thailand Suchada.S@chula.ac.th	iteration;l-system;prototype;simulation;x86 virtualization	Somporn Chuai-Aree;Willi Jäger;Hans Georg Bock;Suchada Siripant	2003		10.1007/3-540-27170-8_9	mathematical optimization;visualization;branching (version control);logistic function;shoot;computer science	Robotics	-43.730340852141374	-9.943004556779414	180571

More specifically, we introduce a number of extensions for the Media Annotations ontology in order to close the gap with Media Fragment URIs. Further, a fully integrated Web application has been developed that shows how both specifications can work together within an HTML5 environment. This application relies on NinSuna, our media delivery platform targeted at multichannel publication that provides server-side support for both Media Fragment URIs and Media Annotations.	digital media;first-class citizen;first-class function;html5;server (computing);server-side;streaming media;uniform resource identifier;web application;world wide web	Wim Van Lancker;Davy Van Deursen;Erik Mannens;Rik Van de Walle	2011	2011 Workshop on Multimedia on the Web	10.1109/MMWeb.2011.9	computer science;database;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-41.01277018484728	-21.759166356668224	181597

12d57108a1c3644f005412117649c578068af4dc	a geospatial tangible user interface to support stakeholder participation in urban planning		The complexity of urban projects today requires new approaches to integrate stakeholders with different professional backgrounds. Traditional tools used in urban planning are designed for experts and offer little opportunity for participation and collaborative design. This paper introduces the concept of Geospatial Tangible User Interfaces (GTUI), and reports on the design and implementation of such a GTUI to support stakeholder participation in collaborative urban planning. The proposed system uses physical objects to interact with large digital maps and geospatial data projected onto a tabletop. It is implemented using a PostGIS database, a web map server, the computer vision framework reacTIVision, a Java based TUIO client, and GeoTools. Based on a series of comments collected during an evaluation workshop with stakeholders in the fields of urban and energy planning, we discuss how maps projected on a table and physical objects can be an new approach to participatory bottom-up urban planning.	bottom-up proteomics;computer vision;geographic information system;human height;interactivity;java;logistics;on the fly;postgis;server (computing);tangible user interface;urban computing;web map service;web processing service;web standards	Valérie Maquil;Luís Moreira de Sousa;Ulrich Leopold;Eric Tobias	2015	2015 1st International Conference on Geographical Information Systems Theory, Applications and Management (GISTAM)		human–computer interaction;geography;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-38.159370029280055	-23.251104845194813	182521

This challenge becomes more acute as libraries grow, both in terms of size and organizational complexity, making the traditional humanities practice of intensive, manual annotation and markup infeasible. In this paper we describe an approach we have taken in adding a music collection to the Cervantes Project. We use metadata and the organization of the various documents in the collection to facilitate automatic integration of new documents—establishing connection from existing resources to new documents as well as from the new documents to existing material.	complexity theory and organizations;digital library;library (computing);markup language	Manas Singh;Richard Furuta;Eduardo Urbina;Neal Audenaert;Jie Deng;Carlos Monroy	2006		10.1007/11863878_14	digital humanities;digital library;computer science;artificial intelligence;musical acoustics;music;database;multimedia;metadata;world wide web	PL	-47.00739894401024	-22.89300757511192	182692

This knowledge comes in the form of mechanically typeset books and journals going back more than a hundred years. Besides these older sources, there are a great many current publications, filled with useful mathematical information, which are difficult if not impossible to obtain in electronic form. What we would like to do is extract character information from these documents, which could then be passed to higher-level parsing routines for further extraction of mathematical content (or any other useful 2-dimensional semantic content). Unfortunately, current commercial OCR (optical character recognition) software packages are quite unable to handle mathematical formulas, since their algorithms at all levels use heuristics developed for other document styles. We are concerned with the development of OCR methods that are able to handle this specialized task of mathematical expression recognition.	algorithm;book;compiler;computation;diagram;heuristic (computer science);lisp;optical character recognition;parsing;printer (computing);signal processing;workstation	Benjamin P.

The Endangered Languages Archive at SOAS is creating a new archive to take advantage of web-based social networking to address these issues. The archive is reconceived as a platform for conducting relationships between information providers (depositors) and information users, using the now-familiar idiom of Facebook. Rather than the archive having to continually broker complex access conditions, depositors and requesters can negotiate directly with each other via the archive to achieve more flexible and creative outcomes.	disk space	David Nathan	2010	IJHAC	10.3366/ijhac.2011.0011	database;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-46.484271619024426	-22.93150415654093	182771

ab32c6e15ef82d455563c73d3fbd74e1d7774f13	special issue on answer set programming	special issue;answer set programming	Since its introduction, answer set programming (ASP) has been widely applied to various knowledgeintensive tasks and combinatorial search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to SAT, which has led to new methods of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. While this has been the most studied relationship, the relationship of ASP to other computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified boolean formulas (QBF), or first-order logic (FOL) is also the subject of active research. The goal of the annual ASPOCP (acronym for ASP and Other Computing Paradigms) workshop is to facilitate the discussion about crossing the boundaries of current ASP techniques, in combination with or inspired by other computing paradigms. In 2010, the third edition of the ASPOCP workshop (ASPOCP’10) was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) in the frame of the 5th Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). The program included one invited talk by Torsten Schaub and nine regular paper presentations. This special issue of AI Communications contains extended and carefully reviewed versions of select contributions to ASPOCP’10. The articles reflect the range of areas the ASPOCP workshop tries to touch; in particular articles contained in this volume address preferential reasoning, domain-specific heuristics, symmetry breaking, as well as grounding issues. The first article “Potassco: The Potsdam answer set solving collection” [5] is the contribution by our invited speaker and his team. It gives a thorough overview of the suite of ASP tools that are developed at the University of Potsdam.

Based on the datasets in computer vision research and existing insect image datasets, we plan to create a sharing data platform for insect image researches and we have created a prototype system. Considering insect image research many sub fields and the database must meet the requirements of these researches, we give a flexible database design to supply various information around images. Furthermore, we adopt a series copyright protection policies to encourage the taxonomists and data providers to sharing their images with professional taxonomy and related information. We will extend services on this platform and collect images with entomology information for insect image researches in the future.	computer vision;database design;prototype;requirement;taxonomy (general)	Jiangning Wang;Liqiang Ji;Lu Wang;Lingwang Gao;Zuorui Shen	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098660	computer vision;computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web;database design	Robotics	-41.38554330573194	-20.46868505937678	186907

A section on related work follows giving an account on efforts on the management of digital annotations that are pertinent and that have been considered. Afterwards the innovative annotation features of the CULTURA portal for digital humanities are described; those features are aimed at improving the interaction of non-specialist users and general public with digital cultural heritage content. The annotation functions consist of two modules: the FAST annotation service as back-end and the CAT Web front-end integrated in the CULTURA portal. The annotation features have been, and are being, tested with different types of users and useful feedback is being collated, with the overall aim of generalising the approach to diverse document collections and not only the area of cultural heritage.	digital humanities;relevance	Maristella Agosti;Owen Conlan;Nicola Ferro;Cormac Hampson;Gary Munnelly	2013		10.1145/2494266.2494288	digital humanities;hypertext;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;collections management	Web+IR	-47.18878593844003	-23.20890000570562	187536

53167044c9c541127b59bc3de71bcf70319af1df	storytelling and digital epigraphy-based narratives in linked open data		Carefully curated digital collections, structured with rich metadata sets and accessible via search engines and APIs, are not enough for users anymore. Multimedia narratives on the web and other digital “wayfindings” help a wider audience access the content of digital collections and also familiarize them with the research products that are published online. Digital humanists, then, face a twofold challenge: how to create scientific-oriented resources that serve the need of both scholars and general users and how to introduce nonspecialists to the digital collections produced by academics. The case of epigraphy is interesting, as there are already several examples of how niche content can be introduced to a wider public using multiple tools. This chapter illustrates the effort made by the Europeana network of Ancient Greek and Latin Epigraphy (EAGLE) in both integrating the largest collections of digitized inscriptions in Europe in a single database and providing users with tools for research, interaction, and fact finding. In particular, we will focus on the web-based storytelling tools that help users build engaging multimedia narrative based on inscriptions and ancient monuments and on a virtual exhibition that showcases some of the most spectacular items in the EAGLE collection.	linked data	Pietro Liuzzo;Francesco Mambrini;Philipp Franck	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-49607-8_20	art;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-47.36335431788096	-23.372843387315296	187900

A decrease in the learning accuracy likely reduces the context prediction quality. We study the impact of context pre-processing on the learning efficiency of context prediction schemes. In particular, influences of the context data abstraction level on the learning accuracy are analysed. This discussion is accompanied by simulations as on sampled as well as synthetic context data. In the simulation an alignment prediction algorithm is applied to low-level GPS data and to high-level location data.	abstraction (software engineering);abstraction layer;algorithm;global positioning system;high- and low-level;institut für dokumentologie und editorik;internet;preprocessor;requirement;self-information;simulation;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Stephan Sigg;Sandra Haseloff;Klaus David	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Digital Information Management	10.1109/ICDIM.2007.4444309	information and communications technology;simulation;computer science;machine learning;data mining;statistics	HCI	-34.750045015758616	-18.043180140346973	188042

c9d9d17a96c8d30d611fb7ff88e3ada3f218ccc0	a new lsi and tm based cross-language information retrieval system providing text summaries	cross language information retrieval	An exploding volume of documents circulating over the internet demand an entirely different information retrieval system from those of traditional systems based on key word search, because key words tagged by the documents' authors are often insufficient to other users due to inherent ambiguity involved and users must often either read the texts or documents retrieved to ensure the documents are in their interest. This paper introduces a new IR system equipped with the document summarization function whereby the summary of the document comes with the retrieved document together with an URL of the documents. The cross-language capability of LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) vector space is fully exploited in indexing summaries of documents in various natural languages whereby a query is used to retrieve the documents dispensing with a translation of the documents nor the queries. The translation memory technology is also applied so that a rough translation could also be given on-line.	automatic summarization;cross-language information retrieval;integrated circuit	Liang Chen;Naoyuki Tokuda	2000			ranking;computer science;database;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-40.06180550158958	-15.432870074618625	189932

They make cyberspace and physical space integrated by their abundant abilities of sensing, communication and computation, forming a cyber-physical integrated network. In order to maximize information diffusion in such a network, a group of objects are selected as the forwarding points. To optimize the selection, a minimum connected dominating set (CDS) strategy is adopted. However, existing approaches focus on minimizing the size of the CDS, neglecting an important factor: the weight of links. In this paper, we propose a distributed maximizing the probability of information diffusion (DMPID) algorithm in the cyber-physical integrated network. Unlike previous approaches that only consider the size of CDS selection, DMPID also considers the information spread probability that depends on the weight of links. To weaken the effects of excessively-weighted links, we also present an optimization strategy that can properly balance the two factors. The results of extensive simulation show that DMPID can nearly double the information diffusion probability, while keeping a reasonable size of selection with low overhead in different distributed networks.	algorithm;algorithm design;computation;connected dominating set;cyberspace;dominator (graph theory);embedded system;embedding;entity name part qualifier - adopted;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);physical object;simulation;smart objects;smartphone;smartwatch;sensor (device)	Hongliang Lu;Shaohe Lv;Xianlong Jiao;Xiaodong Wang;Juan Liu	2015		10.3390/s151128513	text mining;dominating set;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining;nanotechnology;statistics	AI	-40.05422370003811	-15.40834839225818	189933

Theses hosts’ management is becoming more time consuming and less reliabale decreases with the increase in complexity of GIS applications. The resource management of GIS applications is becoming increasingly important in order to deliver to the user the desired Quality of Service. Map systems often serve dynamic web workloads and involve multiple CPU- and I/O-intensive tiers, which makes it challenging to meet the response time targets of map requests while using the resources efficiently. This paper proposes a virtualized web map service system, v-TerraFly, and its autonomic resource management in order to address this challenge. Virtualization facilitates the deployment of web map services and improves their resource utilization through encapsulation and consolidation. Autonomic resource management allows resources to be automatically provisioned to a map service and its internal tiers on demand. Specifically, this paper proposes new techniques to predict the demand of map workloads online and optimize resource allocations considering both response time and data freshness as the QoS target. The proposed v-TerraFly system is prototyped on TerraFly, a production web map service, and evaluated using real TerraFly workloads. The results show that v-TerraFly can accurately predict the workload demands: 18.91% more accurate; and efficiently allocate resources to meet the QoS target: improves the QoS by 26.19% and saves resource usages by 20.83% compared to traditional peak-load-based resource allocation.	autonomic computing;data visualization;encapsulation (networking);gis applications;geographic information system;input/output;quality of service;replay attack;response time (technology);semiconductor consolidation;software deployment;terrafly;web map service	Yun Lu;Ming Zhao;Lixi Wang;Naphtali Rishe	2013	Journal Of Big Data	10.1186/2196-1115-1-4	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web;human resource management system	OS	-40.07726361468403	-15.41095746763568	189934

5f4445756473c5282956f68668afb820981a7049	evolutionary optimization of convolutional neural networks for cancer mirna biomarkers classification		Cancer diagnosis is currently undergoing a paradigm shift with the incorporation of molecular biomarkers as part of routine diagnostic panel. This breakthrough discovery directs researches to examine the role of microRNA in cancer, since its deregulation is often associated with almost all human tumors. Such differences frequently recur in tumor-specific microRNA signatures, which are helpful to diagnose tissue of origin and tumor subtypes. Nonetheless, the resulting classification problem is far from trivial, as there are hundreds of microRNA types, and tumors are non-linearly correlated to the presence of several overexpressions. In this paper, we propose to apply an evolutionary optimized convolutional neural network classifier to this complex task. The presented approach is compared against 21 state-of-the-art classifiers, on a real-world dataset featuring 8,129 patients, for 29 different classes of tumors, using 1,046 different biomarkers. As a result of the comparison, we also present a meta-analysis on the dataset, identifying the classes on which the collective performance of the considered classifiers is less effective, and thus possibly singling out types of tumors for which biomarker tests might be less reliable.	antivirus software;artificial neural network;convolutional neural network;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm	Alejandro Lopez Rincon;Alberto Paolo Tonda;Mohamed Elati;Olivier Schwander;Benjamin Piwowarski;Patrick Gallinari	2018	Appl.

22c15e063d233dd25b178d0e70e6d1ea55a51c1a	cu++: an object oriented framework for computational fluid dynamics applications using graphics processing units	parallel computing;computational fluid dynamics cfd;graphics processing units gpus	The application of graphics processing units (GPU) to solve partial differential equations is gaining popularity with the advent of improved computer hardware. Various lower level interfaces exist that allow the user to access GPU specific functions. One such interface is NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) library. However, porting existing codes to run on the GPU requires the user to write kernels that execute on multiple cores, in the form of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD). In the present work, a higher level framework, termed CU++, has been developed that uses object oriented programming techniques available in C++ such as polymorphism, operator overloading, and template meta programming. Using this approach, CUDA kernels can be generated automatically during compile time. Briefly, CU++ allows a code developer with just C/C++ knowledge to write computer programs that will execute on the GPU without any knowledge of specific programming techniques in CUDA. This approach is tremendously beneficial for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code development because it mitigates the necessity of creating hundreds of GPU kernels for various purposes. In its current form, CU++ provides a framework for parallel array arithmetic, simplified data structures to interface with the GPU, and smart array indexing. An implementation of heterogeneous parallelism, i.e., utilizing multiple GPUs to simultaneously process a partitioned grid system with communication at the interfaces using Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been developed and tested.	cuda;cartesian closed category;central processing unit;code;compatibility of c and c++;compile time;compiler;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer graphics;computer hardware;computer program;data structure;euler;expression templates;graphics processing unit;grid computing;heterogeneous system architecture;interference (communication);message passing interface;metaprogramming;navier–stokes equations;operator overloading;parallel array;parallel computing;peer-to-peer;simd;scalability;solver;unstructured grid	Dominic D.

In this paper, we introduce two infinite classes of quadratic crooked multinomials on fields of order 2. One class of APN functions constructed in [7] is a particular case of the one we construct in Theorem 1. Moreover, we prove that the two classes of crooked functions constructed in this paper are EA inequivalent to power functions and conjecture that CCZ inequivalence between them also holds.	algebraic petri net;nonlinear system;operation cyber condition zebra;quadratic function	Xueying Duan;Qichun Wang	2011	CoRR		combinatorics;power function;computer science;pure mathematics;mathematics	Crypto	-40.0359823444833	-15.426912466898012	189940

This innovative system exploits the advances in handlings a/v content and related metadata, as introduced by MPEG-4 and worked out by MPEG-7, to offer advanced services characterized by the tri-fold ”semantic phrasing of the request (query)”, ”unified handling” and ”personalized response”. The proposed system is targeting the intelligent extraction of semantic information from a/v and text related data taking into account the nature of the queries that users my issue, and the context determined by user profiles. It also provides a personalization process of the response in order to provide end-users with desired information. From a technical point of view, the FAETHON system plays the role of an intermediate access server residing between the end users and multiple heterogeneous audiovisual archives organized according to the new MPEG standards.	archive;emoticon;entity;home page;information system;mpeg-7;moving picture experts group;network access server;personalization;point of view (computer hardware company);prototype;server (computing);triangular function;user profile	Yannis S.

5a74e721f225a737b7d9e42fcc87d831d17954b9	a document-centric approach for developing the tolapc ontology	document-centric;excel workflow;ontology;tawny-owl	"""BACKGROUND There are many challenges associated with ontology building, as the process often touches on many different subject areas; it needs knowledge of the problem domain, an understanding of the ontology formalism, software in use and, sometimes, an understanding of the philosophical background. In practice, it is very rare that an ontology can be completed by a single person, as they are unlikely to combine all of these skills. So people with these skills must collaborate. One solution to this is to use face-to-face meetings, but these can be expensive and time-consuming for teams that are not co-located. Remote collaboration is possible, of course, but one difficulty here is that domain specialists use a wide-variety of different """"formalisms"""" to represent and share their data - by the far most common, however, is the """"office file"""" either in the form of a word-processor document or a spreadsheet. Here we describe the development of an ontology of immunological cell types; this was initially developed by domain specialists using an Excel spreadsheet for collaboration. We have transformed this spreadsheet into an ontology using highly-programmatic and pattern-driven ontology development. Critically, the spreadsheet remains part of the source for the ontology; the domain specialists are free to update it, and changes will percolate to the end ontology.   RESULTS We have developed a new ontology describing immunological cell lines built by instantiating ontology design patterns written programmatically, using values from a spreadsheet catalogue.   CONCLUSIONS This method employs a spreadsheet that was developed by domain experts. The spreadsheet is unconstrained in its usage and can be freely updated resulting in a new ontology. This provides a general methodology for ontology development using data generated by domain specialists."""	cultured cell line;design pattern;ontology (information science);ontology engineering;percolation;problem domain;semantics (computer science);spreadsheet;meeting;teams	Aisha Blfgeh;Jennifer D.

We show in this paper how we applied design principles in the creation of screens and icons as well as actual visualization on the map for a mobile-web based disaster management system reports. Specifically, we exercised abstraction of data processing through the MVC architecture to focus on visualization. We used a partial view to isolate the map configuration. Development of a visualization module using this framework provided not only convenience in development but also made distribution of tasks more efficient.	crowdsourcing;model–view–controller;real-time transcription	Jhoanna T.

Each laboratory contains 16 fixed disc IBM#8482; PC-compatible microcomputers networked with the University's mainframe computer. In order to reduce costs and extend the hours the laboratories are available for student use, they are designed to be left unattended by Computer Laboratory staff. To accomplish this the laboratories have been made secure by storing the microcomputer system units in locked cabinets and cabling the monitors and keyboards to the work surfaces. Slave monitors driven by the instructor's microcomputer are available at each work station for demonstration purposes. A standard set of software including MD-DOS#8482;, two word processors, a spread-sheet, BASIC interpreter, tutorials and a communications package are provided on the fixed discs of each microcomputer by the Computer Laboratory. Instructors can request to have their software stored on the fixed discs. Student work files are stored on the University's mainframe computer and are up-and down-loaded via the cable network.

9dfab61bcaada7d6a38223b18a6ea16bad08f837	a distributed ranking algorithm for the itrust information search and retrieval system		The iTrust system is a decentralized and distributed system for publication, search and retrieval of information over the Internet and the Web, that is designed to make it difficult to censor or filter information. In the distributed ranking algorithm for iTrust presented in this paper, a source node that publishes a document indexes the words in the document and produces a term-frequency table for the document. A requesting node that issues a query and receives a response uses the URL in the response to retrieve the term-frequency table from the source node. The requesting node then uses the term-frequency tables from multiple source nodes and a ranking formula to score the documents with respect to its query. Our evaluations of the distributed ranking algorithm for iTrust demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits stability in ranking documents and that it counters scamming by malicious nodes.	algorithm;cns;censoring (statistics);commodore reu;countermeasure (computer);distributed computing;ibm notes;internet;randomness;relevance;tf–idf;world wide web	Boyang Peng;Louise E.

The tables were edited as needed, then converted into layout independent Wang Notation using the Table Abstraction Tool (TAT). The output generated by TAT consists of XML files to be used for constructing narrow-domain ontologies. On an average each table required 104 seconds for editing. Augmentations like aggregates, footnotes, table titles, captions, units and notes were also extracted in an average time of 93 seconds. Every user intervention was logged and audited. The logged interactions were analyzed to determine the relative influence of factors like table size, number of categories and various types of augmentations on the processing time. The analysis suggests which aspects of interactive table processing can be automated in the near term, and how much time such automation would save. The correlation coefficient between predicted and actual processing time was 0.66.	coefficient;interaction;ontology (information science);world wide web;xml	Raghav K.

New information is constantly being made available for users. However, the information accessible on the Web changes constantly. These changes may occur as modifications to both the content and the location of previously existing Web resources. As these changes occur, the accessibility to past versions of such Web resources is often lost. This paper presents an approach to provide content persistence of Web resources by organizing collections of historical Web resources in a distributed configuration management system to allow online, read-only access to the versioned resources.	accessibility;file system permissions;information access;organizing (structure);persistence (computer science);read-only memory;software configuration management;software versioning;web resource;world wide web	Joachim Feise	2001		10.1145/504216.504267	web service;persistence;web application security;web development;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web-based simulation;web design;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;software versioning;web navigation;data mining;database;configuration management;web intelligence;web engineering;web 2.0;world wide web;web server	Web+IR	-43.54528021370998	-22.20862406067459	195220

We propose that such patterns also offer an effective way to communicate solutions to ubiquitous computing design problems. Some of the ubicomp design patterns include context-sensitive I/O, physical-virtual associations, global data, proxies for devices, follow-me display, appropriate levels of attention, and anticipation. Design patterns range in scale from a city to a room and, together, form a pattern language that designers can adapt to a project's particular level of complexity or detail.	ubiquitous computing	James A.

Soon afterward, he was instrumental in facilitating the full-text harvest of arXiv by large-scale search engines, beginning with Google and followed by Microsoft and Yahoo!—previous robotic crawls of arXiv being overly restricted in the 1990s due to their flooding of the servers with requests. Jim understood the increasing role of text as a form of data, and the need for text to be ingestible and treatable like any other computable object. In 2005, he was involved in both arXiv and PubMed Central and expressed to me his mystification that while the two repositories served similar roles, they seemed to operate in parallel universes, not connecting in any substantive way. His vision was of a world of scholarly resources—text, databases , and any other associated materials—that were seamlessly navigable and interoperable. Many of the key open questions regarding the technological transformation of scholarly infrastructure were raised well over a decade ago, including the long-term financial model for implementing quality control, the architecture of the article of the future, and how all of the pieces will merge into an interoperable whole. While answers have remained elusive, there is reason to expect significant near-term progress on at least the latter two	computable function;computer science;database;financial modeling;google moderator;interoperability;pubmed central;robot;web search engine	Paul Ginsparg	2009			world wide web;database-centric architecture;computer science	ML	-46.29878912785705	-16.751381928976134	197618

The total cost of the kit and the software is under $500, so it makes this combination a very cheap alternative for establishing a control systems laboratory. The platform can be used to demonstrate: 1) parameter identification technique; and 2) cross-coupled control. The experimental result shows that the proposed testbed can be viewed as an efficient tool for the education of control engineering as well as C programming language, robots, and digital signal processing with a minimum burden of time and cost.	control engineering;control system;digital signal processing;lego mindstorms;nxt;programming language;robot;testbed	Hung-Shiang Chuang;Ying-Chun Chuang;Chun-Hsiang Yang	2014	2014 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009649	embedded system;simulation;computer science;dc motor	Robotics	-34.344747589320164	-22.052733210915473	197703

This is contrasted with intelligent imaging and the additional capabilities that have to be built into an imager for it to be ‘intelligent’. A selective information capture scenario is demonstrated using the digital evidence bag (DEB) storage format. A DEB is a universal container for digital evidence from any source that allows the provenance to be recorded and continuity to be maintained throughout the life of the investigation. The paper concludes by defining the ‘ultimate test’ for an intelligent and selective imager approach. a 2006 DFRWS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

f728391cce80d15b8abb50abac84167bdb95bde0	dynamic hypermedia from a museum database: the gold of greece application		Two traditions coexist in the use of information technology in museums. The first tradition, museum information systems, stems from the introduction about twenty five years ago of computers in a small number of large museums for the compilation and off-line use of inventories, indexes and lists. Microcomputer software available off-theshelf is used by a considerable number of European museums, incorporating both documentation and collections management facilities (Dallas, 1990). The second tradition, cultural interactive multimedia, concerns mostly the disseminating function of museums, i.e., the support of exhibition, publication and educational activities. Many important cultural interactive applications have been produced so far using Interactive Videodisc. The combination of microcomputers with digital storage media such as CD-ROM in the late 1980s allowed the easier delivery of applications and the integration of data and application logic within the same medium. Combining an Interactive Videodisc with a CD-ROM, the Perseus Hypercard application allowed students of Classics and archaeology to retrieve a wide range of visual, textual and formatted data concerning Classical Greek culture (Crane, 1992).	business logic;cd-rom;coexist (image);compiler;computer;documentation;hypercard;hypermedia;information system;inventory;microcomputer;online and offline	Costis J.

It proves very useful to help humans perform various tasks, from standard industrial applications to performing tasks that are too difficult or dangerous to do by a person. Nowadays tele-robotic applications as a tool for training and education have also been increasingly popular. The development of a tele-robotic system requires handling the control design as well as the programming, that it gives an excellent practical training to students. In this paper, the development of a control remote laboratory that applies this tele-robotic technology is reported. The system architecture and the control functions within the facility are discussed. The use of minimum hardware for the servers while keeping the functions modular is proposed, and the advantages of this approach in terms of reliability and accessibility are highlighted. Some experimental results are presented, to show the functionalities of this facility to support control engineering and robotics education for engineering students at both introductory and advanced levels.	accessibility;control engineering;control function (econometrics);driving simulator;internet;personal computer;phantom reference;remote control;robot;server (computing);servo;simulation;systems architecture;television	Lasse Wollatz;Radovan Gallo;Dina Shona Laila;Tochukwu C.
